HEADLINE: Regulators Fret Over Rise of Trading in the Shadows

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Wall Street is embracing its dark side.
As the stock market continues to climb, trading has increasingly migrated from established bourses like the New York Stock Exchange to private platforms, including dark pools, that are largely hidden from public view. The shift is helping big traders hide what they are doing in the markets, and regulators are worried that the development could obscure the true prices of stocks and scare away ordinary investors.
The movement, under way for several years, has gathered force recently. The portion of all stock trading taking place away from the public exchanges hit new highs over the last few weeks, amounting to close to 40 percent on several days, up from an average of 16 percent in 2008, according to Rosenblatt Securities.
The trend has bucked the government's broad effort in recent years to move more of the financial industry out of the back rooms and into the light. The increasing opacity of stock trading in the United States, long the most transparent place in the financial world, is troubling for investors and regulators. 
''We've been having a lot of discussions about whether we are reaching a tipping point between lit and unlit markets,'' said Thomas Gira, head of market regulation at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the industry-financed regulator.
In March, Australia introduced new rules to limit trading off-exchange, following the lead of Canada, which put regulations in place last fall. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission has so far declined to act.
The concerns are also evident in the industry itself, where a few dark pools have recently been advertising tools that promise to keep out ''gaming'' and ''toxic'' trading practices going on in other dark pools.
Dark pools, like public exchanges, give investors a place to connect with buyers and sellers of stock, but the pools are subject to less stringent regulations than public exchanges. Often run by big banks, dark pools do not require buyers and sellers to publicly announce their intention to trade stocks, allowing traders and investors to hide behind a veil that only the operator of the pool can penetrate.
That appeals to a pension fund that wants to buy a million shares of Ford stock, for instance, because it allows the fund to avoid tipping off competitors who could push the price of the stock up.
Investors also have said that they have moved more of their trading into the dark because they have grown more distrustful of the big exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq. Those exchanges have been hit by technological mishaps and become dominated by so-called high-frequency traders.
But the biggest factor pushing trading away from the public exchanges is the ongoing decline in volatility in stock prices, traders say. When share prices are rising or falling sharply, investors want to quickly and reliably get their trade done, leading to a preference for the safety of an exchange. In calmer trading, on the other hand, the anonymity of dark pools is more attractive. What's more, dark pools are generally cheaper to use than an exchange.
Other places besides the 30-plus dark pools are stealing the business of stock exchanges. A handful of firms including Citigroup and Knight Capital pay retail brokers like TD Ameritrade and Scottrade for the opportunity to trade with ordinary retail investors before the orders can reach an exchange, a phenomenon known as internalization. This type of off-exchange trading has also been growing, in part because of the recent revival of interest in the stock market among ordinary investors.
In recent weeks, internalization has accounted for about 60 percent of off-exchange trading and dark pools for about 40 percent.
The complicated structure of the stock markets makes it hard to get reliable numbers on the exact amount of trading going on in the different entities. Some operators of dark pools say that the most widely used numbers misrepresent the amount of trading going on in the dark, and ignore the fact that on public exchanges some types of trading happen out of the public eye.
Dan Mathisson, the operator of the nation's largest dark pool, Credit Suisse's CrossFinder, said that American regulators should not introduce new rules just because of the fears surrounding dark pools. Mr. Mathisson also said that dark pools have not had the technology problems that have done real harm to investors.
Trading in the dark is just one of the facets of the turbocharged stock market that lawmakers have been examining. High-frequency trading has often grabbed the public spotlight. But while high-speed traders have been dialing back their activity, trading in the dark has kept rising.
Canada has been among the most aggressive countries in confronting dark trading, introducing rules last fall that allow trades to take place in dark pools only if brokers are getting customers a significantly better price than is available on the public exchange. Within months, dark pool trading in Canada dropped to about a third of what it was before the rule, according to Rosenblatt Securities.
Regulators and long-term investors fear that the movement away from exchanges will diminish part of what has made the American stock market the envy of the world: the public auction process. In off-exchange trading, investors cannot see what trades are available and as a result are not encouraged to offer a better price.
A recent study by researchers in Australia found that the cost of trading went up for all traders when more trading happened in the dark, backing up an earlier study by an economist at Rutgers, Daniel Weaver.
''If long-term investors are being siphoned off and sent away from the exchanges, there will be less competition and prices will get worse,'' said Mr. Weaver.
Because most dark pools and internalizers are operated by banks, Finra, the industry-financed regulator, is also worried that the banks can provide a sneak peek of the trading their customers are doing to their own traders and selected customers. Last September, Finra began gathering information from 15 of the largest dark pools and is now trying to determine whether the banks have improperly shared information about the customers in their dark pools.
''We've seen some problematic activity when we've looked at'' dark pools in trading exams, said Mr. Gira, Finra's head of market regulation.
Among long-term investors, 67 percent said that they have ''trust issues'' with dark pools, according to a survey last year by the Tabb Group.
Kevin Cronin, the top trader at the mutual fund provider Invesco, said that to buy and sell stocks in his firm's mutual funds he has to dedicate an increasing amount of time and money navigating the dark pools. There is too much trading going on there to avoid it, he said.
Last month, Invesco hired a top trader from Mr. Mathisson's company, Credit Suisse, to keep up with the latest technological developments.
But Mr. Cronin said that he worries as he and other traders escalate the amount of business they are doing out of the public eye.
''It's just not an efficient market if a fair amount of orders never see the light of day,'' he said. ''We should all be concerned about this.''

HEADLINE: Discovery Expands Its Reach Overseas

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
Alana Thompson, the 7-year-old beauty queen known as Honey Boo Boo, has had some mishaps in child pageants in the Deep South, where her reality show on Discovery Communications' TLC channel is based. But the chubby and charming contestant and her overbearing parents are big in Brazil.
''Here Comes Honey Boo Boo,'' the reality show on TLC in the United States, has become an unlikely hit in Brazil and dozens of other countries where it is broadcast on some of TLC's 150 international channels. To help explain its particularly American milieu and language, the episodes come with a glossary of common terms: ''concurso de brillo'' in Spanish for ''glitz pageants''; ''gorduchéte'' in Portuguese for ''chubette.''
The series and its popularity overseas are just one aspect of Discovery's growing international business. The company, based in Silver Spring, Md., owns 14 domestic cable channels including Discovery, OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network and Animal Planet, but its executives see growth coming from places like Brazil, Mexico and Russia. 
''We don't see ourselves as a domestic media company,'' said David M. Zaslav, Discovery Communications' president and chief executive, in a phone interview from Moscow, where he was visiting with the company's 32 local employees. (The week before, he had business meetings in Paris, Switzerland and Belgium.)
Discovery's strategy signals how the cable television business in the United States is maturing. With a proliferation of channels competing for a diminished number of total viewers, media companies have looked elsewhere for growth.
Last year, News Corporation paid $335 million to complete its acquisition of the Singapore-based ESPN Star Sports, previously a joint venture with the Walt Disney Company. Viacom has in recent years expanded its footprint in Russia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. In India, the company owns Colors, a Hindi-language general entertainment pay TV channel.
''You have many markets with substantial G.D.P. growth ahead of them and multichannel infrastructure growth,'' Robert M. Bakish, president and chief executive of Viacom International Media Networks, said in an interview last year. ''TV in the U.S. is pretty well saturated.''
Discovery has channels in 217 countries and territories in 45 languages as well as 1.3 billion subscribers outside the United States. In the six years since Mr. Zaslav took over as chief executive in 2007, the company has grown from making around $720 million in total profits, with roughly $120 million coming from overseas, to making $721 million just from its international business, or 34 percent of its total profit of $2.1 billion, in the fiscal year that ended Dec. 31.
In the coming weeks, Discovery is expected to close its biggest deal yet: a $1.7 billion acquisition of SBS Nordic, a Scandinavian programmer that includes 12 television networks, radio stations and digital assets in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.
The SBS deal came around the time Discovery agreed to pay about $240 million for a 20 percent stake in Eurosport, a Pan-European cable sports channel that broadcasts tennis, cycling and cross-country skiing and other sports in 59 countries, and other pay television assets owned by the French media company TF1 Group. The transaction gives Discovery the chance to take majority ownership of Eurosport in two years.
After the SBS acquisition closes, more than 40 percent of Discovery's business will come from abroad, making the company the biggest among its competitors in the international cable television business. On Thursday, Discovery will hold its annual upfront presentation to unveil its business and programming plans to advertisers and reporters.
Thirty-eight percent of Discovery's revenue last year came from its international business, compared with 44 percent for News Corporation, 29 percent for Viacom and 28 percent for Time Warner, according to Wall Street estimates in Discovery's latest investor presentation.
Before joining Discovery, Mr. Zaslav oversaw NBCUniversal's fast-growing cable channels including CNBC, MSNBC and Bravo. He said he noticed early on that emerging markets overseas looked a lot like the nascent United States pay TV business for which he worked in the 1990s.
''We used to joke that if you were in the business in those years, you just grew and grew because you were in the jet stream,'' he said. ''Now we see a very similar type of environment in Mexico, Brazil, Russia and Turkey.''
The Eurosport and SBS deals will give Discovery additional leverage to negotiate distribution and advertising deals for its other cable channels, said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research. ''Discovery has been an early player in staking out a land grab overseas,'' he said. In the United States, Mr. Greenfield added, ''you're fighting for market share in a declining business.''
Of course, Mr. Zaslav has more to work with than some of his competitors. Discovery's documentary series like ''Gold Rush,'' about Alaskan miners, and ''Through the Wormhole,'' a Science Channel series hosted by the actor Morgan Freeman, can be more easily dubbed and exported than sitcoms or expensive scripted dramas that often appeal only to American tastes.
''They don't wake up in Russia and say 'That's a Russian show,' '' Mr. Zaslav said. (He added that Discovery is President Vladimir V. Putin's favorite channel.)
Discovery relies almost entirely on local employees in 43 international offices in 31 countries (including offices in Miami and Silver Spring devoted to international channels) to determine what types of shows work for local audiences and to sell advertisements to be broadcast during those.
To ensure that Discovery's hit series ''Deadliest Catch,'' about Alaskan king crab fishermen, would resonate in Italy, the company recruited a local fisherman to help introduce the series. (He had become well known after he saved a shipmate from an accident at sea.) In Poland, the local star Dominika Ostalowska serves as the host of the Investigation Discovery channel's true crime series ''Behind Mansion Walls,'' a role similar to Susan Lucci's on a different crime series on Investigation Discovery in the United States.
Not all shows work everywhere. To appeal to Indian women, TLC's ''What Not to Wear'' had to be recast with fewer snide put-downs and more positive feedback. Others could seem culturally insensitive. ''We have 'Sister Wives' that you might have to be careful about,'' said Luis Silberwasser, Discovery Networks International's executive vice president and chief content officer, about the reality show featuring a polygamous family.
Some of TLC's most popular reality series, like ''Toddlers and Tiaras,'' about child beauty pageants (from which ''Here Comes Honey Boo Boo'' was spun off), and ''Cake Boss,'' about a baker in New Jersey, are ''very recognizable American content, and it's hit or miss,'' Mr. Zaslav said.
Increasingly, Discovery's well-traveled shows have become only part of the company's international strategy. The Eurosport deal shows the company plans to expand beyond its core lineup of Discovery, TLC, Animal Planet and other cable channels. ''You're limiting yourself if you think 'I can only do fact-based channels,' '' said Mark Hollinger, president and chief executive of Discovery Networks International.
The company typically relies on pay TV since those channels bring in dual revenue streams of advertising and subscriber fees. But lately, Discovery has snapped up free-to-air channels. In Italy, Discovery has Real Time, a free-to-air channel that broadcasts female-centric series like ''Shopping Night.'' Last year, the company introduced a free-to-air channel in Spain called Discovery Max.
Those countries may seem counterintuitive given their high unemployment rates and dismal economies, but Discovery said it was betting long-term that the economic crisis in several euro zone countries would eventually improve. In the meantime, the company can buy channels cheaply.
''We almost view Western Europe as the new emerging markets,'' Mr. Hollinger said. ''If you get in and can have some patience with it, there will be improvement.''

HEADLINE: Straight to the Source

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER and STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
When the founders of a start-up that sells eyeglasses online, Warby Parker, began investigating why designer glasses cost several hundred dollars, they discovered that everyone in the process was taking a cut: designers, manufacturers, brands, wholesalers and retailers.
But what if they left out most of those people? ''I had been to the factories and knew what it costs to manufacture glasses and knew the cost didn't warrant a $700 price tag,'' said Neil Blumenthal, a founder of the company. Inspired by glasses they found in their grandparents' attics, the founders sketched a few frames, hired the same Chinese factories that make designer glasses and started selling directly to consumers online. By doing so, they eliminated enough of the cost to charge customers just $95 a pair.
Warby Parker is part of a wave of e-commerce companies that are trying to build premium brands at discount prices by cutting out middlemen and going straight to manufacturers. They make everything from bedding (Crane and Canopy), to office supplies (Poppin), nail polish (Julep), tech accessories (Monoprice), men's shoes (Beckett Simonon) and shaving supplies (Harry's).
The result is generally cheaper products for consumers and higher profit margins for the companies. 
Big retailers discovered long ago that controlling the supply chain benefited their bottom lines, which is why companies like Wal-Mart and Whole Foods sell many products under their own brands. At Macy's and Kohl's, such ''private label'' brands make up almost half of their sales.
Start-ups have traditionally struggled to match those efforts. They do not have as much brand recognition as big retailers, and persuading consumers to take a chance on, say, Warby Parker eyeglasses instead of Prada's can be difficult.
''The challenge is, if you've never heard of the brand, you wonder, 'Should I buy it when it's 20 percent cheaper?' '' said Raj Kumar, a supply chain consultant at A. T. Kearney. ''Or should I buy a brand I trust?''
What is empowering the upstarts now is the Web's ability to reach lots of consumers without the costs of operating physical stores as well as a change in manufacturers' willingness to work with small brands.
The founders of Deal Décor, whose model was to sell furniture directly to customers, worked at Target and Home Depot Direct before starting their company. They said they saw an opening after the recession hit.
As home sales in the United States declined, and furniture sales went with them, Chinese furniture factories had excess capacity, said Craig Sakuma, co-founder of the company. Where the factories had previously been unwilling to take small production orders, they were now eager for business -- but they were concerned about getting paid, as they were already chasing down payments from errant retailers.
So Deal Décor approached manufacturers with an appealing proposal: it would pay them as the products were shipped, rather than a month or more later.
Unlike traditional furniture retailers, Deal Décor's model was to sell couches or bookshelves on its Web site before they were in production. It timed the deals for when a factory was producing similar items for other clients and could easily add Deal Décor's order. Deal Décor ordered the exact quantity it had sold and had the items shipped straight from the factory to customers eight to 16 weeks later.
Because they are not dependent on third parties, these e-commerce companies can also introduce products much more quickly.
Crane and Canopy, for example, releases new duvet covers and sheet sets every other week and designs textiles based on current trends on Pinterest and elsewhere, instead of planning collections seasons ahead of time like most brands, said Karin Shieh, its co-founder.
''We want consumers to get those products immediately, so we connect our customers directly with the factories that are currently making bedding for Bloomingdale's, Neiman Marcus and high-end brands,'' Ms. Shieh said.
But Crane and Canopy sells the bedding without all the extra costs. A queen-size white pintuck duvet cover on its site, for instance, is $119, while a similar one by DKNY is $400 at Bloomingdale's.
These direct-to-consumer companies are raising large sums from investors, who see great potential in the idea. In February, Julep raised $10.3 million from Andreessen Horowitz and Maveron.
This year, Warby Parker raised $42 million from investors including American Express and the chief executive of J. Crew. The company declined to disclose its valuation, but said investors value it as a lifestyle company, which is worth more than a typical e-commerce company.
In some cases, the online brands are choosing not to discount, keeping the extra profits from cutting out the middlemen for themselves. At Poppin, an office supply company, the staplers are $14, while staplers from other sites can be bought for as little as $3 (though they do not come in lime green and hot pink like Poppin's).
People are willing to pay more for a unique product, said Randy Nicolau, Poppin's chief executive. The company's gross margins are more than double the typical margins in the industry, he said.
''You can buy the same Swingline stapler at OfficeMax, Office Depot, Walmart and Amazon,'' he said. ''The only way these folks can differentiate is on price, so they're just beating themselves up on margins.''
The start-ups also use their manufacturers as research and development centers, getting tips on what bigger brands are doing.
Julep, for instance, made lengthening mascara in part using techniques that the factories had developed with bigger brands that had not yet brought their products to market. Last year, it introduced 180 shades of nail polish in response to trends like the colors that models wore on the runway.
Jane Park, Julep's founder and chief executive, said manufacturers were eager to help because small e-commerce companies brought many more new products to market than big brands did since they were not hampered by shelf space and a complex supply chain. Mr. Sakuma of Deal Décor said the manufacturers ''have incredible amounts of intelligence on what's being sold and what's popular.''
Still, managing a product's entire supply chain has challenges. One, said Mr. Kumar, the supply chain analyst, is controlling quality at factories abroad. Another is avoiding design patent conflicts when working with factories that also work with big brands (though Mr. Sakuma said making minor changes to designs, like a different leg on a sofa, was enough to avoid conflicts).
Deal Décor learned this firsthand recently. After 10 months in business, it was on track to have $2 million in revenue this year, and its margins were 20 to 30 percent, said Gregory Lok, a co-founder. However, marketing costs to attract customers to an unknown brand were too expensive. Deal Décor is shutting down operations, and Mr. Lok is working on a new business.
''Going to factories in China is the easiest part of the process,'' Mr. Blumenthal of Warby Parker said. ''The hardest part is building a brand that stands for something and will resonate with customers.''
To do that, Warby Parker's founders gave article ideas about the company to fashion magazines instead of tech blogs or optical trade magazines, he said. They spent months arguing over details like whether they would describe the glasses as ''collegiate'' or ''preppy.'' (''Collegiate'' won, Mr. Blumenthal said, because it implies worldliness, while ''preppy'' signals a specific socioeconomic class.)
Even though selling online, and avoiding the costs of bricks-and-mortar stores, is one of the central tenets of e-commerce strategy, Warby Parker has found that many potential customers want to touch and hold its products. The company, based in New York, has contracted with boutiques in several major cities to display sample glasses, and it is also opening a stand-alone showroom in Manhattan this spring.
Similarly, Julep sells nail polish in Sephora and QVC to try to build brand recognition.
''It adds gravitas,'' Mr. Blumenthal said.

HEADLINE: Calculating the Impact of Cyprus's Bailout

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
WHAT are the implications of the huge losses -- 60 percent -- that the Cypriot bailout is imposing on the biggest depositors of that country's two largest banks?
The magnitude of the losses, disclosed late Friday and confirmed Saturday by Cypriot officials, has provoked concern that depositors in second-tier euro zone banks in Slovenia and Italy might withdraw their savings from those institutions.
It has also raised fears that countries like Malta and Luxembourg, which like Cyprus have banking sectors many times bigger than their economies, might soon find it harder to gain access to international bond markets.
One relevant lesson might lie not elsewhere in the euro zone but in the carcass of a Los Angeles-based savings and loan institution, IndyMac Bancorp, that failed five years ago and required a bailout. IndyMac was about the size of the Bank of Cyprus, and its depositors ended up taking nearly as big a loss -- 50 percent on deposits above the levels insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Rather than causing a panic and a bank run elsewhere, IndyMac's debacle proved to be a largely contained disaster with little fallout. 
''Just as you did not see mass panic and deposit runs in the U.S. after IndyMac, what happened in Cyprus is not going to spill over into Europe,'' said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a specialist in banking and government debt at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
IndyMac needed rescuing because, like the Cypriot bank, it placed a large bet just before one of the biggest recent credit disasters. For IndyMac, the calamity was the collapse of the subprime mortgage market in the United States. For the Bank of Cyprus, it was the collapse of Greek government bonds, in which it and other Cypriot banks had invested heavily, seeking an adequate return on the billions of euros of deposits that had inflated their balance sheets.
''How unique is Cyprus? Pretty unique actually,'' Mr. Kirkegaard wrote in a research note.
He pointed out that compared with other countries with huge banking systems relative to their economies -- notably Malta, at about eight times gross domestic product, and Luxembourg at more than 22 times G.D.P. -- Cypriot banks had much lower levels of equity to cushion against failing assets. What is more, it is the subsidiaries of foreign banks, which have little or no exposure to the local economies, that make up the bulk of the Maltese and Luxembourg banking systems.
By comparison, many of the Cypriot banking assets that grew to be seven times the size of the country's economy consisted of corporate, construction and mortgage loans to the Cypriot and Greek economies, which tied the health of these banks directly to those sagging economies.
As proponents of the Cypriot losses argue, just as it was fair that the large depositors that bankrolled IndyMac's subprime excesses in 2008 pay the cost for the bank's failure, so it is right that Cypriot savers -- the largest of whom were Russian billionaires chasing high-yielding deposits -- suffer a similar fate.
''There were stories of pain, too, at IndyMac, but in the U.S., we paid little attention to it,'' Mr. Kirkegaard said. ''This will impose a lot of pain on Cypriot society, but the outcome will not be that much different.''
IndyMac, when it was rescued by American regulators in July 2008, had become the ninth-largest originator of mortgage loans in the United States, relying largely on large, uninsured deposits to finance a lending spree in some of the riskiest areas of the housing market.
And while the American government backed savers with deposits of less than $100,000, those with more deposited at IndyMac were required to accept a loss of 50 percent when it declared bankruptcy. (The federal government helped prevent a broader panic by later raising the deposit insurance threshold to the current $250,000.)
As the Cypriot government begins investigating the misadventures of the Bank of Cyprus and the second-largest, Laiki, bankers and lawyers in Nicosia have begun to argue that the disastrous venture by the Bank of Cyprus into Greek bonds could well have been avoided.
Local bankers say the bank had more or less sold out of its Greek bond position by early 2010 as Greece's problems became evident.
But then, in late spring of 2010, as an international bailout of Greece looked increasingly likely, the Bank of Cyprus plunged back into the market, buying 2.1 billion euros, $2.7 billion, worth of the troubled bonds, lured by the increasingly high yields that went with the risk. At the time, the bonds were trading around 70 cents on the euro, and bankers say that, in essence, when the Bank of Cyprus bought the securities, it was betting that the loss, when it occurred, would be less than the market had expected.
Such a risky strategy is frequently used by hedge funds dabbling in distressed debt. But it is generally not seen as the expertise of large, deposit-reliant institutions like the Bank of Cyprus.
''This was pure speculation -- European banks like Deutsche Bank were desperately trying to get rid of these things,'' said a Cypriot banker familiar with the transactions who was not authorized to speak publicly.
Two years later, in March 2012, Greek bonds would be written down by 75 percent, saddling the Bank of Cyprus with a loss of about 1.6 billion euros -- around 4.4 percent of its assets -- from which it has yet to recover.
European officials and economists at the International Monetary Fund are therefore making the case that the risks the Cypriot banks took were not just egregious but unique, given the size of its banking sector.
This is not to say that there are no looming problems in Europe that could not become more dangerous in the days ahead as uncertainty over Cyprus continues. A few weeks ago the I.M.F., in its annual economic survey of Slovenia, warned that the country's banks, hobbled by increasing nonperforming loans, were under ''severe distress'' and would need 1 billion euros in fresh cash to keep them afloat.
Slovenia has large levels of understated debt that could attract investor scrutiny as broader finances continue to deteriorate.
Nonperforming loans in Italy are also persistently on the rise. And risk-averse investors are becoming more wary about buying the bonds of Italian banks in the fear that if these banks fail, investors will be required to share in the burden of bailing them out.
Nevertheless, those problems were endemic to Slovenia and Italy long before the Cyprus crisis emerged. If, as a result of Cyprus, bond investors and depositors become more discerning about where they put their money, European officials will see that as more positive than negative for the future of the euro zone.

HEADLINE: Beijing Opposes U.S. Rule on Technology Imports

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China expressed ''resolute opposition'' and ''strong dissatisfaction'' with a new U.S. cyberespionage rule limiting imports of Chinese-made information technology products, the state media reported over the weekend. 
The remarks underscore growing tension between the world's top two economies after the United States accused China of backing a string of hacking attacks on U.S. companies and government agencies. China says that the accusation lacks proof and that it is also a victim of hacking attacks, more than half of which originate in the United States.
The new provision, tucked into a funding bill signed into law in Washington on Thursday, requires NASA, as well as the U.S. Justice and Commerce Departments, to seek approval from national law enforcement officials before buying information technology systems from China. The United States imports about $129 billion worth of ''advanced technology products'' from China, according to a May 2012 report by the U.S. Congressional Research Service.
The Chinese state media, including Xinhua, China Daily and People's Daily, quoted a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce on Saturday as saying the U.S. bill ''sends a very wrong signal.''
''This will directly impact partnerships of Chinese enterprises and American business as they conduct regular trade,'' said Shen Danyang, the Commerce Ministry spokesman.
''This abuse of so-called national security measures is unfair to Chinese enterprises, and extends the discriminatory practice of presumption of guilt,'' the article in the official People's Daily said, quoting Mr. Shen. ''This severely damages mutual trust between the U.S. and China.'' The United States should eliminate the law, Mr. Shen said.
The technology security lawyer Stewart Baker wrote in a blog post last week that China could claim that the United States was violating World Trade Organization rules. However, because Beijing has not signed a W.T.O. agreement setting international rules for government procurement, it may not be successful in its challenge, Mr. Baker said.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei urged the United States at a news conference to abandon the law. ''This bill uses Internet security as an excuse to take discriminatory steps against Chinese companies,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Papers Worldwide Embrace Web Subscriptions

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
SERRAVAL, France -- Newspapers, once reluctant to try to charge readers for access to their Web sites, have begun doing so in droves.
Across many of the developed economies of America, Europe and Asia, so-called pay walls are proliferating as publishers struggle to make up for dwindling revenue on their print products. Online advertising, once seen as the great hope for the future, has begun leveling off, which is accelerating the push for new Internet business models.
''Why now?'' said Douglas McCabe, an analyst at Enders Analysis in London. ''The outlook for digital advertising for all but the very largest sites looks increasingly challenging. Therefore, it is critical that news services experiment with subscription models.'' 
The trend has taken in some longtime holdouts, like The Washington Post, which said in March that it would start charging online readers this summer. Elsewhere in the United States, The San Francisco Chronicle also recently announced plans to start digital subscriptions, and the total number of American newspapers with pay walls has climbed to more than 300.
In Europe, the recent conversion has been even more striking. Last week, the Telegraph Media Group, publisher of the biggest broadsheet in Britain, said it would start charging British domestic readers for access, having previously introduced a pay wall for its international audience. The biggest tabloid in Britain, The Sun, also confirmed plans to erect a pay wall.
Last month in Switzerland, Tages-Anzeiger, the largest-circulation quality daily in the German-speaking part of the country, announced plans to switch to a paid online model, joining its main rival, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, which did so last year.
In Germany, Schwäbisches Tagblatt became the 35th newspaper to introduce a pay wall. Among the leading national dailies, Die Welt started charging online readers recently, and Bild plans to do so this summer. Other German publishers have said they are weighing the move.
''There's hardly anyone left who is resisting the trend,'' said Tobias Fröhlich, a spokesman for Axel Springer, which publishes both papers.
In Asia, too, pay walls are popping up, with publications like the Asahi Shimbun and the Nihon Keizai Shimbun in Japan and The Straits Times of Singapore embracing digital payment plans.
The new round of pay wall adoption could test some long-held assumptions about online fees. In Britain, for example, the conventional wisdom used to be that it would be impossible for newspapers to persuade readers to pay for general news online; while one British newspaper, The Financial Times, was a pay wall pioneer, some analysts attributed its success to its specialized business content and the fact that many of its customers pay for their subscriptions via corporate expense accounts.
Certain particularities of the British market make the transition harder for general newspapers in Britain than elsewhere. One is a high rate of newsstand sales rather than home delivery, which predominates in the United States and Germany. It is easier to market new services, like paid online access, to existing subscribers than to anonymous customers at a newsstand.
British tabloids have also had to confront questions about their credibility since the phone-hacking scandal, which resulted in the shutdown of The News of the World, a sibling to The Sun in News Corporation's stable.
The popularity of the BBC's news Web site, which is required to be free in Britain, is a further hurdle for rival online publishers. Yet after the latest round of pay wall adoption, only two prominent national British dailies, The Guardian and The Daily Mail, will be available free on the Web.
Another notion that is about to be put to the test is the industry belief that tabloid newspapers, specializing in celebrity gossip and other news with a short shelf life and aimed at lower-income readers than broadsheets, might have an especially hard time persuading readers to pay for digital editions. Now the two highest-circulation newspapers in Europe, Bild -- a tabloid in content despite its broadsheet format -- and The Sun, are about to find out.
Perhaps in an acknowledgment that tabloid news will prove to be a tough sell, both papers plan to supplement their online offerings with a new kind of newspaper content: soccer video clips. Both The Sun and Bild recently acquired online rights to show highlights from the top-flight soccer leagues in their respective countries, the Premier League in Britain and the Bundesliga in Germany.
Bild plans to continue offering general news free; exclusive content, including the soccer clips, will require payment. The Sun says it has not yet decided on a charging mechanism.
Among higher-brow publications, the favored approach to digital payment seems to be the so-called metered model, under which casual visitors to a newspaper Web site are not charged, while those who pass a certain threshold -- say, 10 articles a month -- are required to pay. This model, pioneered by The Financial Times and later adopted by The New York Times, lets online papers maintain a broad audience, necessary to sell digital advertising, while obtaining new revenue from the most loyal readers.
The New York Times turned on its metered system two years ago, and says it had attracted about 640,000 paying customers to its digital versions by the end of last year. Elsewhere, papers like Die Welt and Neue Zürcher Zeitung have also taken the metered approach, and The Telegraph said it planned to do so, too. In Hong Kong, The South China Morning Post, which for years operated a so-called hard pay wall -- requiring payment for all access -- switched last fall to the metered approach.
Big numbers have not always followed immediately. The Neue Zürcher Zeitung in Zurich, for example, said it now had 13,000 digital subscribers; but even before it put up its pay wall in October, it had 12,000 customers for its ''e-paper'' edition -- a paid-for digital replica of the paper.
''I'm glad we did it,'' said Peter Hogenkamp, head of digital media at the NZZ Media Group, the paper's publisher. ''I have no bad feelings about it. But everyone in the business is overestimating pay wall revenues.''

HEADLINE: The Tar Sands Disaster

BYLINE: By THOMAS HOMER-DIXON. 
Thomas Homer-Dixon, who teaches global governance at the Balsillie School of International Affairs, is the author of ''The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization.''

 BODY:
WATERLOO, Ontario
IF President Obama blocks the Keystone XL pipeline once and for all, he'll do Canada a favor.
Canada's tar sands formations, landlocked in northern Alberta, are a giant reserve of carbon-saturated energy -- a mixture of sand, clay and a viscous low-grade petroleum called bitumen. Pipelines are the best way to get this resource to market, but existing pipelines to the United States are almost full. So tar sands companies, and the Alberta and Canadian governments, are desperately searching for export routes via new pipelines.
Canadians don't universally support construction of the pipeline. A poll by Nanos Research in February 2012 found that nearly 42 percent of Canadians were opposed. Many of us, in fact, want to see the tar sands industry wound down and eventually stopped, even though it pumps tens of billions of dollars annually into our economy. 
The most obvious reason is that tar sands production is one of the world's most environmentally damaging activities. It wrecks vast areas of boreal forest through surface mining and subsurface production. It sucks up huge quantities of water from local rivers, turns it into toxic waste and dumps the contaminated water into tailing ponds that now cover nearly 70 square miles.
Also, bitumen is junk energy. A joule, or unit of energy, invested in extracting and processing bitumen returns only four to six joules in the form of crude oil. In contrast, conventional oil production in North America returns about 15 joules. Because almost all of the input energy in tar sands production comes from fossil fuels, the process generates significantly more carbon dioxide than conventional oil production.
There is a less obvious but no less important reason many Canadians want the industry stopped: it is relentlessly twisting our society into something we don't like. Canada is beginning to exhibit the economic and political characteristics of a petro-state.
Countries with huge reserves of valuable natural resources often suffer from economic imbalances and boom-bust cycles. They also tend to have low-innovation economies, because lucrative resource extraction makes them fat and happy, at least when resource prices are high.
Canada is true to type. When demand for tar sands energy was strong in recent years, investment in Alberta surged. But that demand also lifted the Canadian dollar, which hurt export-oriented manufacturing in Ontario, Canada's industrial heartland. Then, as the export price of Canadian heavy crude softened in late 2012 and early 2013, the country's economy stalled.
Canada's record on technical innovation, except in resource extraction, is notoriously poor. Capital and talent flow to the tar sands, while investments in manufacturing productivity and high technology elsewhere languish.
But more alarming is the way the tar sands industry is undermining Canadian democracy. By suggesting that anyone who questions the industry is unpatriotic, tar sands interest groups have made the industry the third rail of Canadian politics.
The current Conservative government holds a large majority of seats in Parliament but was elected in 2011 with only 40 percent of the vote, because three other parties split the center and left vote. The Conservative base is Alberta, the province from which Prime Minister Stephen Harper and many of his allies hail. As a result, Alberta has extraordinary clout in federal politics, and tar sands influence reaches deep into the federal cabinet.
Both the cabinet and the Conservative parliamentary caucus are heavily populated by politicians who deny mainstream climate science. The Conservatives have slashed financing for climate science, closed facilities that do research on climate change, told federal government climate scientists not to speak publicly about their work without approval and tried, unsuccessfully, to portray the tar sands industry as environmentally benign.
The federal minister of natural resources, Joe Oliver, has attacked ''environmental and other radical groups'' working to stop tar sands exports. He has focused particular ire on groups getting money from outside Canada, implying that they're acting as a fifth column for left-wing foreign interests. At a time of widespread federal budget cuts, the Conservatives have given Canada's tax agency extra resources to audit registered charities. It's widely assumed that environmental groups opposing the tar sands are a main target.
This coercive climate prevents Canadians from having an open conversation about the tar sands. Instead, our nation behaves like a gambler deep in the hole, repeatedly doubling down on our commitment to the industry.
President Obama rejected the pipeline last year but now must decide whether to approve a new proposal from TransCanada, the pipeline company. Saying no won't stop tar sands development by itself, because producers are busy looking for other export routes -- west across the Rockies to the Pacific Coast, east to Quebec, or south by rail to the United States. Each alternative faces political, technical or economic challenges as opponents fight to make the industry unviable.
Mr. Obama must do what's best for America. But stopping Keystone XL would be a major step toward stopping large-scale environmental destruction, the distortion of Canada's economy and the erosion of its democracy.

HEADLINE: Lessons From A Comeback

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Modern movement conservatism, which transformed the G.O.P. from the moderate party of Dwight Eisenhower into the radical right-wing organization we see today, was largely born in California. The Golden State, even more than the South, created today's religious conservatism; it elected Ronald Reagan governor; it's where the tax revolt of the 1970s began. But that was then. In the decades since, the state has grown ever more liberal, thanks in large part to an ever-growing nonwhite share of the electorate.
As a result, the reign of the Governator aside, California has been solidly Democratic since the late 1990s. And ever since the political balance shifted, conservatives have declared the state doomed. Their specifics keep changing, but the moral is always the same: liberal do-gooders are bringing California to its knees. 
A dozen years ago, the state was supposedly doomed by all its environmentalists. You see, the eco-freaks were blocking power plants, and the result was crippling blackouts and soaring power prices. ''The country's showcase state,'' gloated The Wall Street Journal, ''has come to look like a hapless banana republic.''
But a funny thing happened on the road to collapse: it turned out that the main culprit in the electricity crisis was deregulation, which opened the door for ruthless market manipulation. When the market manipulation went away, so did the blackouts.
Undeterred, a few years later conservatives found another line of attack. This time they said that liberal big spending and overpaid public employees were bringing on collapse.
And the state has indeed spent the past few years facing a severe fiscal crunch. When the national housing bubble burst, California was hit especially hard, and the combined effects of the plunge in home prices and the economic downturn led to sharply reduced revenue. Once more there were gleeful pronouncements of imminent doom: California, declared one pundit after another, is America's Greece.
Again, however, reports of the state's demise proved premature. Unemployment in California remains high, but it's coming down -- and there's a projected budget surplus, in part because the implosion of the state's Republican Party finally gave Democrats a big enough political advantage to push through some desperately needed tax increases. Far from presiding over a Greek-style crisis, Gov. Jerry Brown is proclaiming a comeback.
Needless to say, the usual suspects are still predicting doom -- this time from the very tax hikes that are closing the budget gap, which they say will cause millionaires and businesses to flee the state. Well, maybe -- but serious studies have found very little evidence either that tax hikes cause lots of wealthy people to move or that state taxes have any significant impact on growth.
So what do we learn from this history of doom deferred?
I'm not suggesting everything in California is just fine. Unemployment -- especially long-term unemployment -- remains very high. California's longer-term economic growth has slowed, too, mainly because the state's limited supply of buildable land means high housing prices, bringing an era of rapid population growth to an end. (Did you know that metropolitan Los Angeles has a higher population density than metropolitan New York?) Last but not least, decades of political paralysis have degraded the state's once-superb public education system. So there are plenty of problems.
The point, however, is that these problems bear no resemblance to the death-by-liberalism story line the California-bashers keep peddling. California isn't a state in which liberals have run wild; it's a state where a liberal majority has been effectively hamstrung by a fanatical conservative minority that, thanks to supermajority rules, has been able to block effective policy-making.
And that's where things get really interesting -- because the era of hamstrung government seems to be coming to an end. Over the years, California's Republicans moved right as the state moved left, yet retained political relevance thanks to their blocking power. But at this point the state's G.O.P. has fallen below critical mass, losing even its power to obstruct -- and this has left Mr. Brown free to push an agenda of tax hikes and infrastructure spending that sounds remarkably like the kind of thing California used to do before the rise of the radical right.
And if this agenda is successful, it will have national implications. After all, California's political story -- in which a radicalized G.O.P. fell increasingly out of touch with an increasingly diverse and socially liberal electorate, and eventually found itself marginalized -- is arguably playing out with a lag on the national scene too.
So is California still the place where the future happens first? Stay tuned.

HEADLINE: The Immigration Spring

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
It has been amazing this year to watch immigration reform, that perennial train wreck of an issue, keep rolling forward without losing steam or blowing up. A bipartisan band of senators called the Gang of Eight has been working steadily for months on a bill; a similar group in the House is doing the same; diverse outside forces are lining up to urge all of them on, and every week seems to bring new reason for optimism.
The news over the weekend may be the best yet: an agreement in principle between two old adversaries, business and labor, on a new visa program for lower-skilled workers in industries like hotels, restaurants and construction. Previous immigration overhauls have died because of the seemingly unbridgeable divide between business groups, which want an abundant flow of cheap workers, and labor unions, which want to protect the jobs and wages of workers already here. The impasse had been threatening to derail current efforts to draft legislation, just as it did the last time Congress came close to passing a bill, in 2007. 
The breakthrough seems to have come through the vanishing art of compromise. According to negotiators, business won't get the annual flood of 400,000 guest workers it wanted, but it will get four years of rising visa totals -- going from 20,000 to 75,000. After that, visa levels would rise and fall with the unemployment rate and other factors, with a maximum of 200,000 a year.
Labor, meanwhile, gets significant worker protections, including the right for immigrants to change jobs and to seek green cards and citizenship if they wish. Labor's objection to previous guest-worker programs was that they import workers who are shackled to employers and thus acutely vulnerable to exploitation -- a recipe for abysmal wages and working conditions for everybody.
The deal as it has been outlined is highly encouraging, but an actual bill hasn't been seen yet, much less debated. And there is so much else to negotiate beyond the future flow of guest workers. Here are some of the devilish details that remain:
Any bill should give the 11 million unauthorized immigrants a shot at citizenship within a reasonable time -- a decade or less. We want the system to create new Americans, not a permanent subclass of the marginalized and poor. A bill should swiftly clear long backlogs in legal immigration, and not burden the unauthorized with onerous penalties that would only keep them in the shadows.
A bill that cracks down on illegal hiring by expanding the E-Verify database should also include robust anti-discrimination provisions and protect privacy and whistle-blowers. But it must not demand border-sealing benchmarks, or ''triggers,'' as a condition for legalization.
As the immigration debate has moved forward, it has also gone topsy-turvy; left and right are jumbled and players are in unfamiliar positions. President Obama says the right words about giving hope to the unauthorized, but is still playing the role of hard-core enforcer: his administration is deporting people at record rates and keeping detention cells full. More Republicans are trying to appear welcoming to immigrants, though how well these penitents reflect their party as a whole is unclear.
The loudest voices on the anti-immigrant fringe, at least so far, have been drowned out by the calls for comprehensive reform, which is supported by a solid majority of Americans in polls.
Die-hards like Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama are imploring Democratic leaders to slow the process down, which is another way of letting it fester. He should remember that those who have griped the loudest about the immigration problem have always been short on solutions. We are encouraged by the doggedness of Senator Lindsey Graham, who said of reform: ''If I can sell it in South Carolina, don't come to me and say it's hard. This is a conservative state, and the way we're selling it is to fix it.''

HEADLINE: Mexico's Ambitious Economic Agenda

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, has proposed reforms that could make monopolistic industries like telecommunications more competitive, bolster oil production and improve the government's finances. The proposals are commendable and could transform Mexico's economy. But success is far from guaranteed. 
Mexico has long failed to take full advantage of its many assets, including big energy reserves, a growing middle class and access to the American market. One obstacle has been crony capitalist policies that have concentrated economic power in the hands of a few oligarchs. As a result, Mexicans pay much more for goods and services like phone calls, medicines and airfares than the citizens of most other advanced countries, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Mr. Peña Nieto is the young face of Mexico's grand old political party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which governed the country for more than 70 years and is responsible for many of its problems. He argues that it has changed and that he and the PRI are ready to take on vested interests like the broadcasting giant Televisa and the telecom colossus América Móvil, which is controlled by Carlos Slim Helú, who also owns about 8 percent of the Class A shares of The New York Times Company.
In recent weeks, Mr. Peña Nieto and leaders of the country's two other large parties agreed to introduce more competition in broadcasting and telecommunications by giving a new regulator the power to break up dominant companies and award licenses to new firms. Mr. Peña Nieto also plans to reform the country's tax code to cut down on evasion by corporations and the rich. And he wants to allow the country's state-owned oil monopoly to form joint ventures with foreign energy companies to improve its ability to produce oil from deepwater wells.
The big questions are whether and how these proposals will be implemented. The new regulator overseeing the telecommunications and broadcasting industries will need real authority and political backing to confront powerful companies that have undermined previous efforts to allow more competition. In the energy sector, policy makers will have to guarantee that concessions involving foreign oil companies are awarded fairly and transparently and are not handed out to a favored few.
One house of the Mexican Congress has already approved a new telecommunications law and changes to the constitution that could usher in education reforms that will pay off in the long run. Other proposals like tax reform have been delayed because other political parties oppose plans to expand the country's value-added tax to food and medicine, which are not currently taxed.
Mr. Peña Nieto, who took office in December, is not the first Mexican president to attempt big economic reforms, though he has moved further and faster than his predecessors, who were often stymied by the PRI. Now that the PRI is back in power after a 12-year absence, it must demonstrate that it can turn Mr. Peña Nieto's ambitious agenda into national policy.

HEADLINE: North Korea Vows to Keep Nuclear Arms and Fix Economy

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea's leader on Sunday announced a ''new strategic line'' that defied warnings from Washington, saying that his country was determined to rebuild its economy in the face of international sanctions while simultaneously expanding its nuclear weapons arsenal, which the ruling party called ''the nation's life.''
The North's nuclear weapons ''are neither a political bargaining chip nor a thing for economic dealings,'' the official Korean Central News Agency reported, citing remarks from the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party, which adopted new guidelines for the country. 
The North's leader, Kim Jong-un, presided over the meeting, which South Korean news media said was convened for the first time since 1993. The rare event came a day before the planned gathering of the North's rubber-stamp Parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly, which was expected to follow up on the new guidelines adopted by the party.
The party meeting took place against the backdrop of joint military exercises in South Korea involving American and South Korean forces. On Sunday, American F-22 stealth fighter jets were flown from a base in Japan to South Korea to join the exercises, according to an American military statement. In past weeks, B-52 and B-2 bombers offered a demonstration of American air power as part of the exercises.
American and South Korean officials still hope they can persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons through sanctions and diplomacy, especially if China agrees to use its economic leverage with the North. Many regional analysts and officials have suggested that the North's recent strident language, including threats to attack the United States and South Korea with nuclear weapons, is intended not only to solidify Mr. Kim's military credentials at home but also to draw the United States back to the negotiating table.
But a growing number of analysts also say that North Korea seems to have no intention of giving up its nuclear arms. ''The enemies are using both blackmail, telling us that we cannot achieve economic development unless we give up nuclear weapons, and appeasement, saying that they will help us live well if we choose a different path,'' Mr. Kim was quoted as saying during the meeting on Sunday.
But he said his country must expand its nuclear arsenal both ''in quality and quantity, as long as the United States's nuclear threat continues.''
The North's stance has appeared to harden in recent years. Last April, it identified itself as a nuclear power when it revised its Constitution. After the United Nations Security Council imposed more sanctions to punish it for its launching of a long-range rocket in December and its third nuclear test in February, it said it would no longer attend talks on dismantling its nuclear program.
On March 17, the North's Foreign Ministry said the country's nuclear weapons were not a bargaining chip. On Sunday, officials at the plenary meeting made that stance formal, adopting a statement calling the North's nuclear weapons a ''treasure'' that will not be traded for ''billions of dollars,'' because they ''represent the nation's life, which can never be abandoned as long as imperialists and nuclear threats exist on earth.''
Both President Obama and his national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, have recently urged Mr. Kim to learn from Myanmar, where changes initiated by new leaders have resulted in billions in debt forgiveness, large-scale development assistance and an influx of foreign investment. It North Korea continues on its current path, they said, it will face more sanctions and deeper isolation.
President Park Geun-hye of South Korea has also warned that the only way for Mr. Kim's government to ensure its survival is to give up its nuclear weapons. She has often said that nuclear weapons did not save the Soviet Union from collapsing.
On Sunday, North Korea said economic development and an expansion of the nuclear program could take place ''simultaneously'' because a growing nuclear deterrent could allow the North to limit military spending and put more resources into the agricultural sector and light industries to improve people's lives. In what appeared to be related move, officials at the party meeting appointed Pak Pong-ju, a minister in charge of light industries who has supported economic policy changes in the past, to the Politburo.

HEADLINE: On the Economy, Think Long-Term

BYLINE: By JEFFREY D. SACHS. 
Jeffrey D. Sachs, a professor of sustainable development and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, is the author of the forthcoming book ''To Move the World: JFK's Quest for Peace.''

 BODY:
THE 2009 economic stimulus package has come and gone. So, too, have the temporary payroll tax cuts of 2011-12. Most of the Bush-era tax cuts, in addition, have been made permanent. Yet the lasting effects of these policies have been meager.
The economy is still sluggish. Unemployment remains high, especially for lower-skilled workers. Inequality of incomes is higher still. What's more, the fundamental structural challenges to our economy remain. Deeply disruptive forces -- rapidly evolving information technology, globalization and environmental stresses -- are radically reshaping the jobs market. Decent jobs for low-skilled workers have virtually disappeared. Some have been relegated to China and emerging economies, while others have been lost to robotics and computerization. 
The results of these changes can be seen in two starkly different employment figures: since 2008, 3.1 million new jobs have been created for college graduates as 4.3 million jobs have disappeared for high-school graduates and those without a high school diploma.
These trends will only continue, and even become more sharply defined. But in the face of such immense challenges, Republicans continue to hawk their age-old remedy, demanding cuts in government spending, tax rates and regulation so that market forces can respond in due course. Democrats, meanwhile, push just as stridently for their familiar fixes -- short-term spending programs like the 2009 stimulus package enacted during President Obama's first term.
It's time to move beyond such transitory and piecemeal policies. Our underlying economic problems are chronic, not temporary; structural, not cyclical. To solve them, we need a systematic long-term approach.
Consider three priorities for this new, long-range perspective: infrastructure, energy and job skills. With a smart, ambitious strategy in these sectors we can encourage the creation of good jobs and begin to resolve huge problems of competitiveness and the environment.
Start with the country's crumbling infrastructure. Mr. Obama has spoken eloquently about fast intercity rail, renovated highways, safe water systems and refurbished waterways and coastlines. And on Friday, in a speech at the Port of Miami in Florida, the president called once more for a new public-private funding strategy for infrastructure -- $21 billion, on top of some $40 billion previously announced.
That's good and important. Yet the private money will move off the sidelines only when there are solid, long-term plans to deploy it. After all, the 2009 stimulus program put some short-term money toward infrastructure repair, but there has been precious little sustained investment to show for it. Calls for ''public-private'' financing aren't enough. We need strategies -- linking federal, state, regional and local efforts -- that have a 10- to 20-year perspective.
The same goes for our energy system. We are in the midst of a short-term boom of shale oil and natural gas. Yet this expansion in energy production, driven in large part by two new techniques -- horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing -- won't begin to address our long-term energy needs.
Like any overhyped gold rush, today's boom will soon be tomorrow's bust; fractured gas fields have a remarkably rapid decline rate. They also threaten the local environment. More important, given the genuine and increasing impact of climate change, there is no longer any doubt that the world will have to fulfill its energy needs with low-carbon sources -- whether solar, wind, nuclear or carbon-capture and sequestration.
A clearly laid out federal program to support large-scale solar and wind energy, electric vehicles and other smart technologies -- and backed partly by public money -- would unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of private investments. It would secure America's energy future and protect the environment, too.
The third area is job skills. Let's take a lesson from Germany, which boasts a low youth unemployment rate because of skills training. There, many young people gain a job foothold through an apprenticeship with a private company partly financed by the government.
If Mr. Obama were to stop angling for more temporary stimulus and instead put forward sound programs for job training, low-carbon energy and modernized infrastructure, he would most likely carry the public and eventually win the political battle.
For encouragement, he can look to history. Indeed, the United States government has a strong track record of success in such long-term public-private investment programs. Federal agencies helped support and guide the birth of the computer age, the Internet, the Human Genome Project, the federal highway system, the GPS revolution, the global fight against AIDS and, of course, the space program. Each was built on the painstaking political work of a president, backed by scientific experts and private businesses, and fashioned over many years.
All of the challenges above were daunting. We set out for the moon, John F. Kennedy said, not because it was easy but because it was hard. Likewise, those who think returning the nation to prosperity, economic fairness and a safe environment will be easy are only fooling themselves.

HEADLINE: New Breed of Cuban Dissident Finds Changed Miami

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Yoani Sánchez, the Cuban dissident whose trenchant blog and Twitter posts have made her a cause célèbre for democracy on the island, lingered on the edge of the sea wall at La Ermita de la Caridad, Miami's shrine for Cuban exiles, and looked toward home.
''Me siento como en Cuba pero libre,'' said Ms. Sánchez, summing up her first day in Miami last week. ''I feel like I'm in Cuba but free.'' 
With that, Ms. Sánchez officially cemented her bond with the old guard, the city's Cuban exiles.
On Monday, despite her anticipated return to Cuba and her opposition to the economic embargo, Ms. Sanchez will take the stage at the Freedom Tower downtown -- a haven where hundreds of thousands of Cubans in the 1960s and 1970s were first processed as refugees and handed slabs of industrial cheese and Spam. Among those expected to greet her will be veterans of the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion -- standard-bearers of the dwindling hard-line generation -- and the newest Cubans, those who see increased contact with the island as a path to progress.
It was not too long ago that Cuban-Americans here rolled out the red carpet only to defectors who disavowed their homeland and stayed in America. But Ms. Sanchez, a journalist who will return to Cuba to join her husband and son, has offered up an alternative narrative for both the disenchanted in Cuba and the hopeful in Miami, one forged over the Internet.
''This is transcendent,'' said Eduardo J. Padrón, the president of Miami Dade College, which is sponsoring the event, recalling his own arrival at the Freedom Tower as a 15-year-old. ''There is incredible agreement here that she symbolizes the voice of a free Cuba. Her visit has proved that all of us can agree, regardless of the means, on the ultimate goal.''
Ms. Sanchez said in an interview Friday that the warmth of the welcome she has received here has exceeded her expectations. ''I am finding Cuba outside of Cuba,'' she said, in Spanish. ''I was raised in Cuba and indoctrinated that the exiles were the enemy, that they had betrayed the country. And here I am, seeing Cubans preserving Cuba, preserving the culture, the history, the music.''
Working from her Havana apartment, Ms. Sanchez, 37, has spent years writing dispatches on the island's stifling contradictions, the absurdities of everyday life under the Communist system and the lack of freedom and human rights. The Internet and the USB drives that Cubans use to share information have been her chief ally.
She named her blog Generación Y, a nod to Cubans her age who were given names beginning with Y at a time when the Soviet Union held greater sway over the island. The blog receives millions of hits a month, the vast majority from people outside the island because Cuba restricts Internet access. She also has 459,000 Twitter followers.
Ms. Sanchez has been arrested, detained, beaten and harassed for speaking out against prohibitions on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. She is fond of saying that the rights of citizens are not gifts from the government but, as the phrase makes clear, ''rights'' that are inherent.
For five years, Ms. Sanchez tried to obtain permission to travel outside of Cuba but was denied until now. President Raúl Castro recently eliminated travel restrictions for many Cubans and the government chose to grant her permission to travel, too. Her 80-day tour has brought her to three continents, where she has given speeches and received a string of awards and recognitions.
Rosa de la Cruz, one of Miami's most prominent art collectors, said that two years ago she dedicated a room in the museum-like building that houses the de la Cruz Collection to videos of Ms. Sanchez. The collection also hands out copies of Ms. Sanchez's book, ''Havana Real.''
''She is a positive person, not a negative one,'' said Mrs. de la Cruz, who supports the economic embargo but also views the push for human rights in Cuba as paramount. ''And it's important to be positive. It has been very difficult for her to do this in Cuba. And she has said if she had to do it again, she would do it again.''
Natalia Martinez, the communications director for Roots of Hope, a network of 4,000 young professionals who work to help young people in Cuba, said Ms. Sanchez spoke often about the need for a diversity of opinion and emphasized the importance of empowering Cubans on the island.
Technology is one way to punch a hole, Ms. Sanchez says often. So she asks for a flood of cellphones and USB sticks and other devices.
''She addresses the fact that there is a lot of hurt, a lot of pain, associated with the Cuba issue, and she doesn't dismiss it,'' Ms. Martinez said. But, she said: ''Cuban-Americans have more opportunities to be involved in Cuba now than they had before, and Yoani has come to symbolize some kind of joint agency between them. That resonates here.''
Ms. Martinez added, ''She is focused on building a narrative about the future.''
Over the weekend, though, Ms. Sanchez grappled with a far less ambitious agenda: She spent time in Miami with her sister, her brother-in-law and niece. It has been two years since her sister left Cuba for Miami.
''For two years I haven't been able to hug them,'' she said.

HEADLINE: After a Shake-Up, EADS Braces for Challenges Ahead

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
OTTOBRUNN, GERMANY -- Like the farmers tilling the fields that surround its sprawling German offices south of Munich, European Aeronautic Defense & Space, the parent company of Airbus, is making preparations for new beginnings.
This past week, its shareholders approved a new board of directors and formally dissolved a complex agreement that, for more than a decade, had given the governments of France and Germany an effective veto over company strategy.
''It's a huge change for us,'' Thomas Enders, the group's chief executive, said in an interview this month. The failure of a proposed merger last year with BAE Systems of Britain because of opposition from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany showed that ''when push came to shove, it was the shareholder pact that could outvote the board's independent directors.''
The board's new independence is likely to be put to the test quickly, as EADS prepares to disclose a new strategic plan that could put management on a fresh collision course with Berlin. 
The broad outlines of the new strategy, which Mr. Enders expects to reveal this summer, are likely to involve a re-evaluation of the company's previous goal -- formulated before the financial crisis -- of increasing its military business to 50 percent of revenue by 2020. That, analysts said, would mean a new approach to the lucrative U.S. market in the aftermath of the failed BAE merger.
It would also require casting a close eye over its underperforming -- and heavily German -- defense division, Cassidian.
''The biggest single weakness that EADS at least needs to acknowledge is that its defense business, on its own, is subscale,'' said Sash Tusa, an aerospace and military industry analyst at Echelon Research & Advisory in London. Cassidian, he noted, owns significant, but not controlling, stakes in some of Europe's biggest military joint ventures, including Eurofighter, the producer of the Typhoon combat jet, and MBDA, a missile manufacturer, as well as niche activities in military electronics and security.
''It's very fragmented,'' Mr. Tusa said. ''Some of those areas have synergies, but with most it's hard to see how they really fit together into a coherent whole.''
It has also not been hugely profitable. Like most military contractors in recent years, Cassidian, which contributed about half of EADS's &#x20ac;12 billion, or $15 billion, in defense revenue last year, has seen its growth stalled by sharp budget cutbacks in Europe and the United States. Stagnant earnings have prompted two restructurings of the unit since 2011, resulting in the loss of about 1,500 jobs. Cassidian's operating profit plunged 57 percent last year, to &#x20ac;142 million.
That contrasts sharply with EADS's booming commercial jet division, Airbus, which last year increased its sales 19 percent, representing 68 percent of the company's revenue. Operating profit more than doubled, to &#x20ac;1.1 billion from &#x20ac;543 million in 2011. Airbus's order backlog stands at more than 4,700 planes, enough to keep its assembly lines humming for nearly eight years.
Hence the temptation, some analysts say, to spin off EADS's military business entirely and either sell or merge its various activities with those of rival companies based mainly in France, Britain or Italy.
''It looks increasingly like an adjunct to a much bigger body,'' said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Agency Partners in London. ''Even management refers to it as the 'non-Airbus' business.''
A spinoff is likely to be easier said than done. Cassidian employs about 23,000 people, of which a little more than half are based in Germany -- and in particular in Bavaria, a traditional bastion of support for the Christian Democratic Union party of Ms. Merkel, who is seeking re-election this autumn. The prospect of further high-technology job losses or the transfer of valuable intellectual property to foreign competitors would undoubtedly raise hackles in Berlin.
It was precisely those kinds of concerns that ultimately drove Ms. Merkel to reject a merger of EADS with BAE, a deal that would have created a $45 billion European aerospace behemoth to rival Boeing of the United States.
''The German government would go ballistic,'' said Mr. Tusa of Echelon. ''One of the big arguments being made by the economic ministry is, 'We give you lots of defense business, so you have got to provide a lot of high-tech jobs in Germany.' I can't think of a better way to alienate one of your best government customers for little or no financial gain.''
It is a challenge that is not lost on Mr. Enders, a 54-year-old German whose rise began in government. He acknowledged Cassidian's woes, which he said included a heavy dependence on older products like the Eurofighter Typhoon, whose German final assembly lines are in nearby Manching. The Typhoon generates more than &#x20ac;1 billion in annual revenue for EADS, but it is likely to cease production by around 2017.
''We have a very mature business, very much driven by Eurofighter and the businesses around combat aircraft,'' Mr. Enders said. ''Of course we have to look beyond that.''
Mr. Enders said he had ''no doubt'' that Cassidian's profitability could be improved, but he added that he would not rule out the sale of unprofitable assets in Germany or elsewhere. ''We've done that in the past,'' he said. ''It's part of the business of any company to do a bit of portfolio management.'' The success of Airbus, he added, would give EADS time to carefully weigh its strategic options for the military side of the business.
Yet Mr. Enders insisted that domestic political concerns, in Germany or elsewhere, would not play a part in the decision-making. ''We are not timing our strategic review or any other important projects according to whether somebody has an election year or not,'' Mr. Enders said. Under the new governance structure, he added, any divestments -- or acquisitions, for that matter -- were now ''fully in the scope of the new board of directors and not of shareholders or governments.''
EADS's future in the United States, meanwhile, poses different challenges.
The European group has made several attempts in recent years to significantly expand its footprint in the United States, the world's biggest spender on military hardware, with an annual budget of $500 billion. Those attempts have included an ultimately unsuccessful bid for a $35 billion aerial refueling tanker contract with the U.S. Air Force as well as the failed attempt last year to merge with BAE, one of the Pentagon's top 10 contractors.
In the current environment, however, that ''big bang'' focus on the U.S. market looks increasingly difficult to realize.
''The market reality is quite stark,'' said Richard L. Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. ''To a certain extent, EADS is a prisoner of that. ''
With few if any major U.S. procurement programs on the horizon, ''EADS might have to fall back to the acquisition approach,'' said Mr. Cunningham of Agency Partners. But with major U.S. players like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman almost certainly out of reach for national security reasons, he suggested that EADS ''could look at less-sensitive, less-sizable deals that over time aggregate into a significant business.''
Mr. Enders confirmed that the study of U.S. acquisition targets would figure prominently in the EADS strategy review. But he rejected the need to rush -- or to think small. ''I am not a believer in small acquisitions,'' he said. ''I think that a string-of-pearls approach is, in many cases, value-destroying. For a group like ours, it's easier to integrate and to acquire larger companies than smaller ones.''
That said, Mr. Enders said he was less focused on elbowing out U.S. rivals on their home turf. ''I have no illusions about how difficult it is to sell non-American products on the American market,'' he said. ''We should not even dream about trying to sell a product to a U.S. defense customer if it is not really superior to what our American peers are offering.''
Analysts tend to agree.
''The strategy should not be to get a percentage of U.S. exposure for the sake of it, but to manage defense as a nearly integrated business and make acquisitions when and where they fit,'' said Mr. Tusa of Echelon. ''They've got cash, they've got earnings. They can afford to sit on their hands for two years.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Financing the Deficit (More Feldstein)

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Follow the bursting bubble. 

 BODY:
OK, a bit more on the puzzle of people who think there's an interest rate puzzle. Here's the picture of what has happened to saving and investment in America in recent years: 
The blue line is government saving, roughly speaking (leaving some public investment aside) the public sector surplus or deficit; the red line is the private sector surplus, the difference between private saving and private investment. So yes, the budget deficit has soared - but it's just offsetting a surge in the private sector surplus.
Now, this is almost an accounting identity, so by itself the figure doesn't tell you which side is driving the action. But we know the answer to that question from other evidence. For one thing, we know that most of that surge in the private sector surplus reflects the collapse of the housing bubble, and that most of the surge in the public deficit reflected automatic stabilizers. For another, we know that if government deficits were crowding out private spending, we should have seen rising interest rates; what we actually saw was falling rates.
So there isn't any puzzle here, except the puzzle of people who are puzzled. I really don't understand how Marty Feldstein can look at these facts and conclude that the only way to explain low interest rates is to imagine that the Fed is imposing massive market distortions.

HEADLINE: In Libor Ruling, a Big Win for the Banks

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: A judge&#8217;s dismissal of the bulk of the claims filed by private plaintiffs against banks involved in a rate-manipulation scandal is certainly a major victory, but the banks should not get too far ahead of themselves. 

 BODY:
Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of Federal District Court in Manhattan, in a 161-page decision, has given the multinational banks being investigated for manipulating the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a dose of good news for once. 
On Friday, the judge dismissed the bulk of the claims filed against the banks by private plaintiffs, most important the antitrust and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations counts that bring with them triple damages and attorneys' fees for any violation.
The banks can certainly celebrate a major victory in the district court, but they should not get too far ahead of themselves. Like most such decisions, this one is just a way station on the road to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for further review, and there is no guarantee that the appellate judges will agree with Judge Buchwald's analysis. 
Given the stakes involved, this could even be the type of case that draws the interest of the Supreme Court. That means the threat to the banks will linger until the appeals process is played out over the next year or two.
Her decision might have seemed surprising given that three banks - Barclays, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland - have already settled cases with the government that cost them more than $2.5 billion in penalties. Each admitted to submitting false interest-rate information to the British Bankers Association used to establish Libor, a benchmark for loans and securities issued throughout the world. 
UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland even had their Japanese brokerage subsidiaries enter a guilty plea in the United States, something unheard-of in bank prosecutions for years. More banks are likely to reach settlements with the government in the coming months, including admissions of wrongdoing, as they seek to put the Libor investigation behind them.
Indeed, the judge acknowledged in her opinion that the dismissal might be "unexpected" in light of the settlements that brought large fines and admissions of wrongdoing. But she made it clear that this seeming incongruity was a result of the "many requirements that private plaintiffs must satisfy, but which government agencies need not."
Her decision came on a motion to dismiss filed by the banks arguing that the plaintiffs could not prove a violation of the law even if it could be shown that interest-rate manipulation caused them financial harm. 
The cases before Judge Buchwald represent a raft of class actions seeking billions of dollars in damages that were consolidated into a single proceeding.
A major focus is on the claim that the banks colluded to artificially depress Libor, costing investors in swaps and issuers of securities billions of dollars because interest rates tied to the benchmark did not reflect the true market. Under the antitrust laws, it is illegal for competitors to take concerted action that affects the price of goods and services for their own benefit.
The key to Judge Buchwald's decision is her finding that the banks were not acting as competitors but instead were cooperating when submitting interest-rate information to the British Bankers Association, which in turn set Libor based on that data. To prove an antitrust violation, any financial harm suffered by private plaintiffs must be traceable to the negative effect on competition from the collusion. Thus, she concluded, the "injury would have resulted from defendants' misrepresentation, not from harm to competition."
This reflects the approach taken by the Justice Department in the settlements reached thus far with the three banks over Libor manipulation. Those cases involved admissions of violating the federal wire fraud statute from the submission of false information designed to manipulate Libor, not a violation of the antitrust laws.
Judge Buchwald also found that Libor did not fall under the antitrust laws because it was designed to be only a point of information reflecting what banks would charge one another for loans, not a product subject to price-fixing. Whether banks colluded in their submissions or acted individually, the effect on investors would be the same so that there was no harm to competition, even if it caused financial losses.
In addition to the antitrust claims, some plaintiffs claimed the Libor manipulation violated the commodities laws and the racketeering statute, commonly known as RICO. Judge Buchwald threw out the RICO action, but did allow a portion of the commodities claims to proceed.
The discount broker Charles Schwab based its claim of a RICO violation on the banks' having engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity involving mail, wire and bank fraud in manipulating Libor. 
The judge dismissed that claim on two grounds: first, because RICO cannot be used in cases involving securities, based on a provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act adopted in 1995 to curb abusive lawsuits. 
Second, she concluded that RICO only reached a domestic enterprise affected by the misconduct, not a foreign one. Because the focal point of the manipulation was Libor as set by the British Bankers Association in London, she ruled, the violations fell outside the jurisdiction of a United States court.
The commodities claims were brought by traders in Eurodollar futures contracts who claimed that artificially lowering Libor effectively drove up the cost of their contracts. Judge Buchwald allowed some claims to proceed if the plaintiffs could show that the two-year statute of limitations did not require dismissal.
The claims by investors over some Eurodollar futures contracts will move forward, and the amounts involved in that case could be significant, even if much less than the broad antitrust claims.
Yet the banks face other significant legal challenges. There are lawsuits from the Libor manipulation that were not directly affected by the ruling. For example, for antitrust violations, breach of contract and fraud. The potential damages are $5 billion. There is no guarantee the judge in that case, which was filed in Virginia, will adopt the view of the antitrust laws taken by Judge Buchwald.
And for those banks that have not yet reached settlements with regulators, there is the prospect of large monetary penalties and perhaps a guilty plea by a foreign subsidiary. As we have seen in the first three settlements, the government usually releases a set of embarrassing e-mails and text messages that put the bank in a rather bad light.
Still, there is no question that a win is a win, and the banks have every reason to be heartened by Judge Buchwald's decision because it gives the plaintiffs much less leverage in seeking any settlement. There is, however, still a long way to go.

HEADLINE: On Wall Street, It's Good to Be a Director

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: There is one job on Wall Street for which pay has continued to rise since the financial crisis: board member. | Michael S. Steinberg is the most senior SAC Capital Advisors employee to be ensnared in the government&#8217;s insider trading investigation. | A Dell proxy statement sheds light on the process of fielding interest from bidders. | Efforts to replace corporate directors rarely succeed. 

 BODY:
There is one job on Wall Street for which pay has continued to rise since the financial crisis: board member. Compensation for directors at the nation's biggest banks has ticked up even as the banks themselves have reined in salaries and bonuses, DealBook's Susanne Craig reports.
The directors of Goldman Sachs, who are the best compensated of any big bank board members in the United States, made $488,709 on average in 2011, up more than 50 percent from 2008, according to the compensation data firm Equilar. Goldman defends the board's pay by saying the bulk of compensation is in stock that directors cannot touch until they leave the board, aligning their interests with those of shareholders. "More broadly, banks and compensation experts say, financial firms must now pay a premium to entice and keep qualified directors," Ms. Craig writes.
But some on Wall Street argue that increased regulation has actually limited what a bank's board can do. "About the only thing bank directors have more of these days is meetings," joked one senior Wall Street executive who has frequent interaction with his board. "Regulators have all but stripped boards of the main powers they had before the crisis." 
At Goldman, which is expected to release fresh pay data in the coming weeks, the board's compensation is likely to rise for 2012 because the firm's shares rose more than 35 percent last year, Ms. Craig notes. "After Goldman, Morgan Stanley's director pay is the second highest on Wall Street, with an average of $351,080, roughly the same as it was in 2008 but much higher than the pay at bigger and more complicated rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup."
A TOP MANAGER AT SAC IS ARRESTED | Michael S. Steinberg was a trusted lieutenant of Steven A. Cohen, having joined Mr. Cohen's hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, when it was still a rising star on Wall Street. He led a charmed life, earning tens of millions of dollars and taking part in philanthropy. But he was arrested on Friday, becoming the most senior SAC employee to be ensnared in the government's insider trading investigation, DealBook's Peter Lattman writes.
He is among nine current or former SAC employees to have been linked to insider trading while at SAC. But Mr. Steinberg stands out. In an unusual move, SAC issued a statement in support of the portfolio manager: "Mike has conducted himself professionally and ethically during his long tenure at the firm. We believe him to be a man of integrity."
Mr. Steinberg, 40, pleaded not guilty on Friday and was freed on $3 million bail. "Michael Steinberg did absolutely nothing wrong," his lawyer, Barry H. Berke, said in a statement. "Caught in the cross-fire of aggressive investigations of others, there is no basis for even the slightest blemish on his spotless reputation."
WEIGHING ALTERNATIVES FOR DELL | A proxy statement filed by Dell on Friday sheds light on the process of fielding interest from a range of possible bidders for the company. "Buried in one of the filing's exhibits is a presentation that JPMorgan Chase bankers delivered to a special committee of Dell's board on Jan. 18," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced writes. Bids from the Blackstone Group and Carl C. Icahn would involve leaving a portion of Dell publicly traded, in contrast to the $24.4 billion takeover bid by Michael S. Dell and Silver Lake. But in that presentation, JPMorgan Chase bankers said alternatives to a full take-private could limit the company's financial flexibility.
Advisers to Dell directors spoke to 71 potential bidders during the company's 45-day "go shop" period, the filing shows. Among the parties to have circled the computer maker were Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG Capital, Mr. de la Merced reports.
ON THE AGENDA | In Britain, the Financial Services Authority is split into separate regulators. The ISM manufacturing index for March is out at 10 a.m. David Tisch, co-founder of TechStars NYC, is on Bloomberg TV at 2 p.m.
WHY BAD DIRECTORS STAY IN PLACE | "You really couldn't have a stronger case for removing directors" than Hewlett-Packard, Michael Garland, executive director for corporate governance in the New York City comptroller's office, told James B. Stewart, a columnist for The New York Times. And yet, all 11 of H.P.'s directors were re-elected on March 20. Mr. Stewart writes: "H.P. is hardly an isolated case. According to Patrick McGurn, special counsel for one of the major shareholder advisory services, Institutional Shareholder Services, shareholder efforts to remove directors in uncontested elections rarely succeed or come close, even in egregious circumstances."
PARSONS ENVISIONS A JAZZ REVIVAL | Richard Parsons, a former chairman of Citigroup, who is working to reopen Minton's Playhouse in Harlem, told The New York Times about his early memories of jazz. As a teenager growing up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, he took his senior prom date to the Hickory House restaurant in Manhattan to hear the Billy Taylor Trio, an evening he remembers as his "first true adolescent experience."

HEADLINE: Apple of Discord in China

BYLINE: BILL BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: There are a number of theories about why official Chinese media outlets are attacking Apple. And while many Chinese commentators online are mocking the state media, the company does appear to have a problem with Beijing. 

 BODY:
The official Chinese media assault on Apple discussed in the previous China Insider column continued throughout the week. 
CCTV Evening News, watched by tens of millions every night, broadcast reports nearly every night criticizing Apple while the People's Daily newspaper ran multiple stories attacking the company, including one accusing it of "incomparable arrogance."
On Monday, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that Apple would "face enhanced legal supervision in China" because of "imparity clauses in its warranty policies," while the China Consumer's Association has demanded the company "sincerely apologize to Chinese consumers" and "thoroughly correct its problems." 
The central stated issue is that Apple is not in full compliance with Chinese law that requires warranties on computer sales to be at least two years. Interestingly, a European Union official recently said that Apple had a similar problem there.
(The chief executive of Apple, Timothy D. Cook, on Monday issued a letter of apology - in Chinese - over the company's warranty policies.)
The tabloid newspaper The Global Times, not usually known for its restraint, ran an editorial on Friday headlined "For Apple, business must stay business":
Apple has won respect from Chinese consumers with its perseverance in developing leading technologies and styles. But the company is not impeccable ...
Apple should not follow the media speculation and consider itself the target of political persecution ...
If the issue developed into a head-on confrontation between Apple and the Chinese authorities, the U.S. company will never be a winner, nor will China necessarily do well. Of course, Apple will suffer the most, as its products are already facing increasing competition in China.
There aremany theories about why official media outlets are attacking Apple, including payback for Huawei's problems in the United States; a reaction to new U.S. government procurement rules that will limit the purchase of Chinese-made information technology products; and protectionism for domestic handset makers (almost all of whom rely on some variant of Google's Android to power their phones). 
Many Chinese netizens have mocked the state media's attacks, especially the comments by a People's University law professor that the missing piece in Apple's logo may be "responsibility and conscience to Chinese consumers," but Apple cannot win this fight, regardless of the merits or support from some consumers. 
Apple looks to have a serious government and public relations problem that will require a much more proactive and forthright response than what the company has done so far. Dribbling out a petulant apology akin to its response to the problems with the 2010 iPhone 4 antenna will not work in China. 
The standard response by a foreign company in China facing this kind of onslaught is to make public and private apologies, emphasize its commitment and contributions to China and dispatch senior executives from headquarters to make the rounds of the relevant Chinese government entities. Apple may also have to begin a new service for China, one it may also be able to sell to other foreign enterprises. It's name? The iKowtow.
Investors have reason to be concerned. Between this brouhaha, the increased competition from Samsung and other high-end Android phones and the crackdown on corruption that is denting the gifting culture, Apple's results in China for its current quarter may be disappointing, even though this is the first full quarter in which the iPhone 5 has been on sale in China. 
There is of course other news in China. 
 ECONOMIC DATA ON MONDAY was moderately positive, though consumption was light:
It appears that the efforts by the new government to crack down on corruption and to moderate official extravaganza may have started to dampen retail sales.
Beijing, Shanghai and several other cities released details of the new measures to control real estate prices, including strict implementation of a 20 percent capital gains tax. The new rules appear to be weaker than many had feared, and there is much skepticism in the market that they will slow rising property prices. 
China goes on vacation for several days this week to observethe Tomb Sweeping Festival, so it should be a relatively quiet week. The mobile phone revolution has now reached the dead. According to Xinhua, some graveyards now have tombstones affixed with two-dimensional quick response codes that allow you to point your phone at the code and call up a virtual obituary. 
So far there is no word on whether anyone has trademarked the word iTombs.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: The Silly Money Ratio

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: The stock market closes at a record high. Daily deals are no longer driving restaurant traffic. You may now power up your electronic devices. But are your ducks in a row? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
 Small-Business Must-Reads 
Matthew Yglesias explains how not-in-my-backyard stupidity is blocking an opportunity for small-business growth. A dongle joke at a tech conference spirals way out of control. Bryan A.

 The Week's Best Quotes 
 Brian S. Cohen explains in his just-published book what angel investors are looking for: "Entrepreneurs who most impress angel investors are the ones who deeply know their customers. They have done research into the demographics of their typical customers: age, gender, geography, lifestyle, income, aspiration, brand preferences, shopping habits. They know what their behavior and thinking is because they[#x2bc]ve spent time with them. They even learn which words and phrases resonate most with customers. This research doesn't come cheap or easy, but it's available with a little work."
 Maneesh Sethi explains how to make it impossible to fail: "The secret is called precommitment. Precommitment is the process of making a promise, when you are in your sane state, that will prevent your tempted insane-emotional-id-self from doing something bad. Precommitment is the process of creating an environment that forces you to succeed. You might not be able to find a month to hike in the wilderness, but there are still ways to use precommitment in your normal life."

HEADLINE: Behind the Cover Story: Susan Dominus on Whether Altruism Pays Off

BYLINE: RACHEL NOLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The author of this week&#8217;s cover article discusses Adam Grant&#8217;s theories on how helping others can make you more successful. 

 BODY:
 Sue Dominus, a staff writer at the magazine, wrote this week's cover story about a psychologist and management professor named Adam Grant. Her last article for the magazine was a profile of the actress Connie Britton. 
 How did you hear about Adam Grant? 
I've always been interested in organizational psychology, to the point where I nearly applied to graduate school in the field when I was about 25 years old. A Marxist friend of mine talked me out of it. But I stayed interested and started looking around for someone whose work was interesting. One academic told me that the clear rising star in the field was Adam Grant. He had been at the University of North Carolina, and when he announced he was leaving for Wharton, the governor of North Carolina called him to try to persuade him to stay. That piqued my interest. 
 And what made Grant such a standout? 
That he had been given tenure at Wharton so early (at 30), that he had been so productive, won so many awards and done work that was influential in organizational psychology. His early study of call centers really established him because he showed that connecting workers to the beneficiaries of their work - in that case, scholarship students who benefited from the fund-raising phone calls - dramatically increased their productivity.
 So, what's the Marxist downside to studying organizational psychology? 
I remember my friend saying something like this: you want to go to school to learn how to psychologically manipulate people so that they'll make more money for their corporate employers? At 25, that stopped me in my tracks, but I see it with more nuance now.
 Does the potential for manipulation disturb Grant? 
In some of his papers, he does talk about the concern that companies might exploit people's naturally altruistic impulses to extract more out of them. But he also believes employees are not so naïve that they would not see through conscious efforts like that.

 Might his research also apply to our personal lives? 
People in healthy personal relationships do act more as what he calls "givers," and he's encouraging people to bring that into the workplace.
 Your own efforts to become a giver seemed somewhat fraught, and you are not alone in that. How realistic is his generous model for the rest of us mortals? 
I do think seeing the world through what he calls a prosocial lens can make most kinds of work more pleasant, at a minimum. I see a weekly memo at my office that for various reasons can make me a bit anxious; when I started approaching it as an opportunity to see if I could help move along whatever came up on that memo, it changed, for the better, the whole experience of it. On the flip side, I do struggle with staying on top of the "can you put me in touch" e-mails that a lot of people in publishing and in other fields receive. Adam is unusually motivated to help, but in truth, he is also wildly organized, which makes that kind of thing that much easier for him.
 It's not a pure "give," though, because sometimes it's a "take" from the person you are putting them in touch with, right? 
Of course. Because I was reading Adam Grant's book and spending time with him, over a period of several months I became much more self-conscious about trying to connect people. A few times, I did feel as if my effort to help turned out to be an imposition on someone else; but I was surprised by how often it turned out to be useful to both sides. And that's the perfect Adam Grant scenario: when you are just a conduit between two people who do need to connect and are grateful to have found each other. It's very satisfying. Of course, there are limits.
 But is this altruistic behavior just another way of networking, with a bigger network? 
Yes, in that someone else now has a sense of you as someone who is helpful and that you are not just in it for yourself - and if you ever do have a favor to ask of that person, that someone may be more inclined to help. Adam makes the point that you can't be doing it for that reason, of course - I'm not sure what mysterious voodoo will come back and punish you if you are giving with the long game in mind. But he probably just means that people can read others' motivations very well.
 But that's when his work starts to sound like spiritual doctrine rather than economic insight. 
There were times when I was reading his book that I felt uncomfortable with the assurances that the more you give away financially to charities the more will redound to you because you will be happier and thus more successful and thus wealthier. I'm sure it's all based in studies but it does start to have this almost Suzy Orman-esque karmic feeling.
 Grant has pledged to introduce any of his students to any of his contacts. What does he do when a student is not so great? 
He did say that his students were excellent in general, but that he would coach a student in how they might improve if he had concerns. A big part of his book is about the power of seeing the potential in everyone. He cites a fascinating study in which teachers were told ahead of time which students were expected to be strong; over time, those students did turn out to be strong, even though they had been chosen at random. The point is that when people expect greatness, they elicit it. I heard him describe his students constantly, to them and to others, in incredibly positive terms. He really is very generous in the way that he characterizes people and their motivations.

HEADLINE: A Child Star With a Knack for Publicity

BYLINE: N. R. KLEINFIELD


HIGHLIGHT: It was sad but not entirely surprising when word came on Sunday of the passing of Pattycake, the Bronx Zoo gorilla who had long reigned as one of the city&#8217;s more acclaimed tourist attractions. 

 BODY:
There were problems with her heart that weren't getting better. She weighed 320 pounds. One can only imagine the toll taken by so many years of cloying attention, all the beguiled admirers staring and cooing and craning to get close to her. The press was always sniffing around for new angles. Of course, there was her age.
Forty sounds painfully young - but, then, she was a gorilla. Once you're past 37, you need to consider putting your affairs in order.
And so it was sad but not entirely surprising when word came on Sunday of the passing of Pattycake, the Bronx Zoo gorilla who had long reigned as one of the city's more acclaimed tourist attractions. Jim Breheny, the zoo's director, said she had been discovered around 8 a.m. by a worker in the zoo's Congo Gorilla Forest. Apparently, she went peacefully, in her sleep. Even at 40, her looks were still pretty much intact. 
For a gorilla, she had had quite a life. "She was a story that captivated people," Mr. Breheny said.
She earned a superstar's distinction and heaps of publicity right at birth, on Sept. 3, 1972, being that she was the first gorilla born in New York City, as opposed to, say, Cameroon or Gabon or Equatorial Guinea. It was an excellent Manhattan address - the Central Park Zoo. Her furry face served as a bit of a respite at a time when the city found itself grappling with high crime rates and an intensifying financial crisis. 
Another gorilla, Hodari, was born just a month later at the Bronx Zoo, and he never got the press she did. 
In every sense, Pattycake's arrival was a surprise. Zoo workers had been unaware that Lulu, her mother, was even pregnant until one day she matter-of-factly produced a bundle of dark fur. Back then, it was still relatively rare for gorillas to give birth in captivity.
Gorilla babies were typically raised by humans. But Pattycake, a western lowland gorilla, a species classified as "critically endangered," lived with Lulu and her father, Kongo. The housing wasn't ideal; the gorillas shared the Lion House.
Stardom enveloped her at once. The Daily News conducted a contest to name her, attracting an estimated 33,000 entries. Zoo attendance soared.
One devotee remembered that "seeing her was like seeing a movie star."
Adrian Savonije, 45, who was touring the zoo on Monday with his children, said he had visited Pattycake since he was a child. "I grew up with her," he said. "She was a big attraction here, a little mini New York landmark."
There were initial concerns about her mother's ability to raise her, Lulu being just 8, and caged, but things seemed to work out. When Pattycake was 6 months old, though, there was a frightening accident. She was squatting with her right arm slung through the bars separating the cage she occupied with Lulu and the neighboring cage of Kongo, who sometimes got a bit rough. Kongo playfully grabbed her arm. Either out of parental rivalry or mere playfulness, her mother scooped her up, inadvertently fracturing Pattycake's right humerus.
It became one of the best-known broken arms in history. The public hung on every ensuing development.
There was an hourlong operation at New York Medical College. The arm was put in a cast, and later in a sling. She was moved to the far larger Bronx Zoo to recuperate. She slept on a cot, was fed infant formula in a bottle and wore a vest, and cloth nappies.
While Pattycake was convalescing, a full-fledged, two-borough custody battle erupted between the two zoos. The Bronx Zoo found her to be undernourished and said she had intestinal parasites. Her mother, the zoo believed, just wasn't doing her job.
To resolve the custody fight, a referee was brought in: Dr. Ronald D. Nadler, a specialist well-versed in gorilla reproduction from the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta. While Lulu might not have qualified as gorilla mother of the year, he concluded, she was more than up to the task of providing Pattycake with the best chance of developing "the normal repertoire of a gorilla."
Three months after the accident, Pattycake returned to the Central Park Zoo. There was a well-chronicled reunion with her parents, with conspicuous emotion on display all around. On Pattycake's first birthday, her parents celebrated with her, and a banana layer birthday cake. Birthday cards funneled in from as far away as California. During the party, more cake found its way into Pattycake's fur than into her mouth. It was reported that her father behaved like a "caged beast."
Her parents saw her through adolescence, but then in 1983, when the Central Park Zoo was undergoing renovation, she was moved permanently to the Bronx Zoo.
Such was her fame that two books were written about her: "Gorilla Baby: The Story of Pattycake" and "Gentle Gorilla: The Story of Pattycake."
Innumerable children became smitten with the gorilla, and later transferred that allegiance to their own children. John Bulger, 49, first saw her as a child. As a parent, he takes his son, John Jr., to the zoo twice a month, and they had always checked in on Pattycake. "There's no better day to spend as a child," he said.
She was a robust, big-boned female, so much so that those unacquainted with her often mistook her for a male - suspicions they no doubt realized were best kept to themselves. Pattycake lived with 18 other gorillas, and volunteers said that she gave the younger ones piggyback rides and assumed a clear matriarchal role.
"She was the boss," said Christine Ortman, who has spent countless hours visiting the gorillas. "We always called it Pattycake's troop."
Her afflictions - the heart issues and worsening arthritis - had slowed her. Zookeepers were advised to say goodbye to her last month, said Kate Brown, a longtime zoo volunteer, but Pattycake held on.
Zoo workers said that one gorilla, named Bweroni (workers called her Fran), had been crying and howling since Pattycake's death.
According to the Wildlife Conservation Society, which operates the Bronx Zoo, Pattycake was the 31st oldest of the 338 gorillas kept in North American zoos. The median life expectancy for female gorillas in zoos is 37.
Pattycake (her name had also been spelled Patty Cake, but it lost the space over the years) managed to give birth to 10 babies with four mates, including a pair of twins born in 1995. She raised only 1 of the 10 on her own; one died four days after birth. The others now reside in zoos around the country, including in Omaha, Buffalo, Detroit and Louisville. She had 10 half-siblings, their whereabouts unknown. She is also survived by at least one grandchild.
A necropsy attributed her death to heart disease. The zoo said she will probably be cremated later this week. No funeral service is planned.
 Vivian Yee contributed reporting. 
If you have remembrances or stories about Pattycake, please share them in the comments box below.
An earlier version of this post rendered incorrectly the name of the gorilla who died at the Bronx Zoo. Her name was Pattycake, not Patty Cake. Although her name was previously written many times as two words, the Wildlife Conservation Society says one word is correct.
An earlier version of a photo caption misstated the sex of Pattycake. The gorilla was a female.
An earlier version of a photo caption misstated the name of a hospital where Pattycake was treated for a broken arm. It was Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital, not Flower Fourth Avenue Hospital.
An article on Tuesday about the death of Pattycake, the first gorilla born in New York City, misstated the relevance of the age 37 for gorillas. That age is the median life expectancy for female gorillas in North American zoos, not the median age of gorillas in North American zoos.

Despite a particularly fruitful week in February - when five deals collectively worth more than $91 billion were announced - the business of mergers and acquisitions remains largely stuck in the doldrums.
Only 8,115 deals were announced worldwide in the first quarter of this year, the lowest number since 2003, according to data from Thomson Reuters. And while the combined value of $542.8 billion outpaced last year's first quarter by about 10 percent, it is still 26 percent below the level for the period in 2011. 
 Bankers and lawyers have been publicly boasting about a nascent revival in mergers. In March, 97 percent of deal makers surveyed by the Brunswick Group public relations firm said they expected more deals to be announced in North America this year than in last.
But privately, many have conceded that for all of the improvements in the economy and corporate profits, executives still lack the confidence to sign for a big deal.
"The M.& A. market remains uneven," said Scott Lindsay, the global head of mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse. "There's a little bit of everything going on right now. But you would think there would be more activity than there is."
Still, as market indexes like the Dow Jones industrial average set highs, the number of mergers - which historically tracks closely with stock prices - should rise as well, he added. And many advisers caution against judging 2013 by one quarter. Some deals that would otherwise have been announced in the first quarter were moved to fourth quarter 2012 to avoid incurring potentially higher taxes, they said.
By some measures, the merger environment has continued to improve steadily. In the United States, the growth in activity nearly single-handedly lifted overall deal volume, with major deals like Dell's planned sale to its founder and H. J. Heinz's takeover by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital. The value of transactions announced in the United States for the first quarter jumped nearly 89 percent from a year ago, to $269.8 billion. Other areas of the world have lagged behind, none more so than Europe. The Continent had just 2,705 deals, worth a total of $125.7 billion, in the quarter, down significantly from the period last year.
Bankers and lawyers regularly recite the litany of factors that should lead to a wellspring of deals: an improving economy; soaring stock markets; and record low interest rates, courtesy of the Federal Reserve, that make borrowing incredibly cheap. But other factors have weighed on executives' confidence, including concerns about how events like the bailout of Cyprus may affect the European economy and how America's budget problems might hamper its growth.
Some bankers and lawyers indicate that companies may finally be ready to look beyond the short-term crises, and focus on their specific needs for the long term. "A couple of years ago, something like Greece brought the M.& A. market to a halt," said Sarkis Jebejian, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis. "I think the trend now is to ask, 'Does this affect my deal?' "
In the first quarter, Goldman Sachs narrowly edged out JPMorgan Chase for the lead in Thomson Reuters's financial league tables, having advised on 83 deals worth a total of $135.9 billion. Goldman's transactions include advising Dell Inc. in its proposed takeover by Michael S. Dell and Virgin Media in its sale to Liberty Global.
Davis Polk & Wardwell claimed the top spot in the legal adviser rankings, having advised on 33 deals worth a total of nearly $109 billion. The firm's biggest assignment this year was advising Comcast in buying full control of NBCUniversal from General Electric.

HEADLINE: American Airlines Settles Suit Against Orbitz

 BODY:
FORT WORTH (AP) -- American Airlines said Monday that it had settled lawsuits with the online travel agency Orbitz over the agency's display of information about American flights and fares. 
The companies did not disclose terms, and they declined to comment beyond a brief news release.
The settlement is subject to review by the federal judge overseeing the bankruptcy reorganization of American and its parent, AMR Corporation, which is based here.
American has been fighting with Orbitz Worldwide and other companies that distribute information to travel agents. American says it can better tailor offers to customers if it provides flight and price information directly to travel agents.
Distribution companies contend that American wants to push them aside and reduce competition for selling airline travel.
As the dispute escalated in 2011, American flights disappeared briefly from listings on Orbitz and Expedia
American had filed suit in Federal District Court here, accusing Orbitz, which is based in Chicago, and its largest shareholder, Travelport, of violating antitrust laws. In November 2011, a judge dismissed some of American's claims but let the suit proceed.
American settled with Travelport last month, allowing Travelport subsidiaries to sell American Airlines upgrades such as premium seating in economy class.
Last year American said it had received an undisclosed amount of cash to settle with another distribution company, Sabre Holdings, after a jury trial had begun in Texas state court.

HEADLINE: Early Deaths Linked to China's Air Pollution Totaled 1.2 Million in 2010, Data Shows

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Outdoor air pollution contributed to 1.2 million premature deaths in China in 2010, nearly 40 percent of the global total, according to a new summary of data from a scientific study on leading causes of death worldwide.
Figured another way, the researchers said, China's toll from pollution was the loss of 25 million healthy years of life from the population. 
The data on which the analysis is based was first presented in the ambitious 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study, which was published in December in The Lancet, a British medical journal. The authors decided to break out numbers for specific countries and present the findings at international conferences. The China statistics were offered at a forum in Beijing on Sunday.
''We have been rolling out the India- and China-specific numbers, as they speak more directly to national leaders than regional numbers,'' said Robert O'Keefe, the vice president of the Health Effects Institute, a research organization that is helping to present the study. The organization is partly financed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the global motor vehicle industry.
What the researchers called ''ambient particulate matter pollution'' was the fourth-leading risk factor for deaths in China in 2010, behind dietary risks, high blood pressure and smoking. Air pollution ranked seventh on the worldwide list of risk factors, contributing to 3.2 million deaths in 2010.
By comparison with China, India, which also has densely populated cities grappling with similar levels of pollution, had 620,000 premature deaths in 2010 because of outdoor air pollution, the study found. That was deemed to be the sixth most common killer in South Asia.
The study was led by an institute at the University of Washington and several partner universities and institutions, including the World Health Organization.
Calculations of premature deaths because of outdoor air pollution are politically threatening in the eyes of some Chinese officials. According to news reports, Chinese officials cut out sections of a 2007 report called ''Cost of Pollution in China'' that discussed premature deaths. The report's authors had concluded that 350,000 to 400,000 people die prematurely in China each year because of outdoor air pollution. The study was done by the World Bank in cooperation with the Chinese State Environmental Protection Administration, the precursor to the Ministry of Environmental Protection.
There have been other estimates of premature deaths because of air pollution. In 2011, the World Health Organization estimated that there were 1.3 million premature deaths in cities worldwide because of outdoor air pollution.
Last month, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, based in Paris, warned that ''urban air pollution is set to become the top environmental cause of mortality worldwide by 2050, ahead of dirty water and lack of sanitation.'' It estimated that up to 3.6 million people could end up dying prematurely from air pollution each year, mostly in China and India.
There has been growing outrage in Chinese cities over what many say are untenable levels of air pollution. Cities across the north hit record levels in January, and official Chinese newspapers ran front-page articles on the surge -- what some foreigners call the ''airpocalypse'' -- despite earlier limits on such discussion by propaganda officials.
In February, the State Council, China's cabinet, announced a timeline for introducing new fuel standards, but state-owned oil and power companies are known to block or ignore environmental policies to save on costs.
A study released on Thursday said the growth rate of disclosure of pollution information in 113 Chinese cities had slowed. The groups doing the study, the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, based in Beijing, and the Natural Resources Defense Council, based in Washington, said that ''faced with the current situation of severe air, water and soil pollution, we must make changes to pollution source information disclosure so that information is no longer patchy, out of date and difficult to obtain.''
Chinese officials have made some progress in disclosing crucial air pollution statistics. Official news reports have said 74 cities are now required to release data on levels of particulate matter 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller, which penetrate the body's tissues most deeply. For years, Chinese officials had been collecting the data but refusing to release it, until they came under pressure from Chinese who saw that the United States Embassy in Beijing was measuring the levels hourly and posting the data in a Twitter feed, @BeijingAir.
Last week, an official Chinese news report said the cost of environmental degradation in China was about $230 billion in 2010, or 3.5 percent of the gross domestic product. The estimate, said to be partial, came from a research institute under the Ministry of Environmental Protection, and was three times the amount in 2004, in local currency terms. It was unclear to what extent those numbers took into account the costs of health care and premature deaths because of pollution.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing's Mirage

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
These are good times for Libbey, a 125-year-old American glassmaker that nearly went bankrupt four years ago. The company's shares have risen to almost $20 from below $1, sales of its tableware are at a record high, and its energy-intensive factories saved more than $5 million in 2012 as natural gas prices fell.
Despite all the upbeat news, however, Libbey recently announced it would lay off 200 workers at its plant in Shreveport, La., and move some production to Mexico as it cuts costs and discontinues several products.
Libbey's decision is just one example of why manufacturing, for all its renewed promise, is likely to fall far short of the claims by industry groups that millions of new factory jobs are about to be created in the United States because of the unlocking of abundant supplies of domestic energy. 
''Even though the U.S. is more competitive globally, manufacturing doesn't give you the kind of direct job creation it did in years past,'' said Joseph G. Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein, a Wall Street investment firm. ''At the end of the day you still want a strong manufacturing base, but there aren't as many people on the factory floor.''
Indeed, while the sector has added 500,000 jobs since the recession ended and the value of what the nation's factories churn out is close to a high, there are nonetheless two million fewer manufacturing workers today than in 2007. Ever since the early 1960s, the share of jobs in manufacturing has been on a nearly uninterrupted downward slope, now accounting for less than 9 percent of all employment in the United States.
The dream that a reinvigorated manufacturing sector will restore prosperity to the middle class and bring back millions of well-paying blue-collar jobs has made for some unlikely political bedfellows recently.
Even as heavy industry has garnered strong support from the White House -- in his State of the Union address in February, President Obama proposed financing 15 new centers for manufacturing innovation -- a number of lobbying groups have been promising that more drilling for natural gas will lead to a jobs boom in dozens of industries that would benefit from cheaper energy. They argue that if additional land is opened for exploration, especially shale formations where hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, can increase production, millions of manufacturing jobs that migrated overseas will return to the United States.
Fracking's environmental impact has made it a flash point for activists, but the promised job gains, other than in the petrochemical industry, have been slow to materialize.
''It's not going to happen as fast as a lot of people think and it will be selective,'' said Stephen T. Maurer, who heads the manufacturing practice at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. The sector may not be hemorrhaging jobs as in recent years, he said, ''but it's going to be a long, slow climb back.''
For all the caution of experts like Mr. Maurer and Mr. Carson, industries that benefit from cheaper gas have not been shy about talking up the coming manufacturing jobs bonanza they foresee. A December 2011 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Association of Manufacturers predicts fracking could help add one million manufacturing jobs in the United States by 2025.
''It definitely is a game changer for the United States,'' said Chad Moutray, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. ''It puts us in a position that we might not have been in a couple of years ago.''
A May 2012 study by the American Chemistry Council, which represents the chemicals industry, estimated that increased gas production could create 200,000 jobs in the broader manufacturing sector, including several thousand in the glass industry. ''It's resulting in a renaissance in manufacturing,'' said Kevin Swift, the chemical council's chief economist.
But glass industry veterans say cheaper natural gas, which is used to melt sand into glass and is critical to the manufacturing process, isn't a game changer in terms of jobs, however beneficial the cost savings are. Pressure from inexpensive imports remains intense, and labor in Mexico and China is still cheaper than in the United States.
While demand for their products is improving thanks to a more robust housing market and other factors, don't expect a ramp up in hiring, said Richard A. Beuke, vice president for flat glass at PPG Industries, a Pittsburgh-based glassmaker.
The production lines run 24 hours a day, seven days a week at PPG's plants, including one in Carlisle, Pa., that makes flat glass. It's among the plants benefiting from a rebound in housing.
''Because it is automated, we won't have to add a lot of employees with the upturn in the construction industry,'' Mr. Beuke said. ''You don't touch a piece of glass in our factories.'' At PPG, production is up 10 percent since the recession -- but employment remains flat.
Glass isn't the only manufacturing sector that has struggled to add jobs recently. Other industries identified by American Chemistry Council as potential winners from the energy boom, like paper producers and foundries, have continued to lose jobs in recent months.
It's not that manufacturing itself is disappearing. But nearly all of the American manufacturers that survived the lean years of the last decade are globally competitive companies that depend on high productivity and advanced technology for their success more than masses of assembly line workers.
''There is this incredibly powerful long-run trend of declining employment in manufacturing,'' said Robert Z. Lawrence, a professor of economics at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. ''It's the same story as in food and farming. We're producing more food with many fewer workers. The only way we compete with our higher wages is by being more innovative.''
Still, it's clear why the jobs at Libbey are ones the White House wants to see more of in the United States, not less.
Salaries for union workers top out at nearly $22 an hour, providing a middle-class wage in an area where workers without a college degree typically earn half that much.
But while Libbey's Shreveport plant is close to some of the most abundant gas supplies in the country, it's ultimately more efficient to run six production lines off one furnace instead of four each on two furnaces, with 200 fewer workers.
Libbey officials declined to be interviewed. In a statement, the company said it has ''right-sized its Shreveport plant to be more focused, flexible and run more efficiently with improved asset utilization.''
On the ground, that means saving well over $5 million a year, said David Broussard, who represents the workers in Shreveport for the United Steelworkers union.
Mr. Broussard says he can't argue with the logic of saving that money and moving some production of beer mugs and other glassware to factories in Monterrey, Mexico, and Toledo, Ohio.
''They're a decent company to do business with and this is a pretty docile union,'' said Mr. Broussard. ''It was a business decision. I'm never O.K. with losing members but when you understand the dynamics behind it, it's tough to disagree with.''
Even boosters of natural gas development concede that the benefits they foresee won't translate into a jobs boom in some parts of the manufacturing sector.
''There are industries you may never see come back to prerecession levels,'' said John Larson, a consultant with IHS Global Insight who helped produce a study for America's Natural Gas Alliance in 2011 that estimated the shale gas industry could eventually create 1.6 million jobs in the coming decades.
''Jobs are not the only measure,'' he said. ''It's also about how productive American workers are.''

HEADLINE: Staying H.I.V.-Free for $288

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
A new study suggests that most young gay men in Mexico City would pledge to stay H.I.V.-free, attend a monthly safe-sex talk and take regular H.I.V. tests to prove they were uninfected -- all in return for just $288 a year. 
Most male prostitutes would make the same promise for $156 a year, the study found.
Because each person receiving H.I.V. treatment costs Mexico's public health system up to $7,000 a year for drugs alone, payments that encourage men to stay uninfected could be a bargain, the authors argue.
The study, done by researchers from Brown University, the University of California at Berkeley and Mexico's national public health institute, was published online by The European Journal of Health Economics.
Although other countries have tried programs that pay people for good health behavior, like taking children for checkups, the authors believe their study was the first to pinpoint a specific dollar value that would ensure cooperation from 70 percent of a risk group -- in this case, young gay and bisexual men, who have very high H.I.V. infection rates and are the drivers of Mexico's epidemic.
The researchers approached men aged 18 to 25 in gay bars, discos and the streets of the city's red-light district. The 40-minute survey, taken on cellphone-size computers, increased or decreased the amount each man was offered until 70 percent answered yes.
When it comes to staying H.I.V.-free, prostitutes have to make difficult decisions, said the lead author, Omar Galárraga, a health economist at Brown. They are often desperate for cash, and they can charge more for sex without a condom.
''But also, they know they are high-risk, so it's good for them to have checkups,'' he said. ''If you're a man who has sex with men in Mexico City, you're lucky if you are tested every two years, if at all.''
Although he has not surveyed gay men or prostitutes in the United States to determine how much cash would be tempting, Dr. Galárraga said the cost-benefit ratio could, in theory, be greater in the United States because drugs and hospital care are far more expensive.
However, he noted two important differences. Prostitution is not illegal in Mexico, but it is in the United States, which could hamper recruitment. Also, 9 percent of the survey takers said they would not participate at any price, and they tended to be wealthier and better educated -- that is, more resembling Americans.

HEADLINE: A Slice of London So Exclusive Even the Owners Are Visitors

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
LONDON -- An odd thing was happening, or rather not happening, as dusk fell the other day across Belgravia, home to some of the world's most valuable real estate: almost no one seemed to be coming home. Perhaps half the windows were dark.
It seems that practically the only people who can afford to live there don't actually want to. Last year, the real estate firm Savills found that at least 37 percent of people buying property in the most expensive neighborhoods of central London did not intend them to be primary residences.
''Belgravia is becoming a village with fewer and fewer people in it,'' said Alistair Boscawen, a local real estate agent. He works in ''the nuts area'' of London, as he put it, ''where the house prices are bonkers'' -- anywhere from $7.5 million to $75 million, he said.
The buyers, increasingly, are superwealthy foreigners from places like Russia, Kazakhstan, Southeast Asia and India. For them, London is just a stop in a peripatetic international existence that might also include New York, Moscow and Monaco. 
Along Elizabeth Street, home to a Poilâne bakery outlet and tony boutiques, foot traffic the other day was very slow. A Belgravia resident from Colombia, who was shopping at a pet store where dog beds go for $358 and cat blankets for $289, said that there were two English people along her street, and that it was hard to tell whether many of her neighbors were there or not there.
''French, American, Petra Ecclestone'' -- that would be the daughter of the Formula One impresario Bernie Ecclestone -- ''and Russians,'' said the resident, considering those closest to her. She asked that her name not be used because, she said, she was scared of the Russians on the corner.
London is not the only city where the world's richest people leave their expensive properties vacant while they stay in their expensive properties someplace else; the same is true in parts of Manhattan. But the difference is that so many of them here are foreign, and that they look to be buying up entire neighborhoods.
''Many areas of central London have become prohibitively expensive for local residents,'' a recent report by the Smith Institute, a research group in London, said recently.
Paul Dimoldenberg, leader of the Labour opposition in Westminster Council, said the situation had reached a ''tipping point'' and was starting to concern lawmakers.
''Some of the richest people in the world are buying property here as an investment,'' he said. ''They may live here for a fortnight in the summer, but for the rest of the year they're contributing nothing to the local economy. The specter of new buildings where there are no lights on is a real problem.''
In its report, Savills found that in 2011-12, 34 percent of people buying residential properties in the resale market in prime areas of London -- places like Kensington, Chelsea and Mayfair as well as Belgravia -- were from overseas, up from 24 percent in pre-crisis 2007. In the most exclusive spots, foreigners accounted for 59 percent of the sales.
This has made parts of London more international, more expensive and more empty. The salesclerk at a Belgravia clothing boutique, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because she did not want to get in trouble, said that at some times of the year the area was virtually abandoned. ''We'll shut for the whole of August,'' she said.
Many foreign purchasers are buying to rent, said Naomi Heaton, chief executive of London Central Portfolio, which represents high-end buyers. ''There is a definite concern about 'lights out London,' '' she said, ''but the reality is that half of what is bought is bought for rental.''
But not at the top end, said Yolande Barnes of Savills.
''The very wealthy won't rent their houses out. Why would they?'' she asked rhetorically. ''It's more like buying their own private hotel, really -- an alternative to living in a suite at the Dorchester.''
Meanwhile, prices are rising beyond expectation. For single-family housing in the prime areas of London, British buyers spend an average of $2.25 million, Ms. Barnes said, while foreign buyers spend an average of $3.75 million, which increases to $7.5 million if they are from Russia or the Middle East.
Of newly developed properties in what are considered ''ultraprime'' apartment complexes, those offering hotel-style amenities and apartments priced at more than $7.5 million, 78 percent of purchases last year were made by foreigners, the report said. Brokers are marketing new properties abroad in places like Hong Kong and Singapore even before advertising in Britain, as they did for Cornwall Terrace, a development at the edge of Regent's Park where houses are priced at $45 million to $87 million.
The most visible, and also the most notorious, of the new developments is One Hyde Park, a $1.7 billion apartment building of stratospheric opulence on a prime corner in Knightsbridge, near Harvey Nichols, the park and the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, which functions as a 24-hour concierge service for residents. Apartments there have been purchased mostly by foreign buyers who hide their identities behind murky offshore companies registered to tax havens like the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands.
It is rare to see anyone coming to or going from the complex, and British newspapers have been trying since it opened two years ago to discover who lives there. Vanity Fair reported recently that as far as it could discern after a long trawl through records, the owners seem to include a cast of characters who might have come from a poker game in a James Bond movie: a Russian property magnate, a Nigerian telecommunications tycoon, the richest man in Ukraine, a Kazakh copper billionaire, someone who may or may not be a Kazkh singer and the head of finance for the emirate of Sharjah.
One resident, Rinat Akhmetov, the Ukrainian, paid $204 million for two penthouse apartments that he combined into one, at a reported additional cost of some $90 million.
According to The Sunday Times of London, only 17 of 76 apartments, which have been sold for a total of $4 billion, are registered as primary residences, which means that the owners pay only negligible ''second home'' taxes of a few thousand dollars a year. Mr. Dimoldenberg called the building ''London's Mary Celeste'' and said it ''contributes nothing to local businesses or London's economy.''
London's housing market is at odds with that in the rest of the country, floundering since the 2008 crisis and now hit by a new wave of austerity-driven budget cuts. While housing prices outside the city fell by 10 percent in the last five years, inside London they increased by 21 percent. In Mayfair alone, they rose by 30 percent. A house in Chester Square that sold for $2.4 million as a long-term lease in 1987, Mr. Boscawen said, sold last year, as an outright purchase, for $48 million.
An American who lived for 20 years in a multimillion-dollar apartment in Belgrave Place, and who did not want her name used for fear of alienating her old neighbors, said the quiet could become oppressive.
Most of her neighbors seemed to be away most of the time, and she never met any of them. ''So I was kind of excited when a Russian family moved in across the street,'' she said. ''I put a welcoming note through their letterbox, introducing myself.''
The neighbors invited her to their Christmas party, where she ate caviar, drank vodka and listened to Russian classical music. ''I tried to meet people, but they didn't speak much English,'' she continued. ''Anyway, that was the last I saw of my neighbors. I think they spend most of their time in Palm Beach.''

HEADLINE: Major Indexes Decline as Growth in Manufacturing Slows

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market got off to a slow start in April, edging lower on Monday after a week when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eclipsed its nominal high.
The main catalyst was slowing growth in manufacturing last month. The decline in the Institute for Supply Management's benchmark manufacturing index for March was worse than economists had forecast. Stocks started falling shortly after the report was released at 10 a.m. and stayed lower the rest of the day.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 5.69 points, or 0.04 percent, at 14,572.85. The S.& P. 500 dropped 7.02 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,562.17. 
Industrial companies fell 1 percent, the most in the S.& P. 500. Caterpillar, which makes construction and mining equipment, declined $1.33, or 1.5 percent, to $85.64, and 3M, which makes Post-it notes, industrial products and construction materials, fell 66 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $105.65.
Investors have raised their expectations for the American economy as the market has climbed this year, said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade. The Dow is up 11.2 percent in 2013; the S.& P., 9.5 percent.
''The numbers have to be outstanding in order to drive the market higher,'' Mr. Kinahan said. ''It's a different mind-set when we're at these levels.''
The S.& P. 500 ended the first quarter at a high of 1,569.19, surpassing its previous record close of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2007. The index has recaptured all of its losses from the financial crisis and recession. The Dow broke its high, also set in 2007, on March 5.
The market has risen this year because of optimism that housing is recovering and that employers are starting to hire again. Strong company earnings and continuing stimulus from the Federal Reserve have also increased demand for stocks.
Small stocks fared worse than large ones Monday. The Russell 2000 index, a benchmark of small-company stocks, fell 1.3 percent to 938.78, paring its gain for the year to 10.5 percent. It was the index's biggest decline in more than a month. The Nasdaq composite index fell 28.35 points, or 0.9 percent, to 3,239.17.
April is historically the second-strongest month for stocks, behind December, Deutsche Bank analysts said in a report released Monday. The S.& P. 500 has gained an average of 1.4 percent in April, based on returns since 1960.
The last meaningful setback for stocks started before the elections last November. The market slid 6 percent from Oct. 1 through Nov. 15 before the vote and immediately afterward over concerns that Congress and the administration would be unable to enact measures to continue economic growth.
Evidence that growth was continuing, despite political discord in Washington, has kept stocks on an upward trajectory since then, leaving investors waiting for dips to add to their holdings.
''I'd love to have some sort of a pullback here because I'd think it's an opportunity,'' said Scott Wren, an equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors. ''But it doesn't feel like we're going to have one in the near term.''
Among the stocks on the move, Tesla Motors, the electric car company, rose $6.04, or 16 percent, to $43.93 after it said Sunday night that first-quarter sales have exceeded 4,750 Model S sedans, above its previous forecast of 4,500.
DFC Global, a finance company that lends to consumers who lack bank accounts, fell $3.60, or 22 percent, to $13.04 after slashing its earnings estimate for its fiscal year because of loan defaults in its business in Britain.
American Greetings rose $1.95, or 12 percent, to $18.05 after the company agreed to be taken private for about $602 million by a group led by some of its top executives.
In the bond market, interest rates eased slightly. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 5/32, to 101 16/32, while its yield slipped to 1.84 percent, from 1.85 percent late Thursday. (The bond and stock markets were closed Friday in observance of Good Friday.)

HEADLINE: Mergers Slowed to a Snail's Pace in the Quarter, the Fewest Since 2003

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
Deal makers may want to keep the Champagne bottles on ice a while longer.
Despite a particularly fruitful week in February -- when five deals collectively worth more than $91 billion were announced -- the business of mergers and acquisitions remains largely stuck in the doldrums.
Only 8,115 deals were announced worldwide in the first quarter of this year, the lowest number since 2003, according to data from Thomson Reuters. And while the combined value of $542.8 billion outpaced last year's first quarter by about 10 percent, it is still 26 percent below the level for the period in 2011. 
Bankers and lawyers have been publicly boasting about a nascent revival in mergers. In March, 97 percent of deal makers surveyed by the Brunswick Group public relations firm said they expected more deals to be announced in North America this year than in last.
But privately, many have conceded that for all of the improvements in the economy and corporate profits, executives still lack the confidence to sign for a big deal.
''The M.& A. market remains uneven,'' said Scott Lindsay, the global head of mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse. ''There's a little bit of everything going on right now. But you would think there would be more activity than there is.''
Still, as market indexes like the Dow Jones industrial average set highs, the number of mergers -- which historically tracks closely with stock prices -- should rise as well, he added. And many advisers caution against judging 2013 by one quarter. Some deals that would otherwise have been announced in the first quarter were moved to fourth quarter 2012 to avoid incurring potentially higher taxes, they said.
By some measures, the merger environment has continued to improve steadily. In the United States, the growth in activity nearly single-handedly lifted overall deal volume, with major deals like Dell's planned sale to its founder and H. J. Heinz's takeover by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital. The value of transactions announced in the United States for the first quarter jumped nearly 89 percent from a year ago, to $269.8 billion. Other areas of the world have lagged behind, none more so than Europe. The Continent had just 2,705 deals, worth a total of $125.7 billion, in the quarter, down significantly from the period last year.
Bankers and lawyers regularly recite the litany of factors that should lead to a wellspring of deals: an improving economy; soaring stock markets; and record low interest rates, courtesy of the Federal Reserve, that make borrowing incredibly cheap. But other factors have weighed on executives' confidence, including concerns about how events like the bailout of Cyprus may affect the European economy and how America's budget problems might hamper its growth.
Some bankers and lawyers indicate that companies may finally be ready to look beyond the short-term crises, and focus on their specific needs for the long term. ''A couple of years ago, something like Greece brought the M.& A. market to a halt,'' said Sarkis Jebejian, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis. ''I think the trend now is to ask, 'Does this affect my deal?' ''
In the first quarter, Goldman Sachs narrowly edged out JPMorgan Chase for the lead in Thomson Reuters's financial league tables, having advised on 83 deals worth a total of $135.9 billion. Goldman's transactions include advising Dell Inc. in its proposed takeover by Michael S. Dell and Virgin Media in its sale to Liberty Global.
Davis Polk & Wardwell claimed the top spot in the legal adviser rankings, having advised on 33 deals worth a total of nearly $109 billion. The firm's biggest assignment this year was advising Comcast in buying full control of NBCUniversal from General Electric.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Criticism of Cuomo Over Plight of Cities Raises Syracuse Mayor's Profile

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
SYRACUSE -- Stephanie A. Miner, the mayor of Syracuse, boarded a plane from Newark Liberty International Airport a couple of weeks ago for a quick flight to her beloved hometown. Shortly after takeoff, however, something went wrong: the cabin filled with smoke, the temperature inside the plane plunged, and a very concerned flight attendant ordered all passengers to the back of the aircraft.
The plane made a safe emergency landing, but not before Ms. Miner had a few terrifying moments to reflect on a year that has already included a few hair-raising incidents, not the least of which came when Ms. Miner, a first-term mayor in a second-tier city, publicly criticized her party's leader, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, for what she said had been insufficient assistance to the state's many struggling cities and towns. 
In the weeks since, Ms. Miner has gone from a simple position of power in Democratic ranks -- she serves as the state party's co-chairwoman, a position Mr. Cuomo picked her for -- to a more complex role: equal parts hometown hero and the de facto leader of a wider movement to advocate for suffering cities, both upstate and elsewhere. The region faces a multitude of problems: declining or stagnant population growth, faltering economies, pension and debt woes, as well as a political concern -- what Ms. Miner and others see as the inability of a series of governors to confront the situation.
''She had no interest in getting into a fight with the governor,'' said Richard Ravitch, a former lieutenant governor and a friend and mentor of Ms. Miner. ''But she found herself as the only one who was willing to say, 'Hey, let's sit down and figure out what the long-term answer is.' ''
After Mr. Cuomo said in a January speech that the answer for struggling municipalities could not be to come to the state asking for a check, Ms. Miner objected, saying that there needed to be a more comprehensive approach to helping cities. And she wrote an article published on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times on Feb. 14 that criticized the governor's proposal to allow local governments to defer a portion of their pension costs by choosing a fixed contribution rate below a higher current one. She accused the governor of avoiding reality and lacking leadership, and likened his proposal to policies ''that plunged New York City into a fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s.''
The criticism continued last month, after Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders in Albany agreed to a plan, supported by the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, that modifies an existing program that permits public employers in the short term to contribute less into pension funds, though they would be required to put money into reserve funds once deferred payments are eventually made.
Still, Ms. Miner was not impressed.
''It is another way to kick the can down the road,'' she said. ''It will have no appreciable impact on the oncoming fiscal crisis facing our cities and, in fact, will add to the crisis in the end.''
The governor and the mayor have not met since his budget was introduced in late January and Ms. Miner spoke out. But Ms. Miner has not been punished for her outspokenness; she has remained in her leadership role with the state party.
Asked about Ms. Miner's critiques, Matthew Wing, a spokesman for the governor, said only that Mr. Cuomo ''has enacted more mandate relief for local governments and schools than any administration in decades.''
Ms. Miner's rhetoric and public criticism of the governor have raised questions about her ambitions. But she says she was simply seeking to attract attention to the fiscal woes of cities like her own.
''This is not some brilliant political strategy,'' Ms. Miner said during a recent interview in her office. ''Just the contrary. This was, 'I am the mayor and I represent the people of this city and I need to make sure that their interests are heard and being represented.' ''
That Ms. Miner, 42, would clash with Mr. Cuomo has an interesting wrinkle; she cut her political teeth as a regional representative for Mr. Cuomo's father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. She later served on Syracuse's Common Council -- where she earned a pugnacious reputation, in part for clashing with fellow Democrats -- before being elected Syracuse's first female mayor in 2009. (Her mayoral portrait in City Hall is the sole color photograph on a wall of black-and-white pictures of the city's former mayors.)
Elected during a recession, Ms. Miner cut the city's work force by 10 percent. But she is still facing a substantial budget shortfall as she prepares for the city's 2013-14 fiscal year, which begins in July.
As a labor lawyer, she says she knew something about pensions before taking office, but she admits to having become alarmed by the extent of Syracuse's problems as well by bankruptcies in other cities nationwide. ''Cities are different in what causes them to go under, but the same systemic problems are there,'' she said.
One of her tutors in economic issues was Mr. Ravitch, whom Ms. Miner said she ''stalked'' for information. Mr. Ravitch said he was skeptical whether he could help. ''I said, 'You need money more than ideas, and I can't help with the former,' '' he said.
But he was impressed by Ms. Miner's persistence and honesty about the looming pension costs for cities. ''She's trying to be responsible about it,'' he said.
Kristi Andersen, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, said Ms. Miner's positions have played well in her hometown, particularly after Lt. Gov. Robert J. Duffy suggested -- shortly after Ms. Miner's initial critique -- that maybe the city should look into a financial control board as a solution to its fiscal woes.
''That was really not liked by everyone around here,'' Ms. Andersen said. ''There was a lot of rallying around the mayor.''
For her part, Ms. Miner said Mr. Cuomo was ''an effective advocate on a number of issues that impact upstate and impact New York in general,'' as well as perhaps the only figure who ''has the skill and the political capital and the ability to bring all of the vested interests around the table.''
She said she knew the governor would not be happy with her remarks.
''But you know, my job is not to do things to get a positive reaction from state leadership: My job is to represent the people of the city of Syracuse,'' she said. ''And I anticipated, and have since received, tremendous positive feedback.''
A central New York native, Ms. Miner graduated from Syracuse University before beginning to work for the elder Mr. Cuomo in the early 1990s. She is married, has no children, and keeps a busy schedule of community events. She is a runner, and a jazz and rock fan.
She is facing voters in the fall for a second term, but has often found herself on the road to discuss the issues facing cities. She was on the way back from one such conference when she boarded the flight from Newark.
And while she survived that scare, Ms. Miner said it was something of an eye-opener.
''All of the sudden,'' she said, ''it put it in all in perspective.''

HEADLINE: Low-Cost Drugs In Poor Nations Get Lift in Court

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS and KATIE THOMAS; Gardiner Harris reported from New Delhi, and Katie Thomas from New York.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- People in developing countries worldwide will continue to have access to low-cost copycat versions of drugs for diseases like H.I.V. and cancer, at least for a while.
Production of the generic drugs in India, the world's biggest provider of cheap medicines, was ensured on Monday in a ruling by the Indian Supreme Court.
The debate over global drug pricing is one of the most contentious issues between developed countries and the developing world. While poorer nations maintain they have a moral obligation to make cheaper, generic drugs available to their populations -- by limiting patents in some cases -- the brand name pharmaceutical companies contend the profits they reap are essential to their ability to develop and manufacture innovative medicines. 
Specifically, the decision allows Indian makers of generic drugs to continue making copycat versions of the drug Gleevec, which is made by Novartis. It is spelled Glivec in Europe and elsewhere. The drug provides such effective treatment for some forms of leukemia that the Food and Drug Administration approved the medicine in the United States in 2001 in record time. The ruling will also help India maintain its role as the world's most important provider of inexpensive medicines, which is critical in the global fight against deadly diseases. Gleevec, for example, can cost as much as $70,000 a year, while Indian generic versions cost about $2,500 a year.
The ruling comes at a challenging time for the pharmaceutical industry, which is increasingly looking to emerging markets to compensate for lackluster drug sales in the United States and Europe. At the same time, it is facing other challenges to its patent protections in countries like Argentina, the Philippines, Thailand and Brazil.
''I think other countries will now be looking at India and saying, 'Well, hold on a minute -- India stuck to its guns,' '' said Tahir Amin, a director of the Initiative for Medicines, Access and Knowledge, a group based in New York that works on patent cases to foster access to drugs.
In trade agreements -- including one being negotiated between the United States and countries in the Pacific Rim -- the drug industry has lobbied for stricter patent restrictions that would more closely resemble protections in the United States.
Gleevec is widely recognized as one of the most important medical discoveries in decades. In a televised interview, Ranjit Shahani, vice chairman of the Indian subsidiary of Novartis, said that companies like Novartis would invest less money in research in India as a result of the ruling. ''We hope that the ecosystem for intellectual property in the country improves,'' he said.
India exports about $10 billion worth of generic medicine every year. India and China together produce more than 80 percent of the active ingredients of all drugs used in the United States.
In Monday's decision, India's Supreme Court ruled that the patent that Novartis sought for Gleevec did not represent a true invention. The ruling is something of an anomaly. Passed under international pressure, India's 2005 patent law for the first time allowed for patents on medicines, but only for drugs discovered after 1995. In 1993, Novartis patented a version of Gleevec that it later abandoned in development, but the Indian judges ruled that the early and later versions were not different enough for the later one to merit a separate patent.
Leena Menghaney, a patient advocate at Doctors Without Borders, said that the ruling was a reprieve from more expensive medicines, but only for a while.
''The great thing about this ruling is that we don't have to worry about the drugs we're currently using,'' Ms. Menghaney said. ''But the million-dollar question is what is going to happen for new drugs that have not yet come out.''
Others decried the ruling, saying it was further evidence that India does not respect the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies. Last year, India granted what is known as a compulsory license to a generic drug manufacturer to begin making copies of Bayer's cancer drug Nexavar, and revoked Pfizer's patent for another cancer drug, Sutent. Both companies have appealed the decisions.
''It really is in our view another example of what I would characterize as a deteriorating innovation environment in India,'' said Chip Davis, the executive vice president of advocacy at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry trade group. ''The Indian government and the Indian courts have come down on the side that doesn't recognize the value of innovation and the value of strong intellectual property, which we believe is essential.''
Anand Grover, a lawyer who argued the case on behalf of Cancer Patients Aid Association in India, said the ruling confirmed that India had a very high bar for approving patents on medicines.
''What is happening in the United States is that a lot of money is being wasted on new forms of old drugs,'' Mr. Grover said. Because of Monday's ruling, ''that will not happen in India.''
In the United States, companies can get a new patent for a drug by altering its formula or changing its dosage. The companies contend that even minor improvements in medicines -- changing a pill dosage to once a day instead of twice a day -- can have a significant impact on patient wellness. But critics say a majority of drug patents given in the United States are for tiny changes that often provide patients few meaningful benefits but allow drug companies to continue charging high prices for years beyond the original patent life.
They point to AstraZeneca, for example, which extended for years its franchise around the huge-selling heartburn pill Prilosec by slightly altering the chemical structure and renaming the medicine Nexium. Amgen has won so many patents on its expensive erythropoietin-stimulating drugs that the company has maintained exclusive sales rights for 24 years, double the usual period. A result of this practice is that the United States pays the highest drug prices in the world, prices that only a tiny fraction could afford in India, where more than two-thirds of the population lives on less than $2 a day.
While advocates for the pharmaceutical industry argue that fairly liberal rules on patents spur innovation, a growing number of countries are questioning why they should pay high prices for new drugs. Argentina and the Philippines have passed laws similar to the one enacted in India, placing strict limits on patents. And Brazil and Thailand have been issuing compulsory licenses for AIDS drugs for years under multilateral agreements that allow such actions on public health grounds.
As the economies of emerging markets grow, the countries' refusal to pay higher premiums for newer drugs could significantly reduce the money needed for innovation. The drug industry makes more than a third of its sales in the United States, a dependence that many in the industry fear is unsustainable, especially since sales of prescription drugs actually dropped in the United States in 2012, according to the research firm IMS Health. Sales in emerging markets like Brazil and China are expected to account for 30 percent of global pharmaceutical spending by 2016, up from 20 percent in 2011, according to IMS Health.
The United States government has become increasingly insistent in recent years that other countries adopt far more stringent patent protection rules, with the result that poorer patients often lose access to cheap generic copies of medicines when their governments undertake trade agreements with the United States. Washington is currently negotiating the terms of a new Pacific Rim trade agreement, called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which might be completed later this year. The pharmaceutical industry has lobbied the United States to require other countries to enforce tougher patent restrictions, although the details are still being worked out.

HEADLINE: Real Estate Brokers Predict A Tough Time for Buyers

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
With inventory at near-record lows and prices inching up, all signs are pointing toward a seller's market for Manhattan real estate this spring.
The number of apartments for sale dropped 34.4 percent to 4,960 listings in the first three months of the year -- the largest year-over-year decline in 12 years, according to a report by the Douglas Elliman brokerage firm. At the same time, the number of sales went up 6.3 percent to 2,457 and prices increased across all categories, with the median sales price at $820,555, up 5.9 percent, according to the report.
With the exception of the second and third quarter of 2010, when prices were buoyed by the homeowners' tax credit, ''that is the largest year-over-year increase since Lehman fell'' in 2008, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of Douglas Elliman's report. ''If you choke supply by the throat,'' he added, the inevitable outcome is that ''prices rise.'' 
All of this means a tough time for those looking to buy. ''The demand is across the board from studios to $50 million apartments, and there is not enough supply,'' said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, which reported the median price was stable for the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2012. ''There are more bidding wars. There's more frustration.''
While the average price was down 10 percent, Corcoran attributed that dip to a shift in market share toward smaller apartments and resale co-ops as more entry-level buyers, enticed by low mortgage rates, decided to buy.
Reports by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, however, showed the median price down by 5 percent to $780,000 in the first quarter of 2013 compared with the same period the previous year, a decrease that the firms consider an aberration caused by a rush of high-end closings at the end of 2012 in anticipation of changes to tax laws.
''All these deals that normally would have closed in January, February and March were pushed forward,'' said Hall F. Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens Residential. ''As a firm, our closings were three times what our high had ever been in the month of December,'' he added.
Average prices skewed lower as well, down 16 percent to $1,252,081, in part because last year's average was inflated by an $88 million closing at 15 Central Park West. Looking ahead, Mr. Willkie noted, ''Our new deals are considerably above where they were in the first quarter of last year, which was our record year.''
Overall, there were 3,066 new contracts signed in the first quarter, up 15 percent compared with the first three months of 2012, according to StreetEasy.com. The Web site's analysis also showed prices going up 26.8 percent in the first quarter compared with last year, and a 41.3 percent drop in price cuts.
Strong demand for new apartments means many new developments are selling inventory based on floor plans, before the buildings are completed. The sales center at 56 Leonard Street, a new luxury tower in TriBeCa, opened in February, and half the building is already sold, with more than $450 million in signed contracts. The median price of new development units also jumped 37 percent to $1.3 million in the first quarter from the same period last year, according to Corcoran.
And with construction costs high, new development is meant to attract luxury buyers, offering little relief to the rest of the market.
Brokers expect supply to begin to loosen up as prices rise, because homeowners with little or negative equity who have been holding back may finally put their homes up for sale as prices appreciate. ''People are looking to move on with their life,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, president of Halstead Property. ''I think we'll see more resale product come on in a more normal way.'' She added, ''I'm optimistic the balance will not get too much worse.''
But buyers who wait could face higher prices as mortgage rates and prices are expected to rise. ''You might have more inventory to look at next year, but financing costs might be higher and home prices will certainly be higher than right now,'' said Stan Humphries, the chief economist of Zillow.com.
While all of this means sellers currently have the upper hand, brokers caution against raising prices too quickly. ''We hope that we don't see crazy price increases,'' said Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman. ''You want them to rise in a smart way and not just based on a shortage of inventory,'' she continued. ''You want them to rise in a fashion that doesn't create a bubble.''

HEADLINE: A Big Budget With Lots of Holes

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
State lawmakers in New York managed to meet the deadline in approving a $141 billion budget for 2013-14 last week. But the budget is just one part of the State Legislature's job this year. Here's some of what is missing: 
¶Despite Gov. Andrew Cuomo's insistence on curbing the political influence of big-money special interests, there was no money in the budget for matching funds for small contributions in state elections. That should now be at the top of his and the Legislature's list.
¶Lawmakers failed to pass a proposal to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana. They also failed to provide money to help young illegal immigrants brought to this country as children afford state colleges.
¶And, once again, lawmakers stubbornly refused to allow New York City to buy speed cameras that snap photos of license plates when cars are going too fast. Mayor Michael Bloomberg blamed three state senators for the failure: Dean Skelos, the Republican majority leader; Martin Golden, a Republican from Brooklyn; Simcha Felder, a Democrat who votes with Republicans. Maybe this time the mayor's scolding will work.
Here is some of what the Legislature did achieve:
¶A minimum-wage increase moves lowest-paid workers in the right direction -- albeit slowly. The wage will be $9 an hour by 2016 with no index for inflation.
¶A higher tax for millionaires set to expire next year is now extended through 2017. This also makes sense.
¶Many families with incomes between $40,000 and $300,000 a year will get a $350 tax refund, conveniently scheduled to arrive next October, a few weeks before the governor and lawmakers are up for re-election.
As Speaker Sheldon Silver of the Assembly sent his members home for a spring break, he warned that there are ''many challenges ahead of us before we complete our work in this legislative session.'' That list this year is longer than usual.

HEADLINE: What's On Today

BYLINE: By ADAM W. KEPLER

 BODY:
2:15 P.M. (HBO) INTOLERABLE CRUELTY (2003) George Clooney, with his chiseled chin and blazing-white teeth, plays Miles Massey, the crème de la crème of Los Angeles divorce lawyers, in this film from Joel and Ethan Coen. Catherine Zeta-Jones, above with Mr. Clooney, is Marylin, a silken beauty and Miles's latest client, who becomes mired in a vicious divorce after she catches her adulterous husband (Edward Herrmann) cheating yet again. Billy Bob Thornton is her Texas millionaire beau and Miles's chief rival for her money-hungry affections. She may be a victim, but she's no innocent. ''The Coens, bless their hearts, are too smart to apologize for avarice -- it's what gave screwball comedies a kick and sends this movie straight to your head,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times. ''Keep in mind that it's only a minor rush, but a rush nonetheless.'' He added: ''It has a Jell-O-shot smoothness that makes you a little dizzy afterward in recollecting how assured and unremittingly smart 'Intolerable Cruelty' is. The second word in the title is a little too apt; this movie should pack a license to kill.'' 
2 P.M. (IFC) YOU KILL ME (2007) Ben Kingsley, left, plays a boozy hit man from Buffalo who is sent to dry out in San Francisco, where he acquires an Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor (Luke Wilson), a job sprucing up corpses at a funeral home and a mouthy girlfriend (Téa Leoni). Now he's about to return home to settle some scores, and he has help. Writing in The Times, Manohla Dargis said that this film from John Dahl ''goes about as dark as a comedy can go before turning into tragedy or self-parody.''
8 P.M. (IFC) GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002) In 1863 a man (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to the Five Points neighborhood in Lower Manhattan to avenge his father's death at the hands of Bill Cutting, a man known as the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), in this period drama directed by Martin Scorsese. The film was nominated for 10 Oscars, including best picture, best director and best original screenplay. ''People who care about American history, professionally and otherwise, will no doubt weigh in on the accuracy of its particulars and the validity of its interpretation; they will also, I hope, revisit some of their own suppositions in light of its unsparing and uncompromised imagining of the past,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''I said earlier that 'Gangs of New York' is nearly a great movie. I suspect that, over time, it will make up the distance.''
8:30 P.M. (ABC Family) CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (2005) Tim Burton's sugar rush, based on Roald Dahl's book, stars Johnny Depp, right, as an oddly sinister candy maker, and Freddie Highmore as a boy who wants nothing more than some marvelous chocolate. Well, who doesn't? But the movie also burdens Wonka with a psychological back story and forces a redemptive father-son reconciliation onto Dahl's tale, a move A. O. Scott, writing in The Times, called ''worse than lazy; it is a betrayal of a book that the filmmakers seem otherwise to have not only understood, but also honored.'' Mr. Scott added, ''Luckily, the sumptuous, eerie look and mood of the movie make it possible to ignore this dispiriting and superfluous adherence to convention.''
9 P.M. (13, 49) KIND HEARTED WOMAN This ''Frontline'' episode follows a divorced single mother who lives on the Spirit Lake Reservation in North Dakota, over the course of three years as she struggles to raise her two children, further her education and recover from the psychological wounds she sustained from childhood sexual abuse.
10 P.M. (FX) JUSTIFIED In this season finale Boyd (Walton Goggins) and Ava (Joelle Carter) try to dispose of a body before the police can find it, while Raylan (Timothy Olyphant) and Winona (Natalie Zea) deal with some unwelcome visitors from Detroit.
12:50 A.M. (HBO) THE CHANGE-UP (2011) Dave Lockwood (Jason Bateman), a corporate lawyer and father of three, finds his body switched with that of his bachelor best friend, Mitch Planko (Ryan Reynolds), an unemployed actor, after they urinate side by side into a public fountain while declaring that they'd like to live each other's lives. Panic ensues when they return to the fountain and discover that it has been moved. And while the premise isn't explored with any depth, it ''at least sets up a farce that surpasses 'The Hangover' in gleeful crudeness and profanity,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The Times, adding that ''the similarities between the two movies aren't coincidental,'' for Jon Lucas and Scott Moore wrote both.

HEADLINE: A Child Star With a Knack For Publicity

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD; Vivian Yee contributed reporting.

 BODY:
There were problems with her heart that weren't getting better. She weighed 320 pounds. One can only imagine the toll taken by so many years of cloying attention, all the beguiled admirers staring and cooing and craning to get close to her. The press was always sniffing around for new angles. Of course, there was her age.
Forty sounds painfully young -- but, then, she was a gorilla. Once you're past 37, you need to consider putting your affairs in order.
And so it was sad but not entirely surprising when word came on Sunday of the passing of Pattycake, the Bronx Zoo gorilla who had long reigned as one of the city's more acclaimed tourist attractions. Jim Breheny, the zoo's director, said she had been discovered around 8 a.m. by a worker in the zoo's Congo Gorilla Forest. Apparently, she went peacefully, in her sleep. Even at 40, her looks were still pretty much intact. 
For a gorilla, she had had quite a life. ''She was a story that captivated people,'' Mr. Breheny said.
She earned a superstar's distinction and heaps of publicity right at birth, on Sept. 3, 1972, being that she was the first gorilla born in New York City, as opposed to, say, Cameroon or Gabon or Equatorial Guinea. It was an excellent Manhattan address -- the Central Park Zoo. Her furry face served as a bit of a respite at a time when the city found itself grappling with high crime rates and an intensifying financial crisis.
Another gorilla, Hodari, was born just a month later at the Bronx Zoo, and he never got the press she did.
In every sense, Pattycake's arrival was a surprise. Zoo workers had been unaware that Lulu, her mother, was even pregnant until one day she matter-of-factly produced a bundle of dark fur. Back then, it was still relatively rare for gorillas to give birth in captivity.
Gorilla babies were typically raised by humans. But Pattycake, a western lowland gorilla, a species classified as ''critically endangered,'' lived with Lulu and her father, Kongo. The housing wasn't ideal; the gorillas shared the Lion House.
Stardom enveloped her at once. The Daily News conducted a contest to name her, attracting an estimated 33,000 entries. Zoo attendance soared.
One devotee remembered that ''seeing her was like seeing a movie star.''
Adrian Savonije, 45, who was touring the zoo on Monday with his children, said he had visited Pattycake since he was a child. ''I grew up with her,'' he said. ''She was a big attraction here, a little mini New York landmark.''
There were initial concerns about her mother's ability to raise her, Lulu being just 8, and caged, but things seemed to work out. When Pattycake was 6 months old, though, there was a frightening accident. She was squatting with her right arm slung through the bars separating the cage she occupied with Lulu and the neighboring cage of Kongo, who sometimes got a bit rough. Kongo playfully grabbed her arm. Either out of parental rivalry or mere playfulness, her mother scooped her up, inadvertently fracturing Pattycake's right humerus.
It became one of the best-known broken arms in history. The public hung on every ensuing development.
There was an hourlong operation at New York Medical College. The arm was put in a cast, and later in a sling. She was moved to the far larger Bronx Zoo to recuperate. She slept on a cot, was fed infant formula in a bottle and wore a vest, and cloth nappies.
While Pattycake was convalescing, a full-fledged, two-borough custody battle erupted between the two zoos. The Bronx Zoo found her to be undernourished and said she had intestinal parasites. Her mother, the zoo believed, just wasn't doing her job.
To resolve the custody fight, a referee was brought in: Dr. Ronald D. Nadler, a specialist well-versed in gorilla reproduction from the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta. While Lulu might not have qualified as gorilla mother of the year, he concluded, she was more than up to the task of providing Pattycake with the best chance of developing ''the normal repertoire of a gorilla.''
Three months after the accident, Pattycake returned to the Central Park Zoo. There was a well-chronicled reunion with her parents, with conspicuous emotion on display all around. On Pattycake's first birthday, her parents celebrated with her, and a banana layer birthday cake. Birthday cards funneled in from as far away as California. During the party, more cake found its way into Pattycake's fur than into her mouth. It was reported that her father behaved like a ''caged beast.''
Her parents saw her through adolescence, but then in 1983, when the Central Park Zoo was undergoing renovation, she was moved permanently to the Bronx Zoo.
Such was her fame that two books were written about her: ''Gorilla Baby: The Story of Pattycake'' and ''Gentle Gorilla: The Story of Pattycake.''
Innumerable children became smitten with the gorilla, and later transferred that allegiance to their own children. John Bulger, 49, first saw her as a child. As a parent, he takes his son, John Jr., to the zoo twice a month, and they had always checked in on Pattycake. ''There's no better day to spend as a child,'' he said.
She was a robust, big-boned female, so much so that those unacquainted with her often mistook her for a male -- suspicions they no doubt realized were best kept to themselves. Pattycake lived with 18 other gorillas, and volunteers said that she gave the younger ones piggyback rides and assumed a clear matriarchal role.
''She was the boss,'' said Christine Ortman, who has spent countless hours visiting the gorillas. ''We always called it Pattycake's troop.''
Her afflictions -- the heart issues and worsening arthritis -- had slowed her. Zookeepers were advised to say goodbye to her last month, said Kate Brown, a longtime zoo volunteer, but Pattycake held on.
Zoo workers said that one gorilla, named Bweroni (workers called her Fran), had been crying and howling since Pattycake's death.
According to the Wildlife Conservation Society, which operates the Bronx Zoo, Pattycake was the 31st oldest of the 338 gorillas kept in North American zoos. The median life expectancy for female gorillas in zoos is 37.
Pattycake (her name had also been spelled Patty Cake, but it lost the space over the years) managed to give birth to 10 babies with four mates, including a pair of twins born in 1995. She raised only 1 of the 10 on her own; one died four days after birth. The others now reside in zoos around the country, including in Omaha, Buffalo, Detroit and Louisville. She had 10 half-siblings, their whereabouts unknown. She is also survived by at least one grandchild.
A necropsy attributed her death to heart disease. The zoo said she will probably be cremated later this week. No funeral service is planned.
Vivian Yee contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Double-Digit Inflation Worsens in Iran

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
Iran's double-digit inflation rate worsened for the sixth consecutive month in March, the government said on Monday, in what appeared to be an implicit acknowledgment that international sanctions linked to the disputed Iranian nuclear program are causing some economic harm. 
The government's statistics office said the rate increased in March to an annualized 31.5 percent, compared with 30.2 percent in February and 26.4 percent a year earlier, the semiofficial Mehr News Agency reported. The Mehr report did not offer an explanation for the increase except to specify that much of it was in the categories of food, beverages and tobacco.
Many economists say the real rate could be at least double the official rate, partly because it does not fully take into account the prices of many imported goods, which have become prohibitively expensive. The main reason is the severe depreciation of the rial, Iran's national currency, as the sanctions that have limited Central Bank activities and oil exports have taken hold.
Some experts believe the Iranian inflation calculation deliberately understates the actual rate in order to present a public face of resistance to the coercive pressures inflicted by the sanctions, which have been imposed largely by the United States and European Union.
''It's unclear how the Iranian government calculates the inflation rate, especially given the lack of transparency and accountability within the political system, but the official rate announced by the Iranian government is politically motivated,'' said Alireza Nader, an Iran specialist in Washington at the RAND Corporation.
He said the prices of some food items had increased by as much as 100 percent in recent months.
''Of course inflation was high before sanctions against the Central Bank, but there are indications that sanctions have pushed Iran's inflation much higher,'' he said. ''This means a more severe economic outlook for the Iranian government, and the population's continued loss of confidence in the Islamic Republic's ability to keep the economy afloat.''
Proponents of the sanctions have argued that they are not meant to hurt the Iranian people, but rather to create enough pressure on the government so that it is more willing to negotiate. The sanctions advocates say they are working, as reflected in Iran's eagerness to re-engage in talks with the major powers aimed at resolving the nuclear dispute.
Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, said last week that he was hopeful that ''forward movement'' would be achieved at the next round of talks on Friday and Saturday in Almaty, Kazakhstan.
Critics of the sanctions argue that despite the public Iranian expressions of optimism, there has been no sign that the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is willing to soften his hostility to what he regards as American bullying.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 4, 2013

 CORRECTION:
A picture on Tuesday with an article about Iran's announcement that its double-digit inflation had worsened in March for the sixth consecutive month was published in error. It showed a spice shop in the Deira section of Dubai, United Arab Emirates, not one in Deira, Iran. (There is no Deira in Iran.) The article also misspelled the middle name of Iran's foreign minister in some editions. He is Ali Akbar Salehi, not Akhbar.

HEADLINE: Incentives for Men, to Help Women to Work

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Promoting women&#8217;s labor-force participation without curbing their career achievements will require addressing another issue: why family-friendly policies aren&#8217;t being used by men. 

 BODY:
As I wrote in an article appearing this week in The New York Times Magazine, if you want women to be bigger participants in the labor force, some expansion of work-life accommodations (parental leave, flex work, telecommuting, etc.) is probably desirable, particularly relative to the barren landscape of work-life policies in the United States.
But without careful design, expanding work-life accommodations can unintentionally reinforce archaic gender roles and lower the glass ceiling, Temple of Doom style. That's because women are much more likely to take advantage of these policies, and employers know it. 
If you want to create policies that promote women's labor-force participation without curbing their career achievements, you also have to address why family-friendly policies aren't being used by men.
True, women earn less than men in most countries, meaning that there's less of an incentive for women to stick with their jobs. Which is sort of a tautology, or at least a self-perpetuating cycle of women who underinvest in their skills, thereby landing in jobs that pay less, thereby giving them a reason to underinvest in their skills, and so on. 
To a large extent, though, those nebulous things known as social norms are probably to blame for the trivial rates at which men take advantage of leave and flex-work policies. These norms are enforced both by workers and their employers, who might look askance at a father who wants to take time off for a birth or a ballet recital.
So, how do you change norms? 
In a word (economists' favorite word, to be precise): incentives! And it looks as if the most promising place to dangle those incentives is in paternity leave, as some other countries are discovering. 
Sweden and Norway, for example, have recently set aside some weeks of paid parental leave that are available only to fathers. (Like most parental leaves, they are paid by social insurance rather than directly by the employer.) In Germany and Portugal, a mother gets bonus weeks of maternity leave if the child's father takes a minimum amount of paternity leave. 
The share of men who choose to go on leave has grown sharply in these countries. 
Big whoop if men spend a few weeks with their newborn, right? 
But it turns out these few weeks can change gender roles in households and workplaces for years. That's according to a new study by Ankita Patnaik, a Cornell graduate student. It found that several years after the introduction of a paternity-leave quota in Quebec, fathers spent more time in child care and other domestic tasks, and mothers spent more time in paid work. (Otherstudies on use of or exposure to paternity leave in other countries have found similar results.)
Why might that be the case? The birth of a newborn is a crucial time for renegotiating a couple's division of labor. Having men spend some time at home after the birth seems to alter (1) expectations and habits; (2) fathers' comfort and skill level with taking care of a child (economists would say there's a "fixed cost" to learning how to change diapers); and (3) potentially the bond between father and baby. 
It's worth noting, by the way, that men (with or without children) might have another reason to start requesting more flexible work schedules: their aging parents. 
"Elder care is such a growing issue in terms of labor-force attachment," said Heather Boushey, chief economist at the Center for American Progress (a liberal research organization) and a visiting fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research in London. 
As Nancy Folbre has written, women are more likely to be caregivers for elderly parents, but there are likely to be more men who will face this task, too. 
"A lot of men no longer have a wife at home who can care for his parents," Ms. Boushey said.

HEADLINE: Dynamic Scoring Once Again

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: A Senate amendment to require an assessment of the macroeconomic effect of tax changes is an attempt to introduce ideology into the budget process, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
On March 22, the United States Senate adopted an amendment to S. Con. Res. 8, the concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 2014, that would require the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation to produce estimates of the revenue effect of tax changes that incorporate their macroeconomic effects (Sec. 416). 
While seemingly innocuous, this amendment opens the door to "dynamic scoring," which Republicans have long supported to make it easier to enact tax cuts and harder to enact tax increases. Tellingly, they reject the idea of dynamic scoring on the spending side of the budget.
The origins of the debate on dynamic scoring go back to the 1970s, when my former boss, Representative Jack Kemp, Republican of New York, used the "Laffer curve" to assert that an across-the-board cut in income tax rates of 30 percent would not lose any revenue. That is because the stimulative effect of the tax cut on the gross domestic product, employment, investment and so on would be so great and instantaneous that the tax base would expand more than the tax cut, he said.
The Laffer curve is named for the economist Arthur Laffer, who, according to legend, drew it on a napkin to show that there were always two tax rates that raised the same dollar amount of tax revenue - a high rate on a small tax base and a low rate on a large tax base. There is nothing controversial about this proposition, which economists from the time of Adam Smith have acknowledged.
The problem has always been estimating the curve empirically and calculating the impact of any particular tax cut at a given moment under a certain set of conditions. There is also the question of the appropriate time period over which to estimate revenue effects.

Generally speaking, supporters of dynamic scoring don't offer any kind of serious economic analysis; they simply assert, as if it were self-evident, that the nation is always on the high side of the Laffer curve and that any tax cut will therefore pay for itself.
Pressed for evidence supporting this contention, supporters of dynamic scoring will point to the impact of cuts in the capital gains tax. But this is a very poor example because capital gains are a very special form of income.
Unlike wages, interest, dividends and rent, which are taxed when earned, capital gains are not. Gains that are not realized through the sale of an asset remain untaxed. Thus the stock of potentially taxable capital gains is much larger than the amount of gains that may arise in any given year.
A cut in the capital gains tax may unlock some of these gains, which may have arisen over decades, thus leading to a temporary surge in revenue. But it is important to recognize that the economy is not expanding when capital gains revenue rises, because the economic activity that gave rise to the gains occurred in the past. Comparing the revenue effect of a cut in the capital gains tax to the effect of an across-the-board tax cut on all forms of income is grossly inappropriate.
Another problem with dynamic scoring is that proponents often assert that if nominal federal revenue ever rises to the level before a tax cut, this proves that it paid for itself. Supporters of the tax cuts during the George W. Bush administration often state that since the aggregate dollar amount of federal revenue was higher in 2006 than it was in 2000, this is proof that the Bush tax cuts paid for themselves. (Revenue was well below its 2000 level from 2001 to 2005.)
This assertion is so ridiculous it hardly needs rebuttal, but since one still hears it, let me say that inflation raises nominal revenue and the economy generally grows over time whether taxes are cut or not. To observe that the nominal dollar amount of revenue is higher many years after a tax cut occurred tells us absolutely nothing about the revenue effects of that tax cut.
A better method would be to look at federal revenue as a share of gross domestic product. On this basis, the Bush tax cuts are still reducing federal revenue, which has yet to come close to where it was in 2000.
An even better method would be to look at projections of future revenue at the time a tax cut is made and compare the path of revenue with and without the tax cut, incorporating the effects on the economy. In 2003, the Heritage Foundation did just such an estimate - exactly what advocates of dynamic scoring propose.
The Heritage analysis shows that the 2003 Bush tax cut would immediately begin to expand the economy, offsetting some of the static revenue loss, which is the estimated revenue loss, assuming no change in the macroeconomy. In 2003, 8.8 percent of the static revenue loss would be recouped, rising to 14.6 percent in 2004, 28.5 percent in 2005, 47.5 percent in 2006, 73.7 percent in 2007 and 90 percent by 2011.
According to Heritage's "dynamic" forecast, federal revenue should have reached $3.5 trillion in 2012 with the Bush tax cuts in place. In fact, they were only $2.5 trillion. Of course, Heritage was also wrong about the growth path of revenue without the tax cut. Economic growth over the last 10 years was far worse than anyone expected with or without the tax cut in 2003.
In principle we should want the revenue effects of tax changes to be calculated as accurately as possible, including their impact on the macroeconomy. 
But this is a very time-consuming process, and the vast bulk of tax changes have no effect on the macroeconomy one way or another.
In practice, dynamic scoring is just another way for Republicans to enact tax cuts and block tax increases. It is not about honest revenue-estimating; it's about using smoke and mirrors to institutionalize Republican ideology into the budget process. Why six Democrats joined the Senate Republicans in this move remains to be seen.

HEADLINE: After Running S.E.C., Schapiro Becomes Bank Consultant

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Mary L. Schapiro is joining the Promontory Financial Group, a consulting firm that steers banks and other financial firms through regulatory scrutiny. 

 BODY:
After more than three decades of policing Wall Street, Mary L. Schapiro is going to work for some if its biggest players. 
The Promontory Financial Group, a consulting firm that steers banks and other financial firms through regulatory scrutiny, announced on Tuesday that it had hired Ms. Schapiro as chairwoman of its governance and markets practice. The move comes after a grueling four-year period for Ms. Schapiro, who ran the Securities and Exchange Commission in the wake of the financial crisis. 
"Mary is an outstanding advocate for investors and was a strong and decisive regulator during one of the most volatile periods in our financial history," Eugene A. Ludwig, the head of Promontory, said in a statement. 
Ms. Schapiro is the latest regulator to step through Washington's revolving door on her way to Promontory. In addition to its ties with the S.E.C., Promontory has a deep bench of employees from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Mr. Ludwig created Promontory in 2001 after a stint as comptroller under President Bill Clinton. 
Ms. Schapiro's arrival comes at a difficult time for Promontory, which recently took a beating for its role in a botched review of foreclosures. Under orders from the comptroller's office, the nation's biggest banks had hired consultants like Promontory to determine whether homeowners were wrongfully evicted. 
But delays and inefficiencies plagued the consultants, which collected about $2 billion in fees over 14 months. Promontory, the firm examining loans for Wells Fargo, Bank of America and PNC, was blamed for relying on contract employees and lowballing the amount of harm homeowners experienced. The comptroller's office, fed up with the delays, scuttled the review in January and negotiated a multibillion-dollar settlement deal directly with the banks. 
"From Day 1, Promontory strove to conduct its review work as thoroughly and independently as possible," a spokesman for the firm, Christopher Winans, said in a previous statement. "Our overarching concern at all times was to serve the best interests of borrowers."
The arrival of Ms. Schapiro could help Promontory deflect the mounting scrutiny. She might also bolster its corporate governance practice, which advises public companies on managing risk. 
"The risk environment for firms in today's global markets is increasingly complex," Ms. Schapiro said in a statement on Tuesday.
It is unclear how much Ms. Schapiro will earn at Promontory, but the job will certainly pay her more than the $165,000 annual salary she made at the S.E.C. Ms. Schapiro will also pick up a healthy payday as she joins corporate boards. Last month, General Electric nominated her to join its board, a spot that should pay about $250,000. 
And then there is her payday from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-regulatory group. In 2008, Ms. Schapiro left that group with a $7 million-plus payout that included pension and deferred compensation.
Until now, Ms. Schapiro was a lifelong regulator. Joining the government straight out of law school, she started as a trial lawyer for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, an agency she later ran under President Clinton. 
She later ran the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, before she took the reins of the S.E.C. in 2009, when the agency was being widely condemned after it failed to head off the financial crisis and spot Bernard L. Madoff's huge Ponzi scheme.

HEADLINE: Opening a Gateway for Girls to Enter the Computer Field

BYLINE: CLAIRE CAIN MILLER


HIGHLIGHT: Silicon Valley and several small companies and nonprofits are working to increase the number of women in the technology industry by teaching teenage girls how to write computer code. 

 BODY:
WHEN Julia Geist was asked to draw a picture of a computer scientist last year, the 16-year-old sketched a businessman wearing glasses and a tie. Looking around at her classmates' drawings, she saw similar depictions of men.
Now, Ms. Geist said, "I see a computer scientist could be anyone" - including herself.
 Her new perspective is a victory for Girls Who Code. As part of an eight-week program with the Manhattan-based nonprofit group, Ms. Geist and 19 other high school girls learned software programming, public speaking, product development and other skills to prepare them for jobs in the technology industry.
Girls Who Code is among the recent crop of programs intended to close the gender gap in tech by intervening early, when young women are deciding what they want to study. With names like Hackbright Academy, Girl Develop It, Black Girls Code and Girls Teaching Girls to Code, these groups try to present a more exciting image of computer science. 
The paucity of women in the tech industry has been well documented. Even though women represent more than half the overall work force, they hold less than a quarter of computing and technical jobs, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology based at the University of Colorado, Boulder. At the executive and founder levels, women are even scarcer.
A variety of advocacy and networking groups have tried to address the problem by coaching women on building start-ups, raising venture capital and climbing the management ranks at big companies. Most recently, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, published a best-selling book, "Lean In," that was a call to arms for women to pursue their ambition in the workplace.
Even so, the number of women entering technology has been declining. Women earn just 12 percent of computer science degrees, down from 37 percent in 1984. Tech executives, recruiters and financiers say women simply do not walk through their doors seeking work.
"We actively recruit women, but there's just not that many women who want to do this kind of work and are equipped to do the work from their education," said Adam Messinger, the chief technology officer at Twitter, who is on the board of Girls Who Code.
So the industry is trying a new approach. It is tackling the problem long before women start their careers, by teaching girls the basic skill of writing code.
"We have to get women on the right side of the computer," said Margit Wennmachers, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. Knowing a programming language is becoming essential not just for engineers, she added, but also for women who want to be tech executives or deal-makers or pursue other careers, from medicine to fashion.
"The dividing line is learning to code," Ms. Wennmachers said. "You either tell the computer what to do and you've got lots of great career options. Or the computer tells you what to do and you end up working in a shoe store."
Groups like Girls Who Code are part of a national movement to recruit young people to software development and remain competitive with other economies. A new group, code.org, for example, has people like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Bill Gates of Microsoft pushing for all schools to teach children to code.
But the need is most urgent for girls, said Reshma Saujani, who founded Girls Who Code last year. Roughly 74 percent of girls in middle school express an interest in engineering, science and math, she said. But by the time they get to college, just 0.3 percent choose computer science as a major.
Ms. Saujani, the daughter of two engineers who were refugees from Uganda, developed the idea while she was running for Congress, a race that she lost. As she traveled from school to school on the campaign trail, she said she saw the same thing over and over: computer science classrooms without a single girl.
"I saw the ability of technology to either enhance poverty or reduce it, and I saw girls not getting the same opportunities boys were," said Ms. Saujani, who is now campaigning for public advocate in New York City. "Back in the '60s, you didn't have gender parity in law or medicine, but something happened and women started opting into these professions. We have to do that in computer science."
Researchers say many factors contribute to girls' reluctance to pursue computing as early as elementary school, including discouraging parents, inadequate resources for teachers and a lack of exposure. Studies have shown that girls imagine computer scientists as men working alone in a basement and can't relate.
It's a significant disconnect, given how women embrace technology. Female consumers make up a majority of users for many tech products. For technology companies, women also offer a diverse perspective, which can help bolster the bottom line.
"Being a software developer gives you a lot of insight into the world and business and gives you a lot of career opportunities," said Sara J. Chipps, the co-founder of Girl Develop It, and the chief technology officer of Levo League, a Web start-up for professional women.
After hatching the idea for Girls Who Code, Ms. Saujani and Kristen Titus, its executive director, started going to tech companies and asking what skills they wanted in female applicants. Mr. Messinger at Twitter, for instance, said he wanted to see more candidates who knew how to break a problem into parts and describe it in logic terms, which was incorporated into the program's curriculum.
The response from companies was encouraging. The group raised money from Google, Twitter, Intel and other technology companies. Some also agreed to host workshops for Girls Who Code at their offices and volunteered employees to teach courses.
To develop the classes, the women recruited academics and people who worked in tech to design the curriculum, which includes topics like robotics, animation and mobile app development, as well as skills like introducing yourself in a business setting and presenting your product onstage. By Week 2, students learn what an algorithm is and how to write one to program a robot. By Week 5, they build their own mobile apps.
Then there are the intangibles, like eating in the Twitter cafeteria, pitching the apps the students built to Twitter's engineering team and listening to notable female executives talk about what it was like to be the only girl in their computer science classes. Last year, so many girls said they wanted to become forensic scientists - as in the hit television show "C.S.I." - that the group took a field trip to the New York Police Department to see how they used computers.
Nikita Rau, 17, another Girls Who Code graduate, said seeing female programmers on field trips taught her that anyone could be a coder. At big companies like Google and small ones like Foursquare, she said she was inspired by seeing successful women, and engineering problems scrawled on white boards - not to mention "the amazing food."
"As we walked through Facebook and Twitter, I could imagine myself sitting there coding throughout the day," she said. "I'm not afraid to be one of the first girls to go into one of those fields. I want to pursue this career and maybe be a C.E.O. of a company."
Girls Who Code is still in its infancy. In 2012, it taught 20 girls in New York. This summer, the program will accept 160 girls in New York, San Francisco and Detroit. The group is packaging its curriculum so schools and community organizations can teach it, too.
Girls Who Code is already showing signs of progress.
In March, it hosted a recruiting event at Google's New York office for 200 girls, parents and teachers. Last year's graduates showed off the apps and Web sites they built and attendees were treated to Google's famous perks, including a demo of its Internet-connected glasses and a spread of beef sliders and chicken fingers.
Ms. Geist, the high school student who had never taken a computer science course, built an app for finding people with similar interests on Twitter. Now, she has signed up for the only computing courses in her public high school and wants to study computer science and physics in college. She even persuaded her father, a part-time custodian, to take a programming class.
"I guess I was just doing what my friends were doing, and none of the girls wanted to do computer science because it was mostly just guys," Ms. Geist said. "But I don't really care about that now. I love computer science."

HEADLINE: A Plan to Simplify the Tax Code That May Be Too Simple

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: A draft proposal in Congress does nothing to address how the partnership tax rules are now being used, and abused, by large businesses, the author writes. 

 BODY:
Did anyone else notice the elephant in the living room?
Last month, Dave Camp, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, released a draft proposal to change how we tax certain types of businesses known as pass-throughs. Under current law, the owners of these partnerships, limited liability companies and subchapter S corporations pay their share of the company's income or loss on their individual tax returns instead of paying tax at the entity level. Mr. Camp's proposal would maintain this basic approach and simplify aspects of it for small businesses.
Reaction to Mr. Camp's proposal has been subdued compared with the praise for his plan to change the way we tax derivatives. Mr. Camp's willingness to float draft proposals and invite comment should again be commended. But the likely outcome here is a slight change, not a major overhaul. 
Incremental change with a minimum of controversy must be Mr. Camp's goal. That would explain why he takes the corner wide, steering clear of the most controversial aspect of partnership tax: carried interest. Carried interest refers to the share of partnership profits earned by an investment fund manager, and under current law it is often taxed at low capital gains rates. Critics like myself argue that because carried interest is labor income, not investment income, it ought to be taxed as ordinary income. 
Mr. Camp's proposal includes two options. The first option addresses what we might think of as deferred maintenance - cleaning up some corners of the tax code that have been neglected. For example, it would relax the anachronistic eligibility restrictions for subchapter S corporations. For partnerships, the proposal would repeal the confusing rules related to "guaranteed payments." It would also make some useful changes to the partnership tax rules related to basis adjustments and revise some outdated definitions.
The second option, a more radical one, appears to be a stalking horse. This would replace our existing system with a unified set of rules for pass-throughs. This sounds simple and appealing. Many of the ideas in Option 2 are promising, but they are largely untested and not fully explained in the proposal. 
For example, Option 2 would replace the labyrinth of rules for determining whether allocations of income will be respected for tax purposes with a simple rule: the tax consequences should track the economic gains or losses. This sounds great in theory, but it's hard to implement in a system where Congress likes to single out certain activities for special tax treatment. 
The tax rules often allow and even encourage the tax consequences of a deal to diverge from the economics. Examples include depreciation deductions (where tax depreciation is accelerated compared with real economic depreciation), tax credits for low-income housing and clean energy and nonrecourse liabilities (when a loan is secured by an asset instead of the partnership or any of the partners). 
Suppose a partnership allocates wind energy tax credits to a limited partner who financed a new project with those tax credits in mind. The tax credits, however, have no effect on the partner's capital account or economic risk of loss. Would the I.R.S. allow the limited partner to take the tax credits? Or would the tax credits be denied because they represent artificial tax losses, not real economic losses? 
In my view, there's an additional problem with Mr. Camp's proposal: its failure to address how the partnership tax rules are now being used, and abused, by large businesses. The partnership tax rules were originally created for small business, so a small number of individuals could work in a business together and mix together labor and capital without having to pay an extra layer of tax. The rules are now used in ways that Congress never intended. Two examples are the erosion of the corporate tax base and the tax treatment of carried interest.
The corporate tax base is eroding because many large businesses are able to avoid the corporate tax rules altogether and choose to be taxed as pass-throughs instead. Bain Capital, the Blackstone Group, the Carlyle Group and other large asset management firms are organized as partnerships, yet take in billions of revenue each year. Energy Products Partners, a publicly traded master limited partnership, has a market capitalization more than $50 billion. The Bechtel Corporation, the largest engineering firm in the United States, is organized as a subchapter S corporation and pays no entity-level tax.
And the proposal doesn't contain so much as a whisper about carried interest, the most controversial partnership tax issue in recent years. 
Of course, Mr. Camp has pitched the proposal as being about simplification of the tax rules for small business. Avoiding the topic of carried interest is consistent with that message. 
But if Mr. Camp wants to raise some revenue to pay for tax changes elsewhere, like a reduction in the corporate tax or a shift to a territorial tax system, he will have to follow the money to where it disappears - through loopholes like carried interest and the abuse of the publicly traded partnership rules.

HEADLINE: Big Profits at Fannie and Freddie Reignite Debate on Housing Supports

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reported huge profits for 2012, which is likely to intensify the debate over the amount of involvement that the government should have in supporting the housing market. 

 BODY:
What was the most profitable insurance company last year? 
It wasn't Berkshire Hathaway. It was a company that nearly collapsed in the 2008 financial crisis because of reckless housing bets and then required a colossal taxpayer bailout. 
No, it was not American International Group. 
It is Fannie Mae, the government-backed company that insures mortgages against default. Fannie made $17.2 billion last year, versus Berkshire Hathaway's $14.8 billion. Fannie was the third-most profitable financial firm in 2012, after JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. But this year, Fannie's earnings could exceed even those of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, if it decides to book a large tax-related gain. 
The huge profits rolling in at Fannie, and at its corporate sibling Freddie Mac, reflect the enormous role the government is playing in the housing market nearly five years after the crisis. As a result, the earnings will intensify the debate over the role that government should play in supporting housing. 
"This should change the dialogue of what we want to do with the companies," said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. 
Fannie and Freddie charge fees in return for a guarantee that they will pay back mortgages that default. In the first years after the crisis, that fee revenue was overwhelmed by losses. As those have abated, profits have returned for the two mortgage giants. 
The big question looming over the housing market is how quickly to remove the support provided by Fannie and Freddie. 
They shore up the market by purchasing mortgages from banks and selling them on, with the guarantee, to bond investors. Because the companies are government backed, they can borrow at a very low cost. They then effectively pass on some of that cost advantage to homeowners, making home loans cheaper for the average borrower. In addition, the sheer purchasing power of Fannie and Freddie in the mortgage market means there is always strong demand for home loans, which induces banks to keep making them. 
As much as all that has helped the housing market, it has led to a situation where the government backed 86 percent of all mortgages last year, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. In 2000, the figure was 47 percent. 
The concern in some quarters is that the government's heavy involvement is distorting the housing market and the Treasury Department is moving too slowly to roll back the presence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. "I'm glad Fannie Mae is showing an increase in income, but we have to remember that this is largely because we have crowded out private capital and made Fannie or Freddie the only viable execution option for new loans," Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said in a statement. 
The last time the Treasury Department took a big step with housing was in early 2011, when it outlined for Congress how it planned to overhaul housing finance. Incremental measures are being taken, but what's still missing is a concrete commitment to start scaling back Fannie and Freddie's role at a certain date. 
"They still haven't developed an actual transition plan for the companies that works toward a real reform goal," said Jim Vogel, who analyzes debt markets for FTN Financial. 
Mr. Cecala says that one easy step to implement would be to set out a timetable for reducing the size of the loans that Fannie and Freddie guarantee. Those mortgages above the limit would have to be financed by private entities in the mortgage market. But there is little appetite for such a move. "No one wants to get blamed for breaking the housing recovery," Mr. Cecala said. 
In reality, the status quo is likely to remain in the housing market for at least the next couple of years. After all, as the big profits pour in, the Treasury Department can look forward to getting back the money it plowed into Freddie and Fannie after the crisis. The taxpayers provided $116.1 billion of support to Fannie, which has paid the Treasury Department $35.6 billion in dividends out of its earnings. 
And taxpayers could get a huge windfall from Fannie soon. The reason has to do with accounting. In 2008, Fannie set aside a large amount of money to reflect the possibility that it might not get to use an asset that allows it to reduces its taxes. It now appears that the set aside sum, $58.9 billion at the end of last year, is no longer needed, because the tax asset can be utilized. 
As a result, the earnings will intensify the debate over the amount of involvement that the government should have in supporting housing. Here's how Fannie put it in a news release on Tuesday: "Fannie Mae expects to pay Treasury a significant dividend in the quarter following a release of the valuation allowance on the company's deferred tax assets." Mr. Vogel, the analyst, said Fannie could in theory borrow money to make a cash payment to the Treasury Department.
"Right now, Fannie and Freddie appear to be cash machines for the federal government," Mr. Cecala said.

HEADLINE: Comparing the World's Glass Ceilings

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: In relation to other wealthy countries, the United States is doing a relatively good job of getting women into high-achieving jobs. 

 BODY:
One of the more surprising things I learned in my research foran article in The New York Times Magazine is that despite all the complaints about the glass ceiling, the United States is actually doing a relatively good job of getting women into high-achieving jobs. 
 Other developed countries have much more family-friendly labor policies than the United States does. The United States is one of only a handful of countries in the world (rich or poor) that do not offer paid maternity leave, for example. And while prominent American companies like Yahoo and Best Buy are banning work-from-home arrangements, European Union countries have legislated that parents can request part-time, flexible or telecommuting arrangements without penalty. In some countries, employers are not allowed to say no to these requests, and in places where they can, there's often a pretty involved process required to justify the refusal. Some places, like Germany and Spain, also require companies to keep a job open for an employee on parental leave for as long as three years. 
A new paper by Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn of Cornell argues that those policy differences may explain why the United States has fallen behind in women's labor-force participation rates. But the paper also suggests that the same policy gap could explain why, paradoxically, women in the United States seem to have more varied and ambitious career paths open to them if and when they do choose to work. 
After all, not all full-time positions can be easily divided into two or more part-time ones, or can be done remotely. It can be costly or even impossible for employers to reconfigure their existing jobs. Nurses and receptionists can work shifts without difficulty; that's probably less true for a lawyer on a big merger, where there's a lot of case-specific knowledge that's hard to hand off. If women are disproportionately the ones taking advantage of these work-life-balance options - which they are - that makes women more expensive to hire.
The chart below includes data from the study (to be published in The American Economic Review), and shows the share of women and the share of men who were managers or were in traditionally "male" professions (defined as all professionals excluding nurses and pre-university teachers) in the United States versus the average of 10 other developed countries. The numbers are for 2009.
The lighter-colored bars refer to the incidence of being a manager or traditionally male professional in the United States; the darker-colored bars refer to the same rates for 10 other developed countries. As you can see, American women are about as likely as American men to become managers or land in traditionally male jobs. 
To clarify, this does not mean that the United States has as many women as men who are senior managers or professionals, since there are fewer women than men in the overall labor force. It just means that if you're a working woman, your chances of being a manager or a professional are about as good as they are for a working man. 
Indeed, according to separate data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States has the smallest gap between the share of employed women who are in senior management positions and the share of employed men in such positions. 
In the United States, the ratio of the share of women who are in senior management positions to the share of men who are in senior management positions is about 0.85 (13.9/16.3), whereas for all O.E.C.D. countries it is about 0.59 (6.1/10.3). The country with the next highest ratio, behind the United States, is New Zealand, with a ratio of 0.76 (11.7/15.4).

HEADLINE: A Huge Parking Bill, but It's Also a Huge Space

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: The world&#8217;s largest yacht, the Eclipse, has been docked at a city-owned terminal since mid-February, at a charge of $2,000 a day. 

 BODY:
 As of Wednesday, Roman Abramovich's latest bill for parking in New York City will reach $100,000. And by the time his ship sails, the tab could exceed $150,000. 
 Mr. Abramovich, the Russian billionaire who owns the Chelsea soccer team in London, also owns the world's largest yacht, the 533-foot Eclipse. The boat is so big that the only place to dock it in Manhattan is at the terminal on the West Side where cruise ships load and unload.
 But cruise ships usually stay in port less than 12 hours. The Eclipse has been at Pier 90 since mid-February and intends to stay another month, according to a spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, which controls the terminal.
The fee for parking at the terminal is $2,000 a day, said the spokesman, Patrick Muncie. That may sound steep, but the rate has not risen in more than two years - unlike subway fares or the charge to park a car at a meter in the city.
 Providing shelter for the megayachts of Russian billionaires could be a source of significant revenue for the city, which splits the fee evenly with the company that operates the terminal, Ports America.
 The Eclipse is reputed to be decked out with three helipads, a submarine and a swimming pool whose bottom can be raised for use as a dance floor. Its construction cost has been estimated at more than $500 million.
 In November 2011, the 440-foot yacht Serene parked at the terminal for several days. It was the first personal boat to do so, according to the development corporation. Boating publications havereported that the Serene, whose unusual features include an indoor saltwater pool and a room in which it snows, belongs to Yuri Shefler, whose company distributes Stolichnaya vodka.
 The Serene's owner also was charged $2,000 a day, according to the development corporation. But if the city charged by the foot, Mr. Abramovich would be paying $422 more per day for the Eclipse, which has been the biggest private yacht in the world since it was launched in 2010, according to Superyachts.com.
 The Eclipse is about two feet longer than the Dubai, a yacht owned by the ruler of Dubai. But soon the Eclipse may be eclipsed by a much larger yacht under construction in Bremen, Germany. That boat, known as Azzam, is estimated to be about 50 feet longer.
 It is too soon to know if Azzam will ever be moored in Manhattan. But its owner, whoever that turns out to be, is unlikely to be a better customer of the city's development corporation than Mr. Abramovich.
 The only yacht ever to dock at the city-owned cruise terminal in Brooklyn spent a month there last spring, at a cost of $1,800 a day, Mr. Muncie said. That boat, a 377-foot vessel named Luna, reportedly belonged to Mr. Abramovich, too.

HEADLINE: The Mumbai/New York Photo Project: Education Heroes

BYLINE: NISHA SONDHE and NEHA THIRANI BAGRI


HIGHLIGHT: Helping poor children in both cities who often struggle to get a good education. 

 BODY:
Mumbai and New York may both be the financial capitals of their respective countries and home to vibrant economies, but the cities have struggled since their birth with persistent social inequity. 
Poor children in particular often struggle to get decent education and care, despite the presence of world-class educational institutes in both cities. In the seventh edition of the Mumbai/ New York photo project, Nisha Sondhe documented individuals and institutions working to improve the lives of children from all backgrounds.

Founded in 1989 by Wendy Kopp, Teach for America, which places college graduates and young professionals as teachers for two years in under-resourced schools, has reached over 3 million children in America. Teach for India, founded in 2008, adapted the American model and places teachers in Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Hyderabad and Chennai.
Zafar Bhatri, 28, who teaches at the Elia Sarwat High School and Junior College in Mumbai, said that after he entered his classroom, he quickly realized how far behind the students were and how little they understood. "They are sitting in a Grade 2 classroom, but, on an average, are academically at a lower kindergarten level, meaning three years lower than where they should be," he said.
Over the past year, he said, he has watched some of his students improve dramatically, to the point where they can do math at their age level and even write stories.
In Mumbai, the Sahaara Charitable Society is a nonprofit started by a group of citizens to provide services ranging from education to health care to people from lower-income backgrounds. As part of the Sahaara Charitable Society, Project Pratham works to break the cycle of poverty by providing education, food and medical care to over 500 children in slums across Mumbai.
Many organizations go beyond basic education to provide holistic support. In New York, the Girls Educational and Mentoring Service, or GEMS, focuses on girls and young women between the ages of 12 to 24 who were sexually abused, trafficked or worked as commercial sex workers. The organization was founded in 1998 by Rachel Lloyd, who was sexually exploited as a teenager. The organization works to enable young women to leave the commercial sex industry by providing them with support and access to education.
Founded in New York in 1998, Girls Write Now provides mentoring for girls and young women interested in writing. Through a program of tutoring, workshops, readings and portfolio guidance, the organization helps young women from New York City's public high schools to develop their writing styles, explore careers in professional writing as well as make healthy choices outside of school.
The organization has met with incredible success: while 40 percent of New York City high school students fail to graduate on time, 100 percent of the mentees in the program graduate on time and attend college.
Economic and social pressures make it difficult for many children in Mumbai to stay in school and complete their education. The Iskcon Food Relief Foundation attempts to address this problem by providing meals to children who attend school. The foundation provides 12,000 meals each day from 24 kitchen centers across 10 states in India.

HEADLINE: Opening a Gateway for Girls to Enter the Computer Field

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
WHEN Julia Geist was asked to draw a picture of a computer scientist last year, the 16-year-old sketched a businessman wearing glasses and a tie. Looking around at her classmates' drawings, she saw similar depictions of men.
Now, Ms. Geist said, ''I see a computer scientist could be anyone'' -- including herself.
Her new perspective is a victory for Girls Who Code. As part of an eight-week program with the Manhattan-based nonprofit group, Ms. Geist and 19 other high school girls learned software programming, public speaking, product development and other skills to prepare them for jobs in the technology industry.
Girls Who Code is among the recent crop of programs intended to close the gender gap in tech by intervening early, when young women are deciding what they want to study. With names like Hackbright Academy, Girl Develop It, Black Girls Code and Girls Teaching Girls to Code, these groups try to present a more exciting image of computer science. 
The paucity of women in the tech industry has been well documented. Even though women represent more than half the overall work force, they hold less than a quarter of computing and technical jobs, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology based at the University of Colorado, Boulder. At the executive and founder levels, women are even scarcer.
A variety of advocacy and networking groups have tried to address the problem by coaching women on building start-ups, raising venture capital and climbing the management ranks at big companies. Most recently, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, published a best-selling book, ''Lean In,'' that was a call to arms for women to pursue their ambition in the workplace.
Even so, the number of women entering technology has been declining. Women earn just 12 percent of computer science degrees, down from 37 percent in 1984. Tech executives, recruiters and financiers say women simply do not walk through their doors seeking work.
''We actively recruit women, but there's just not that many women who want to do this kind of work and are equipped to do the work from their education,'' said Adam Messinger, the chief technology officer at Twitter, who is on the board of Girls Who Code.
So the industry is trying a new approach. It is tackling the problem long before women start their careers, by teaching girls the basic skill of writing code.
''We have to get women on the right side of the computer,'' said Margit Wennmachers, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. Knowing a programming language is becoming essential not just for engineers, she added, but also for women who want to be tech executives or deal-makers or pursue other careers, from medicine to fashion.
''The dividing line is learning to code,'' Ms. Wennmachers said. ''You either tell the computer what to do and you've got lots of great career options. Or the computer tells you what to do and you end up working in a shoe store.''
Groups like Girls Who Code are part of a national movement to recruit young people to software development and remain competitive with other economies. A new group, code.org, for example, has people like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Bill Gates of Microsoft pushing for all schools to teach children to code.
But the need is most urgent for girls, said Reshma Saujani, who founded Girls Who Code last year. Roughly 74 percent of girls in middle school express an interest in engineering, science and math, she said. But by the time they get to college, just 0.3 percent choose computer science as a major.
Ms. Saujani, the daughter of two engineers who were refugees from Uganda, developed the idea while she was running for Congress, a race that she lost. As she traveled from school to school on the campaign trail, she said she saw the same thing over and over: computer science classrooms without a single girl.
''I saw the ability of technology to either enhance poverty or reduce it, and I saw girls not getting the same opportunities boys were,'' said Ms. Saujani, who is now campaigning for public advocate in New York City. ''Back in the '60s, you didn't have gender parity in law or medicine, but something happened and women started opting into these professions. We have to do that in computer science.''
Researchers say many factors contribute to girls' reluctance to pursue computing as early as elementary school, including discouraging parents, inadequate resources for teachers and a lack of exposure. Studies have shown that girls imagine computer scientists as men working alone in a basement and can't relate.
It's a significant disconnect, given how women embrace technology. Female consumers make up a majority of users for many tech products. For technology companies, women also offer a diverse perspective, which can help bolster the bottom line.
''Being a software developer gives you a lot of insight into the world and business and gives you a lot of career opportunities,'' said Sara J. Chipps, the co-founder of Girl Develop It, and the chief technology officer of Levo League, a Web start-up for professional women.
After hatching the idea for Girls Who Code, Ms. Saujani and Kristen Titus, its executive director, started going to tech companies and asking what skills they wanted in female applicants. Mr. Messinger at Twitter, for instance, said he wanted to see more candidates who knew how to break a problem into parts and describe it in logic terms, which was incorporated into the program's curriculum.
The response from companies was encouraging. The group raised money from Google, Twitter, Intel and other technology companies. Some also agreed to host workshops for Girls Who Code at their offices and volunteered employees to teach courses.
To develop the classes, the women recruited academics and people who worked in tech to design the curriculum, which includes topics like robotics, animation and mobile app development, as well as skills like introducing yourself in a business setting and presenting your product onstage. By Week 2, students learn what an algorithm is and how to write one to program a robot. By Week 5, they build their own mobile apps.
Then there are the intangibles, like eating in the Twitter cafeteria, pitching the apps the students built to Twitter's engineering team and listening to notable female executives talk about what it was like to be the only girl in their computer science classes. Last year, so many girls said they wanted to become forensic scientists -- as in the hit television show ''C.S.I.'' -- that the group took a field trip to the New York Police Department to see how they used computers.
Nikita Rau, 17, another Girls Who Code graduate, said seeing female programmers on field trips taught her that anyone could be a coder. At big companies like Google and small ones like Foursquare, she said she was inspired by seeing successful women, and engineering problems scrawled on white boards -- not to mention ''the amazing food.''
''As we walked through Facebook and Twitter, I could imagine myself sitting there coding throughout the day,'' she said. ''I'm not afraid to be one of the first girls to go into one of those fields. I want to pursue this career and maybe be a C.E.O. of a company.''
Girls Who Code is still in its infancy. In 2012, it taught 20 girls in New York. This summer, the program will accept 160 girls in New York, San Francisco and Detroit. The group is packaging its curriculum so schools and community organizations can teach it, too.
Girls Who Code is already showing signs of progress.
In March, it hosted a recruiting event at Google's New York office for 200 girls, parents and teachers. Last year's graduates showed off the apps and Web sites they built and attendees were treated to Google's famous perks, including a demo of its Internet-connected glasses and a spread of beef sliders and chicken fingers.
Ms. Geist, the high school student who had never taken a computer science course, built an app for finding people with similar interests on Twitter. Now, she has signed up for the only computing courses in her public high school and wants to study computer science and physics in college. She even persuaded her father, a part-time custodian, to take a programming class.
''I guess I was just doing what my friends were doing, and none of the girls wanted to do computer science because it was mostly just guys,'' Ms. Geist said. ''But I don't really care about that now. I love computer science.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: March Auto Sales Increased 3.4% for Highest Total Since 2007

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Automakers reported on Tuesday that March sales of new cars and trucks were the highest monthly total in five years, providing more evidence of a sustained turnaround in the industry.
According to Autodata, 1.45 million vehicles were sold during the month, a 3.4 percent improvement over last year, as a strengthening housing market and low interest rates spurred consumers and businesses to replace aging models.
It was the best monthly performance since 2007, executives and analysts said, and it reinforced their sales forecasts for the full year at more than 15 million vehicles. 
''Even though consumer confidence has been up and down this year, there are 'wealth effects' that are making Americans feel comfortable finally buying new cars they've been waiting for,'' said Lacey Plache, an economist for the auto research site Edmunds.com.
General Motors, the largest American automaker, said it sold 246,000 new vehicles during March, a 6.4 percent increase over the same period last year.
While sales of its biggest brand, Chevrolet, were flat, G.M. said sales of its Cadillac brand increased almost 50 percent and Buick sales rose 37 percent.
G.M. benefited from a steadily growing demand from the construction industry for new pickup trucks. Sales of the Chevrolet Silverado increased 8 percent, and the company expects even better results when it begins delivering a newer-model truck to showrooms over the next few months.
''Trucks have improved in lock step with the housing market,'' said Kurt McNeil, head of the company's sales operations in the United States.
Ford Motor said it sold 236,000 new vehicles during the month, a 5.7 percent improvement over a year earlier and the company's best monthly performance since May 2007.
The results were driven by the heart of the Ford lineup. Sales of the midsize Fusion sedan topped 30,000 for the first time, and demand for the Escape sport utility vehicle was up more than 27 percent.
Ford also posted a 16 percent gain in sales for its F-series pickup, the best-selling vehicle in America.
''Full-size pickup demand continues to gain momentum, outperforming the industry for the third consecutive month,'' said Ken Czubay, Ford's marketing and sales chief for the United States.
Chrysler sold more than 171,000 vehicles in March. Its 5 percent improvement over a year ago was smaller than in some recent months, and it underscored the company's need to keep refreshing its showrooms with new models.
The company said sales of its Ram pickup truck increased 25 percent over the previous year, and the new Dodge Dart compact car had its best month since it was introduced last summer.
Chrysler is revamping its cornerstone Jeep brand with a new version of the Cherokee S.U.V. and other models. Analysts said broadening the Jeep lineup was crucial to Chrysler's chances of returning to the double-digit monthly growth it had in 2012.
''Chrysler's March sales story is one of old and new,'' said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Edmunds.com. ''Jeep desperately needs the Cherokee to get back into positive territory.''
The Japanese automakers all reported sales increases in March. Toyota said it sold 205,000 vehicles in the month, a 1 percent gain from a year earlier. While the company more than doubled the sales of its redesigned Avalon sedan, its top-selling Camry declined 11 percent.
Nissan sold 137,000 vehicles, a 1 percent improvement over last year. The all-electric Nissan Leaf, which is now produced at the company's Tennessee assembly plant, had its best monthly sales of 2,200 vehicles.
Honda posted the strongest results of the Japanese companies, selling 136,000 vehicles for a year-over-year gain of 7.1 percent. Much of the improvement was caused by a 26 percent increase in sales by its Acura brand.
Both Toyota and Honda are back at full strength from lingering inventory problems caused by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, and they are aggressively updating their showrooms with new products.
All the automakers are advertising heavily to bolster spring sales. One of the busiest has been Volkswagen, which is rapidly expanding its American operations.
Volkswagen sold 37,000 vehicles in the month, a 3.1 percent increase from a year ago. The company said that was its best March since 1973, when it was among the few import brands available in the United States. Adding in the company's Audi, Bentley and Lamborghini brands, it sold 51,226, a 5.8 percent increase.

HEADLINE: Bank Will Pay Credit Unions $165 Million in a Settlement

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Bank of America has agreed to pay $165 million to settle accusations from the federal agency that regulates credit unions over sales of mortgage-backed securities to corporate credit unions that led them to fail, the agency said on Tuesday. 
Bank of America disclosed in February that it had reached a preliminary agreement with the agency, the National Credit Union Administration, and said the cost of the settlement would be covered by existing reserves, but it did not then disclose the amount it would pay.
The settlement adds to a growing list of mortgage-related legal troubles that Bank of America has been able to put behind it after sustaining more than $40 billion in losses from its home loan business since the financial crisis.
Most of those losses stemmed from its 2008 purchase of Countrywide Financial, once the largest American subprime mortgage lender.
The new settlement is intended to resolve claims over mortgage securities offerings that the regulator had threatened to sue the bank and its Countrywide and Merrill Lynch units over, Bank of America said in its annual report.
A bank spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday beyond the earlier filing. The credit union regulator did not release settlement papers and declined to provide additional details about the deal.
In recent months, Bank of America has moved closer to ending its mortgage troubles, with more than $14 billion in settlements announced in January alone.
Around $3 billion went to end a loan-by-loan review of past foreclosures required by the government. An additional $11.6 billion went to resolve accusations from the mortgage finance company Fannie Mae that the bank had improperly sold mortgages that later soured, and to resolve questions about foreclosure delays.
The bank has also sought to sign a $8.5 billion settlement to resolve claims from private investors who bought shaky securities. That deal is still awaiting approval in state court in New York.
The credit union regulator previously indicated that it objected to that proposed deal, but last week it withdrew its notice of intent to object without providing a reason for the change.
Bank of America did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement, the credit union regulator said.

HEADLINE: A Debate In the Open On the Fed

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
RICHMOND, Va. -- Federal Reserve officials regularly air their views in public speeches, but they rarely engage in public debates. On Tuesday night, two of the officials who disagree most sharply about the Fed's current policy did just that.
The exchange between Charles L. Evans, an outspoken advocate for the Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy, and Jeffrey M. Lacker, the Fed's most persistent internal critic, suggested their differences are as much a matter of temperament as economics. 
Mr. Lacker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said he did not expect the economy to recover the losses sustained during the recession. ''It's hard to talk about the economic outlook without being a little bit of a sourpuss,'' he said during a panel discussion sponsored by Virginia Commonwealth University.
Mr. Evans, describing himself as ''the happy guy in the room,'' said the recovery had been postponed rather than canceled.
Mr. Lacker said he doubted monetary policy had more power to increase growth.
Mr. Evans said the Fed had an obligation to try because unemployment remained high.
Mr. Evans said the Fed would have sufficient warning of inflationary pressures to keep price increases under control. Mr. Lacker said he was worried the Fed was overconfident about its ability to manage the risk.
Both men emphasized that their views could prove to be wrong.
Their basic difference is about whether it would be better to do too little or too much.
The Fed is trying to stimulate the economy by suppressing interest rates, reducing borrowing costs and encouraging risk-taking. It intends to hold short-term rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent. The rate stood at 7.7 percent in February. To hasten that process, the Fed also is buying $85 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.
The Fed's course continues to be set by its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and a centrist majority he has carefully assembled who regard asset purchases as necessary and effective. In recent months, Mr. Bernanke and his supporters have argued forcefully that the risks of doing too little exceed the risks of doing too much.
''I do not claim that there are no costs or risks associated with our unconventional monetary policy regime,'' one of Mr. Bernanke's closest allies, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said last month. ''But I see greater cost and risk in moving prematurely to a policy setting that might not prove sufficiently accommodative to ensure a sustainable, strengthening recovery.''
Mr. Bernanke said last month that the Fed's next step is likely to be a reduction in the volume of monthly asset purchases rather than an abrupt cessation. And even that first step may not come for some time.
Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said Tuesday that he thought the Fed would need to keep buying bonds at least until the end of this year, and possibly into next year.
''There are encouraging developments in the economy, to be sure, but the evidence of sustainable momentum that will deliver 'substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market; is not yet conclusive,'' Mr. Lockhart said. ''I favor a 'wait and watch' mode for the time being. Several more months of positive data -- especially in a range of employment data--would give me confidence that the economy has real traction and is unlikely to backslide.''
Mr. Evans made clear that he, too, wants the Fed to keep buying bonds. He has said that the central bank needs to demonstrate that its commitment to reduce unemployment equals its commitment to control inflation.
The Fed is charged by Congress with minimizing unemployment, which has persisted at high levels since the financial crisis, and stabilizing prices.
''Our credibility will ultimately be judged by how we do on both of these mandates, not just the price mandate,'' Mr. Evans said Tuesday night. ''I think we will be judged very badly'' if officials do not act forcefully to reduce unemployment and instead, he said, ''worry obsessively'' about inflation.
Only one Fed official has gone further than Mr. Evans and suggested that the Fed should increase its efforts to stimulate the economy.
Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, reiterated in a speech Tuesday that the Fed should hold short-term rates near zero at least so long as the unemployment rate was above 5.5 percent, one percentage point lower than the Fed's current 6.5 percent threshold.
Mr. Lacker, by contrast, said Tuesday night that he saw little evidence the Fed's efforts were helping the economy. He said that reflected the limits of monetary policy, particularly the experimental strategies the Fed has deployed in recent years. He also noted that the Fed had repeatedly overestimated the strength of the recovery.
''There's little more that we can do,'' Mr. Lacker said of monetary policy. ''There's little more that we can contribute to growth.''

HEADLINE: Sandbag Season Has Fargo Thinking of a Better Way

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
FARGO, N.D. -- Just last fall, the reservoirs and rivers here in the Red River Valley were so low from drought that Mayor Dennis R. Walaker of Fargo was concerned that the faucets and shower heads in his city would run dry.
Now, Fargo residents are bracing for water that is expected to come rushing over those once-parched riverbanks.
As winter's bite gives way to spring sunshine, weather forecasters are predicting that this region will almost certainly face devastating floods for the fourth time in five years as the snow melts.
If normal weather patterns hold, said Gregory Gust of the National Weather Service, the Red River -- which runs past Fargo and divides North Dakota and Minnesota -- is expected to rise to at least 38.1 feet, which would cause the fifth-worst flood ever recorded here. The record was set just four years ago when the river crested at 40.84 feet and cost the city of Fargo between $40 million and $50 million. 
And so the people of this growing, economically diverse city find themselves again engaged in a tiring spring ritual: On Wednesday, schoolchildren, business owners, city officials and other volunteers will begin the arduous process of filling hundreds of thousands of plastic sacks with fine sand called glacial till to build the dikes that will be the last line of defense for their homes and businesses, fields and roads.
''I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you I lose some sleep over things like this,'' said Joel Livingood, the general manager of the Oxbow Country Club, an 18-hole golf course in Oxbow, N.D., a town of 350 people just south of Fargo.
During the 2009 flood, Mr. Livingood said, the course looked like a lake. The floods of 2010 and 2011, though less severe, also swamped the greens, causing the country club to shut down for months. The region was spared flooding last year, and the club had one of its best seasons ever, Mr. Livingood said, with growing membership and a record number of rounds played.
Now the outlook is grim again.
The region's drought lasted for a year before it broke in October, Mr. Gust said. But since Oct. 1, the rain and snow have been above normal. When overnight temperatures stay above freezing -- which they are expected to do as early as next week -- the melting ice and snow will dump too much water into the Red River, which currently sits around 14 feet. The river will unquestionably get to 30 feet, Mr. Gust said, and that leads to major flooding. Whether it reaches the 2009 levels will depend on how quickly the snow melts.
With sandbagging, Mr. Livingood said, his golf course could be saved if the river crests at 33 feet. But if the water rises to 36 feet, he said, the greens and fairways will be drowned again, and the club could lose 10 percent to 20 percent in revenue.
''It's tough to have that constant battle every year, and that constant worry,'' he said.
The people here have yearned for years for permanent protection to alleviate the back-straining and uncertainty of sandbagging and erecting clay dikes. There is some hope on that front.
Since 2009, more than 14 miles of permanent levees have been built in Fargo, and the city has bought and razed houses in flood-prone areas. Plans are under way to build a $1.8 billion system that will funnel the rising waters around the city through 35 miles of channels.
The state has set aside $75 million for the project, with an additional $102 million proposed in the governor's budget. Cass County and Fargo, which is its largest city, have increased sales taxes to generate more than $200 million for the diversion. Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, said he hoped that the Senate would authorize the project by next month and that it would pass in the House by the end of the year. Local officials anticipate beginning construction next year, and they estimate it will take about eight and a half years to build.
''We will save money by getting permanent protection in place, versus spending money to fight a flood every year,'' Mr. Hoeven said.
The almost-yearly floods have fed the sense of urgency that a permanent barrier is needed. A flood in 1997 devastated Grand Forks, N.D., about an hour north of here, but that city is now fortified by a series of flood walls. In a way, Fargo has been so successful in its makeshift defenses that it took a stretch like the recent series of floods to get people fed up.
''When you have a 100-year flood four years out of five, that's a great challenge,'' Gov. Jack Dalrymple said.
Not everyone is happy about the flood-protection plans.
The diversion system calls for a staging area near Oxbow that will be flooded for several days before the water is released into the channels. A dike will circle Oxbow and the surrounding towns in hopes of protecting them.
Mike Bice, who owns a bar in nearby Hickson, said the staging area would divert floodwaters to high ground that does not usually flood. The diversion would be more effective if the water were routed farther north, Mr. Bice said, but he believed that Fargo officials were reluctant to do that because they wanted to preserve that land for development.
But Mayor Jim Nyhof of Oxbow, a supporter of the diversion project, said that the staging area does get some flooding, and that taking in more water there would be worth it in exchange for a permanent dike.
Some residents of the 42-home Oak Creek neighborhood in Fargo are angry about the city's attempt to buy about a dozen properties there to build a dike. The city has approved the construction of million-dollar homes there in recent years, said Gary Cavett, who lives in Oak Creek, and razing part of the neighborhood, he added, could depress home values and cost the city millions in property tax revenue. Mr. Cavett, 65, said the city could preserve the homes and still build a dike with some reinforcements to the banks of a neighborhood creek.
The city is trying to buy the home that Mr. Cavett and his wife built about 20 years ago, but he said the offer was only about half of what it would cost to rebuild a similar house elsewhere in Fargo. The home's sentimental value is contributing to his resistance.
''We don't like the flood; we don't like sandbagging, it's extremely stressful,'' Mr. Cavett said. But, he later added: ''We just like living here. They say you shouldn't become that attached to your home, but it's our home. We've become attached to it.''

HEADLINE: My Little (Global) School

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
There was a time when middle-class parents in America could be -- and were -- content to know that their kids' public schools were better than those in the next neighborhood over. As the world has shrunk, though, the next neighborhood over is now Shanghai or Helsinki. So, last August, I wrote a column quoting Andreas Schleicher -- who runs the global exam that compares how 15-year-olds in public schools around the world do in applied reading, math and science skills -- as saying imagine, in a few years, that you could sign on to a Web site and see how your school compares with a similar school anywhere in the world. And then you could take this information to your superintendent and ask: ''Why are we not doing as well as schools in China or Finland?'' 
Well, that day has come, thanks to a successful pilot project involving 105 U.S. schools recently completed by Schleicher's team at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which coordinates the Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA test, and Jon Schnur's team at America Achieves, which partnered with the O.E.C.D. Starting this fall, any high school in America will be able to benchmark itself against the world's best schools, using a new tool that schools can register for at www.americaachieves.org. It is comparable to PISA and measures how well students can apply their mastery of reading, math and science to real world problems.
The pilot study was described in an America Achieves report entitled ''Middle Class or Middle of the Pack?'' that is being released Wednesday. The report compares U.S. middle-class students to their global peers of similar socioeconomic status on the 2009 PISA exams.
The bad news is that U.S. middle-class students are badly lagging their peers globally. ''Many assume that poverty in America is pulling down the overall U.S. scores,'' the report said, ''but when you divide each nation into socioeconomic quarters, you can see that even America's middle-class students are falling behind not only students of comparable advantage, but also more disadvantaged students in several other countries.''
American students in the second quarter of socioeconomic advantage -- mostly higher middle class -- were significantly outperformed by 24 countries in math and by 15 countries in science, the study found. In the third quarter of socioeconomic advantage -- mostly lower middle class -- U.S. students were significantly outperformed by peers in 31 countries or regions in math and 25 in science.
The good news, though, said Schnur, ''is that, for the first time, we have documented that there are individual U.S. schools that are literally outperforming every country in the world.''
''BASIS Tucson North, a nonselective high school serving an economically modest middle-class student population in Arizona, outperformed the average of every country in the world in reading, math, and science,'' the report said. ''Three nonselective high schools in Fairfax, Va., outperformed the average of virtually every country in the world.'' One of them, Woodson, outperformed every region in the world in reading, except Shanghai. But the pilot also exposed some self-deception. ''One school, serving students similar to Woodson's, lags behind 29 countries in math but received an A on its state's accountability system based primarily on that state's own test,'' Schnur said.
Paul Bambrick-Santoyo is managing director of North Star Academies in Newark, an Uncommon Schools network of nine low-income charter schools that took part and cracked the world's Top 10. ''We have always had state tests and SATs,'' he told me, ''but we never had an international metric. This was a golden opportunity to see where we stand -- if we have to prepare our kids to succeed not only in this country but in a global marketplace.'' He said he was particularly motivated by the fact that Shanghai's low-income kids ''could outperform'' most U.S. schools, because this gave his school a real international peer for a benchmark.
''We got 157 pages of feedback'' from participating in the pilot, added Jack Dale, the superintendent of Fairfax County's schools, which is so valuable because the PISA test exposes whether your high school students can apply their math, science and reading skills to 21st-century problems. ''One of my principals said to me: 'This is not your Virginia Standards of Learning Test.' ''
So what's the secret of the best-performing schools? It's that there is no secret. The best schools, the study found, have strong fundamentals and cultures that believe anything is possible with any student: They ''work hard to choose strong teachers with good content knowledge and dedication to continuous improvement.'' They are ''data-driven and transparent, not only around learning outcomes, but also around soft skills like completing work on time, resilience, perseverance -- and punctuality.'' And they promote ''the active engagement of our parents and families.''
''If you look at all the data,'' concluded Schnur, it's clear that educational performance in the U.S. has not gone down. We've actually gotten a little better. The challenge is that changes in the world economy keep raising the bar for what our kids need to do to succeed. Our modest improvements are not keeping pace with this rising bar. Those who say we have failed are wrong. Those who say we are doing fine are wrong.'' The truth is, America has world-beating K-12 schools. We just don't have nearly enough.

HEADLINE: Revamping Euro-Atlantic Security

BYLINE: By DES BROWNE, WOLFGANG ISCHINGER, IGOR IVANOV and SAM NUNN

 BODY:
Security policies in the Euro-Atlantic region -- an area that includes six of the world's 10 largest economies, four of the five declared nuclear weapon states, and more than 95 percent of global nuclear inventories -- are dangerously out of date and demand urgent attention. With a new approach that is grounded in today's opportunities and challenges, the European community, Russia and the United States can chart a more secure path for their people and the world and avoid the risks and costs of a new downward spiral in relations between states.
The first step is to get out from under Cold War-era strategies and tactics that are ill-suited to the real threats we face. Today, the likelihood of a devastating conventional or nuclear conflict in the Euro-Atlantic region has dramatically declined, yet Cold War--era security concepts and their associated weapons and military postures continue. Large strategic nuclear forces remain deployed on prompt launch, ready to be fired in minutes; thousands of tactical nuclear weapons are still stockpiled in Europe; a decades-old missile defense debate remains stuck in neutral; and new security challenges associated with prompt-strike forces, cybersecurity, and space remain contentious and inadequately addressed. 
Our publics are paying the price for this policy inertia, which, in addition to raising their security risks, needlessly increases costs for defense and misdirects resources away from fiscal demands, domestic priorities and emerging security challenges and threats. Moreover, the alarming asymmetry between military capabilities and a true Euro-Atlantic partnership is dangerous and potentially destabilizing, undermining the trust necessary for cooperative efforts to meet emerging security threats in Europe and across the world.
Over the past year, we have been working with more than 30 senior political, military and security experts from across the Euro-Atlantic area to develop a regional approach to addressing these challenges. Our group includes generals who commanded the most deadly nuclear arsenals ever deployed, and many other senior military and civilian leaders who have served on both sides of the Cold War in France, Germany, Russia, Britain, the United States and NATO.
Our group concluded that today's leaders should move decisively and permanently toward a new security strategy, one that considers offensive and defensive military forces, nuclear and conventional weapons, and cybersecurity and space. Thinking together about these issues in an integrated way can lead to transformational change in Euro-Atlantic security and nuclear and conventional force postures -- from the persistent Cold War shadow of mutually assured destruction to mutual security. This focused and sustained effort can increase stability, reduce the risk of conflict, eliminate remaining bilateral and regional disputes, and save precious resources.
Our recommendations to guide these essential policy changes have been prepared for presidents, prime ministers, parliamentarians and publics. The key to this strategy is a new continuing process of dialogue involving senior civilian and military leaders mandated by the highest political levels, where security could be discussed comprehensively and practical steps could be taken on a broad range of issues.
Within this flexible framework for dialogue, issues relating to nuclear weapons and missile defense should receive the highest priority in the first five years. It should also be possible to take steps relating to conventional forces, cybersecurity and space during the initial phase.
Reducing the role of nuclear weapons as an essential part of any nation's overall security posture -- without jeopardizing the security of any of the parties -- should be among the core principles guiding this new dialogue. This should include practical steps to increase decision time and crisis stability for leaders, in particular with respect to U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear forces. Even under the latest nuclear arms treaty, each country will maintain thousands of nuclear warheads on hundreds of ballistic missiles ready for prompt launch and capable of hitting their targets in less than 30 minutes. This status increases the risk that a decision to use ballistic missiles will be made in haste based on false warning, as well as the risk of an accidental or unauthorized missile launch.
What are the costs of persistent inaction in defining a fresh approach to mutual security? While there is much more at stake here than ''guns versus butter,'' in the area of nuclear weapons alone, the potential price tag is breathtaking. The United States is poised to embark on programs to build new nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarines and strategic bombers at a cost of more than $400 billion, and to extend the life of nuclear weapons deployed in Europe at a cost of $10 billion. Russia reportedly plans to spend 1.9 trillion rubles, or $61 billion, over the next decade to modernize its strategic nuclear forces, while the United Kingdom estimates the cost of Trident replacement at £25 billion, or $38 billion. A new approach to security would not save every one of these dollars, rubles, pounds, or euros from being spent, but over time the savings could be substantial -- and they could multiply in the non-nuclear areas of security policy.
A new approach for building mutual security in the Euro-Atlantic region can lead to a more secure and promising future for all our citizens. There is an historic -- and fleeting -- opportunity to act. There is no more important security issue for leaders to address.
Des Browne, former British defense secretary, is convener of the European Leadership Network. Wolfgang Ischinger, former German deputy foreign minister, is chairman of the Munich Security Conference. Igor Ivanov, former Russian foreign minister, is president of the Russian International Affairs Council. Sam Nunn, former U.S. senator, is co-chairman of the Nuclear Threat Initiative. They are co-chairmen of the ''Building Mutual Security in the Euro-Atlantic Region'' initiative.

HEADLINE: Euro Zone Unemployment Reaches a Record at 12%

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- While the euro zone has been transfixed lately by the Cyprus meltdown, another and potentially bigger European crisis has continued to simmer: record-high unemployment.
Spending cuts and tax increases aimed at trimming debt and addressing the financial crises in bailed-out euro zone countries, and the rising rate of joblessness in much of the currency bloc, ''are feeding off of each other,'' said Mark Cliffe, chief economist at ING Group.
''It's a bit of a vicious circle,'' he said. ''Europe is pursuing a policy that is self-evidently failing.''
The euro zone jobless rate rose to 12.0 percent in the first two months of the year, the latest in a series of record highs tracing to late 2011, Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, reported Tuesday. 
The agency revised upward the January jobless rate for the euro zone from the previously reported 11.9 percent, itself a record. For the overall European Union, Eurostat said the February jobless rate rose to 10.9 percent from 10.8 percent in January, with more than 26 million people without work across the 27-nation bloc.
Both the jobless rates and the number of unemployed are the highest Eurostat has recorded in data that reach back to 1995, before the creation of the euro.
Europe's rising unemployment is in increasingly stark contrast to the jobs recovery in the United States, where unemployment in February declined to 7.7 percent, the lowest level since late 2008. The consensus among economists surveyed by Reuters is for the U.S. economy to show a gain of 200,000 jobs in March, after a gain of 236,000 in February. The labor data will be released Friday.
With most European economies either contracting or barely growing, any hiring that is being done by Europe's companies tends to be taking place elsewhere. Volkswagen, aspiring to become the world's largest automaker within a few years, is planning to hire 50,000 workers by 2018, raising its total work force to 600,000 employees, according to Bernd Osterloh, the chairman of the German carmaker's workers council.
But the company wants to add production where the demand is.
''Volkswagen is growing, and is therefore continuing to hire in production,'' Mr. Osterloh said in an article that appeared Tuesday in the German daily Handelsblatt. More of the new employees will be added in China than in Europe, he told the newspaper.
The European car market, meanwhile, is at its lowest level in nearly two decades -- a side effect of the weak regional economy and the growing number of people without paychecks to spend.
After Greece's staggering debt problems became apparent in 2009, political leaders and the European Central Bank began demanding that member nations cut government spending and raise taxes to bring their budgets in line with European rules. Those efforts, along with a commitment from the E.C.B. to do whatever is necessary to defend the euro, have helped to ease the near-panic that has gripped the euro zone as recently as last year.
But lower government spending also reduces overall demand for goods and services, weakening the overall economy and the labor market.
In the absence of new measures to stimulate growth at the European and national levels, all attention will be focused Thursday on the governing council of the European Central Bank, which meets in Frankfurt to consider whether to maintain interest rates at their current record low or cut even further. Economists said that the data Tuesday would give the E.C.B. greater scope to cut its main interest rate target from the current 0.75 percent, but that the bank would probably hold its fire for now.
The jobless crisis is hitting hardest in the south of Europe. Eurostat said Greece, with its economy in free fall, had the euro zone's highest unemployment rate ,at 26.4 percent in December, the latest month for which data are available. Among Greek youth, the jobless rate has hit a staggering level, 58.4 percent.
Spain, where the economy has contracted sharply after the collapse of the global credit bubble, posted the second-highest unemployment rate in the euro zone in February, at 26.3 percent.
Cyprus's jobless rate, at 14.0 percent, is almost certain to rise because the country's recently negotiated bailout deal will crimp the economy for years to come, said Mr. Cliffe, of ING. ''We've already seen how this story plays out in Greece,'' he said. ''We're about to see it play out again in Cyprus.''
Austria had the euro zone's lowest jobless rate, at 4.8 percent. Britain, the largest E.U. economy outside the single currency bloc, had an unemployment rate of 7.7 percent in December, the latest available month.
The European labor market has now declined for 22 straight months, making this the worst downturn since the early 1990s, Jennifer McKeown, an economist in London with Capital Economics, wrote in a research note Tuesday. ''With fiscal tightening still putting downward pressure on disposable incomes and consumer confidence at very low levels, household spending is likely to fall further in the coming months,'' Ms. McKeown said.
Ms. McKeown also noted that the France's February jobless rate at 10.8 percent -- double the German rate of 5.4 percent -- ''looks very worrying.''
Philippe d'Arvisenet, global chief economist of BNP Paribas, said France had lost competitiveness relative to Germany over recent years, as Berlin overhauled the labor market to hold costs down while Paris had stood by as wages outgrew productivity.
President François Hollande's government is taking positive steps, he said, including labor market reforms and budget consolidation, but it will take time.
''Labor reform and fiscal consolidation are done in Germany,'' Mr. d'Arvisenet said. ''But we still have a lot to do in France.''
One company bucking the unemployment trend is the aircraft maker Airbus, with an order backlog of seven years and the bulk of its sales outside Europe. Anne Galabert, a spokeswoman, said about 90 percent of the company's 3,000 new hires this year will be in Europe, about the same percentage as the more than 10,000 people Airbus hired in the two years spanning 2011 and 2012.
But the company, a unit of European Aeronautic Defense and Space, which is partly owned by the French, German and Spanish governments, may feel pressure to maintain employment in its home markets.
European officials continue to hold out hope that the economy, which continued to shrink in the first quarter of 2013, will begin turning around in the second half of the year. Many private-sector forecasters are more pessimistic, expecting a contraction of as much as 2 percent in the euro zone's gross domestic product this year, after a 0.9 percent contraction last year.
Mr. Cliffe said it was unlikely that European officials would consider any change of course before Germany's national elections, in September, as a combination of bailout fatigue and German electoral politics had halted any discussion of action on the labor market, banking union or the possibility of jointly issued euro bonds.
''The only other hope is that the global economy turns up,'' he said. ''But so far that seems unlikely.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Growing World of Women's Conferences

BYLINE: By LUISITA LOPEZ TORREGROSA

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Melanne Verveer ought to know. She's been at it for more than 15 years, pushing, pleading, traveling, carrying her message to the powerful and the weak. While pounding away at male-dominated cultures, she has managed to help bring a crucial measure of rights and economic advancement to women and girls worldwide.
''I feel heartened by the progress, but aware that many challenges remain,'' Ms. Verveer, who will be a co-host at the Women in the World Summit in New York this week and who served as ambassador at large for global women's issues in the U.S. State Department, said in a phone call from Venice last week. 
''There's been a great deal of progress in government policies, education, civil society, and in the private sector,'' she said. ''We're moving in a way we've not seen before.''
Tina Brown, the Newsweek and Daily Beast editor who co-founded Women in the World, calls this juncture a ''tipping point for women.''
''There's the outcry in India'' over a history of gang rapes, she said. The rapes most recently ignited protests in Delhi, led mainly by women, and drew the attention of the world to India's disregard for women's rights and safety. A study released Sunday reports a sharp drop in the number of foreign tourists, especially women, to India. Taken by surprise and shamed into action, the government promised to protect women and prosecute rapists and sexual abusers.
Women in the World, which features women from diverse cultures and backgrounds, brings in celebrities, media stars and fashion figures. Since it started in 2010, it has leaped to the forefront of the scene, drawing thousands of chief executives, world leaders, artists and activists to a tightly packed program at Lincoln Center. ''We have been a galvanizing force,'' Ms. Brown said in a phone interview. ''We've fomented debate.''
Of course, many women's conferences crowd the global calendar. A quick rundown includes:
The 57th session of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, which advanced an initiative to prevent and end violence against women and girls;
The inaugural Trust Women conference in London, organized last year by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and the International Herald Tribune, which seeks to put the rule of law behind women's rights;
The World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, previewed her hot book, ''Lean In'';
The Catalyst awards dinner in New York, which rewards multinational corporations for advancing women in business;
The 2013 Vital Voices Global Partnership gala Tuesday in Washington, to celebrate little-known women and high-profile figures who foster rights and development.
''On our side it's very different,'' Ms. Brown said. ''It's driven by a news edge. We show stories of women that the media doesn't anymore have the ability to tell. We provide a stage, a platform, a voice. We promote the women. We put them up on television. We give them a heightened platform.'' For the rest of the year, she said, the Women in the World Foundation acts as ''the connector,'' putting women in touch with each other, linking people to money. ''We're making a lot of headway.''
Though Ms. Verveer and Ms. Brown said they didn't worry about a convention glut, some leaders are concerned.
''I worry it's now the big thing,'' an official of a Washington-based nonprofit group told me recently, requesting anonymity to avoid any appearance of undercutting a specific group or gathering.
''We have to be mindful and clear about what real services we are providing,'' she said. ''It's not enough to bring victims and advocates from oppressive cultures to the big stage and give them the spotlight. What happens after the conference is over and everyone goes home?''
With all of these forums and conventions, there is plenty of cross-pollination and overlap. This week, Ms. Brown and Diane von Furstenberg, Ms. Verveer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, all featured on the Women in the World program, were also headlining the Vital Voices dinner. (Ms. Verveer, executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security in Washington, will be co-hosts of Women in the World after accepting a tribute at Vital Voices, which she co-founded as an outgrowth of a 1997 initiative by Mrs. Clinton, then the first lady, and Madeleine Albright, then the U.S. secretary of state.)
Among the scheduled speakers at the Vital Voices dinner was the New York Times columnist Nicholas D. Kristof, who wrote the best-selling book ''Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide'' with his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, with whom he shares a Pulitzer Prize. The book served in part to originate the Female Factor series in the International Herald Tribune and is now a transmedia project including a PBS documentary filmed in 10 countries. The documentary examines health, education and economic advancements as well as sex trafficking, forced prostitution, forced marriage and female genital mutilation.
None of those problems are going away in hardened male-dominated societies. In Egypt, conservative Islamists blame not men, but women themselves, for the appalling number of sexual attacks and gang rapes at Tahrir Square in Cairo, as The New York Times reported. ''Sometimes a girl contributes one hundred percent to her own raping,'' a lawmaker was quoted as saying.
For Ms. Brown, those are some of the stories the world needs to hear. ''We want electrifying action and involvement, spotlighting women in the world who have none,'' she said. ''We talk a lot in America about a lot of issues about getting to the corner office'' -- an allusion to the Sheryl Sandberg credo -- ''but these women are fighting for basic rights, and I want to bring the spotlight to them.''

HEADLINE: House Immigration Bill Is Said to Offer 3 Paths

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the shadow of a bipartisan Senate group preparing to roll out broad immigration legislation next week, shortly after Congress returns from its holiday break, a bipartisan group of eight House members is readying its own bill.
In contrast to the Senate plan -- which would provide one clear, if difficult, path to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country -- the House legislation will most likely offer three distinct paths to legal status. 
Young immigrants in the country without legal papers, who often call themselves ''Dreamers,'' and low-skilled agricultural workers would qualify for an expedited road to legal status, people familiar with the negotiations said. The Dreamers should not be punished for being brought illegally to the country by their parents, House aides said, and the members agreed that the agricultural workers perform crucial work for the economy.
In an opinion article in The Los Angeles Times on Sunday, Representative Raúl R. Labrador, a Republican member of the group from Idaho, more explicitly laid out the path for Dreamers: ''Those who entered the U.S. as children, through no fault of their own, will be allowed to have a pathway to citizenship.''
The second group to receive a path to legal permanent residence would be immigrants who have either a family or an employment relationship that would allow them to apply for legal status, except that they have already entered the country illegally. Currently, most of those immigrants would have to return to their home country for either 3 or 10 years before they would be eligible to reapply.
The House bill would most likely relax or waive those barriers. Immigrants would then have to return to their home country to apply for legal status, aides said, but could do so only after completing a series of hurdles including paying fines and back taxes and learning English, aides said.
The remaining illegal immigrants could apply for ''provisional legal status'' if they came forward and admitted breaking the law, paid fines and back taxes, and learned English, much as they could under the Senate plan, aides said. This status would allow them to live, work and travel in the country legally, and they could then apply through regular channels for a green card after 10 years and citizenship 5 years after that.
This comprise seems to mollify both sides: Republicans could reassure their base that illegal immigrants would not receive a special path to citizenship, while Democrats are satisfied because the plan would allow for the option of citizenship down the road.
A Democrat in the House group, Representative Luis V. Gutierrez of Illinois, wrote last month in The Orange County Register: ''It seems that the Republican bottom line when it comes to how to legalize undocumented immigrants in the U.S. is that we do not create a 'new special path to citizenship' for only undocumented immigrants outside the paths we make available to all immigrants.''
''On the Democratic side,'' he added, ''we want to make sure we do not preclude anyone from citizenship who would be legalized under immigration reform.''
The House group is still debating what benefits, if any, immigrants would receive during their provisional legal status, though a Republican with knowledge of the talks said the group had agreed that no government-subsidized benefits would be included. The group is also discussing what border security standards would need to be met before any path to legal permanent residence could begin.
Another sticking point is a guest worker program. Though the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the nation's largest federation of unions, have reached an agreement that the Senate group is adopting, Republicans in the House group remain wary of the deal.
Aides to the House group have been meeting during the recess, and the members hope to release their bill before the senators officially announce theirs. Though some senators have promised to unveil their bill next week, staff members on the House side remained skeptical.
''If they do, I will be shocked,'' one said. ''If they do, I will buy them all dinner.''

HEADLINE: North Korea Says It Will Restart Mothballed Nuclear Reactor

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN and MARK LANDLER; Choe Sang-hun reported from Seoul, and Mark Landler from Washington.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea announced plans on Tuesday to restart a mothballed nuclear reactor, the latest in a series of provocations by its leader, Kim Jong-un, to elicit a muted response from American officials, who believe they can wait out Mr. Kim's threats until he realizes his belligerent behavior will not force South Korea or the United States into making any concessions.
''Right now, they're testing the proposition that we'll choose peace and quiet, and put it on our MasterCard,'' said a senior American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the administration's internal calculations. ''When they get through this cycle, they will have gotten no return on their investment.'' 
Secretary of State John Kerry, using time-tested diplomatic language, said North Korea's plan to restart the reactor would be a ''provocative act'' and ''a direct violation of their international obligations.'' Speaking in Washington after his first meeting with South Korea's foreign minister, Yun Byung-se, Mr. Kerry reaffirmed the determination of the United States to defend its ally.
American officials still worry about the consequences of any miscalculation, given the hair-trigger tensions on the Korean Peninsula and Mr. Kim's inexperience at this type of brinkmanship. The top American commander in South Korea, Gen. James D. Thurman, called the situation ''tense'' and ''volatile'' in an interview with ABC News.
But the senior official predicted that North Korea would eventually back down, as Mr. Kim's need for food aid and hard currency outweighed the domestic political gains from his threats to shoot missiles at American cities.
''The North Koreans want the international community to feed their people, fuel their factories and fill their bank accounts,'' the official said. ''If North Korea were a self-sufficient enterprise, we would have a much bigger problem on our hands.''
Still, the announcements by the North's General Department of Atomic Energy were troubling on a couple of levels: The plan to restart the reactor at the main nuclear complex in Yongbyon reverses gains from a short-lived 2007 nuclear disarmament deal with the United States. And its plan to use a uranium-enrichment plant on the site for the weapons program gives it two ways of producing fuel for bombs, since the reactor produces plutonium.
The announcements came two days after Mr. Kim said his nuclear weapons were not a bargaining chip and called for expanding the arsenal in ''quality and quantity'' during a meeting of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea.
It was the first time North Korea had said it would use the uranium plant to make nuclear weapons. Since unveiling it to a visiting American scholar in 2010, North Korea had insisted it was running the plant to make reactor fuel to generate electricity, though Washington suggested that its purpose was bombs.
The five-megawatt, graphite-moderated reactor, which experts say would require significant effort to bring back on line, had been the main source of plutonium bomb fuel until it was shut down under the deal with the United States. North Korean engineers are believed to have extracted enough plutonium for six to eight bombs from the spent fuel unloaded from the reactor.
It is unknown whether North Korea's third nuclear test in February used some of its limited stockpile of plutonium or fuel from its uranium-enrichment program, whose scale and history remain a mystery.
Mr. Kim has recently raised tensions with a torrent of threats to attack the United States and South Korea with pre-emptive nuclear strikes. But this week, he appeared to shift his tone slightly by reiterating that his nuclear weapons were a deterrent that helped his country focus on more pressing domestic economic issues.
The White House said it was reaching out to China and Russia to encourage them to use their influence to urge restraint on Pyongyang. The senior American official said the new Chinese leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, was frustrated by Mr. Kim's belligerence, which it viewed as a threat to China's own security. And Mr. Yun of South Korea said the Chinese had been cooperative since the passage of the latest United Nations sanctions.
China's official Xinhua news agency issued comments from Deputy Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui that did not expressly single out North Korea but nonetheless signaled deepening worry about its actions and the response from the United States and its allies.
''We do not want to see war or turmoil break out on the peninsula, and we oppose provocative words and actions by any side,'' Mr. Zhang said, using more urgent language than his government has tended to use until now.
On Wednesday, North Korea blocked traffic across the heavily armed border to an industrial park it has run with South Korea for eight years. It was unclear whether the action resulted from a communications problem or represented the end of one of the last symbols of North-South cooperation.

HEADLINE: Once Hobbled, New York Developer Aims for Comeback

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
David Lichtenstein presided over one of the biggest real estate debacles of the last economic cycle. In 2009, only two years after he bought a portfolio of nearly 700 hotels for $8 billion, almost all of it borrowed, he filed for bankruptcy protection.
The failure of the overleveraged Extended Stay Hotels deal cost Mr. Lichtenstein's lenders billions of dollars, set off a raft of lawsuits and required him to pay more than $100 million for breaking a pledge to stay out of bankruptcy court.
He described the experience as ''humbling,'' but Mr. Lichtenstein, 52, has not spent the last few years licking his wounds. Instead, he is trying to take his company in a new direction by starting several ambitious projects in New York, a market he had largely shied away from in the past.
In March, the city planning commission authorized Mr. Lichtenstein's company, the Lightstone Group, to go ahead with plans to build 700 units of rental housing on the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. The site was acquired after Toll Brothers, the home-building company based in Horsham, Pa., abandoned plans to develop luxury condominiums there. 
Lightstone and the Macerich Company of Santa Monica, Calif., plan to replace the Whitestone Multiplex Cinema in the Bronx with the city's first outlet mall. And Mr. Lichtenstein has assembled a site between Fulton and John Streets in Lower Manhattan for a 450,000-square-foot retail-and-residential tower.
These three projects are still being planned, but construction is well under way on a fourth -- a 12-story, 199-unit residential development at Second Street and 50th Avenue, in Long Island City.
Though he is a Brooklyn native, Mr. Lichtenstein used to hunt mainly for overlooked real estate opportunities outside New York. But he said the city's resiliency after the recession led him back to his hometown.
''People from all over the world want to be in New York,'' he said in an interview in his Park Avenue offices. ''This rather simple idea took me a long time to learn.''
Mr. Lichtenstein's entry into the New York market has been greatly facilitated by the cash he amassed from his biggest success: the 2010 sale of 22 Prime Outlet shopping centers to Simon Property Group, the nation's largest mall operator, for $2.3 billion. He bought Prime in 2003 for $638 million.
In recent months, Mr. Lichtenstein has put together a team of prominent real estate executives, including Mitchell C. Hochberg, who founded the residential developer Spectrum Communities and later sold it to WCI Communities; Dennis Freed, a former senior vice president of the Lend Lease Corporation, who has supervised construction of several dozen buildings in New York; and Veronica Hackett, the founder of the Clarett Group, a New York office and residential developer that ceased operations in 2011, who is overseeing the Gowanus project.
Community opposition to the project intensified after the canal, which was declared a Superfund cleanup site in 2010, overflowed during Hurricane Sandy.
But the protests faltered because the development site, a former junkyard between Carroll and Second Streets, had already been rezoned from manufacturing to residential use in 2009, when Toll Brothers planned to put up 447 luxury condos there.
The Lightstone project will have a greater number of units, but they will be smaller rental apartments. ''It's exactly the same envelope as the Toll project,'' Ms. Hackett said. She said that even before Hurricane Sandy, Lightstone had planned to install floodgates and elevate the building.
Brad Lander, the city councilman who represents Gowanus, said it was shortsighted for the city to rezone the industrial neighborhood one lot at a time. ''We need a comprehensive plan for the area,'' he said
Though Lightstone received $51 million in financing from the Canadian bank C.I.B.C. for the Long Island City development, construction loans for other projects may prove more challenging. A lawyer and former banker with firsthand knowledge of the Extended Stay case -- who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing future dealings with Mr. Lichtenstein -- said some banks would no longer do business with Mr. Lichtenstein because of the legal battles related to Extended Stay. ''Some lenders will never lend to him again -- period, end of story,'' said the banker.
But Mr. Hochberg said Lightstone had received 12 loans in the last year, from both major and regional banks.
Banks were only too eager to lend to Mr. Lichtenstein at the peak of the market in 2007, even though he had no previous experience in the lodging business.
But he had to promise that if he voluntarily filed for bankruptcy protection, which would reduce the value of their collateral, he would pay his lenders a so-called bad-boy penalty of $100 million. Mr. Lichtenstein initially resisted paying the money, but finally wrote the check last spring. Lenders are still fighting over which of them are entitled to the money.
Monty J. Bennett, the chief executive of Ashford Hospitality Trust of Dallas, which wrote down its $98 million mezzanine loan, said he believed that Mr. Lichtenstein had been on the verge of restructuring the deal and could have avoided bankruptcy. ''It certainly would have been much better for the lenders,'' he said.
Last year, Mr. Lichtenstein took the unusual step of suing his lawyers at the New York law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher for malpractice, saying they had incorrectly advised him that a bankruptcy filing was his only option. (In court documents, the law firm characterized the suit as ''a transparent sideshow'' that is ''wholly devoid of factual or legal merit.'')
Another pending lawsuit filed by creditors accuses Mr. Lichtenstein of contributing to the lodging company's insolvency by siphoning tens of millions of dollars of hotel revenues to reap substantial asset management fees and pay back investors. The suit was based on the findings of a court-appointed examiner who filed a 452-page report.
Labeling the allegations absurd, Mr. Lichtenstein said his management fees amounted to only $1 million a year, a fraction of the value of the deal.
He added that his major investors, who included Joseph Chetrit, the new owner of the Sony Building in Midtown Manhattan, had what is known as a preferred equity position. Not paying them ''would have been a default under our mortgage,'' he said.
At a time when major real estate companies are streamlining their portfolios to achieve more focus, Lightstone is unusually diverse. Its holdings include 11,000 apartment units on the East Coast; 15 hotels, including three newly acquired Marriott hotels in the Midwest; and more than 2,300 acres of land for residential development. It also develops outlet malls, most recently in Livermore, Calif., and Dallas.
''I'm an extrovert,'' Mr. Lichtenstein said, in accounting for his company's varied portfolio. ''The company is a reflection of that.''
Lightstone is a privately held company, but it raises money by selling shares in illiquid real estate investment trusts that are not publicly traded.
The son of teachers, Mr. Lichtenstein likes to underscore his points with parables. In January, he lectured students from the Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School in Manhattan on the importance of moral conduct in their professional lives.
One lesson he has drawn from the Extended Stay experience is to avoid large gambles. ''When you take smaller gambles, no one particular deal can be big enough to have a material adverse effect on the company,'' he said.
But he said this failure needed to be seen in the context of a mostly successful career. ''To be human is to err, isn't it?'' he said.

HEADLINE: Rate Increase for Private Medicare Buoys an Uncertain Market

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Tuesday, led by the health care sector after the government said it would alter payment rates for private Medicare insurers, and helped by data on factory orders that indicated the economy was steadily improving.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average closed at nominal highs, though the S.& P. fell short of breaking above its milestone intraday high of 1,576.09.
The federal government dropped plans to cut payments for private Medicare Advantage insurers, and instead said it would allow a 3.3 percent raise. 
The news improved shares of some health insurers, including Humana, which derives about two-thirds of its revenue from the Medicare Advantage business. The stock jumped 5.5 percent to $79.11 and was among the biggest percentage gainers on the S.& P. 500. UnitedHealth Group gained 4.7 percent to $61.74.
''They didn't expect the result that they got. That will help with their bottom line,'' said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, N.J.
Strengthening economic data has helped stocks rally since the start of the year. On Tuesday, data showed February factory orders rose 3 percent, slightly above expectations. That follows a weak reading on manufacturing on Monday that sparked a pullback in stocks.
The S.& P. 500-stock index is now up 10.1 percent since the start of the year.
For the day, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 89.16 points, or 0.61 percent, at 14,662.01. The S.& P. 500 was up 8.08 points, or 0.52 percent, at 1,570.25. The Nasdaq composite index was up 15.69 points, or 0.48 percent, at 3,254.86.
The S.& P. 500 surpassed its 2007 closing high last Thursday, while the Dow first broke above its 2007 record on March 5.
Stocks pared gains late in the session, giving investors another reason to question the strength of the recent rally.
''The recent legs of this rally have lacked a bit of conviction,'' said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. ''What's been leading equity markets has been more defensive sectors.''
Health care sector stocks are still seen as cheap relative to the overall market. Humana, which has a market cap of about $11.9 billion, has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.4, below the S.& P. 500 P/E average ratio of about 16.5. UnitedHealth has a P/E ratio of 10.6 and Cigna, 9.7 ratio.
''We do think that health care stocks are a nice combination of dividend yields, growth and low valuations, and we are very constructive on the sector,'' said Jim Russell, senior equity strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Cincinnati.
Other big gainers in the health care sector included Cigna, up 2.9 percent at $64.75.
Moves are expected to be limited this week before Friday's employment report.
The March jobs report could give clues on how successful the Federal Reserve has been in lowering unemployment, one of the primary headwinds for the economy.
About 200,000 jobs were created last month, according to a Reuters poll, down from 236,000 in February. The unemployment rate is expected to come in at 7.7 percent, unchanged from the previous month, the poll showed.
In an effort to bring down the unemployment rate, the Fed has maintained an accommodative monetary policy, which has also benefited stocks.
Other gainers included Hertz Global Holdings shares, up 6.8 percent to $23.41, after the company forecast strong earnings and revenue through 2015 as a result of increasing global demand for car rentals and benefits from its recently completed acquisition of Dollar Thrifty.
Among decliners, Delta Air Lines was off 8.1 percent at $14.94. Delta's unit revenue for March rose at a slower rate than in the prior two months.
Shares of the Nasdaq OMX Group fell 12.8 percent to $27.91 after agreeing to buy a BGC Partners trading platform. BGC shares were up 48.6 percent at $5.72.
Shares of Hewlett-Packard fell 5.2 percent to $22.10 after Goldman Sachs downgraded them to sell.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 8/32, to 101 8/32 and the yield rose to 1.86 percent from 1.84 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: In Mexican Villages, Few Left to Dream of U.S.

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
EL CARGADERO, Mexico -- The pretty houses in the hills here, with their bright paint and new additions, clearly display the material benefits of having millions of workers move to the United States over the past few decades. But these simple homes also reveal why another huge exodus would be unlikely: the bulk of them are empty.
All across Mexico's ruddy central plains, most of the people who could go north already have. In a region long regarded as a bellwether of illegal immigration -- where the flow of migrants has often seemed never-ending -- the streets are wind-whipped and silent. Homes await returning families, while dozens of schools have closed because of a lack of students. Here in El Cargadero, a once-thriving farm community of 3,000, only a few hundred people remain, at most.
''It's not like it used to be,'' said Fermin Saldivar Ureño, 45, an avocado farmer whose 13 brothers and sisters are all in California. ''I have three kids, my parents had 14. There just aren't as many people to go.'' 
As Congress considers a sweeping overhaul of immigration, many lawmakers say they are deeply concerned that providing a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States would mean only more illegal immigration.
They blame the amnesty that President Ronald Reagan approved in 1986 for the human wave that followed, and they fear a repeat if Congress rewards lawbreakers and creates an incentive for more immigrants to sneak across the border.
''The big problem with immigration is convincing people in the country that it won't turn into a 1986 endgame,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who is in the bipartisan group of senators working on a bill.
But past experience and current trends in both Mexico and the United States suggest that legalization would not lead to a sudden flood of illegal immigration on the scale of what occurred after 1986. Long-running surveys of migrants from Mexico found that work, not the potential to gain legal status, was the main cause of increased border crossings in the 1990s and 2000s. And as Mr. Saldivar points out, times have changed.
The American economy is no longer flush with jobs. The border is more secure than ever. And in Mexico the birthrate has fallen precipitously, while the people who left years ago have already sent their immediate relatives across, or started American families of their own.
''It's a new Mexico, it's a new United States, and the interaction between them is new,'' said Katherine Donato, a sociologist at Vanderbilt University who specializes in immigration. As for Congressional action spurring a surge of illegal crossings, she added: ''You're just not going to see this massive interest. You don't have the supply of people. You have a dangerous trip that costs a lot more money, and there has been strong growth all over Latin America. So if people in Central America are disenfranchised and don't have jobs, as was the case in Mexico three or four decades ago, they might decide to go south.''
Of course, hundreds of thousands of people, from all over Mexico and other parts of the world, still try to reach the United States each year, and the country's magnetism will partly depend on the details of what Congress approves. Who will be eligible? How long will they have to wait, and what barriers will lawmakers erect to prevent new immigrants from entering illegally and finding work?
Some scholars argue that granting any form of legal status encourages illegal migration because it creates a more settled immigrant class, attracting other relatives. ''If that person is a green card holder, the power of that network would seem to be significantly stronger,'' said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, which advocates reduced immigration.
Many lawmakers, particularly Republicans, see the 1986 law -- the Immigration Reform and Control Act -- as the prime example of what can go wrong.
Billed as a sweeping effort to halt illegal immigration, it gave legal status to around 2.7 million immigrants through two programs: one for farm workers and another for immigrants who had been living in the United States since 1982. For the first few years after it passed, illegal crossings fell because migrants who had once entered the United States illegally suddenly had papers allowing them to come and go at will.
But by 1990, the flaws began to show. The documentation requirements for agricultural workers were loose enough to allow for widespread fraud, encouraging people to cross the still relatively unprotected border and apply.
More significant, experts say, work visas for Mexico's masses of poor, young men were hard to obtain and sanctions against employers using illegal workers were rarely enforced. As a result, American companies and immigrants continued to seek each other out.
''The great wave of Mexican migration to the U.S. in the second half of the 1990s and early 2000s was driven by the abundance of jobs generated by the U.S. economic boom of this period,'' said Wayne Cornelius, director emeritus of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California, San Diego. ''Any delayed effects of'' the 1986 amnesty ''were inconsequential compared with the incentives created by U.S. job growth,'' he said.
Here in central Mexico, local economics and demographics also played a significant role. The collapse of the Mexican peso in 1994 and the North American Free Trade Agreement, which made it harder for Mexican farmers to make a living, pushed some families to Mexican cities and accelerated a migration pattern that would soon reshape both sides of the border. More immigrants now living in the United States come from central Mexico than from any other place in the world, according to census and survey data in both countries.
In states like Zacatecas, many areas emptied out gradually. If a visa could not be obtained, the sons and daughters of farming families crossed with smugglers, calling local radio stations back home to announce to their relatives that they had survived the journey.
''It became a way of life,'' said Eduardo López Mireles, president of the municipality of Jerez, which includes El Cargadero. ''There are 50,000 people from Jerez over there, and 57,000 here.''
But over the past few years, the traffic patterns have changed. In Jerez and other places, the established cross-border networks of family connections that made possible one of the greatest immigration waves in American history are either tapped out -- with most close relatives already in the United States -- or they are sending people home. Not only were more than 10,000 Zacatecans deported in 2012 alone, according to state figures, but thousands of others have returned voluntarily because of a lack of work.
Many of these returning migrants -- like Angel Castro, 38, who was sitting on a bench wearing a watch with an American flag -- say they do not intend to head north again for a shot at legalization. ''It's just too hard,'' Mr. Castro said.
In a half dozen towns in Zacatecas, scores of residents of all ages said that crossing the border had become too expensive and dangerous to consider seriously. In Perales, a hilltop village surrounded by fields of oats, corn and beans, a dozen men gathered by a church said it was not just all the extra American enforcement; they also feared the criminal gangs that now dominate smuggling.
Though most of the men had worked illegally in the United States before, they all said that even if they got in again, new rules would probably make it harder for them to work and impossible for them to qualify for any proposed pathway to citizenship. And because of increased prosecution in the United States, they said, getting caught without papers now could torpedo any chance of a visa later on, even just to visit relatives.
''The amnesty, it's for them, the people who are there,'' said Jose Luis Lopez, 32, a laborer in Perales with a brother in Dallas and another in Los Angeles. ''It doesn't mean much for us.''
Over the long term, experts predict that eventual citizenship for 11 million more immigrants could greatly increase legal migration as families reunite. Congress appears interested in limiting the swell, with the senators drafting legislation saying the bill might eliminate visas for married adult children and siblings of American citizens.
Regardless, the pool of potential applicants is shrinking. In a sign of just how much family reunification has already occurred, legally or not, remittances to Jerez have fallen to $100,000 or less per day, down from $1 million in the late 1980s, according to Jerez officials.
Especially in the small towns that have been sending migrants north for decades, the void is stunning. In Santa Ines, three secondary school grades were combined this year into just two classes, including one with only 11 students.
On the main road into El Cargadero, most homes are locked up and gathering dust. On a recent afternoon, there were only two people on the street: an old man in a wheelchair and another with a cane. The sound of a radio inside a home blocks away could be heard as clearly as the men's conversation.
Nearly everyone in the town has relatives in the United States -- one woman counted 150 -- but the families still here tend to be intact, suggesting that legalization would be less of a magnet than before. And there are simply not as many young people over all: the birthrate across Mexico has fallen from nearly seven children per family in 1970 to just over two, partly because of a government push for family planning. Mr. Saldivar, the avocado farmer, says his daughter's sixth-grade class has seven students, compared with 30 when he attended.
He doubted that his three children would bother heading to the United States. His son is in a college preparatory program. He and his wife, whose nine siblings are also all in the United States or Canada, live comfortably in a small, well-kept home with flowered curtains. Their main nod to migration is linguistic: they pay an English teacher to instruct their children so they can communicate with their American cousins. They are among the many here who no longer see the United States as a dreamland, recoiling at the anti-immigrant sentiment there and the stories of struggle that relatives share in phone calls and e-mails.
At least initially, many Zacatecans said, legalization may actually send more people south than north, as millions of immigrants would be able to come and go from the United States legally for the first time in years.
J. Reyes Sanchez, 53, one of the men chatting near the church, said he wanted nothing more than to see his three children in the United States, and his American grandchildren, and a pathway to citizenship could let that happen. ''They could come see their family, they could come see me,'' he said. ''They'd practically be tourists here, but they need to come.''

HEADLINE: Fatal Landslide Draws Attention to the Toll of Mining on Tibet

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Patrick Zuo and Amy Qin contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- One after another, the bodies have kept coming. By Tuesday night, rescuers had pulled 59 dead miners from the snow-covered rubble. They expect to find more.
The miners had traveled to a valley on the roof of the world to work in what a state news agency described last year as ''a mining miracle.'' Now, the project in central Tibet has brought about one of the nation's worst recent mining disasters. On Friday, an avalanche of rock and mud tumbled down the walls of the Gyama Valley and wiped out a mining camp, burying 83 people.
The deaths have thrown a spotlight on the Gyama mine, one of the largest and most contentious in Tibet. Hailed by the central government in Beijing as a flagship project, the copper, gold and molybdenum mining operation is hated by many Tibetans, who are furious at the environmental degradation it and other mines have caused on the Tibetan plateau.
''This was not a natural but a man-made disaster,'' said Woeser, a Tibetan social critic who has written about the Gyama mine. ''For locals, it says loud and clear how crazy the mining has become there.'' 
Official news reports have not explained the immediate cause of the avalanche. The Tibet regional propaganda office said in a statement on Wednesday that weather conditions were behind the landslide. The debris covered nearly two miles and totaled two million cubic meters, the news reports said.
Mining on the Tibetan plateau is crucial to the Communist Party's plans for maintaining economic growth across China. Metals and minerals -- including copper and gold, and the lithium used in batteries of electronic devices -- are abundant across the region, and mining there has greatly expanded in recent years. The surge in mining, aided in part by the opening in 2006 of the train across Qinghai Province to Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, has drawn investment even from Western companies.
As a result, protests have flared across the plateau. One rally against a project in Markham County by about 1,000 Tibetans in August ended with the fatal shooting of a man by security forces, according to a Human Rights Watch researcher and Radio Free Asia.
For Chinese leaders, discussion of mining in Tibet is politically delicate. When word first emerged of the disaster at Gyama, 40 miles northeast of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, propaganda officials ordered Chinese news organizations not to send journalists and to publish reports only from Xinhua, the state news agency, or government sources, according to China Digital Times, a group in Berkeley, Calif., that tracks the Chinese news media. Foreign journalists have long been barred from traveling independently to central Tibet.
Nicholas Bequelin, an Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said mining is ''one of the trigger points in Sino-Tibetan relations these days'' because it violates ''the place that mountains and sacred mountains have in the Tibetan worldview.''
The Gyama Valley is a revered site. It was the birthplace in the seventh century of Songtsen Gampo, the first king of the Tibetan empire. Prominent monks have come from Gyama, and pilgrims have traditionally flocked to the area to see its holy mountains, caves, shrines and rock paintings. Now, much of that is cut off because of the mining.
''Tibetans are hurt; it's a huge blow to their souls,'' Woeser said. ''Their spiritual hopes have been taken away.''
Ethnic discrimination plays a role in the outrage. The mines in Tibet generally belong to large state-owned enterprises based in eastern China, and they mostly bring in ethnic Han managers and workers, shutting Tibetans out. Of the 83 miners buried by the Gyama avalanche last week, only two were Tibetan, according to news reports.
But it is environmental destruction that most worries Tibetans. Scientists have documented significant problems brought by the ravages of the Gyama mine, which belongs to China Gold International Resources Corporation, a company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that is a unit of the state-owned China National Gold Group.
A paper published in 2010 by Science of the Total Environment, a journal, discussed the impact of mining activities on the surface water in the valley, including on streams that feed the Lhasa River. The researchers found elevated concentrations of six metals in the surface water and streambeds in the middle and upper reaches of the valley. These ''pose a considerably high risk to the local environment,'' according to a summary; meanwhile, pools of heavy metals were ''a great potential threat to downstream water users.''
Establishing the mine at Gyama resulted in the relocation of nomads who had roamed the valley and grazed their animals there. The forced settlement of nomads is a policy that Communist Party officials have been pushing for years in many parts of Tibet, despite the widespread resentment it causes.
Woeser wrote in 2010 that 100 nomad families had had to relocate because of the Gyama mine. Some locals have been herded into a government-built village.
''They're unhappy,'' Mr. Bequelin said. ''It's been presented to them as a legal obligation.''
The Tibet propaganda office said Wednesday in response to earlier faxed questions from this newspaper that Tibet's "ecological environment is fragile," and so the regional government pays "great attention to environmental protection work during the exploitation of mineral resources." That includes conducting environmental impact reviews, doing safety assessments and enforcing environmental laws, it said. The Beijing headquarters of China National Gold Group had no comment for this article.
For decades, the Gyama Valley had been the site of small mines that on occasion set off protests by locals concerned about the environment. About 2006, officials banned private mining and moved in state-owned companies to establish large-scale operations. China Gold International Resources got the rights to mine in Gyama; a subsidiary, Tibet Huatailong Mining Development, began construction in 2008 and operations in 2010.
Last August, Xinhua ran a story under the headline ''A Mining Miracle'' that said ''the scene has been transformed, replaced with a panorama of lush green trees and grasslands, new roads and infrastructure, and cleaner mining facilities, giving the local people a better life.''
The report said that over three years, Huatailong had discovered five million tons of copper, 530,000 tons of molybdenum and 135 tons of gold. Xinhua reported last Saturday that the total initial investment in the mine was nearly $560 million.
Local people have been protesting the new mine for at least four years. ''There have been a number of incidents where people have taken a quite radical stance,'' Mr. Bequelin said.
In 2009, the mining company used villagers' water because of a drought, which led to protests by the locals and the detentions of many villagers by the police, according to Woeser. The next year, there were rallies by Tibetans and supporters of Tibet outside the company headquarters in Vancouver.
One Tibetan environmental scholar in Canada, Tashi Tsering, has been tracking the changes to the landscape of Gyama by using Google Earth. Images posted on his blog, Tibetan Plateau, show huge open-pit mines, a processing plant at the confluence of two major rivers, and mountainsides marred by webs of dirt roads. ''China now wants to voraciously exploit the mineral resources of Tibet and other areas such as Xinjiang to meet its skyrocketing domestic demands,'' he wrote. ''China needs to create an independent resource base, and Tibet is key in achieving that goal.''

HEADLINE: Misdirected Investments In Education

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
James Heckman is one of the nation's top economists studying human development. Thirteen years ago, he shared the Nobel for economics. In February, he stood before the annual meeting of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry, showed the assembled business executives a chart, and demolished the United States' entire approach to education.
The chart showed the results of cognitive tests that were first performed in the 1980s on several hundred low-birthweight 3-year-olds, who were then retested at ages 5, 8 and 18.
Children of mothers who had graduated from college scored much higher at age 3 than those whose mothers had dropped out of high school, proof of the advantage for young children of living in rich, stimulating environments. 
More surprising is that the difference in cognitive performance was just as big at age 18 as it had been at age 3.
''The gap is there before kids walk into kindergarten,'' Mr. Heckman told me. ''School neither increases nor reduces it.''
If education is supposed to help redress inequities at birth and improve the lot of disadvantaged children as they grow up, it is not doing its job.
It is not an isolated finding. Another study by Mr. Heckman and Flavio Cunha of the University of Pennsylvania found that the gap in math abilities between rich and poor children was not much different at age 12 than it was at age 6.
The gap is enormous, one of the widest among the 65 countries taking part in the Program for International Student Achievement run by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
American students from prosperous backgrounds scored on average 110 points higher on reading tests than disadvantaged students, about the same disparity that exists between the average scores in the United States and Tunisia. It is perhaps the main reason income inequality in the United States is passed down the generations at a much higher rate than in most advanced nations.
That's a scandal, considering how much the government spends on education: about 5.5 percent of the nation's economic output in total, from preschool through college.
And it suggests that the angry, worried debate over how to improve the nation's mediocre education -- pitting the teachers' unions and the advocates of more money for public schools against the champions of school vouchers and standardized tests -- is missing the most important part: infants and toddlers.
Research by Mr. Heckman and others confirms that investment in the early education of disadvantaged children pays extremely high returns down the road. It improves not only their cognitive abilities but also crucial behavioral traits like sociability, motivation and self-esteem.
Studies that have followed children through their adult lives confirm enormous payoffs for these investments, whether measured in improved success in college, higher income or even lower incarceration rates.
The costs of not making these investments are also clear. Julia Isaacs, an expert in child policy at the Urban Institute in Washington, finds that more than half of poor 5-year-olds don't have the math, reading or behavioral skills needed to profitably start kindergarten. If children keep arriving in school with these deficits, no amount of money or teacher evaluations may be enough to improve their lot later in life.
Much attention has focused lately on access to higher education.
A typical worker with a bachelor's degree earns 80 percent more than a high school graduate. That's a premium of more than $500 a week, a not insubstantial incentive to stay in school. It is bigger than ever before. Yet the growth of college graduation rates has slowed for women and completely stalled for men.
The Economic Report of the President released last month bemoaned how the nation's college completion rate had tumbled down the international rankings, where it now sits in 14th place among O.E.C.D. countries.
The report restated the president's vow to increase the number of college graduates by 50 percent by 2020, and laid out how the federal government has spent billions in grants and tax breaks to help ease the effects of rising tuition and fees. Last year the government spent almost $40 billion on Pell grants, more than twice as much as when President Obama came to office.
Mr. Heckman's chart suggests that by the time most 5-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds reach college age, Pell grants are going to do them little good.
''Augmenting family income or reducing college tuition at the stage of the life cycle when a child goes to college does not go far in compensating for low levels of previous investment,'' Mr. Heckman and Mr. Cunha wrote.
Mr. Heckman and Mr. Cunha estimated that raising high school graduation rates of the most disadvantaged children to 64 percent from 41 percent would cost 35 to 50 percent more if the assistance arrived in their teens rather than before they turned 6.
Erick Hanushek, an expert on the economics of education at Stanford, put it more directly: ''We are subsidizing the wrong people and the wrong way.''
To its credit, the Obama administration understands the importance of early investments in children. The president has glowingly cited Mr. Heckman's research. In his State of the Union address, the president called for universal preschool education.
''Study after study shows that the earlier a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road,'' Mr. Obama said at a speech in Decatur, Ga., in February.
But the fresh attention has not translated into money or a shift in priorities. Public spending on higher education is more than three times as large as spending on preschool, according to O.E.C.D. data from 2009. A study by Ms. Isaacs found that in 2008 federal and state governments spent somewhat more than $10,000 per child in kindergarten through 12th grade. By contrast, 3- to 5-year-olds got less than $5,000 for their education and care. Children under 3 got $300.
Mr. Heckman's proposals are not without critics. They argue that his conclusions about the stupendous returns to early education are mostly based on a limited number of expensive experiments in the 1960s and 1970s that provided rich early education and care to limited numbers of disadvantaged children. They were much more intensive endeavors than universal preschool. It may be overoptimistic to assume these programs could be ratcheted up effectively to a national scale at a reasonable cost.
Yet the critique appears overly harsh in light of the meager improvements bought by the nation's investments in education today. A study by Mr. Hanushek found that scores in math tests improved only marginally from 1970 to 2000, even after spending per pupil doubled. Scores in reading and science declined.
''Early education is an essential piece if we are going to have a better education system,'' Barbara Bowman, an expert on early childhood education in Chicago who has advised the Education Department. ''We're inching in that direction.''
Education is always portrayed in the American narrative as the great leveler. But it can't do its job if it leaves so many behind so early.

HEADLINE: Report Links High Rates of Gun Violence to Weak State Regulations

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE

 BODY:
Many states with the weakest gun laws have the worst rates of gun violence, ranking high on numerous indicators, like gun homicides and suicides, firearm deaths of children, and killings of law enforcement officers, according to a report to be issued Wednesday by the liberal Center for American Progress.
Alaska ranked first in overall gun deaths, the report found, with 20.28 deaths per 100,000 people in 2010 -- more than twice the national average -- followed by Louisiana and Montana, all states that prior analyses have judged to have weak gun laws. Eight of the states with the highest levels of gun violence were among the 25 with the weakest gun laws, the report found. 
The report is the second in recent weeks to link gun deaths and firearms laws. Last month, a group of Boston researchers reported online in JAMA Internal Medicine that more firearm laws in a state were associated with lower rates of firearm deaths. That study took into account factors like poverty, unemployment, sex and race, education, population density, violent deaths unrelated to firearms and household firearm ownership.
Deborah Azrael, a research scientist at Harvard's School of Public Health who studies firearms and violence, called the latest state-by-state report ''a useful collation of data,'' and said it ''reinforces what we know from other studies, which is that the rate of exposure to firearms is associated with overall mortality.''
But the report was criticized by opponents of tighter gun laws, who faulted its methodology and said it ignored the beneficial effect of gun ownership in combating crime.
''The real world experience of guns obviously is that they are harmful in the wrong hands and protective in the right hands,'' said David B. Kopel, an assistant policy analyst at the Cato Institute. ''So you want to look at both effects.''
He added that high rates of gun violence in states with less gun regulation did not necessarily indicate higher crime rates over all.
''Is Louisiana a low-control state with a lot of crime? Absolutely,'' he said. ''On the other hand, New York and California are clearly dangerous states in comparison to the rest of the country, and they're also very high-control states.''
The new report was based on an analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In addition to firearm deaths, the report looked at other indicators of gun violence, like aggravated assaults with firearms, the percentage of guns traced to crimes within two years of their purchase, and the rate at which guns bought in one state are recovered in another after a crime is committed, a measure of illegal gun trafficking.
When all 10 indicators of gun violence were taken into consideration, Louisiana -- the state with the highest rate of gun homicides, 9.5 per 100,000 people in 2010, and one of the states with the highest numbers of firearm deaths among children from 2001 to 2010 -- ranked as the most violent state. Hawaii had the lowest overall rate of gun violence, followed by Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, all among the 10 states that an analysis last year by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence found had the toughest laws.
''Obviously, we know that correlation is not causation necessarily,'' said Arkadi Gerney, a fellow at the Center for American Progress and the lead author of the report, ''but it suggests that there could be a causal relationship, and there are a lot of reasons to think that there is.''
Some states did not follow the pattern. Vermont, which has relatively weak gun laws, had low rates of gun violence. Maryland, which has relatively strong firearm legislation, had a high level of gun homicides, ranking fifth, with 5.3 per 100,000 people.
Dr. Azrael, of Harvard, noted that the factors that were driving gun violence differed from state to state -- in states like Montana and Idaho, for example, the rate of gun suicides greatly outstrips the rate of homicides committed with firearms.
Tightened laws like universal background checks could address the availability of guns to criminals and the spread of trafficked guns across state borders, she said. But understanding more about things like ''household decision making about guns and how people weigh the costs and benefits of guns'' should also be part of the conversation, she said.

HEADLINE: Legislative Deal Prompts Run on Connecticut Gun Shops

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME; Robert Davey, Elizabeth Maker and Vivian Yee contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Guns shops were jammed. Gun manufacturers were angry. Gun-control advocates were thrilled. Many legislators were torn.
But as President Obama on Tuesday announced a visit to Connecticut next week in the wake of an agreement on a far-ranging package of state gun legislation, Connecticut was bracing for the consequences, intended or not.
The most immediate result of the agreement, which came more than three months after the massacre of 26 children and educators in Newtown, was a run on gun shops on Tuesday, following months of already brisk sales. Gun owners are rushing to buy weapons, ammunition and magazines in anticipation of limits on their sale and possession. 
A package of gun, mental health and school security legislation that leaders in the General Assembly agreed to on Monday includes a ban on the sale of magazines carrying more than 10 bullets and the registration of existing ones; an expansion of the existing assault weapons ban; background checks on all firearms sales; and a registry of weapons offenders. Lawmakers are expected to pass the legislation on Wednesday.
Vic Benson, co-owner of the Freedom Shoppe, a gun shop in New Milford, said that his store was not usually even open on Tuesday, but that he opened its doors in anticipation of panicked buyers, and also to get rid of inventory he thinks he will be unable to sell after lawmakers vote on Wednesday.
''We've got a fire sale going on here,'' he said. ''Whatever doesn't sell by the time they pass this law is going to be useless. Basically, $100,000 worth of paperweights. ''
One customer, John Gursky, 22, of New Milford, was stocking up on 30-round magazines and ammunition he said he uses recreationally. ''Nothing they're trying to pass right now is going to help the crime rate. It's only going to make it worse,'' he said.
But legislators, many Sandy Hook Elementary School families, gun-control groups and big-city mayors praised the legislation.
On Monday, families representing 11 of those who died at Sandy Hook called for a ban on the possession of high-capacity magazines, which was not included in the final legislative package.
But Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who had supported the ban, said on Tuesday that he would sign the legislation anyway. And Sandy Hook Promise, the group representing the families of the 11 victims, said that adding the requirement to register existing magazines strengthened the legislation considerably. ''We thank the legislature for passing the strongest gun responsibility legislation in the nation,'' the group said in a statement.
Not all the families of the victims were in agreement. Many have been silent on gun issues, and one parent, Mark Mattioli, whose son James, 6, died at Sandy Hook, appeared at the National Rifle Association's news conference on Tuesday to praise its proposal to put armed personnel in the nation's schools.
Urban mayors including William Finch of Bridgeport, John DeStefano Jr. of New Haven and Pedro Segarra of Hartford praised the legislation.
''It's bipartisan legislation that's worthy of the tragedy that befell our state and our nation in Newtown,'' Mr. Segarra said.
Very much in doubt is the future of gun manufacturers in a state once known as the cradle of the American gun industry. Many gun makers, like other manufacturers, have long since left the state.
But according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation in Newtown, gun manufacturers in Connecticut account for 2,899 jobs -- 7,340 including related businesses, such as suppliers -- and have a $1.7 billion economic impact. They include giants like Colt Manufacturing; O. F. Mossberg & Sons, the oldest family-owned firearms manufacturer in America; and Stag Arms of New Britain, founded 10 years ago, which is unable to keep pace with its orders.
Stag produces 6,000 AR-15 rifles a month, which critics call assault weapons but users and the gun industry call ''modern sporting rifles.''
All of the companies have been wooed by other states, particularly those in the South and West.
Mark Malkowski, the 34-year-old founder of Stag Arms, said he grew up in New Britain, where the company is based, and had never before considered leaving the state. But he said he would consider it now.
''If our product is so bad, so dangerous, why would the state of Connecticut want us to produce it here, create jobs here, manufacture it here and ship it to all the other states?'' he said.

HEADLINE: America the Debtor

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Guess who still earns more from foreign investments than it pays? 

 BODY:
I guess I'm going to have to write more about David Stockman's unfortunate rant, since a lot of people who should know better seem to think he made serious points. Right now, however, I just want to lay down a marker on an issue I really really do know something about: America as a net international debtor. 
Stockman describes a horror show:
Then came Lyndon B. Johnson's "guns and butter" excesses, which were intensified over one perfidious weekend at Camp David, Md., in 1971, when Richard M. Nixon essentially defaulted on the nation's debt obligations by finally ending the convertibility of gold to the dollar. That one act - arguably a sin graver than Watergate - meant the end of national financial discipline and the start of a four-decade spree during which we have lived high on the hog, running a cumulative $8 trillion current-account deficit.
Leave the goldbuggery aside (does Stockman think that countries pegged to gold - or, for that matter, the euro - never run current account deficits?). Are things as bad as he says?
Well, the $8 trillion number is right. But while it may be EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS, that's a cumulative deficit (which began in the 80s, by the way, not the 70s) of only half of this year's GDP. And if you know anything about the subject, you know that America's debtor position isn't actually that deep, because of capital gains (which aren't counted in the current account):
But OK, market valuations are one thing, what about income flows? Aren't we now paying a lot in interest to foreigners? Ahem. Here's US net international investment income - income from US assets abroad minus income payments on foreign assets in the US - as a percentage of GDP:
Now, that surge at the end is crisis-related: America tends to issue debt while buying equity and real assets abroad, so the plunge in interest rates has pushed up our net investment earnings, and this will go down again if and when we recover. Prior to the crisis, the trend was clearly down. But we're talking about fairly modest numbers, with America still earning more than it pays. This is the result of an epic spending spree, four decades of living high on the hog?
But of course you don't check out these numbers if your purpose is to scare readers by talking about EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS.

HEADLINE: Debt and David Stockman

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: It&#8217;s money we owe to ourselves. Really. 

 BODY:
Well, it turns out that I've actually been polite to David Stockman; Neil Irwin describes his recent writings as "spittle-filled", and gets at the essentially destructive nature of Stockman's critique. More on that another day. What I want to point out is the way Stockman unintentionally makes a point I've been trying to get across: debt does not directly impoverish us, because it's money we owe to ourselves. OK, some of it is money we owe to foreigners, but I've dealt with that part already.
So here's Stockman on how we lived "high on the hog"; he cites the current account deficit (which actually turns out to be a smaller thing than he imagines), then declares 
In effect, America underwent an internal leveraged buyout, raising our ratio of total debt (public and private) to economic output to about 3.6 from its historic level of about 1.6. Hence the $30 trillion in excess debt (more than half the total debt, $56 trillion) that hangs over the American economy today. 
Actually, the LBO analogy isn't too bad; but if he thought about that for even a minute, he would realize that LBOs have nothing to do with spending sprees, they're just a change in the structure of risk, with equity (which shares the risk among a fairly broad set of investors) replaced with debt (that concentrates the risk). 
Anyway, think about the macroeconomics; did America really put itself $30 trillion in hock to someone else? No, some Americans lent to other Americans, which is a very different issue.
And wait: even that isn't really true. About half of the rise in Stockman's rise in the debt-GDP ratio is debt of the financial sector:
How did that happen? Two things: a shift from ordinary deposit-based banking to shadow banking, and the increasingly complexity of the financial system. The first raises the official debt number because bank deposits aren't counted as debt, even though they really are just a particular kind of debt. The second raises the debt number because the same money can be counted several times if an institution buys debt securities, then uses them as collateral to issue debt of its own, which is what repo is all about. Oh, and the rapid drop in the debt ratio reflects a partial return to plain vanilla banking, not a massive paydown of obligations.
The point is that neither shifting from deposits to other forms of debt nor complexification of the financial system involve borrowing from the future, spending more than we earn. They're just fancier ways of owing money to ourselves, ways that cause the official debt ratio to rise. So skip the moral lectures, please.
Now, just to be clear, I'm not saying that complex shadow banking is harmless. Far from it: like LBOs, it shifts risk around, and as it turns out the concentration of risk made our economy much more fragile than it used to be. That's a big deal. But it's not at all the kind of big deal the debt scolds would make it out to be. And it's just crazy to use the economy's excessive reliance on fancy finance to argue that we can't do what it takes to restore full employment.

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Most Republicans Seek Action on Climate Change

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A new survey finds a strong majority of Republicans and conservative independent voters seek action on climate and non-polluting energy sources. 

 BODY:
It's time for that national "listening tour" on energy and climate, President Obama. Some evidence comes in a new survey from the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University (seen via Tom Yulsman on Facebook). Here's an excerpt from the news release:
In a recent survey of Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents conducted by the Center for Climate Change Communication (4C) at George Mason University, a majority of respondents (62 percent) said they feel America should take steps to address climate change. More than three out of four survey respondents (77 percent) said the United States should use more renewable energy sources, and of those, most believe that this change should begin immediately. 
The national survey, conducted in January 2013, asked more than 700 people who self-identified as Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents about energy and climate change.
"Over the past few years, our surveys have shown that a growing number of Republicans want to see Congress do more to address climate change," said Mason professor Edward Maibach, director of 4C. "In this survey, we asked a broader set of questions to see if we could better understand how Republicans, and Independents who have a tendency to vote Republican, think about America's energy and climate change situation."
The reason a listening tour is the next step, and not a pre-packaged batch of legislation or other steps, is to build on the common ground across a wide range of Americans on energy thrift, innovation and fair play (meaning policies that distort the playing field, with mandatedcorn ethanol production and tax breaks for fossil fuel companies prime examples). 
This might even lead to a new sense of mission in this country, something that's been lacking since the cold war and space race.
In Mother Jones, Chris Mooney has an interesting spin on the survey, noting that the way global warming was framed probable had an impact on the level of buy-in on the questions. 
It's been clear for years that there are ways around the familiar partisan roadblocks on climate-smart energy policies. In 2009, the "Six Americas" survey by the same George Mason researchers and counterparts at Yale revealed this clearly. I distilled those findings into three slides here.
Here's a bit more on the survey from the George Mason Web site: 
This short report is based on a January 2013 national survey of Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents. We found that they prefer clean energy as the basis of America's energy future and say the benefits of clean energy, such as energy independence (66%) saving resources for our children and grandchildren (57%), and providing a better life for our children and grandchildren (56%) outweigh the costs, such as more government regulation (42%) or higher energy prices (31%).
By a margin of 2 to 1, respondents say America should take action to reduce our fossil fuel use. Also, only one third of respondents agree with the Republican Party's position on climate change, while about half agree with the party's position on how to meet America's energy needs.

HEADLINE: Toronto-Dominion Announces C.E.O. Succession

BYLINE: IAN AUSTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Bharat B. Masrani, the head of the bank&#8217;s U.S. operation, will take over as chief executive of the Canadian giant when William E. Clark retires as president and chief executive in November 2014. 

 BODY:
The Toronto-Dominion Bank, which is pursuing an aggressive expansion into the United States, said on Wednesday that the head of its American operation would become its chief executive late next year.
Bharat B. Masrani will take over the bank when William E. Clark retires as president and chief executive in November 2014. To smooth the transition, Mr. Masrani will return to the bank's head office in Toronto and become chief operating officer on July 1.
Mr. Masrani emerges from what was widely seen from the outside as a competition between several executives of the bank who, like him, have spent most of their working lives at Toronto-Dominion or Canada Trust, which Toronto-Dominion acquired along with Mr. Clark in 2000. 
 "It was always our desire to appoint internally," Mr. Clark said in an interview. "The people who work at TD love the business model. If you've got really strong executives the best method is to go with people internally who will continue to go with that business model."
While Canada's banking system is overwhelmingly dominated by the country's five largest banks, Mr. Clark concentrated his efforts on retail banking, a profitable segment that many banks had largely taken for granted. A former senior bureaucrat with the federal government who had also worked at Merrill Lynch, Mr. Clark introduced conveniences like longer hours at Canada Trust that, while common generally in retailing, were unknown in Canadian banking. Compensation throughout the bank also became tied to results from customer satisfaction surveys.
Mr. Clark then successfully transposed that template on Toronto-Dominion, making it the largest retail banker in Canada.
Toronto-Dominion also became an exception to Canadian banking with its successful foray into the United States, a move that has brought other Canadian banks more grief than growth. The conservative management style of Canadian banks, including Toronto-Dominion, and tighter regulations in Canada meant that they remained healthy financially during the crisis of 2008.
With its strong balance sheet, Toronto-Dominion took advantage of the weakness in the American financial system to bargain hunt. Among other things, it spent $8.6 billion to acquire Commerce Bancorp of New Jersey in 2008 and followed that with a $6.3 billion acquisition of Chrysler Financial in 2011.
Mr. Masrani, who was Toronto-Dominion's chief risk officer before he went to the United States, said that turning around American operations was not as simple as just applying the methods used by Toronto-Dominion in its home market.
"The U.S. banking environment is to some extent different than the Canadian banking environment," Mr. Masrani said, adding that it demanded numerous, if small, adjustments to the bank's standard methods.
He said the American banks had also exported some new tricks to Canada, including Sunday branch openings and coin-counting machines in branches.
Mr. Masrani will be succeeded as head of Toronto-Dominion's American operation, which is based in Cherry Hill, N.J., by Michael Pedersen, who currently runs the bank's wealth management and insurance businesses. 
Timothy D. Hockey, who manages Canadian banking and Toronto-Dominion's credit card business, and Colleen M. Johnston, the chief financial officer, will gain additional responsibilities over the coming year. Both were seen as possible successors to Mr. Clark.
Mr. Clark said the bank's emphasis on American expansion and Mr. Masrani's appointment did not signal an end to its Canadian growth plan.
"It's always a mistake in any business to ignore your home base," he said, noting that Toronto-Dominion acquired the Canadian credit card operations of MBNA in 2011.
But he said that if Canada's economy slowed as expected at the same time as the United States was rebounding, the growth of the bank's American operations might outpace that of its home market units.

HEADLINE: Uncovering the Human Factor in Risk Management Models

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: John Breit, the former top risk manager at Merrill Lynch, says that mathematical models fail because they don&#8217;t account for human frailty. 

 BODY:
When he left physics, John Breit had the choice of a job in naval intelligence or on Wall Street. "My wife said I couldn't be a spy. She hates capitalism, but said to go to Wall Street," he told me recently. "And then I ended up running a spy network."
Calvin Trillinonce attributed the financial collapse to the influx of smart people on Wall Street. The physicists, computer scientists and mathematicians displaced the slow-thinking country club types. With their incomprehensibly complex models, the smart guys' hubris brought our economy low.
Mr. Breit was part of that initial incursion. A Ph.D. in physics from Columbia, he was doing postdoctoral work when he realized that he could never be as good as his contemporary Edward Witten, who went on to pioneer string theory. 
So in 1986, he joined Wall Street, moving not to the trading floor, like many of his fellow rocket scientists, but into risk management. In 1990, he took his skills to Merrill Lynch, rising to become the firm's head of market risk oversight. The physicist came to understand the limits of mathematical models. He learned that his job was really psychologist, confessor and detective. He became the financial version of a counterintelligence officer, searching for the missed clues and hidden dangers in the firm's trading strategies.
Mr. Breit is retired now, studying ancient Greek in his spare time and volunteering as an adviser for New York's pension funds. He comes across as George Smiley if he were a Southerner - gracious, reluctant to talk about himself, with iconoclastic opinions just below the surface. I've been talking to him periodically over the years about how giant financial institutions should manage the aggressive traders slinging giant sums around the world in ever more complex transactions.
After the Senate issued a report last month on JPMorgan Chase's multibillion-dollar "London Whale" trading loss, an incident where the mathematical modeling went seriously wrong, I reached out to him again.
That debacle encapsulates much of what is wrong about how banks manage their risk and how the regulators oversee those efforts. At JPMorgan Chase, the risk models hid - and were used to hide - risks from the traders and top executives. Too many measures and too many numbers undid the risk managers. But ultimately, they failed because of human frailties; the risk managers lost sight of their mission and tried to protect the traders and their trades. As in all spy debacles, the counterintelligence officers got co-opted.
Early in his career, Mr. Breit figured out that models for markets aren't like those for physics. They don't come from nature. It was necessary to know the math, if only so that he couldn't be intimidated by the quantitative analysts.
But the numbers more often disguise risk than reveal it. "I went down the statistical path," he said. He built one of the first value-at-risk models, or VaR, a mathematical formula that is supposed to distill how much risk a firm is running at any given point.
The only thing from capital markets math he came to embrace was this immutable law of nature: Investors make money by taking risk. "If it's profitable and seems riskless, it's a business you don't understand," he told me.
Instead of fixating on models, risk managers need to develop what spies call "humint" - human intelligence from flesh and blood sources. They need to build networks of people who will trust them enough to report when things seem off, before they become spectacular problems. Mr. Breit, who attributes this approach to his mentor, Daniel Napoli, the former head of risk at Merrill Lynch, took people out drinking to get them to open up. He cultivated junior accountants.
"They see things first," he said. "Almost every trading debacle was sitting on some accountant's desk."
All the while, he was on the lookout for bad trades. Most traders who get into trouble, he thinks, aren't bad guys. The bad ones, who try to cover up improper trades, are relatively easy to detect. The real threat, he said, comes from the "crazy ones" who really believe they've found ways to spin flax into gold. They can blow up a firm with the best of intentions.
They don't do it suddenly. "I hate the whole Black Swan concept," he said, referring to the notion, popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, that the true risks lie in unforeseeable events that occur with much more frequency than the mathematical models suggest. "It takes years of concerted effort to lose a lot."
Yes, a big market move might reveal a fatally flawed trade, but that volatility is not the root cause of an oversize loss.
The problem, as Mr. Breit sees it, is that this has nothing to do with how risk management is practiced today, or what the regulators encourage. Regulators have reduced risk managers to box checkers, making sure they take every measure of risk and report it dutifully on extensive forms. "It just consumes more and more staff, turning them into accountants and rotting brains."
Take VaR. In Mr. Breit's view, Wall Street firms, encouraged by regulators, are on a fool's mission to enhance their models to more reliably detect risky trades. Mr. Breit finds VaR, a commonly used measure, useful only as a contrary indicator. If VaR isn't flashing a warning signal for a profitable trade, that may well mean there is a hidden bomb.
He despises the concept of "risk-weighted assets," where banks put up capital based on the perceived riskiness of the assets. Inevitably, he argues, banks will "pile into" the same types of supposedly safe investments, creating bubbles that make the risks far more severe than the initial perceptions. Paradoxically, risk-weighting can leave banks setting aside the least capital to cover the biggest dangers.
"I could not be more disappointed," he said. "The cynic in me thinks this is all in the interests of senior management and regulators to avoid blame. They may not think they can prevent the next crisis, but they then can blame the statistics."
Instead, Mr. Breit says he believes that regulators should encourage firms when they reach different conclusions on what is risky and what is safe. That creates a diverse ecosystem, more resilient to any one pestilence.
And the regulators should empower risk managers by finding out how many times they meet with chief executives and what they have recently vetoed, and by judging whether the traders respect the executive. "It's all completely unquantifiable and vague," he said, adding that a risk manager should be divorced from the profit and loss statement, the one "who throws sand in the gears."
Mr. Breit's sand-throwing days are over now. Undermined during the credit boom, as the firm's head, E. Stanley O'Neal, became isolated and paranoid, he resigned his position in the middle of 2005 (but stayed at the firm). By the summer of 2007, he realized that something was terribly wrong with Merrill Lynch's subprime mortgage exposure. He began calling in favors from junior finance staff members to find out what was going on and became alarmed. Eventually, Mr. O'Neal called him in, seemingly thinking that Mr. Breit was still his risk manager. It was too late for anyone to save the firm from billions in losses.
When he resigned his position at Merrill Lynch, did a board member or regulator call him to ask why?
"Not a one," he told me. Government overseers need to develop human sources, too.

HEADLINE: In Mortgage Case, Dexia Claims Against JPMorgan Barred

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: In a major victory for JPMorgan Chase, Judge Jed Rakoff dismissed claims by Dexia, a Belgian-French financial institution that had sued the nation&#8217;s largest bank over losses on $1.6 billion in 65 residential mortgage investments. 

 BODY:
A federal judge dealt a devastating blow to a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase that accused the nation's largest bank and its affiliates of duping investors into buying troubled mortgage-backed securities. 
In a ruling on Tuesday, Judge Jed S. Rakoff dismissed claims from Dexia, a Belgian-French bank that had sued JPMorgan over losses on $1.6 billion in 65 residential mortgage investments, according to court documents.
FSA Asset Management, another plaintiff, can continue to pursue its claims over five of the soured investments, with losses of more than $5 million.
The ruling significantly limits the potential legal bill from the case, a major victory for JPMorgan. The lawsuit was being closely watched on Wall Street, in part because it could provide a window into another high-stakes suit facing the industry.
 In 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, accused 17 banks of selling $200 billion of dubious mortgage securities to the housing finance giants. At least 20 of the securities at issue were also included in the Dexia case, according to an analysis of court records.
The Dexia lawsuit, filed in 2012 in United States District Court in Manhattan, centered on complex securities created by JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual during the heady days of the housing boom. As profits soared, the Wall Street firms churned out ever more investments, some of which imploded. Dexia, which has been bailed out twice since the financial crisis, lost $774 million on the securities, according to court records.
Lawyers for JPMorgan have been working to quash the Dexia lawsuit since it was originally filed. They tried to persuade the judge that Dexia did not have the legal standing to sue the bank, court records show.
Judge Rakoff sided with the bank, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. The judge did not outline the reasoning for his decision in Tuesday's order.
Dexia's lawsuit was part of a broad-ranging assault on Wall Street for its role in the financial crisis, as prosecutors, regulators and private investors pursue the banks for losses on mortgage-related securities. New York's attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, for example, sued JPMorgan last year over investments created by Bear Stearns from 2005 to 2007.
For JPMorgan and other big banks, the legal woes have been costly.
In November, JPMorgan agreed to pay $296.9 million to settle claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission that Bear Stearns, which the bank bought in 2008, had misled investors by failing to disclose some problematic loans in the portfolio. JPMorgan did not admit or deny wrongdoing.
Separately, Citigroup agreed last month to pay $730 million to settle claims that the bank had misled investors in securities backed by mortgage loans. The bank did not admit or deny wrongdoing.
Analysts say the mortgage-related legal costs pose one of the most severe threats to the industry's profit. For example, Citigroup said that its fourth-quarter profit was eroded by a $1.3 billion legal bill.

HEADLINE: Americans' Attitudes Toward Owning a House Have Changed

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Nearly half of homeowners say they can see themselves renting in the future. 

 BODY:
Even as the housing market improves, Americans seem more willing to embrace renting as an alternative to homeownership, a new survey on housing attitudes from the MacArthur Foundation finds.
Many Americans still say they have a strong desire to own their own home, but the overall appeal of renting compared with owning is changing, the survey found. Fifty-seven percent of adults believe that "buying has become less appealing," and 54 percent believe that "renting has become more appealing" than it was before. 
And nearly half of current homeowners (45 percent) say they can see themselves renting at some point in the future.
The survey was commissioned by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Hart Research Associates conducted telephone interviews of 1,433 adults from Feb. 27 to March 10. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.
The survey is part of the foundation's "How Housing Matters" initiative, which finances research that explores "if and how housing leads to improved outcomes in child well-being, physical and mental health, education and economic opportunity."
Despite improving indicators, like upswings in home values and building, many Americans remain unconvinced that the housing crisis is over. Nearly 8 in 10 believe the country is still in the midst of the crisis, the survey found. The effects of the housing crisis, combined with longer-term lifestyle changes, seem to have created a more realistic view of the risks and benefits of homeownership, Rebecca Naser, a vice president at Hart Research, said in a conference call about the findings.
The sentiment that renting is more acceptable is "quite pronounced" across the public, Ms. Naser said. "The world is changing, and renting is becoming more viable," she said.
Two-thirds of adults now believe the focus of the country's housing policy should be equally split between rental and ownership, rather than promoting one over the other, the survey found.
And 61 percent of adults now believe that renters can be just as successful as owners in achieving the "American dream," the survey found.
How has the housing crisis changed your outlook on homeownership? Do you think renting is a viable long-term option?

HEADLINE: For the Rockets, It Really Is Science

BYLINE: MAX ROTHMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Daryl Morey&#8217;s success as the Rockets general manager signals a victory for the statistics movement in the N.B.A. 

 BODY:
When Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey signed a four-year contract extension in March, it signaled a victory not just for his wallet, but also for the numbers movement. The extension validated the idea that Morey and other stats guys could last.
Advanced metrics have been established as a requisite in baseball, but are honeymooning with basketball. Morey has served as a leading pioneer of the convergence. He read the abstracts of Bill James when he was young, worked as a statistical consultant with STATS Inc., earned a bachelor's degree in computer science with an emphasis on statistics from Northwestern University and an M.B.A. from the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. He has written articles on sports analytics in the Harvard Business Review and The Economist. He has also molded the Rockets into a near-ideal representation of his philosophies without mitigating the on-court knowledge of Coach Kevin McHale. 
Reaching this point required unpopular moves that puzzled fans and executives alike. The Rockets finished last year's lockout-shortened season at 34-32, their third consecutive season of straddling the .500 mark and missing the playoffs. Morey recognized that few things are worse than mediocrity - your team has no shot at a title or a high draft pick. So he reset the roster.
After failing to acquire Dwight Howard, he drafted Jeremy Lamb, Terrence Jones and Royce White, the gifted point-forward with an anxiety disorder. On July 11, he traded Kyle Lowry, the starting point guard. Two days later he amnestied Luis Scola, the starting power forward and a fan favorite. On July 18, he signed Jeremy Lin after outbidding the Knicks. Two days later, he traded guard Courtney Lee to Boston. On July 24, he signed center Omer Asik after outbidding the Bulls. Locals wanted Morey's head before he had finished his plan.
At the dawn of the regular season, he swapped guard Kevin Martin, Lamb, a few first-round picks and a second-rounder to the Oklahoma City Thunder for guard James Harden, the sixth man of the year. A few days later, on Halloween night in Detroit, in his first game in Rockets red, Harden had 37 points and 12 assists en route to a season-opening victory. The next day he signed a five-year contract extension with Houston. The day after that, he dropped a career-high 45 points in a victory at Atlanta. It took some time, but critics now understand Morey's science.
The Rockets currently possess what they previously lacked: hope. At 41-33, and after recently trading for forward Thomas Robinson, the No. 5 pick of last year's draft (widely regarded as a heist), this team remains a project, but also has a lot of useful pieces. Harden, Lin, Asik, guards Carlos Delfino and Patrick Beverley, forward Donatas Motiejunas, and Chandler Parsons, the 24-year-old swingman who averages 15.1 points, 5.4 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game yet makes less than $1 million this season, have led the enactment of Morey's numerical ideals. The Rockets average 30.2 shot attempts at the rim per game, trailing only the Denver Nuggets, and lead the league with 2,126 3-point attempts. They also average three shots from 10-15 feet and 10.1 shots from 16-23 feet per game; both are easily the lowest figures in the N.B.A.
And then there's White. While he still hasn't made his debut with the Rockets, Morey's interest follows his philosophy. If White ever plays, he has the potential to become a transcendent piece of Houston's future. He dribbles and passes like a point guard and rebounds resolutely. If he never plays, he's just another risk that didn't work out. The White selection symbolizes Morey's desire for bargain greatness or failure over mediocrity; the same reason that he overthrew last season's roster.
About one month ago at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, which he co-founded in 2006, fans and aspiring general managers flocked to Morey. Some remembered Houston's 22-game winning streak of 2008 led by Yao Ming, Tracy McGrady and Shane Battier. Others appreciated this season's Rockets, arguably the most surprising team in the league. They also inquired about front-office jobs related to statistics. After Morey's work in Houston, the league will soon have more of those.

HEADLINE: Everything Familiar Is About to Disappear: Tracy Thompson Talks About the South

BYLINE: JOHN WILLIAMS


HIGHLIGHT: Ms. Thompson discusses the ways in which the South is and isn&#8217;t changing. 

 BODY:
In her book "The New Mind of the South," Tracy Thompson tours the region and analyzes the forces - both familiar and new - that are shaping the way its residents live and relate to each other. In a recent e-mail interview, Ms. Thompson discussed the classic book echoed in her title, her geographic definition of the South, race, class and more. Below are edited excerpts from the conversation:
 Q. 
W. J. Cash's book "The Mind of the South," first published in 1941, is a classic analysis of the region and written in a distinct style. How direct an inspiration was it on your work? 
 A. 
His book is sitting on my desk right now with little sticky notes all over it. You can't write about the South without reading "The Mind of the South," and many of the themes he identified are still around. But I made a conscious decision not to re-read his book while I was working on my own. I was approaching the South as a native who has viewed it from a small distance for 20 years, and I wanted to preserve that slightly arm's-length perspective. Still, I found myself dipping into it all the time; hence all those sticky notes.
 Q. 
What would Cash find most surprising about today's South?
 A. 
The first would be the widespread acceptance of interracial marriage, which in 1941 would have been totally taboo to white Southerners - at least in the social sense, though of course in practical terms, interracial relationships have always been a fact of life in the South. The other is immigration. For a bunch of reasons, the South never knew any significant immigration until the 1980s, when the Mexican migration began. Cash spent much of his newspaper career working for papers in North Carolina, where today nearly 10 percent of the population is Hispanic, and where you can see flyers advertising Mexican bands stuck in the windows of the local Curves franchise. I think that would astonish him. And universal air conditioning! 
 Q. 
How did you choose which states you would focus on for the book?
 A. 
Anybody's definition of "the South" is going to be idiosyncratic. I started with the 11 states of the Old Confederacy, and lopped off portions of that area that, due to major demographic changes, don't really qualify as Southern anymore. So anything west of a line drawn between Dallas and Houston was the West; east Texas was the South. Florida is the South down to about Orlando, at which point it becomes something else. Northern Virginia is not really the South any more, but south of Prince William County definitely is. This left out some places that are identifiably Southern, such as the Eastern Shore of Maryland, the entire state of Kentucky, as well as parts of Oklahoma. But you have to draw a line somewhere.
 Q. 
You say that Southerners are conservative, but that not everyone understands why. What's missing from the common explanation?
 A. 
Southerners tend to be politically and socially conservative - but what everyone, Southerners included, often fails to take into account is how adaptable we are. We've had to be. Between 1800 and 1850, the South went from being a colonial backwater to being a global economic powerhouse, based on the cotton economy. Then there was the Civil War. Then decades of legal apartheid, followed by a transformative civil rights movement - and while all that was going on, you had the "bulldozer revolution," in which an agrarian region became a region of shopping malls and cities and suburbs. Now we have immigration - not just from Mexico, but a significant Asian influx as well. I think Southerners place so much store by history and tradition because we all have this constant, nagging sense that everything familiar to us is about to disappear. And it probably is.
 Q. 
In your account, large parts of the South have stubbornly clung to thinking that the Civil War was not really about slavery and have not come to grips with the systemic violence against blacks that occurred as recently as the 1960s. Yet you also write that Southern cities are less segregated than their Northern counterparts and more openly discuss issues of race and class. How do you reconcile those things?
 A. 
They aren't hard to reconcile; the fact that many white Southerners believe some distorted version of history doesn't have anything to do with where they live or what they think about their neighbors. White Southerners are entirely capable of believing that slavery was a benign institution while at the same time living on cordial terms with the African-American family next door, or for that matter with their African-American son-in-law.
As for open discussions of race and class: I've never met a Southerner, black or white, who could not tell you with great specificity what class of people they came from, whether it was redneck prole, coastal aristocracy, black bourgeoisie, trailer trash, plain old country people or whatever. Honest discussions of race can be hard to find in the South - they are rare everywhere - but on a day-to-day basis, black and white Southerners are very comfortable with each other. We've lived together a long time, and we are big on being polite. 
 Q. 
There's been a large remigration of African-Americans to the South in recent decades. How much of this is driven by the practical demands of the economy versus a more emotional longing to return home?
 A. 
Impossible to say. William Falk, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, is studying this very question, and he has identified two separate streams of returnees - a smaller group of older African-Americans returning to spend their retirement in the region where they grew up, and a much larger group of younger African-Americans who seem to be motivated mainly by economic opportunity. But how many in the latter group have grandparents or great-grandparents who once lived in the South, and how much of an ancestral memory do they have? That's the fascinating, unanswered question. It's worth mentioning that polls show that African-Americans who live in the South are actually slightly more likely than whites in the South to identify themselves as Southerners. 
 Q. 
Some Southern states in recent years have created commissions based on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission created by Nelson Mandela in South Africa. What exactly do these groups aim to do, and what kind of progress are they making?
 A. 
Only two states - Mississippi and North Carolina - have tried that route, with less than earthshaking results. But they're part of a larger grassroots effort to deal with the South's legacy on race, and the aims of all these other groups vary. One group helps people explore different racial branches in their own family tree. Others lobby for a historical marker to commemorate some long-forgotten but historically significant lynching. Another one helps racially polarized neighborhoods talk to each other so they can cooperate on community projects. Others are explicitly religious.
 Q. 
You write about Atlanta: "Somehow, something essentially Southern has managed to survive here, like grass growing in cracks in the concrete. But is that evidence of its persistence, or just the dying remnants?" After writing this book, how would you answer that question?
 A. 
Here I think I'll just quote Cash: "Of the future, I shall venture no definite prophecies." All I can say is I hope it's the former and not the latter. I think - I know - that's the way he would have felt, too.

HEADLINE: Small Companies and the Affordable Care Act

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Affordable Care Act may benefit medium-size companies by making it costly for their smaller competitors to expand, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
Small businesses have spoken out against the Affordable Care Act, but medium-size businesses, customers and taxpayers may be the ones ultimately harmed.
Beginning next year, the Affordable Care Act will penalize employers that fail to offer health insurance to their employees. Because small employers are especially unlikely to offer health insurance (see Table 3 in this paper from the Congressional Budget Office), and large businesses are likely to avoid the penalties because they already offer insurance, the penalties seem like an attack on small business. 
But the Affordable Care Act simultaneously rewards employees at small companies by heavily subsidizing their purchases of health insurance on the exchanges created by the law. Because employees cannot take the subsidies with them if they switch to a large company offering health insurance, the subsidies are, in effect, subsidies to the small businesses themselves, helping them compete more cheaply in the market for employees. 
Employees at the smallest companies, with fewer than 50 employees, are eligible to receive the subsidies, even though their employers are exempt from the penalties. 
Indeed, some medium-size businesses that currently offer health insurance say they find the smaller company "penalty plus subsidy" combination attractive and plan to drop their health insurance plans in order to partake in it, too, even though their participation will entail a penalty. 
The Affordable Care Act also created tax credits for small business that are already available. These credits perhaps have too many strings attached to be attractive to employers, because only 770,000 employees (in an economy with more than 130 million) worked for employers claiming the credit in 2010 (see Page 9 of this report from the Government Accountability Office). The Affordable Care Act also promised to provide small-business employees a choice of health plans, but implementation of that plan has been pushed back until 2015. 
Many small businesses are not as good with bureaucracy and red tape as large businesses are - that's one reason they did not offer health insurance in the first place. The employee subsidies coming online next year are pretty complicated, as evidenced by the 21-page application that must be completed by each employee, and the fact that any one year's subsidy has to be estimated based on historical employee data, advanced from the Internal Revenue Service to the insurer, and then later reconciled when the employee's family income for the year can be fully documented.
I suspect that large businesses will have human resource personnel dedicated to helping company employees complete the application and obtain and accurately reconcile the subsidy to which they are entitled. Employees at smaller business may have to fend for themselves. 
We also have to remember that businesses compete for customers and for employees. A business that experiences a little direct harm from the act may benefit on the whole because competitors are harmed more. This is especially true because of the heavy penalty the law puts on businesses that expand from 49 to 50 employees: that one hire will cost the employer $40,000 annually in penalties, on top of that employee's usual salary and benefits.
Thus, the type of company that may benefit the most from the law is not necessarily large or small but a company with small competitors that have been looking for opportunities to expand their market share, and in the process bring the number of their employees to more than 49.

HEADLINE: Pushing Paternity Leave Helps Working Mothers

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: When countries promote paternity leave, men contribute more at home and women work more. 

 BODY:
How best to encourage women to "lean in" to the work force? Encourage men to lean in at home.
That's not an original turn of phrase, but it is the suggestion of economists and research from a Cornell graduate student as described in two articles by the New York Times economics reporter Catherine Rampell (not a mother herself yet, but a woman who loves her job and intends to stick with it into parenthood). When we talk about women leaving the work force after having children, or reducing their roles, a common suggestion is to promote and provide better work-life accommodations (parental leave, flex work, telecommuting, etc.). 
But, Ms. Rampell writes in"Incentives for Men, to Help Women Work":
Without careful design, expanding work-life accommodations can unintentionally reinforce archaic gender roles and lower the glass ceiling, Temple of Doom style. That's because women are much more likely to take advantage of these policies, and employers know it.
If you want to create policies that promote women's labor-force participation without curbing their career achievements, you also have to address why family-friendly policies aren't being used by men.
She points to societal norms, pesky things that are notoriously resistant to change - the norms that mean many women read things like an e-mail calling for drivers for a field trip differently from the way their male parent counterparts read them. It's not true of all fathers, but my husband does not feel the guilt I feel every time I fail to respond to a request for help with smoothie day, the school musical or the middle school dance.

Would increasing his guilt burden really lessen mine, and how could that be accomplished? Surprisingly, research suggests that in places where paternity leave is common, men grow into parenting differently. Fathers spend more time on child care and on domestic tasks, while women spend more time at work. Ms. Rampell points to the way paternity leave could change a couple's initial response to a baby in "a crucial time for renegotiating a couple's division of labor," but it's worth noting that the link between paternity leave and more involved fathers isn't always a direct one.
Fathers "exposed" to paternity leave policies do more (in Norway and in Canada), but they may, or may not, be fathers who took advantage of the leave.
The fact of encouraging paternity leave, promoting it socially and making it more common, both encourages fathers to take leave and is associated with an increase in male involvement in the day-to-day work of raising children (if not necessarily the volunteer-request-induced guilt). At the same time, "mothers spent considerably more time at work growing their careers and contributing more to the economy, all without any public mandates or shaming." When the social norm of whose career takes an immediate hit following the birth of a child changes, the norms around who continues to adjust and accommodate may change as well.

HEADLINE: As Business Lending Rises, Concerns Emerge About Profit

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The recent spurt in bank business lending is starting to flash some warning signs. The concern is that banks are making loans to businesses at rates that are so low that they may end up being unprofitable for the lenders. 

 BODY:
On the economic scene, it would seem heartening to see a surge in loans that banks are making to corporations of all sizes. The loans help finance business expansion, which may lead to jobs growth. And it shows that banks don't have to pile back into real estate loans, recently the source of crippling losses, to grow.
But the recent spurt in bank business lending is starting to flash some warning signs. 
The concern is that banks are making loans to businesses at rates that are so low that they may end up being unprofitable. A recent survey by the Federal Reserve shows that American banks are charging an average of just 2.83 percent on so-called commercial and industrial loans. That's down from 3.4 percent a year earlier.
 Banks of all sizes are participating in this resurgence, including smaller banks, which managed to avoid many of the excesses of the credit boom of the last decade. In an effort to find alternatives to real estate lending, some smaller banks could be rushing into company loans without due care, says Claude A. Hanley Jr., a partner at the Capital Performance Group, a bank consultancy firm.
"The competition among banks has been fairly pronounced," Mr. Hanley said. "So there is concern that this will lead to foolish terms to the borrower merely to win business in the short term."
Overheated credit markets are a risk that comes with the immense monetary stimulus undertaken by the Federal Reserve to whip up economic growth. Extraordinarily low interest rates have breathed life into several markets where companies go to borrow. Last year, companies issued nearly $360 billion of junk bonds in the United States, according to Dealogic, a large number that has raised eyebrows in some quarters.
Less noticed, but still big, was the increase in commercial and industrial loans at American banks. They added $174 billion of such loans in 2012, a 13 percent increase from the prior year, according to figures from the Fed. Since 1990, the average annual growth for these loans was 4.2 percent.
It's one thing to make the loans, but another to make money on them over time.
At first blush, the banks' business loans look very profitable. Take the business loan portfolio at Huntington Bancshares, a regional lender based in Columbus, Ohio.
The bank's commercial and industrial loans grew by a heady 16 percent last year and the business is a sizable contributor to its revenue. Last year, its business loans had an average interest rate of 4 percent, a nice fat yield for a bank that had to pay only 0.45 percent on the money it borrowed itself. 
But the 4 percent figure is derived partly from older loans that have higher interest rates. As competition in this sector remains intense, it's important to understand the profitability of the recent business loans. They may have a significantly thinner profit margin. That can be seen in a theoretical exercise that uses some of Huntington's numbers.
Unlike some of its peers, Huntington actually discloses the interest rates on newly added commercial and industrial loans. The latest figure it gave was 3.38 percent for the third quarter of 2012.
Estimated costs then need to be subtracted from that figure. First, Huntington's own financing costs, 0.35 percent in the last quarter of 2012, are taken away, to get net interest income of 3.03 percent on the business loans.
Huntington gets fees and other noninterest revenue from the commercial and industrial banking services it provides. But, as is the case at most banks, it has even higher noninterest expenses. 
If this net expense is expressed as a percentage of assets, it comes to 0.59 percent for the division of Huntington that makes commercial and industrial loans. That number is then subtracted from the 3.03 percent net interest income yield on businesses loans. That trims their theoretical annual return to 2.44 percent.
Next, one big potential cost has to be factored in: estimated losses from when loans go bad.
In banking, those can be measured through something called "net charge-offs." Since 1990, those have averaged 1 percent on commercial and industrial loans to American companies, though they spiked above 3.5 percent at Huntington in 2008 and 2009. To take into account the healthier economy today, it may make sense for this analysis to assume a markedly lower loss rate of 0.8 percent.
Subtracting that from the 2.44 percent takes the business loan yield down to 1.64 percent. 
Finally, the taxman's take. Huntington expresses that as 35 percent for the division that makes commercial and industrial loans, which would reduce that figure to 1.07 percent.
The analysis does have shortcomings.
In traditional banking right now, earning just over 1 percent on loans after all estimated expenses, is hardly terrible when interest rates are so low. 
And it is hard to generalize across the banking sector. Some lenders will prove better than others at commercial and industrial lending during this business cycle. 
In theory, banks with strong, long-term relationships with corporate borrowers should be able to generate more business without compromising the quality of their loan books. James E. Dunlap, a Huntington executive who oversees commercial lending, says that if a borrower knows it is getting a valuable range of services from a long-time lender, it will be less tempted to take a cheaper loan from a competitor. 
"When you take responsibility for the success of your customers, they will take the responsibility to buy multiple services from you," Mr. Dunlap said.
Also, the analysis doesn't take into account the fact that most business loans are structured in such a way that their interest rates would go up if benchmarks, like the London interbank offered rate, increase. In other words, it might be a mistake to assume that today's low rates on business loans will persist into the foreseeable future.
Still, the Fed shows few signs of wanting to hoist interest rates. And competition between banks could prompt certain lenders to cut interest rates on commercial and industrial loans still further, leaving little room for error if this type of lending hits a rough patch.

HEADLINE: A Gucci-Fueled Pursuit of a New Sense of Identity

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
The Internet came alive last week with frenzied commentary about the confessional by the Pulitzer Prize winner Buzz Bissinger in the April issue of GQ, an epic tale of a writer stoking a compulsive-shopping disorder with huge doses of Gucci. The article was a classic in glossy magazine moralism, well timed both to lure and shock readers still attempting to stagger out of the slough of an inert economy. What do you mean Buzz Bissinger spent $638,412.97 on clothing? That's 9,388 pairs of Dockers, or enough to outfit almost 400 of the high school football teams Mr. Bissinger came to fame writing about.
Come to think of it, that is more than the average American pays for a home.
Equal parts divulgence (''I own 81 leather jackets, 75 pairs of boots, 41 pairs of leather pants, 32 pairs of haute couture jeans, 10 evening jackets and 115 pairs of leather gloves,'' he wrote) and soft-core self-indulgence, the massive heave was composed by a 58-year-old father of three notably uninhibited about disclosing details of his shopping problems, marital wobbles, latent kinks, family inheritance and robust personal revenue stream (two million copies of his book ''Friday Night Lights'' sold.) 
Written in a febrile swoon, ''My Gucci Addiction'' sketched a consumerist nightmare tale in the prose of a bodice ripper. The heaving bosom, though -- clad in a little something from one of the 38 separate labels that Mr. Bissinger name-checks -- is his.
''I am here as a private client of Gucci, one of five pampered and feted on an all-expenses-paid four-day trip to Milan and Florence,'' Mr. Bissinger wrote of his Gucci-sponsored, business-class flight from Kennedy International Airport to Milan Malpensa last January, where he was met by a private car and whisked (it's the only verb, really) to the Park Hyatt Milan.
There, ''the concierge has been clearly prepped before our arrival, calling me Mr. Bissinger with better pronunciation and far more enthusiasm than my friends,'' he wrote.
Can there be two ways to pronounce Bissinger, one wondered? Never mind. Friends, the authentic kind, are barely necessary when you have Gucci and the Divine Stylist, Mr. Bissinger's personal shopper at the brand's flagship New York store. It was this unnamed sibyl who routinely notified Mr. Bissinger when new styles arrived, who posted bulletins and photographs and who also provided the sartorial guidance that ultimately resulted, Mr. Bissinger wrote, in choruses of praise he hankered for all his life.
Dressed to kill, Mr. Bissinger found himself greeted by waves of approval, most of it delivered, he wrote, ''by women and gays and African-Americans who appreciate go-for-it style.'' Go-for-it-style was new to Mr. Bissinger, who favored shapeless suits and baggy pleated trousers before submitting to the kinky allure of stretch leather and boots with three-inch heels.
His Gucci fetish, on the other hand, had deep roots in childhood. ''Gucci brand has always held special power for me, ever since the 1960s, when the Gucci loafer with the horse-bit hardware was the rage, and my father, who fancied himself as being anti-status when he secretly loved it, broke down and bought a pair,'' wrote Mr. Bissinger, who as a 13-year-old once hungrily circled a Gucci store on Fifth Avenue before getting up the nerve to enter and walk out with a wallet covered with the label's insignia.
Decades on he found he had become a leather-upholstered sandwich board for the label, wearing Gucci jackets of ostrich ($13,900), pony ($8,000) or black napa leather with gold threading ($9,800), buying so much and so compulsively that he was ultimately invited into the ranks of the fashion elect, joining a group of fellow shopping whales in the front row of the biannual men's-wear presentations. There, giddy with self-esteem and Cristal, he experienced a heady front-row apotheosis, home at last among the cognoscenti (''I like turning around and seeing the poor lost souls in the gulag of the higher rows,'' he wrote) and a heady sense of living out Jim Morrison fantasies from his conservative suburban youth. And how did Gucci feel about sharing a starring role in Mr. Bissinger's 6,400-word opus?
''Gucci engages with our clients across many passion points,'' said Robert Triefus, chief marketing officer at Gucci, adding that each season a select group of consumers like Mr. Bissinger is invited to attend runway shows, visit the company's birthplace in Florence and tour the workshops where the magic is made. ''These engagements allow our loyal clients to understand the history, tradition, quality and passion behind our products.'' As for the rest of the article: No comment.
The Bissinger shopping jones may have been ''an extreme case, but it is only in terms of amount,'' according to April Lane Benson, the author of ''To Buy or Not to Buy: Why We Overshop and How to Stop'' and an expert on compulsive shopping disorder. ''It's called the smiled-upon disorder,'' Dr. Benson added of a psychological malady thought to affect as many as 18 million Americans.
Certainly it was smiled upon by Gucci, cast in Mr. Bissinger's account as a willing enabler of his need to shake off a repressive upbringing, the stylistic puritanism foisted on heterosexual white men, and the creep of middle age.
''The 'whales' thing was a little shocking,'' said the editor of one men's magazine, speaking anonymously for fear of offending Gucci, a major advertiser, and referring to the standard casino practice of pampering its biggest gamblers. ''It's not like Milan is Vegas.''
Or is it? After that noontime Gucci fall-winter 2013 show, Mr. Bissinger kept the party going, dressing for a night on the town with some of his new best friends from fashion on a clubbing bender that began with orders of Veuve Clicquot and Cristal and ended with him swigging from a bottle of Patrón while dressed, he wrote, in ''tight black faux-leather stretch pants, a black Gucci T-shirt and a black leather Gucci jacket lined with shearling.'' By his own account, Mr. Bissinger looked ''so hip that the owner of the club put us in the special V.I.P. section overlooking the jammed dance floor,'' although in the photographs accompanying the article he bears an uncanny resemblance to Gene Simmons of Kiss.
What matter? As addicts often do, Mr. Bissinger felt helpless, caught in the grip of a compulsion that fuels not only Gucci's bottom line, Dr. Benson said, but also global economies. ''Don't forget we had a president who, after 9/11, said 'We cannot let the terrorists stop our nation, so I want you to go shopping,' '' she said. ''He didn't tell us to go out drinking or taking drugs.''
Mr. Bissinger's decision to expose himself in GQ as a sexual dabbler, sometime cross-dresser, vagrant husband and man who when he hit rock bottom bought a $22,000 Gucci coat on a whim, he explained in a written statement (he declined to be interviewed for this article), was ultimately a selfless act, a means of ''helping others who are struggling with addiction'' and the damage done by denying who you are.
It was the window Mr. Bissinger opened on addiction that made it an easy decision to publish the tale, said Jim Nelson, the editor in chief of GQ. ''You just don't see pieces like that very often, where someone is writing so close to the bone, wrestling with the truth about themselves, about their compulsions and their identity and doing it with a startling, unflinching clarity,'' he said. And identity, ultimately, is at the core of Mr. Bissinger's shopping addiction, a sense that the lists and tallies and purchase history will ultimately explain Mr. Bissinger to himself. ''There is this thing called completion theory, where there's a discrepancy between who we are, who we would like to be and how we would like to be seen,'' Dr. Benson said. ''The next purchase is always the one that will unlock the secret.''

HEADLINE: China's Unfaltering Flight Path

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; John Schwartz contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- For those frustrated with air travel in the United States, arriving at this city's domestic airport can be a treat.
New arrivals are whisked on electronic walkways through a bright, spacious airport terminal that features elegant lounges, free Wi-Fi, speedy security checks and an efficient baggage handling system.
This is what the best airports now look like in the world's second-largest economy.
Three years after it opened, Terminal 2 at Hongqiao International Airport in Shanghai stands as a testament to China's economic ambitions, and to its unique approach to infrastructure development. 
With extraordinary government support, Shanghai built a massive airport terminal in 32 months as part of a $9 billion transportation hub that connects the air terminal with the city's buses, subway platforms and a new high-speed railway network.
''They know how to build things and how to do it efficiently,'' said Jeffrey N. Thomas, chief executive of Landrum & Brown, an American firm that helped design the new Shanghai terminal. ''That area went from plans on a piece of paper to a complex that has 14 million square feet in less than four years. That's hard to do.''
At a time when many American airports are falling into disrepair, China is quickening its air travel development, with plans to build nearly 100 more airports by 2015, including some at high altitudes, where special landing gear is required. Many of those airports are expected to lose money, but that hasn't deterred the government, which views the expansion of infrastructure as vital to economic development.
China's big-city airports are already colossal. Last year, Beijing Capital International Airport handled 81 million passengers, up from 27 million in 2002.
This year, it could surpass Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport to become the world's busiest.
In Shanghai, Pudong Airport -- which operates 25 miles east of Hongqiao as the city's international gateway -- has so many flights it plans to add a fourth and fifth runway, something few other airports in the world possess.
The quality and speed with which China builds its big city airports is impressive. But whether China holds any lessons for airport development in America, or Europe for that matter, is unclear, analysts say.
China's building programs are supported by an authoritarian political system that brooks no challenges. When the government decides to build or expand an airport, there are no public hearings or any public protests of note.
And while economists ponder the long-term consequences of that decision-making process, this country's leaders push ahead with new megaprojects.
''There's a pro-investment bias here, partly because the country still has so much surplus labor, which makes it a lot cheaper to build,'' said Louis Kuijs, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland based in Hong Kong. ''And this is a country that knows how to build. Look at the Great Wall!''
Terminal 2 at Hongqiao Airport is one of those ''this could only happen in China'' developments. With Terminal 1 congested, the city announced plans in 2006 for a new transportation hub to cover 10 square miles, a project that when complete is likely to be the world's largest transit hub with about 1.1 million passengers a day.
To build it, the city cleared 10,000 residents from a huge plot of land west of Hongqiao by building new apartments for them a few miles away. Because the state owns all land in China, and residents have little bargaining power, local governments and developers often benefit from lower development costs.
And in the case of the transportation hub, once the land was cleared, state-run banks lined up to lend money to the project.
''The relocation and acquiring of land this size, only China can do it,'' said Cao Longjin, general manager of Shanghai Rainbow Investments, a state-run company that helped develop the hub. ''It's a miracle.''
When China went on an earlier airport-building spree in the 1980s and early 1990s, things didn't go quite so smoothly. The airports tended to be poorly designed and minimally functional, and usually lost money.
Now, big cities are flush with cash from a real estate boom. Government officials take part in overseas fact-finding missions, hire international consultants and set up joint ventures that improve the chances that the biggest airports will turn a profit.
In Shanghai, the city's airport authority helped set up Shanghai Rainbow Investments to develop the new transportation hub and revitalize the area around it. The plan includes a new central business district with towers, five-star hotels and a vast mixed-use commercial project created by the Hong Kong developer Shui On Land. The developer hired the American architect Ben Wood, who designed Shanghai's popular Xintiandi commercial and entertainment district.
City officials also designed Terminal 2 with profit-making ventures in mind, modeled on airports in London, Hong Kong and Singapore, where terminals double as vibrant shopping malls, packed with duty-free shopping and restaurants.
''We looked at what areas of an airport are profitable and which are typically not profitable,'' said Liu Wujun, chief technical officer at the Shanghai Airport Authority and one of the main planners behind Terminal 2. ''The areas that tend to be profitable we made as large as possible; the areas not so profitable we made as small as possible.''
The result was smaller roadways alongside the airport (not so profitable), and larger hotels, retail outlets and cargo-processing sections (more profitable).
Atlanta's airport is one of the world's most cost competitive, with about 70 percent of its revenue from nonaviation areas like shops and parking. That is Shanghai's model, Mr. Liu said.
Part of the profitability equation involved lowering the cost of construction. And experts say that comes easier in China, where aggressive building schedules are the norm.
Shanghai, for instance, hired more than 13,000 construction workers to develop the transportation hub and did what many projects here do: it instituted a 24/7 construction schedule. Commuting time was minimal since most of the workers lived on site.
So while Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 in London took nearly six years to build and cost $6.5 billion, Hongqiao's Terminal 2, roughly the same size, was built in less than half the time for a third of the cost. When it opened in early 2010, Terminal 2 had 80 check-in counters and capacity to handle 300,000 flights a year. Last year, the airport handled 234,000 flights.
Inside, Terminal 2 was also fitted with Starbucks coffee, Armani, Zegna, Hermès and Bulgari stores, a duty-free shopping area and office space for lease. Outside the terminal, a shopping mall that connects the railway station with the airport terminal has been slow to develop. But the government says the terminal is profitable.
With more than 30 million passengers expected to pass through its halls this year, billboard advertising comes at a premium.
But rather than sign a deal to lease out the billboards, the city's airport authority brokered a potentially more lucrative deal in 2005 by forming a joint venture with JCDecaux, the French outdoor advertising giant, one that gives the airport a majority stake.
An executive at JCDecaux China says the company helped the airport authority plan Terminal 2 with oversize indoor and outdoor advertising displays in mind. Rates in Shanghai, the spokesman said, can be as high as $2 million a year, in some cases higher than rates in the United States or Europe.
Chinese airports have other financing advantages over the United States, like higher landing fees for airlines and mandatory airport construction fees paid by passengers, as much as $13 a flight.
A 1973 law prohibiting airports in the United States from charging passenger fees was changed in 1990. In 2000, the fee was raised to $4.50 a flight, about half as much as China's fee, though airfares are higher in the United States.
In the United States, there are warnings that the poor state of infrastructure at American airports is likely to hold back the industry, and that one of the impediments is the way government restricts financing options.
''We're going to have to change the way our airports are regulated in terms of how they finance things and how they put projects in place,'' said Greg Principato, president of the Airports Council International North America, which represents the nation's roughly 450 commercial airports.
Of course, with expansion China's airports will face tough management challenges, particularly if labor costs rise and air traffic slows. There are also concerns among some analysts who study economic development that China's airport program is excessive and that the country's high-speed rail is likely to erode the profitability of airports.
But Mr. Liu, the chief technical officer at Shanghai's airport authority, jokes about how much more profit-oriented state-owned operators are in China. ''The difference between here and the U.S. is that in the U.S., the government manages the nonprofit parts of an airport and gives the profitable parts to the private sector,'' he said, laughing. ''The U.S. way is more socialist and the Chinese more capitalist.''

TRANSITION The Toronto-Dominion Bank, which is pursuing an aggressive expansion into the United States, said on Wednesday that the head of its American operation would become its chief executive late next year. 
Bharat B. Masrani, left, will take over the bank when W. Edmund Clark retires as president and chief executive in November 2014. To smooth the transition, Mr. Masrani will return to the bank's head office in Toronto and become chief operating officer on July 1. IAN AUSTEN
NEGATIVE EFFECT Shares of Vodafone fell in London trading on Wednesday after Verizon Communications said it did not ''currently have any intention to merge with or make an offer for Vodafone, whether alone or in conjunction with others.''
The statement by Verizon on Tuesday afternoon was in response to a report earlier in the day that the company was working with AT&T on a plan to take over and break up Vodafone. On Wednesday, the shares fell as much 3.7 percent.
PUBLIC DEBUT Shares of the notebook company Moleskine fell modestly on the first day of trading on Wednesday after the Italian company raised $314 million through an initial public offering.
Moleskine, whose leather-bound notebooks have been used by the likes of Picasso and van Gogh, is the latest European company to turn to the capital markets despite recent uncertainty caused by the bank crisis in Cyprus. In trading in Milan on Wednesday, shares closed at 2.28 euros a share, down 0.87 percent from its offering price. MARK SCOTT
RISING CONCERNS On the economic scene, it would seem heartening to see a surge in loans that banks are making to corporations of all sizes. The loans help finance business expansion, which may lead to job growth.
But the recent spurt in bank business lending is starting to flash some warning signs. The concern is that banks are making loans to businesses at rates that are so low they may end up being unprofitable. PETER EAVIS

HEADLINE: Dementia Study Predicts A Surge In Cost And Cases

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

 BODY:
The most rigorous study to date of how much it costs to care for Americans with dementia found that the financial burden is at least as high as that of heart disease or cancer, and is probably higher. And both the costs and the number of people with dementia will more than double within 30 years, skyrocketing at a rate that rarely occurs with a chronic disease.
The research, led by an economist at the RAND Corporation, financed by the federal government, and published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, provides the most reliable basis yet for measuring the scale of the problem. Until now, the most-cited estimates of the condition's cost and prevalence came from an advocacy group, the Alzheimer's Association. 
Although some figures from the new research are lower than the association's projections, they are nonetheless staggering and carry new gravity because they come from an academic research effort. Behind the numbers is a sense that the country, facing the aging of the baby boom generation, is unprepared for the coming surge in the cost and cases of dementia.
''It's going to swamp the system,'' said Dr. Ronald C. Petersen, who is chairman of the advisory panel to the federal government's recently created National Alzheimer's Plan and was not involved in the RAND study.
If anything, Dr. Petersen said of the study's numbers, ''they're being somewhat conservative.'' Dr. Petersen, the director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the Mayo Clinic, is part of another team collecting data on dementia costs.
The RAND results show that nearly 15 percent of people aged 71 or older, about 3.8 million people, have dementia. By 2040, the authors said, that number will balloon to 9.1 million people.
''I don't know of any other disease predicting such a huge increase,'' said Dr. Richard J. Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging, which financed the study. ''And as we have the baby boomer group maturing, there are going to be more older people with fewer children to be informal caregivers for them, which is going to intensify the problem even more.''
The study found that direct health care expenses for dementia, including nursing home care, were $109 billion in 2010. For heart disease, those costs totaled $102 billion; for cancer, $77 billion.
The study also quantified the value of the sizable amount of informal care for dementia, usually provided by family members at home. That number ranged from $50 billion to $106 billion, depending on whether economists valued it by the income a family member was giving up or by what a family would have paid for a professional caregiver.
Michael D. Hurd, the lead author and a principal senior researcher at RAND, said the team could find no research quantifying such informal care for heart disease and cancer. But he and other experts agree that given the intensive nature and constant monitoring required to care for people with dementia, informal costs are probably much higher than those for most other diseases.
Dr. Petersen said, ''Clearly, dementia is going to outstrip those dramatically.''
Without a way to prevent, cure or effectively treat these conditions yet, the bulk of the costs -- 75 to 84 percent, the study found -- involves helping patients in nursing homes or at home manage the most basic activities of life as they become increasingly impaired cognitively and then physically.
''The long-term care costs associated with people with dementia are particularly high because of the nature of the disease,'' said Donald Moulds, acting assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at the federal Department of Health and Human Services. ''People eventually become incapable of caring for themselves, and then in the vast majority of cases, their loved ones become incapable of caring for them.''
Each case of dementia costs $41,000 to $56,000 a year, the study said. Researchers project that the total costs of dementia care will more than double by 2040, to a range of $379 billion to $511 billion, from $159 billion to $215 billion in 2010. Because the population will also increase, Dr. Hurd said, the burden of cost per capita will not grow quite as fast, but will still be nearly 80 percent more in 2040.
The study used information collected over almost a decade on nearly 11,000 people from a large database called the Health and Retirement Study, considered a gold standard among researchers on aging issues. All of the people followed were given detailed cognitive tests, while a subset of them were more intensely evaluated for dementia and their results used as benchmarks to rate cognitive decline for the others, Dr. Hurd said.
Dr. Hurd noted that in addition to the estimates of people with actual dementia, earlier analyses of the same data estimated that 22 percent of people aged 71 and older -- about 5.4 million people -- have mild cognitive impairment that does not reach the threshold for dementia. In the study, about 12 percent of those people developed dementia each year, meaning that they experienced problems with memory, concentration and daily functioning that were severe enough to meet the medical definition.
The number of dementia cases calculated in the RAND study is smaller than that from the Alzheimer's Association, which used a different database and tended to count people in earlier stages of memory loss. The association estimates that five million people aged 65 and older have Alzheimer's, the most common dementia.
The RAND cost estimates for current dementia care are similar to the Alzheimer's Association's, but the association's future cost projections are significantly higher: $1.2 trillion in 2050.
Robert Egge, the association's vice president for public policy, said his group's cost projections are based on the assumption that ''more and more people will be in severe stages of dementia'' in the future because they will be older. He said his group welcomed the RAND study, especially its comparison of dementia to other serious illnesses. It shows that groups using different methodologies reached the same conclusion about the high costs of dementia care, he said.
Dr. Petersen, whose team at the Mayo Clinic will be analyzing costs using a third distinct data set, said he suspected that ''the reality is somewhere in the middle'' of the RAND numbers and the Alzheimer's Association's projections.
When it comes to dementia, Dr. Hurd said, his team's study could not capture the full toll of the disease. ''One thing we haven't talked about, and it's not in the paper, is the tremendous emotional cost,'' he said. ''Economists are coldhearted, but they're not that coldhearted.''

HEADLINE: Dexia Claims Against JPMorgan Barred

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
A federal judge dealt a devastating blow to a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase that accused the nation's largest bank and its affiliates of duping investors into buying troubled mortgage-backed securities. 
In a ruling on Tuesday, Judge Jed S. Rakoff dismissed claims from Dexia, a Belgian-French bank that had sued JPMorgan over losses on $1.6 billion in 65 residential mortgage investments, according to court documents.
FSA Asset Management, another plaintiff, can continue to pursue its claims over five of the soured investments, with losses of more than $5 million.
The ruling significantly limits the potential legal bill from the case, a major victory for JPMorgan. The lawsuit was being closely watched on Wall Street, in part because it could provide a window into another high-stakes suit facing the industry.
In 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, accused 17 banks of selling $200 billion of dubious mortgage securities to the housing finance giants. At least 20 of the securities at issue were also included in the Dexia case, according to an analysis of court records.
The Dexia lawsuit, filed in 2012 in United States District Court in Manhattan, centered on complex securities created by JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual during the heady days of the housing boom. As profits soared, the Wall Street firms churned out ever more investments, some of which imploded. Dexia, which has been bailed out twice since the financial crisis, lost $774 million on the securities, according to court records.
Lawyers for JPMorgan have been working to quash the Dexia lawsuit since it was originally filed. They tried to persuade the judge that Dexia did not have the legal standing to sue the bank, court records show.
Judge Rakoff sided with the bank, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. The judge did not outline the reasoning for his decision in Tuesday's order.
Dexia's lawsuit was part of a broad-ranging assault on Wall Street for its role in the financial crisis, as prosecutors, regulators and private investors pursue the banks for losses on mortgage-related securities. New York's attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, for example, sued JPMorgan last year over investments created by Bear Stearns from 2005 to 2007.
For JPMorgan and other big banks, the legal woes have been costly.
In November, JPMorgan agreed to pay $296.9 million to settle claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission that Bear Stearns, which the bank bought in 2008, had misled investors by failing to disclose some problematic loans in the portfolio. JPMorgan did not admit or deny wrongdoing.
Separately, Citigroup agreed last month to pay $730 million to settle claims that the bank had misled investors in securities backed by mortgage loans. The bank did not admit or deny wrongdoing.
Analysts say the mortgage-related legal costs pose one of the most severe threats to the industry's profit. For example, Citigroup said that its fourth-quarter profit was eroded by a $1.3 billion legal bill.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Data Suggests Cautious Business Climate

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two reports showed Wednesday that American service companies grew more slowly in March and private employers pulled back on hiring. The declines suggest businesses may have grown more cautious last month after federal spending cuts took effect. 
The Institute for Supply Management said that its index of nonmanufacturing activity fell to 54.4 last month. That is down from 56 in February and the lowest in seven months. Any reading above 50 signals expansion.
Slower hiring and a steep drop in new orders drove the index down. A gauge of hiring fell 3.9 points to 53.3, the lowest since November.
The group's report covers companies that employ roughly 90 percent of the work force, including the retailing, construction, health care and financial services industries.
A separate report from the payroll processor ADP also pointed to slightly weaker hiring in March. ADP said private employers added 158,000 jobs in March, down from 237,000 the previous month. Construction companies did not add any jobs after three months of solid gains.
Economists were not overly concerned with the weaker reports. Several noted that ADP's figures were less reliable than the government's more comprehensive employment report, which comes out on Friday.
Still, many say the pace of hiring has probably dropped off from the previous four months, when employers added an average of 200,000 net jobs a month. And a few reduced their forecasts for March job growth after seeing the two reports.
Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, now expects just 160,000 net jobs in the March employment report, instead of 215,000. Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said her group had lowered its forecast to 155,000, from 220,000.
Ms. Lee said businesses might have temporarily suspended hiring because they wanted to see the impact of $85 billion in government spending cuts, which began on March 1.
Still, most economists say any slowdown is likely to be temporary. Most say growth accelerated in the January-to-March quarter to a 3 percent annual rate, buoyed by a resilient consumer and a steady rebound in housing.
And even if growth slows in the April-to-June period to roughly 2 percent, as some predict, that would still leave the economy expanding at a solid pace in the first half of the year.

HEADLINE: Misperceptions of Benefits Make Trimming Harder

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama had Senate Republicans nodding in agreement during a recent ice-breaking dinner as he described a basic problem for the nation's fiscal future: For each dollar that Americans pay for Medicare, they ultimately draw about $3 in benefits. What's more, he added, most people do not understand that.
By his point that evening, the president was referring to the widespread and incorrect view, especially among older Americans, that Medicare recipients get only what they have paid for through taxes, premiums and medical co-payments. Now that misperception is making it all the harder for politicians to consider trimming those benefits or raising out-of-pocket expenses as they seek to restrain Medicare spending that is rising unsustainably while baby boomers age and medical prices increase.
There has long been similar confusion about Social Security, although the current generation of new beneficiaries is roughly breaking even. 
Late in 2012, for a sixth straight year, Medicare trustees issued a warning required by law whenever more than 45 percent of the health program's costs must be covered by general revenues from all taxpayers.
To date, Mr. Obama has mostly proposed cuts to payments for health care providers, like hospitals. He has supported reducing benefits or raising costs for higher-income beneficiaries, but has made any broader benefit changes contingent on Republicans' agreeing to additional tax revenues from wealthy individuals and corporations.
Even so, Republican senators said they were heartened by Mr. Obama's dinner comments on the growing imbalance between Medicare's benefits and taxes. If they could not yet agree on solutions, agreeing on the problem was a start, said Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin who was among the diners.
''I suggested it would be immensely helpful to reaching solutions to these problems if he would utilize that bully pulpit and start conveying to the American public the full extent, the full depth, of our problems,'' Mr. Johnson said.
He added, ''I'll know President Obama is serious about working with us when I start hearing him tell the American people what he told us in private.''
Administration officials said that Mr. Obama, in speaking of a 3-to-1 ratio of Medicare benefits to taxes, was referring just to Medicare's Part B coverage for doctor and outpatient services.
Older Americans pay about 25 percent of Part B costs through premiums, deductibles and coinsurance (high-income beneficiaries pay 35 percent to 80 percent). The rest comes from general revenues -- income taxes and other levies. The ratio is similar for Medicare's prescription drug benefit: While beneficiaries' premiums cover about a quarter of costs, the rest comes from general revenues and borrowed money.
''They are heavily subsidized by the federal government, and the trend is getting worse,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now one of two public trustees for Medicare and Social Security.
Medicare payroll taxes finance only the program's Part A coverage for hospital costs.
While Mr. Obama apparently was speaking only about Part B, analysts say that it is roughly true for all of Medicare that beneficiaries on average pay about $1 for every $3 in benefits.
Analysts frequently cite Gene Steuerle, an economist at the Urban Institute, a policy research organization, who calculates average payroll taxes and benefits for Medicare as well as Social Security over the lifetimes of various types of individuals. Those figures vary by income, health, longevity, marital status, children and other factors.
For example, his October update showed that a single male who earned the average wage ($44,600 in 2012 dollars) and turned 65 in 2010 had paid about $61,000 in Medicare taxes and could expect $180,000 in benefits.
Social Security is a different story these days. That same single male, Mr. Steuerle calculated, paid about $300,000 in payroll taxes, excluding the portion for disability benefits, and could expect a bit less, $277,000, in retirement benefits. (Married couples do better than single people because many of them receive spousal and survivor benefits.)
Social Security and Medicare benefits are greater on average for women because they generally live longer than men.
The idea among Americans that they get back what they paid for, with some rate of return, dates to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's legislative marketing of Social Security nearly 80 years ago. When Medicare was created in 1965, new payroll taxes were assessed to cover only Part A hospital insurance.
''That was sort of a foundation argument that F.D.R. popularized when the Social Security Act was passed -- that this was a fiscally responsible program because people were going to pay in and, as a result of their payments, be entitled to benefits,'' said Mr. Reischauer, the public trustee.
Yet Social Security has always been a pay-as-you-go system, with workers' taxes going not to some actual trust fund for them but directly toward benefits for retirees. Initial beneficiaries paid little or nothing into the system, but ''all of the first generations got windfalls,'' Mr. Steuerle said.
For decades until the 1980s, workers paid a Social Security tax rate much lower than the current 12.4 percent (split between employers and employees) and on a smaller share of their wages, even as Congress expanded benefits. Only now are new Social Security claimants roughly breaking even and likely to get back about what they paid in. But young workers today can expect fewer benefits for their taxes.
''The bottom line is that the older you are, the more likely that your Social Security benefits exceeded your contributions,'' said Charles Blahous, the other public trustee and a former adviser to President George W. Bush. ''The younger you are, the more certain it is that your tax burden will exceed what you ever get out.''
As the fiscal debate rages, even the word ''entitlement'' -- long part of the budget lexicon -- has come to be seen as a pejorative among Americans who fear that benefits are threatened.
''Social Security and Medicare are both earned and paid for through our salary taxes,'' a reader of The New York Times wrote recently. ''A better term for these two programs is 'earned benefits.' It more accurately describes them without giving them a sense of negativity and welfare.''
Robert Keith, a budget historian formerly at the Congressional Research Service, said the term entitlement first appeared in the 1950s to describe Social Security and veterans and education benefits, and was in common use by the 1970s, after Medicare and Medicaid were created.
It describes programs that automatically provide benefits to those who are ''entitled'' because they meet certain criteria -- like age and payment of payroll taxes -- and cannot be changed except by a new law. In contrast, most other federal programs are called ''discretionary,'' because Congress can add or subtract annually in its appropriations process.
As the past two years have shown, that makes discretionary programs far more vulnerable than entitlement programs when Washington is focused on deficit reduction -- though it is the fast-growing entitlement programs and insufficient tax revenues that are driving the projections of mounting debt.

Current retirees are roughly breaking even when it comes to Social Security, but those who retire in coming years are projected to pay in more than they take out. (Source: The Urban Institute)

HEADLINE: Moscow Tries to Reinvent Itself as Financial Hub

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Having tried and failed to become a major financial center, Moscow is trying yet again -- only this time it finds itself competing for business with Warsaw, not London, Tokyo and New York.
Moscow wants companies to list on the Moscow stock exchange. It wants money center banks to expand here, as well as insurance companies and law firms that deal with securities, to make Moscow the hub for the former Soviet Union or Eastern Europe.
To do all that, city leaders are inviting business to glittering new skyscrapers, including the Mercury City Tower, which at 75 stories is the tallest building in Europe. 
''The idea is to upgrade the position of Moscow in ratings, to become closer to the leaders of innovation and to the big boys of international financial centers,'' Andrei V. Sharonov, the deputy mayor for economic affairs, who led a roadshow tour promoting the city in Asia, said in an interview.
This spring, the city government sent deputy mayors to Tokyo, Singapore, Frankfurt, London, Boston and New York to tell banks and other financial companies they should take a closer look at Moscow. The trip was the first concerted effort by the city government to woo investors as tenants for the new high-rise financial district called Moscow City.
Certainly Moscow has a lot of wooing to do. A city of traffic-clogged highways and sprawling concrete apartment blocks, Moscow is widely known as a singularly difficult place to do business. It did attract the big banking houses from New York and London after the fall of Communism. But cronyism, the lack of transparency and shady accounting gave companies pause. Weak courts and selective enforcement encouraged companies to conduct business outside Russia.
Political change in Russia further sapped enthusiasm. Vladimir V. Putin, a skeptic regarding greater integration with the West, succeeded Dmitri A. Medvedev, who was seen as a modernizing figure, as president in a switch known as ''the castling'' for its resemblance to the chess move.
Mr. Medvedev had named senior Western bank executives to an advisory council for transforming Moscow's financial sector. They included Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase; Vikram S. Pandit, the former chief executive of Citigroup; and Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs.
But the Global Financial Center Index, published in March by Z/Yen, a consulting agency, placed Moscow 65th out of 79 cities studied. London was first, followed by New York and Hong Kong. The ranking placed Moscow between Bahrain and Mumbai. A survey by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation even ranked Moscow No. 30 out of 30 Russian cities for ease of doing business.
''Moscow was never going to be an international financial center,'' a Western banker working here, who was not authorized to speak for his employer on the matter, said of the effort. ''That was a joke.''
So Moscow is setting its sights a little lower. Its biggest problem is to be taken seriously even as a regional center.
The midsize companies in neighboring Ukraine or other former Soviet republics are choosing to go public in Warsaw. They are hardly bothering to look at the carefully laid out welcome mat in Russia. Kernel, a Ukrainian corporate farming enterprise, and Coal Energy, a Ukrainian producer of steam coal, listed in Poland, where a policy of investing pensions in the stock market helps the local exchange.
The Warsaw stock exchange, in fact, has so many Ukrainian company listings it has a Ukraine index. Micex, the Russian stock exchange, has no such index because it has so few listings.
Moscow must compete, said Mr. Sharonov, the deputy mayor, because ''there are a lot of other opportunities and competitors all over the world.''
Moscow's roadshow was intended to illustrate the city's efforts to become more livable for foreign executives and residents, Mr. Sharonov said. A new interchange links the financial district to nearby roads, for example, easing congestion.
Also, under the federal program to promote banking here, Russian financial regulators tied up loose ends in ways that pleased stock traders and other financial professionals, but have not been widely noticed.
Russia created a central securities depository, introduced standard accounting rules for publicly listed companies and is well on the way to consolidating nearly all financial regulatory authority in the central bank by 2015. And, without much fanfare, the government now insists that all listed Russian companies report financial results in accordance with international accounting standards.
''It's a substantive change,'' said Bruce Bower, the managing director of Verno Capital, a hedge fund that focuses on Russia. ''The government realized that by doing a little work, for the first time, it could make a difference.''

HEADLINE: How the I.R.S. Hurts Mothers

BYLINE: By LILIAN V. FAULHABER. 
Lilian V. Faulhaber is an associate professor of law at Boston University.

 BODY:
BOSTON
LOST in the debate between Anne-Marie Slaughter's chronicle of the obstacles confronting career-oriented mothers and Sheryl Sandberg's call to ''lean in'' is a crucial reality: taxes. Women -- no less than other humans, it turns out -- can be rational economic actors.
The tax code starts with a bias in favor of couples in which one partner works and one stays home. Couples with very different incomes (think banker husband, novelist wife) owe less in taxes when they marry, while couples with similar incomes often owe more when they marry. 
This bias, however, does not directly discourage one partner from working. What does is the tax code's treatment of child care.
Most working mothers who pay for child care do so out of their after-tax income. This is not an issue for very well-paid women. Nor is it that relevant for women in poor households, since they most likely don't pay federal income taxes anyway and are eligible for the earned-income tax credit, the government's most effective antipoverty program.
It's women in the middle class who are hit hardest by this treatment of child care. For these couples, increases in the earnings of the better-paid spouse -- usually, still, the husband -- directly discourage work by the lower-paid spouse. There are several reasons for this: the federal child and dependent-care credit, which is supposed to help with these expenses, decreases as household income increases; the lower-paid spouse's earnings are taxed at a higher marginal rate because of the other spouse's earnings; and child care is paid out of after-tax income.
Imagine two women on either end of this middle group, each deciding whether to return to work after having their first child. The first woman's husband makes $25,000, and the job she is considering pays $25,000. The second woman's husband makes $90,000, and the job she is considering pays $45,000.
If the first woman enters the work force, she and her husband will lose their entire earned-income tax credit of more than $2,500. Because of her husband's earnings, a portion of her salary will be taxed at 15 percent. After she pays payroll and state taxes, her after-tax income will be close to $17,000. Say she lives in New York State, where the average cost of day care for an infant is just over $14,000 -- almost every after-tax dollar she brings home will go to her child care provider.
Now consider the second woman. If she were single and without children, her after-tax take-home income would have been around $36,000. But because of her husband's earnings, almost all of her income will now be taxed at a higher rate, 25 percent. After paying for child care, she will take home only around $16,000. This is not even factoring in the fact that many higher-paying jobs, just the type Ms. Sandberg wants women to lean in to, require longer hours -- and the more expensive child care that entails.
Many women in these scenarios, where the costs of working outweigh the benefits, would rationally decide not to re-enter the work force.
That decision has a long-term impact. Every year out of the office will affect these women's retirement savings and Social Security contributions, their chances for promotion, and the likelihood that they will eventually be able to re-enter the work force at the same level and salary. This quite likely contributes to the relatively higher rates of female poverty, especially in old age.
The child and dependent care credit, created in 1976, was meant to address these skewed incentives. But the credit severely underestimates the cost of child care, and is phased out too quickly for higher-earning couples.
The most working parents can receive through the credit is $1,050 (or $2,100 for two or more children), but this amount decreases to $600 (or $1,200 for two or more children) as income increases. Even a couple making $50,000 could use it to reduce their taxes by only $600. Congress was right to prioritize the lowest-income parents, but it shouldn't ignore the impact policies have on other groups.
What can be done? We could decrease tax rates over all, but that wouldn't target the obstacles facing second-earners. There are three better possibilities.
We could directly address the high cost of child care by providing or subsidizing such care, as France and Sweden do. (Congress does allow employers to, in effect, subsidize their employees' child care expenses by letting them exclude a portion from their income. But many companies, particularly smaller ones, do not offer this option, and those that do can exclude only up to $5,000.)
A different approach would be to focus on the tax treatment of child care. We could increase the child and dependent care credit to include the full cost (or at least a higher portion of the cost) of child care, which would increase parents' after-tax income. Or we could treat child care as a business deduction. This would let parents pay for it out of their pretax income, and would have the added symbolic benefit of acknowledging that child care costs are ordinary and necessary business expenses.
It is unlikely that any of these proposals would pass in the face of sequestration. Nonetheless, we need to acknowledge that women (and other second-earners) are not opting out of the workplace without encouragement. If we truly want them to lean in to the work force, we need to have a tax system that does not push them out.

HEADLINE: Budget Constraints Forcing an Overhaul in Military Operations, Hagel Says

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, facing inevitable steep cuts in military spending even as global threats remain high, said Wednesday that he is being forced to consider fundamental changes in how the Pentagon defends American interests and conducts its daily business.
In his first major address as defense secretary, Mr. Hagel said a sweeping review that he ordered will seek to rebalance missions assigned to the military with the reduced money available for the Pentagon. The review's findings are to be reported by the end of May. 
''We need to challenge all past assumptions, and we need to put everything on the table,'' Mr. Hagel declared, warning that previously sacrosanct accounts -- weapons, salaries and benefits, personnel numbers and even how many general and admirals are in service -- will be scrutinized.
Addressing an audience at National Defense University, Mr. Hagel offered no specific cancellations, trims or shifts in Pentagon spending accounts, but he did describe broad categories that will be analyzed for savings.
Among them will be the proper mix of civilian and military personnel, and the size of the fighting force; the balance between officers and enlisted personnel; and the share of support and administrative duties to be performed by contractors and by troops. Mr. Hagel, who served as an Army sergeant in Vietnam, noted that as the military was shrinking, the composition of headquarters staff -- with the three- and four-star generals and admirals -- had not become comparably smaller.
Mr. Hagel said that the across-the-board spending cuts called the sequester have had ''a disruptive and potentially damaging impact'' on American forces, and that they will require the Pentagon to make big cuts to operations and modernization to quickly find savings in this fiscal year.
Under the new budget negotiated between Congress and President Obama, the Defense Department and the military will have more freedom to shift money within Pentagon accounts to more efficiently manage the automatic cuts, and the Pentagon's reductions would be about $41 billion in this fiscal year, down from the previous estimates of $46 billion. Even so, the Defense Department's accounts for military operations and maintenance will face a shortage of at least $22 billion this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
But Mr. Hagel made clear that these reductions would have to be managed while the United States continued to defend against violent extremism, as well as against new risks arriving over computer networks and ''vintage'' threats like the proliferation of unconventional weapons and the hostile aspirations of regional adversaries.
''America does not have the luxury of retrenchment,'' he said. ''We have too many global interests at stake, including our security, prosperity and our future. If we refuse to lead, something, someone will fill the vacuum. The next great power may not use its power as responsibly or judiciously as America has used its power over the decades since World War II.''
Mr. Hagel's carefully worded case for how and why to shrink the military acknowledged the need to anticipate uncertainty -- and assure that the United States is not viewed by adversaries as weak or unprepared.
Some themes of Mr. Hagel's argument to transform the Pentagon and its business practices to meet new fiscal and security challenges echoed a carefully worded case offered by former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. That address by Mr. Rumsfeld came on Sept. 10, 2001 -- just 24 hours before Al Qaeda attacks launched the United States on a decade of war and expanded military spending and upended any attempts to overhaul the Pentagon.
Mr. Hagel, who earned two Purple Hearts in Vietnam, spoke with caution about the use of military force in advancing the nation's agenda, and in tones set by Mr. Obama.
''The United States military remains an essential tool of American power, but one that must be used judiciously, with a keen appreciation of its limits,'' he said. ''Most of the pressing security challenges today have important political, economic and cultural components, and do not necessarily lend themselves to being resolved by conventional military strength.''
In a clear criticism of some past American national security choices -- but with no specific decisions mentioned -- Mr. Hagel said, ''We have made mistakes and miscalculations with our great power.''
With perhaps both American and foreign audiences in mind, Mr. Hagel nonetheless was unwavering in espousing an active overseas role for the United States, despite fiscal pressures.
The Pentagon, he said, ''must understand the challenges and uncertainties, plan for the risks, and, yes, recognize the opportunities inherent in budget constraints and more efficient and effective restructuring.''
He offered the military personnel and national security civilian employees three guidelines for leadership and decision-making: ''Does this help protect national security? Is this in America's strategic interests, which includes the political, economic and moral dimensions of our interest and our responsibilities? Is this worthy of the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, and their families?''

HEADLINE: Entitlement Spending and Debt

 BODY:
In ''Cheating America's Children'' (Views, March 30), Paul Krugman claims that our record budget deficits are no threat to our economy and would only be a concern ''if they were either leading to big trade deficits, increasing our overseas borrowing, or crowding out investment.'' 
Yet these effects are happening: Our trade deficit grew by about 50 percent between 2009 and 2012, excluding petroleum. Overseas borrowing is now at record levels, with nearly half of our publicly held debt in foreign hands. Krugman himself acknowledged businesses ''are sitting on lots of cash, despite record profits.''
He goes on to say that the real problem is budget cuts in public investments, failing to recognize these cuts are the consequence of excessive debt. Wouldn't it make more sense to take reasonable steps to control the entitlement spending that drives America's debt rather than implement the cuts Krugman bemoans?

1913 Anxiety Grows in Vienna
VIENNA -- Alarm is beginning to grow in the commercial community here respecting the Austro-Hungarian Government's insistence on the setting up of an independent Principality of Albania, which the majority of serious politicians consider impossible of realization. Attention is drawn to the fact that, whereas the lukewarm consent of the Powers to a naval demonstration against Montenegro was obtained with difficulty, no plan of action has been agreed upon nor is likely to be. In responsible circles the general opinion is that the scheme for creating an independent Albania is fraught with endless dangers for the Dual Monarchy. 
1938 Fashion World on Parade
PARIS -- The fashionable and sporting worlds of Paris and Europe, well seasoned with Americans, met yesterday [April 3] at the famous Longchamp racetrack for the opening of the 1938 season. Thousands crowded into the grandstands during the races, and in the intervals between the six events, jammed the betting stations and gathered in the paddock where the horses were shown before each race. Additional thousands crowded the pelouse section in the center of the track. Excitement ran high throughout the afternoon, but reached a high point in the fourth race, for the Prix des Sablons. The winner was Victrix, an American horse owned by J.E. Widener, of New York. This race offered an extra thrill when two horses collided, one continuing around the track riderless.
1963 U.K. Budget Lets Deficit Soar
LONDON -- Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's Conservative government today [April 3] unveiled a dramatic budget. It lowers most income taxes, takes 3,750,000 Britons off the tax rolls and forecasts a 1963-64 national deficit of $1.9 billion, more than ten times greater than the 1962-63 deficit. The budget is designed to expand Britain's economy without inflation and win favor with the electorate, which has displayed growing disenchantment with the Macmillan government. It provides more than $750,000,000 in tax cuts, mostly for low-income earners, families and the aged. Considering the Conservatives' traditionally cautious attitude on finance, this economic plan was near-revolutionary.

HEADLINE: Shipments Becalmed in Hong Kong Strike

BYLINE: By NEIL GOUGH

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The waters of the South China Sea surrounding Hong Kong were the setting for an uncommon sight this week: A growing crowd of hulking cargo ships bobbing aimlessly in the haze as their frustrated crews, captains, agents and owners waited for them to be able to come in to port.
A rare strike among contract dockworkers at the cargo terminals owned by Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest man, stretched into its seventh day Wednesday, and the walkout is starting to have a real and increasing effect on the flow of ships and goods on the doorstep of the world's workshop, in southern China.
If the strike drags on, it could affect the peak season for cargo volume, which begins in May and lasts until October, as exporters hurry goods from southern Chinese ports to retailers in the United States and Europe to meet holiday season demand. 
Although it is better known these days as a global financial center akin to New York or London, Hong Kong still ranks as the world's third-busiest container port, after Shanghai and Singapore. Despite its higher charges and slightly greater distance from export factories when compared with the mainland ports of southern China, Hong Kong has maintained this position because it has the most frequent connections to the United States, Europe and the rest of Asia. It also has been -- until the past week -- one of the most efficient ports in the world, analysts say.
Now, because of the strike, some vessels scheduled to dock at the port are facing delays as long as 60 hours -- 20 times as long as the three-hour wait considered normal. Those delays will ripple across the global supply chain, adding to costs as ships are forced to reroute or to skip subsequent ports of call.
''Most of the cargo comes from China or is destined for China, and the reason people bother to truck goods all the way to or from Hong Kong is because it is more efficient,'' said Roberto Giannetta, the secretary of the Hong Kong Liner Shipping Association. Protracted delays, he said, ''affect everything down the line.''
Evergreen Line, a large regional shipping company based in Taiwan, said that as of Wednesday, more than 10 of its vessels had been left waiting for berths in Hong Kong because of the strike. Three or four of those would need to be rerouted to the nearby ports of Shekou in the Chinese province of Guangdong or Khaosiung in southern Taiwan, a company representative said.
''This is not a good situation at all,'' said a senior executive at another major regional shipping company, who declined to be identified, citing the sensitivity of commercial contracts with the port operator. ''It is not only Hong Kong. It's going to hurt everywhere, in a way.''
''The majority of our vessels are waiting for berths right now because we hadn't expected that this thing would last this long,'' he added, estimating that his company had 20 vessels floating off Hong Kong, each having to wait at least two days to get into port. ''That's expensive.''
The strike itself is notable not just for the effect it is having on commerce, but for having happened at all. Unlike their better organized counterparts in the United States -- the longshoremen who won concessions after threatening to close East Coast ports from Massachusetts to Texas in December, or the striking port workers who closed the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports in California for several days in November -- unions have historically been weak in the Hong Kong port.
Apart from a 2001 blockade of the main road leading to the port by striking truck drivers that lasted only several days, the last wide-scale organized labor actions appear to have been during attempted Communist-backed port strikes in the 1960s, when Hong Kong, a British colony at the time, felt the effects of China's Cultural Revolution.
Hong Kong has changed dramatically. A widening wealth gap and soaring housing and other daily living costs have created a sense of disenfranchisement among even middle-class residents, who now take to the streets in protest several times a year, often in the tens of thousands.
The current strike began March 28, when several hundred subcontracted workers at Hongkong International Terminals, a unit of Mr. Li's Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, walked off the job to push for a pay raise of around 20 percent from the 55 Hong Kong dollars, or $7, they say they make in average hourly pay.
They include workers like Mr. Chen, a 16-year veteran of the dockyards whose job is to verify that his team is loading or unloading the correct shipping container from the correct ship. Mr. Chen, who would only give his surname because he was worried about retribution from the contractor that employs him, said that after several pay cuts, he was worse off than when he started on the job.
''The hours are long, and the work can be dangerous at times,'' he said. ''Counting inflation, I am making less than I did 10 years ago.''
The organizers of the strike say they have signed up 500 dockworkers from four companies that provide contracted services to the container terminal. In a strategic move, they targeted workers who operate the towering cranes that load and unload shipping containers from cargo vessels. Wong Yu-loy, the organizing secretary of the Union of Hong Kong Dockers, estimates that 200 of the 400 or so Hutchison crane operators are on strike.
The resulting slowdown has hit productivity and also the bottom line. Executives at Hutchison -- which directly and through a joint venture with China's Cosco Pacific handles more than half the cargo that passes through the Kwai Tsing Container Port -- said the strike is causing it daily losses of 5 million dollars.
Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong-listed parent company, is the world's biggest container port operator by cargo volume, with 30,000 staff at 52 ports in 26 countries. In Hong Kong, it operates 16 ship berths at Kwai Tsing, the city's main container port, including two through the partnership with Cosco.
Hutchison directly employs 1,800 staff in Hong Kong, and an additional 3,000 subcontractors through a network of companies that provide dockside services -- what the company considers ''noncore positions,'' according to its stock exchange filings.
Hutchison said in a statement that it had set up a special task force to deal with the striking subcontractors and had activated contingency measures that include ''relocating internal resources and manpower to sustain the operation of the terminals.''
On Monday, a public holiday in Hong Kong, Hutchison obtained a temporary court injunction against the strike; a judge will hear arguments on the matter on Friday. In the meantime, the injunction is forcing the striking workers to relocate outside the terminal's entrance. There, they continued their protest through intermittent rain on Tuesday and Wednesday, under the shelter of portable canvas tents.
''Some contractors have tried to bully the workers by threatening to fire them if they don't get back on the job, but it didn't work,'' said Lee Cheuk-yan, a unionist lawmaker in Hong Kong who is helping to organize the walkout. He said the union had raised 650,000 dollars for a strike fund. Workers could be seen lining up to collect cash handouts of 1,000 dollars each on one afternoon earlier this week. ''I think things are looking good.''

HEADLINE: For Friars, Finding Renewal by Sticking to Tradition

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL

 BODY:
CORK, Ireland -- The Rev. Gerard Dunne has worked for 12 years essentially as a human-resources recruiter -- albeit one in a habit cinched with a dangling wooden rosary -- for the ancient order of the Dominican friars. Once, his medieval robes may have deterred some. But today he is convinced that the garment is his greatest selling point for enlisting new priests.
Other religious orders largely stopped wearing their traditional garb in recent years, as they tried to attract new followers in secularizing societies. But the friars deliberately went on wearing the robes and promoting the spiritual benefits of shared prayer and a communal lifestyle -- with a little help, too, from a chatty blog. 
''We made a conscious decision a few years ago to wear the habit because we had no vocations and we were in a bad way,'' said Father Dunne, 46, who estimates that he has traveled nearly a half-million miles along Ireland's country lanes and highways in search of recruits. ''If we didn't present ourselves in an authentic manner, who would join us? And that meant going back to the fundamentals.''
Those fundamentals -- which include the signature white tunic and black capuce of the Dominican friars, fashioned almost 800 years ago -- have helped lead to an improbable revival of the Dominican order of preachers. Even as other orders close houses and parish priests in Ireland are vanishing at a time of clerical sexual abuse scandals, the Dominican order is growing, and not just in Ireland.
The friars are something of a hybrid between monks and diocesan priests. They live together in a priory, sharing prayers and meals. But unlike monks, they work in the broader community in preaching and teaching roles in churches, universities and secondary schools. It is a way of life that Pope Francis himself has chosen, shunning the papal palace for a guesthouse to ''live in community'' with bishops and priests at the Vatican.
In the United States, the largest northeastern branch is expecting 18 novices to enter its theology school in Washington, which was expanded three years ago. In the smaller southern region based in New Orleans, the Dominicans are scrambling to finance an influx of novices -- six this year -- with annual expenses of $30,000 for lodging and theology education over seven years.
''People see the habit in a much more positive light then clerical clothing, the black shirt, white collar and suit,'' said Martin Ganeri, who is a Dominican vocations promoter for England, where five people entered the order this year. ''The habit doesn't have the negative image of the clergy, the child abuse issue.''
In fact the Dominicans have faced child abuse accusations in Ireland. But perhaps because of a garb that harks back to the more austere and disciplined traditions of the church, the Dominican friars have managed to flourish even in the Irish Republic, where surveys show Catholics are deserting the church pews faster than in almost any other country.
In tough economic times, the stability of community may also be appealing, and the resurgence for the Dominicans has coincided with Ireland's economic crisis. But Father Dunne and others said most potential candidates were already prospering in existing jobs in professional fields, and came to the order because of a yearning for greater spirituality.
The revival of the order has been particularly striking in a country where diocesan parish priests have been disappearing. Just 12 men started theology studies for all of Ireland's 26 dioceses last fall -- a record low.
In contrast, in January a Dominican vocations retreat in Cork was oversubscribed at St. Mary's Priory and two more were added in March and April. The early events drew a total of 20 men to whom the idea of a simple lifestyle and a clear identity appealed at a time of uncertainty in the lives of many.
In the fall, the Dublin-based order enrolled five men, joining 20 other Dominican theology students. They will become part of a community of 175 priests in 18 priories or communal houses across Ireland.
Their rising numbers in Ireland have made the Dominicans the envy of other orders, which have sought to copy their recruitment methods.
''They're the most successful to the degree that they were online and on the Internet at an early age, and had a blog before the other orders were catching up,'' said Terence Harrington, a vocations director for the Capuchin order in Ireland, which has taken to Facebook and Twitter. The Irish diocese now has an iPad app for people considering the priesthood.
Typically, it takes eight months to two years for prospective candidates to decide whether to join the order while working with a Dominican mentor, like Father Dunne. With that period to reflect, the attrition rate for new entrants has dropped to 15 percent, Father Dunne said.
Maurice Colgan, 41, a former social worker for drug addicts who was ordained as a Dominican priest in 2011, said he was still adapting to his lifestyle.
''My hat goes off to diocesan priests, but I don't know how they do it without community life,'' he said. ''Today, you need the support of your brothers. Now, of course they may annoy you and you annoy them, but that's natural in a community.''
At one recent retreat, prospective recruits were invited to imagine themselves as black friars, as the Dominicans are nicknamed, gathering for evening prayer at the 19th-century St. Mary's Church in Cork, where the order first arrived in 1229.
The guests included a university student, a government lawyer and a schoolteacher drawn by the order's Web site, which is stocked with videos, among them one of a friar snowball fight set to the song ''Eye of the Tiger.'' Later, the group crowded at a long wooden table for a traditional Irish fry dinner of potatoes and sausages.
Some of the Irish candidates said they were impressed by the order's rising numbers and openness to newcomers.
Matthew Farrell, 38, a former bartender from County Offaly and a novice, said he had sampled other orders, like the Carmelites. ''I've been searching a long time for a vocation,'' he said. ''I wanted to get married or wanted to do something else. I tried to visualize myself as a priest.''
But in the end, he said, the Dominicans won out. ''The Dominicans have a lot of enthusiasm and energy,'' he said, ''and I liked the fact that they wore habits.''

HEADLINE: Some Assembly Required

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
Despite the chaotic economic and real estate climate of the last decade or so, it is still the case that the young and innovative can take root and even flower in New York City. Amy Azzarito, 35, is proof that those in the creative classes have not all decamped to Pittsburgh or Philadelphia, and that you can repurpose old-media skills and appetites for a new-media world.
Thirteen years ago, the Arkansas-raised Ms. Azzarito landed in Astoria with a degree in journalism and a husband in an indie rock band.
To pay the rent, she worked at almost everything: as a production assistant in film; as a freelance librarian, organizing the collections of wealthy book lovers; as a blogger. The latter employment she stumbled into by winning a writing contest on Apartment Therapy, the prize for which was a ''job'' producing five posts a week for $11 each. 
She also wrote a screenplay, earned two more degrees (in the history of the decorative arts and design and in library science), interned for a decorator and worked at a bookbinding supply company, before being hired as a librarian by the New York Public Library. She spent eight years at the main branch on 42nd Street, with stints at the reference desk, among other places, finally working her way up to a senior position as a digital producer in the library's office of strategic planning.
She loved the bounty and breadth of the stacks, and she loved presiding at the reference desk, which made her feel like Lucy in Peanuts, she said. The most unusual request she fielded was from an older gentleman who wanted to know everything he could about Canadian train schedules and regulations. ''Because he rode the rails,'' Ms. Azzarito said. ''Like a hobo. I was, like, 'Really?' We had a whole conversation about what it was like to ride the rails.''
When she moved to the digital department, she and a colleague started a Web project inviting local artists and craftsmen like glass blowers and letterpress printers into the library's archives -- which contain artifacts like vintage textile patterns, old restaurant menus and even vintage valentines -- to create work inspired by what they found there. Design Sponge, the online decorating magazine, became a partner in the project. Grace Bonney, the site's founder, and Ms. Azzarito hit it off, and Ms. Azzarito began doing freelance work for Ms. Bonney. Three years ago, Ms. Bonney offered her a full-time job, and Ms. Azzarito is now the site's managing editor.
Her Design Sponge column, Past & Present, explains the history of a design trend (spool beds, say, or terrariums); sometimes she collaborates with a designer to create a DIY project based on the trend. For her first column, Ms. Azzarito repurposed a chandelier as a bedside lamp. It's still hanging in her bedroom, though she has since wrapped the cord in neon duct tape and affixed a set of cat stairs above it (these lead to the top of her closet, a favorite perch for her two Russian blues, Loki and Freya). Her book, ''Past & Present,'' which includes 24 trends and 24 new DIY projects, was published last month by Stewart, Tabori & Chang.
MS. AZZARITO IS AS NIMBLE in her decorating as she is in her professional life. In 2005, she and her husband moved into a three-room, 1,000-square-foot floor-through in a two-story building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which now rents for $1,800. For the new apartment, she made a four-poster bed, fashioned out of metal pipes from a plumbing supply shop.
After her marriage ended in 2009, the bed collapsed, which Ms. Azzarito took as an auspicious sign. ''We just outgrew each other,'' she said. ''He was the guy I went to prom with.''
So she redid her apartment. Her bedroom is now a deep charcoal color, and her new bed was built by the Brooklyn furniture makers at Nightwood; above it is a swoop of a hemp curtain.
Ms. Azzarito painted her brown kitchen cabinets a shiny white and made handles for them from leather straps cut by a woodworking friend in Oregon and tacked on with roofing nails. The middle room, which her ex had filled with musical equipment, is now a library. She sliced MDF, or fiberboard, into arches, attached them to the top of Ikea bookshelves and painted the whole thing white. The shelves took four coats of primer and three coats of paint, she said. Then she let them cure for two weeks before she put her books in. (Ms. Azzarito is not just clever, she is patient.)
So how does this former librarian sort her books? By color, as it happens, which puts Harold Bloom (blue) on the same shelf as ''The Phantom Tollbooth'' by Norton Juster. ''It makes sense, actually,'' Ms. Azzarito said, ''because it's Harold Bloom's 'Stories and Poems for Extremely Intelligent Children of All Ages.' ''
She described how she once organized the collection of a neurologist in Dumbo: by subject classification and then alphabetically, which wasn't easy, because all the books were in Spanish. She used the money she made to buy a dining room table (a farm table from Moon River Chattel that cost about $800). The hustle you have to practice to stay solvent in New York, Ms. Azzarito mused, ''means you'll do anything, and so you meet amazing people and travel to neighborhoods you might not ordinarily see. It's fantastic.''
Her own neighborhood, coincidentally, is where her great-grandfather moved from Puglia, Italy, in 1921. He was a shoe designer, and she has a tiny gold wedge that was one of his salesman samples. Her grandfather was born here, and when she signed the lease on her apartment, he showed her the neighborhood: the settlement house where he had played ball, the house on Jackson Street where he grew up. On her first birthday after her divorce, she recalled, she bought herself a pair of gold pumps from Kate Spade because they reminded her of the tiny sample.
''I paid full price,'' she said dryly. ''Happy Birthday.''
But living alone is something Ms. Azzarito loves. ''I never experienced it, because I got married so young,'' she said (at 22). And growing up, she added, she shared a room with her two sisters, sleeping in one of three bunk beds her father built in a closet. (''It was a big closet,'' she said.)
Last Mother's Day, she and Ms. Bonney took their mothers to the Brimfield Antique Show, where Ms. Azzarito was taken with a plaster wall medallion of a female Roman head, one of a pair made for a Boston theater.
She went back and forth, ''Should I get it? It's so big! It's stupid to get it ...'' And so on.
''But as you can see, I bought her,'' Ms. Azzarito said. ''I ditched her mate, not surprisingly, and she's now a single lady like me. At least she doesn't have to be on OkCupid.''

HEADLINE: Weakness in Jobs Report Sends Market Lower

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Weak reports on hiring and service industries helped send the stock market sharply lower on Wednesday, giving the Dow Jones industrial average its worst day in more than a month.
The Dow fell 111.66 points, or 0.8 percent, to 14,550.35, its biggest decline since Feb. 25. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 16.56 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,553.69. Both indexes closed at nominal record highs the day before.
The stock market started 2013 with a rally as investors became more optimistic about the American economy, especially housing and jobs. The reports on Wednesday disappointed investors and came two days after news that manufacturing growth slowed unexpectedly last month. 
All 10 industry groups in the S.& P. 500 index fell. Banks and energy stocks had the worst losses, 1.7 percent and 1.6 percent.
''The market is overdue for a correction,'' said Joe Saluzzi at Themis Trading. ''I don't think that the economy supports this type of a rally.''
The Nasdaq composite fell 36.26 points, or 1.1 percent, to 3,218.60.
In the bond market, interest rates dropped to their lowest levels since January. The 10-year Treasury note's price rose 13/32, to 101 21/32, while its yield fell to 1.82 percent from 1.86 percent late Tuesday. The decline in yields means investors are beginning to seek safe haven in low-risk government debt.
The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-company stocks, fell for a third straight day, dropping 1.7 percent. It's now down 3.5 percent so far this week, far worse than the declines in the Dow of 0.2 percent and the S.& P. of 1 percent. That is another signal that investors may be becoming more bearish about the American economy.
Small-company stocks, which did better than the Dow and the S.& P. 500 in the first three months of the year, are more vulnerable to the economy than the larger companies in the Dow and S.& P. That is because they rely far more on domestic sales than global giants like I.B.M. and Caterpillar.
The Dow Jones transportation average, an index of 20 stocks including airlines like Delta and freight companies FedEx and UPS, fell more than 1 percent for a third straight day. The index, which is regarded as a leading indicator for the economy, has fallen 3.9 percent this week.
Service companies kept growing in March, but the expansion was less than economists were expecting. The Institute for Supply Management's index of service companies fell to 54.4 from 56 a month earlier.
Separately, the payrolls processor ADP reported that employers added 158,000 jobs last month, down from February's gain of 237,000. The ADP report is often seen as a preview for the government's broader survey on employment, which is due to be released on Friday.
The slowdown in hiring was partly a result of construction companies holding back on adding new employees. That sent the stocks of home-builders lower. PulteGroup fell 85 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $19.01 and D.R. Horton dropped 57 cents to $22.84.
Even though the stock market started the second quarter lower, stocks typically add to their gains after ending the first quarter up, said Sam Stovall, an equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ. Using data going back more than 60 years, Mr. Stovall says that the S.& P. 500 has gained an average of 9 percent from April to December after rising in the first quarter.
Among the stocks on the move, Zynga rose 46 cents, or 15 percent, to $3.53 after the online game maker introduced two casino games in Britain.
Abercrombie & Fitch rose $1.74, or 3.8 percent, to $47.20, making it the biggest percentage gainer in the S.& P. 500. The company said late Tuesday that it planned to expand internationally and place greater emphasis on cost control.

HEADLINE: Midterm Elections Unlikely to Alter Party Balance

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Like the current shape of divided government here? Didn't think so.
Well, get used to the combination of a Republican House with a Democratic Senate and White House. It's likely to remain that way for the next four years, not just two.
And oddly enough, that might just help Washington lower the partisan temperature and strike a few compromises for a change. 
The campaign for midterm elections in 2014 has begun. Late Wednesday, President Obama travels to California to raise cash for the Democratic National Committee and his party's House campaign arm.
But chances that Democrats can gain the 17 seats needed to recapture control of the House appear remote. Republicans have better prospects of picking up the six seats they need to regain the Senate -- but not drastically better.
After midterm ''wave elections'' in 2006 and 2010, the calmer outlook this time reduces the stakes of electoral competition next year. That, in turn, may expand opportunities for bipartisan action on such issues as immigration, modest gun control measures and deficit reduction.
''We're going to maintain our majority,'' Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, said in an interview. But with Mr. Obama not going anywhere either, he added, ''I'm committed to seeing ways we can work with this White House, knowing full well we have big differences.''
''I think what you're seeing emerge now is an appetite for achievement,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip, who is a solid favorite to win re-election next year. ''We want to do some things -- or at least try -- on a bipartisan basis.''
The ideological and political gap between the parties remains wide in any event. But the lure of seizing control of the House or Senate, and winning the presidency, has widened that gap in recent years by injecting all-or-nothing electoral drama into virtually every high-profile dispute.
In 2006, Democrats used unhappiness over the Iraq war, the Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina and other Republican setbacks to recapture House and Senate majorities. When the financial crisis hit two years later, they captured the presidency.
In 2010, House Republicans used continued economic weakness and a backlash against Obama administration policies to create their own comeback wave. Last year Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, set his sights on winning control of the Senate and ensuring Mr. Obama's defeat.
As it turned out, voters last November preserved the existing balance of power. Odds favor their doing the same next time.
As this week's fund-raising jaunt suggests, Mr. Obama is lending his energies to Congressional Democrats now that he no longer has to campaign for himself. But history and circumstance argue strongly against Democrats retaking the House.
Since voters tend to blame the White House incumbent for their discontents, the president's party has lost House seats in all but three midterm elections in the past century. The number of times the president's party has gained 17 seats in a midterm election: zero.
Democratic campaign operatives say they will defy history and gain at least a few seats. Among other factors, they point to strong fund-raising and the Republican Party's national image problems.
But district lines drawn after the 2010 census circumscribe their opportunities. Charlie Cook, a political handicapper, estimates that fewer than 30 Republican-held seats are even at risk, and Democrats themselves have slightly more in jeopardy.
The midterm electorate tends to be heavier than in presidential years with older voters and whites -- both important Republican constituencies. In Senate races, Republicans once again boast an auspicious map of possibilities.
More Democratic-held seats are up for election, including in such conservative states as Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina. Incumbent Democratic senators have announced their retirements in Iowa, South Dakota and West Virginia.
Yet under similar circumstances in 2012, Democrats actually gained Senate seats. The Republicans' staunchly conservative base of primary voters helped in some critical races by nominating candidates too clumsy to appeal to mainstream voters.
To win the majority, Republicans must avoid that pitfall, win all three Democratic-held seats Mr. Cook rates as ''tossups'' and snatch at least three more now leaning toward Mr. Obama's party. If the economy continues to rebound, however gradually, that will not be easy.
''Modest economic growth, divided government, a midterm election in a president's second term -- it's kind of a recipe for not much happening,'' said Gary C. Jacobson, a scholar of Congressional elections at the University of California-San Diego.
That doesn't mean there won't be fierce competition in the fall of 2014. And it's not necessarily a recipe for much happening in Congress.
Bipartisan Senate negotiations on an overhaul of the immigration system could yet fall apart over disagreements about a ''path to citizenship.'' Conservative resistance to expanded background checks for gun purchases could thwart another Democratic priority.
Mr. Cantor complained that the president, while insisting on additional tax increases, still has not embraced the structural changes to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that he says are needed to strike a deficit reduction deal.
Even on the divisive tax issue, however, Mr. Cantor can sometimes sound as if he is leaving a door open. If Mr. Obama shows he is ''serious about fixing the problem,'' he said, ''then we'll see'' about additional taxes.
(When pressed on the point, Mr. Cantor returned to his familiar position that the House would not back higher taxes.)
Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, former chairman of the House Republicans' campaign committee, said that each party had been humbled since November -- Republicans by their failure to stop year-end tax rate increases, Democrats by their failure to stop the budget sequester.
''Now that each side has recognized that the other cannot be bullied but must be bargained with, we have an opening to get things done,'' Mr. Cole said.
Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat who faces re-election next year but is an early favorite to win, voices similar hope.
''I do get a sense -- maybe it's just the season -- that there's a spring in everybody's step,'' Mr. Warner said.

HEADLINE: Fast-Food Workers Plan Second Strike for More Pay

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Tabitha Verges, a minimum-wage worker at a Burger King in Harlem, was caught unawares when 200 workers at other fast-food restaurants in New York City walked out last November to demand higher wages.
But Ms. Verges, 29, says she definitely plans to walk out on Thursday when the movement to raise wages for the city's fast-food workers holds its second big job action. The movement's leaders are predicting that twice as many workers -- more than 400 -- will engage in a one-day strike at 60 to 70 McDonald's, Domino's, Taco Bell and other fast-food restaurants.
Ms. Verges said that her $7.25 hourly wage had not increased since she began working for Burger King four years ago, and that though she had asked for a raise, ''They always give me the same excuse -- that they're not making enough money.'' 
Thursday's strike, sponsored by a labor-community coalition that calls itself Fast Food Forward, seeks to press the city's fast-food restaurants to pay their employees $15 an hour. Many workers say they can barely get by on the $7.25, $8 or $9 an hour that many receive; $9 an hour translates to around $18,000 a year for a full-time worker. The current minimum wage in New York State is $7.25, though lawmakers agreed last month to raise it to $9 by 2016.
''What happened in November was a very big thing in terms of seeing whether workers were ready and able to go out and strike and take risks in a way that has not happened in the fast-food industry before,'' said Jonathan Westin, executive director of New York Communities for Change, one of the main sponsors of the job action. ''A lot of people have been emboldened by what happened last time.''
Workplace experts said the November walkout was the biggest job action in the history of America's fast-food industry. The strike's organizers scheduled the walkout on Thursday to coincide with the day that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated 45 years ago in Memphis, where he was supporting a strike by low-paid sanitation workers.
''We believe that it's a continuation of a civil rights fight against low wages and for Martin Luther King's movement to win dignity and living-wage jobs,'' Mr. Westin said.
He also said that one big change since the November strike was that more than 100 members of the clergy had joined the push to raise wages for the city's 50,000 fast-food workers.
The Rev. Cheri Kroon, associate minister of the Flatbush Reform Church in Brooklyn, said Thursday's job action continued Dr. King's fight against economic injustice.
''My community in Flatbush is filled with fast-food workers who have been suffering due to low wages, no sick days and unsafe working conditions,'' she said.
The main event on Thursday will be a march and rally on 125th Street in Harlem.
Sponsors of Fast Food Forward include UnitedNY.org, the Black Institute and the Service Employees International Union.
The strikers' main message is that they want to be paid $15 an hour, although some workers are also saying that they are eager to unionize.
Gregory Reynoso, a driver for a Domino's in Brooklyn, complains that he is making $7.25 an hour after a year and a half on the job. ''It's impossible to support a family on $7.25 an hour,'' said Mr. Reynoso, 26, who lives with his 3-year-old daughter and his wife, a part-time employee at Macy's. ''We're just surviving.''
Ms. Verges welcomed the recent agreement to raise New York's minimum wage to $9 an hour, but said it fell far short of what workers needed. She insists that she deserves $15 an hour, saying it is hugely difficult to live in New York on her weekly paycheck of $122. That is what she nets from working 25 hours a week at $7.25 an hour.
''I'm behind on paying my cable and Con Ed bills,'' said Ms. Verges, whose Burger King is at 141st Street and Broadway. ''I don't think $15 an hour is asking too much. I do it all. I do three or four jobs. I take orders, I make the orders. I work the cash register. I say, 'Have a good day.' I do the inventory. I take out the trash. I get down and scrub the floor. I don't think $7.25 is nearly enough.''
Burger King officials said that their restaurants provided entry-level jobs for millions of Americans and trained and invested in workers. Miguel Piedra, a Burger King spokesman, said the company's restaurants ''offer compensation and benefits that are consistent with the quick-service restaurant industry.''

HEADLINE: It's North Korea, Again

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Recent weeks of saber-rattling and military escalation have affirmed a harsh truth: North Korea -- which is much closer to putting a nuclear warhead on a missile than Iran and has threatened to strike the United States and its allies -- is the more urgent challenge. The major powers still haven't figured out how to solve it. 
The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, took power in late 2011. Since then, the North has launched a three-stage rocket and tested a nuclear device. After the United Nations Security Council imposed new sanctions in last month for the country's third nuclear test in February, North Korea's s rhetoric became even more aggressive. It threatened to hit American cities with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles and declared itself to be in a state of war with South Korea.
For their part, the United States and South Korea went ahead with a joint military exercise, then upped the ante. Washington deployed extra ships, sent B-2 stealth bombers, F-22 stealth fighter jets and B-52 bombers on practice runs over the South, and, on Wednesday, announced it was setting up a land-based missile defense system in Guam. On Monday, South Korea's president, Park Geun-hye, vowed to strike back quickly if the North stages an attack.
The Obama administration was prudent to bolster its forces in the region. Many experts assume Mr. Kim won't attack the world's top military power or its allies, but Washington has an obligation to guarantee that if this assumption is wrong, it can defend the homeland. There are also sound reasons to reassure South Korea and Japan that America's defense commitments remain firm; some politicians in both countries are pushing their governments to develop their own nuclear weapons programs, which would be disastrous and unnecessary. Finally, there is a message in all this to China, namely that if it will not rein in the ally it keeps afloat with food, fuel and trade, then Washington will contain it.
But it's clearly time to find ways to calm the crisis; there is no way to ensure that Mr. Kim, in particular, won't miscalculate and trigger a serious confrontation. The Obama administration and North Korea in recent days have sent mixed messages in this regard. Secretary of State John Kerry's declaration on Tuesday that the United States would negotiate seriously on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula was helpful. But it could prove more useful to encourage Ms. Park, who has talked of engaging the North, to take the lead, perhaps by exploring Mr. Kim's recent comments about wanting to talk about development.
China remains central to any coherent strategy and some Chinese elites have urged Beijing to abandon its ally. Whether that happens, China needs to robustly enforce the United Nations sanctions it helped enact and stand with the United States and others in delivering a unified message that North Korea will never be accepted as a nuclear weapons state but that there is a path to economic revival and security if it chooses to take it. Plotting next steps should be high on the agenda when Mr. Kerry visits Beijing next week. There's no guarantee any strategy will be successful, but military escalation is no answer either.

HEADLINE: Walmart Strains To Keep Aisles Stocked Fresh

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Michelle Obama visited a Walmart in February to extol the fresh, healthy food in the company's grocery aisles. But Walmart, Ms. Obama's corporate partner in a campaign to make food healthier and more affordable, has been running into problems with food that is not so fresh.
Walmart, the nation's largest retailer and grocer, has cut so many employees that it no longer has enough workers to stock its shelves properly, according to some employees and industry analysts. Internal notes from a March meeting of top Walmart managers show the company grappling with low customer confidence in its produce and poor quality. ''Lose Trust,'' reads one note, ''Don't have items they are looking for -- can't find it.''
Walmart is addressing the grocery concerns with measures like a new inventory system and signs that will help employees figure out what is fresh and what is not, Jack L. Sinclair, Walmart United States executive vice president for food, said in an interview. Brooke Buchanan, a company spokeswoman, said Walmart felt its stores were fully staffed. 
Before the recession, at the start of 2007, Walmart had an average of 338 employees per store at its United States stores and Sam's Club locations. Now, it has 281 per store, having cut the number of United States employees while adding hundreds of stores.
''In its larger supercenter stores, Walmart can't keep the shelves stocked, and that is driving customers away,'' said Terrie Ellerbee, associate editor at the grocery industry publication The Shelby Report, in an e-mail.
She traced the problem to 2010, after Walmart reduced the range of merchandise it carried in an attempt to make stores less cluttered. Customers did not like the change, and Walmart added merchandise back, but with declining sales then, it did not add back employees, she said. ''Without enough labor hours to get those items back, not to mention to do routine stocking, shelves were left bare,'' Ms. Ellerbee said.
Walmart charged into the grocery market about two decades ago, realizing that frequent trips by grocery shoppers could help improve traffic. Grocery made up 55 percent of Walmart United States sales in 2012, which was flat from the previous year. The company's grocery prices are usually about 15 percent below competitors', according to Supermarket News.
Grocery has also been a centerpiece of its corporate responsibility strategy, as the company has trumpeted its support from Ms. Obama in selling healthy foods in underserved, low-income communities.
At the event with Ms. Obama in Springfield, Mo., the company said it had saved customers $2.3 billion on fresh fruits and vegetables in two years.
Ms. Obama's office said that Walmart ''has been a strong partner'' on the healthy-food front. ''There's still more to be done, but we look forward to continuing working with Walmart and others,'' said Sam Kass, executive director of Let's Move!, Ms. Obama's anti-obesity program.
Yet growth has been slowing, analysts say.
''They're still growing share and aisles at a tremendous rate, but not at the rate they were, in part because many of the established operators that are left today are pretty strong,'' said Mark Hamstra, retail and finance editor of Supermarket News.
Walmart does well in dry goods, but fresh food requires more manpower to stock and rotate goods, involves more waste and is a higher-cost operation, he said.
According to the notes from the Walmart meeting last month in Orlando obtained by The New York Times, while Walmart has 20 percent of the market share in dry grocery, it has 15 percent in fresh (areas like produce, meat, deli and bakery).
Safeway customers are 71 percent confident in its fresh produce, the notes said, while Walmart customers are 48 percent confident in Walmart's produce. In the interview, Mr. Sinclair of Walmart said he did not know where that data came from, but that ''we believe that we can improve the perception of quality of produce for Walmart customers.''
The notes highlighted some stocking problems: ''1 hour out of Refrigeration = 1 day less product life,'' they read, adding that Walmart will change shift responsibilities so fresh food is not stocked overnight and goes out at 10 a.m., not 7 a.m. Also, Walmart will add secret shoppers to check on produce quality weekly, and add ''would I buy it?'' guides for employees, the notes said.
''What we're trying to do this year is really accelerate the produce side of our business with better quality,'' Mr. Sinclair said.
The company just introduced an inventory management system for produce departments nationwide that will track how many days an item has been in transit, how much shelf life remains, and what orders the company should place to meet demand. With delicate items like raspberries, ''you almost need to know by the hour how long the product has been through our system,'' which was hard to track when 42 distribution centers buying from hundreds of different vendors were sending around products, he said.
Mr. Sinclair said the stores would also change from putting out produce in huge amounts to displaying small quantities and ''showing customers that they're bringing fresh produce out all the time.''
Asked if the lower staffing levels in the stores was affecting replenishment, Mr. Sinclair said that he would not comment on other parts of the store, ''but in terms of the produce issue, our availability challenges are the same as everyone else's challenges across the marketplace.''
Labor groups and some employees say the low staffing levels are hurting the in-store experience.
Tsehai Scott, a manager at a Los Angeles Walmart who is a member of the union-affiliated employee group OUR Walmart, said ''sometimes there's a 30- or 40-minute wait in the line'' because there are not enough cashiers working. With as few as 11 people on the overnight shift stocking the 218,000-square-foot store, ''stocking has fallen by the wayside in what we call the consumable areas,'' meaning everyday products like food or toiletries.
''The department won't get as clean as it should,'' she said, ''or we'll see spoiled food in the food department, that if we had enough hands, we could get it back to the freezer or refrigerator in time.''
Ms. Scott says she has pushed for additional staff or for more hours for existing staff, ''and the answer that I receive is they want to focus on productivity with the workers that we do have,'' she said. Ms. Buchanan of Walmart said that on-shelf availability was at a record high, and metrics for cleanliness and other categories were on upward trends.
Still, customers have been complaining about stocking and may not wait around for Walmart. ''People are going elsewhere,'' said Ms. Ellerbee of The Shelby Report.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Sundown in America'' (Sunday Review, March 31):
David A. Stockman's analysis of our economic situation and how we got here includes plenty of painful truth. I would, however, remove Franklin D. Roosevelt and President Obama from his villains list and replace them with Ronald Reagan and Alan Greenspan. 
F.D.R.'s policies gave help to the ''little guy'' when help was a matter of survival, and for hundreds of millions of retirees, those policies have been the difference between poverty and a modicum of security. Handed two wars and a broken economy and political system, Mr. Obama has done well to get us to this point.
As Mr. Stockman should recall, President Reagan engaged in his own Keynesian excesses focused on the defense industry and ran up a huge debt in the process. Alan Greenspan, who never saw a bubble he could not blow bigger, gave tacit if not explicit approval to the disastrous guns and yachts policy of George W. Bush.

HEADLINE: Uncovering the Human Factor in Risk Management Models

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. E-mail: jesse@propublica.org Twitter: @eisingerj.

 BODY:
When he left physics, John Breit had the choice of a job in naval intelligence or on Wall Street. ''My wife said I couldn't be a spy. She hates capitalism, but said to go to Wall Street,'' he told me recently. ''And then I ended up running a spy network.''
Calvin Trillin once attributed the financial collapse to the influx of smart people on Wall Street. The physicists, computer scientists and mathematicians displaced the slow-thinking country club types. With their incomprehensibly complex models, the smart guys' hubris brought our economy low.
Mr. Breit was part of that initial incursion. A Ph.D. in physics from Columbia, he was doing postdoctoral work when he realized that he could never be as good as his contemporary Edward Witten, who went on to pioneer string theory. 
So in 1986, he joined Wall Street, moving not to the trading floor, like many of his fellow rocket scientists, but into risk management. In 1990, he took his skills to Merrill Lynch, rising to become the firm's head of market risk oversight. The physicist came to understand the limits of mathematical models. He learned that his job was really psychologist, confessor and detective. He became the financial version of a counterintelligence officer, searching for the missed clues and hidden dangers in the firm's trading strategies.
Mr. Breit is retired now, studying ancient Greek in his spare time and volunteering as an adviser for New York's pension funds. He comes across as George Smiley if he were a Southerner -- gracious, reluctant to talk about himself, with iconoclastic opinions just below the surface. I've been talking to him periodically over the years about how giant financial institutions should manage the aggressive traders slinging giant sums around the world in ever more complex transactions.
After the Senate issued a report last month on JPMorgan Chase's multibillion-dollar London whale trading loss, an incident where the mathematical modeling went seriously wrong, I reached out to him again.
That debacle encapsulates much of what is wrong about how banks manage their risk and how the regulators oversee those efforts. At JPMorgan Chase, the risk models hid -- and were used to hide -- risks from the traders and top executives. Too many measures and too many numbers undid the risk managers. But ultimately, they failed because of human frailties; the risk managers lost sight of their mission and tried to protect the traders and their trades. As in all spy debacles, the counterintelligence officers got co-opted.
Early in his career, Mr. Breit figured out that models for markets aren't like those for physics. They don't come from nature. It was necessary to know the math, if only so that he couldn't be intimidated by the quantitative analysts.
But the numbers more often disguise risk than reveal it. ''I went down the statistical path,'' he said. He built one of the first value-at-risk models, or VaR, a mathematical formula that is supposed to distill how much risk a firm is running at any given point.
The only thing from capital markets math he came to embrace was this immutable law of nature: investors make money by taking risk. ''If it's profitable and seems riskless, it's a business you don't understand,'' he told me.
Instead of fixating on models, risk managers need to develop what spies call humint -- human intelligence from flesh and blood sources. They need to build networks of people who will trust them enough to report when things seem off, before they become spectacular problems. Mr. Breit, who attributes this approach to his mentor, Daniel Napoli, the former head of risk at Merrill Lynch, took people out drinking to get them to open up. He cultivated junior accountants.
''They see things first,'' he said. ''Almost every trading debacle was sitting on some accountant's desk.''
All the while, he was on the lookout for bad trades. Most traders who get into trouble, he thinks, aren't bad guys. The bad ones, who try to cover up improper trades, are relatively easy to detect. The real threat, he said, comes from the ''crazy ones'' who really believe they've found ways to spin flax into gold. They can blow up a firm with the best of intentions.
They don't do it suddenly. ''I hate the whole Black Swan concept,'' he said, referring to the notion, popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, that the true risks lie in unforeseeable events that occur with much more frequency than the mathematical models suggest. ''It takes years of concerted effort to lose a lot.''
Yes, a big market move might reveal a fatally flawed trade, but that volatility is not the root cause of an oversize loss.
The problem, as Mr. Breit sees it, is that this has nothing to do with how risk management is practiced today, or what the regulators encourage. Regulators have reduced risk managers to box checkers, making sure they take every measure of risk and report it dutifully on extensive forms. ''It just consumes more and more staff, turning them into accountants and rotting brains.''
Take VaR. In Mr. Breit's view, Wall Street firms, encouraged by regulators, are on a fool's mission to enhance their models to more reliably detect risky trades. Mr. Breit finds VaR, a commonly used measure, useful only as a contrary indicator. If VaR isn't flashing a warning signal for a profitable trade, that may well mean there is a hidden bomb.
He despises the concept of ''risk-weighted assets,'' where banks put up capital based on the perceived riskiness of the assets. Inevitably, he argues, banks will ''pile into'' the same types of supposedly safe investments, creating bubbles that make the risks far more severe than the initial perceptions. Paradoxically, risk-weighting can leave banks setting aside the least capital to cover the biggest dangers.
''I could not be more disappointed,'' he said. ''The cynic in me thinks this is all in the interests of senior management and regulators to avoid blame. They may not think they can prevent the next crisis, but they then can blame the statistics.''
Instead, Mr. Breit says he believes that regulators should encourage firms when they reach different conclusions on what is risky and what is safe. That creates a diverse ecosystem, more resilient to any one pestilence.
And the regulators should empower risk managers by finding out how many times they meet with chief executives and what they have recently vetoed, and by judging whether the traders respect them. ''It's all completely unquantifiable and vague,'' he said, adding that a risk manager should be divorced from the profit and loss statement, the one ''who throws sand in the gears.''
Mr. Breit's sand-throwing days are over now. Undermined during the credit boom, as the firm's head, E. Stanley O'Neal, became isolated and paranoid, he resigned his position in 2005 (but stayed at the firm). By the summer of 2007, he realized that something was terribly wrong with Merrill Lynch's subprime mortgage exposure. He began calling in favors to find out what was going on and became alarmed. Eventually, Mr. O'Neal called him in, seemingly thinking that Mr. Breit was still his risk manager. It was too late to save the firm from billions in losses.
When he resigned his position at Merrill Lynch, did a board member or regulator call him to ask why?
''Not a one,'' he told me. Government overseers need to develop human sources, too.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: How Data Analysis Led Us to Reassess Sales and Open a Lead-Generation Center

BYLINE: BRYAN BURKHART


HIGHLIGHT: Our account executives are really good at closing deals when they have the opportunity to meet with a company in person. How do we increase the number of in-person meetings? 

 BODY:
Here is a quote I love from "Good to Great," the Jim Collins book: "But once we looked at the facts, there was really no question about what we had to do. So we just did it."
At H.Bloom, we try to live by that principle, which is why we are always collecting data, analyzing the evidence, and making decisions to improve the business based on these facts. Here's an example. 
Since we got started in April 2010, the company has experienced fast growth, more than doubling revenue last year. The majority of our revenue comes from corporate customers - hotels, retailers, residential buildings, commercial buildings and offices - who subscribe to our weekly flower-delivery service and/or our plant-installation and maintenance service. We acquire these corporate customers through a direct-sales force. We have account executives in all of our local markets - New York, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco and Dallas - who make cold calls, send e-mails, have sales meetings, give presentations, and close deals. The unit economics of our corporate business is terrific today: for every dollar of sales expense, we receive many dollars in lifetime value, measured as gross profit.
But we can always do better. 
Our director of sales operations, Kim Scott, is no stranger to quantitative analysis. Equipped with an undergraduate degree from M.I.T. and a Masters Degree in Engineering from the University of California, she digs into the details of our sales team's activities to optimize our sales process. The members of our sales team use Salesforce to track leads, sales opportunities and signed customers. As a result, we have a lot of data on the dynamics of our sales funnel; we can see the number of new leads that go into the top of the funnel and our conversion rate prosecuting those leads.
In Kim's review of the data recently, she spotted some interesting facts. Our account executives are really good at closing deals when they have the opportunity to meet with a company in person. The conversion rate for even a brand new account executive is more than 20 percent given an in-person meeting. For account executives with at least a year at H.Bloom, the conversion rate rises to 52 percent! This is a phenomenal rate and leads to a very simple conclusion: H.Bloom account executives should meet in person with a lot of companies.
Based on the data, Kim asked how we might increase the activities that create in-person meetings. She returned to the facts, and she noticed something else: Almost all of the activities - sending e-mails, making phone calls - that lead to in-person meetings are done remotely - 96 percent, in fact. That means that these activities do not have to take place in our local markets. Yet, until this point, our local account executives - the very same folks that go on the meetings and close the deals - had been responsible for generating those leads and filling the top of the sales funnel.
Our vice president of sales, Tom MacLeod, grasped the opportunity immediately: we could invest in lead-generation specialists to increase activities, which, if our conversion rate stays the same, would dramatically increase our new subscription customers and therefore increase monthly revenue. Moreover, because the majority of activities that lead to in-person meetings are done remotely, we could establish a lead-generation center in a place that is less expensive than our headquarters in New York City, providing a second potential benefit: a lower cost of sales.
Rebekah Rombom, who heads talent at H.Bloom, got involved to work with Tom and define the roles and determine how to build this new team. First, they chose a location for the new lead-generation center: Pittsburgh. It is a great town, surrounded by many terrific colleges that provide an educated employee base. It is a short flight from New York and much less expensive. And, it is a city both Tom and I know well. In fact, I was born in Pittsburgh and grew up just outside of the city in Wheeling, W.Va. (I'm also a lifelong Steelers fan, so having an office in Pittsburgh brings a fringe benefit, particularly during football season!).
Second, Rebekah and Tom defined the role we were looking to fill: account development specialist. These will be people with outstanding communication skills - both written (for e-mails) and verbal (for phone calls). They will be highly driven, ready to complete 100 activities per day in order the fill the pipeline for local account executives. They will be highly competitive, undaunted by the challenge of a daily quota. At the same time, they will work well with others, both on the account-development team and with the local account executives who will be the recipients of leads from the account-development specialists. Finally, they will be motivated to be part of a fast-growth start-up, knowing that their activities will have a direct impact on the performance of the company.
We expect to see a significant increase in new customers and monthly revenue.
Next week, I'll talk about the recruiting campaign and interview process that we use in Pittsburgh. I plan to cover our entire hiring process for this new team in future posts: recruiting, interviewing, onboarding, training and results.

HEADLINE: Treasury Needs a Tough No. 2

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: A determined, accomplished regulator like Gary Gensler &#8212; not a Wall Street executive &#8212; is essential as deputy Treasury secretary, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
The Obama administration is actively seeking a new deputy secretary for the Treasury Department. Its leading candidate, Ruth Porat of Morgan Stanley, just withdrew, and a new short list is now being floated. But one name is conspicuously absent: Gary Gensler. 
Mr. Gensler is chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulatory body responsible for overseeing the business of commodity trading, as well as the critically important area of derivatives. In this capacity, Mr. Gensler has worked hard to make markets more transparent and to push market participants away from activities that can be destabilizing to the macroeconomy. 
In fact, the only imaginable reason Mr. Gensler is not on the Treasury short list is that he has been so effective getting financial reform in place that he has made powerful enemies on Wall Street.
Mr. Gensler worked in the Rubin-Summers Treasury Department in the late 1990s, when extreme deregulation was in fashion. Almost alone among prominent public figures from that period, Mr. Gensler not only learned the right lessons but is now willing to stick his neck out on re-regulation. (Former President Bill Clinton has also expressed regret for not regulating derivatives, but it's not clear what he might do about his concerns.)
If you look across the current set of officials, few are really willing to take on the industry lobby in a sustained way. Mr. Gensler stands out in this category. The most visible actions of the C.F.T.C. may have been its pursuit of the Libor scandal - the illegal fixing of benchmark interest rates by employees of Barclays and other major global financial companies. (For more background on the issues at stake, see this commentary by Mr. Gensler.) 
Mr. Gensler was also a constructive voice during the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, and he has been in the subsequent thick of rule-writing in the process of putting the law into effect. This is not glamorous work, but it is absolutely essential if the financial system is to function in a more stable manner (for details, see this speech by Mr. Gensler). Of course, industry people complain that the rules have not been written fast enough, but that is largely because of their diligent delaying tactics.
Independent observers, such as Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets, give Mr. Gensler high marks for his efforts - and for his accomplishments. "Chairman Gensler has done an exceptional job and has been a tireless advocate for implementing the critically important financial reform law designed to protect the American people from Wall Street and another devastating financial collapse and economic crisis," Mr. Kelleher said recently.
Perhaps this success is a result of the fact that Mr. Gensler is unusual in another way - he is a former senior partner at Goldman Sachs who thinks that Wall Street firms should not be allowed to take and mismanage risk as they have in the past.
As important as his work at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been, the deputy Treasury job is bigger - with a broad purview and the ability to jump into all kinds of issues. Under the Dodd-Frank act, the Treasury has become more central to financial issues, and there are a lot of Dodd-Frank reforms still to be carried out.
No one is going to intimidate Mr. Gensler with supposed street smarts or complicated algorithms. And as a nation, the United States is desperately short on financial executives who are determined to become really effective regulators. 
The revolving door between Washington and Wall Street is of course an important concern. In the latest development under that heading, Mary L. Schapiro, former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has joined the Promontory Group, a prominent force that works on behalf of the industry. (Ms. Schapiro feels she has established sufficient safeguards against anything inappropriate; read the details and decide. You should also review the case of Lanny Breuer, formerly of the Department of Justice, and now at a prominent law firm.)
Jeff Connaughton, a leading critic of the revolving door (see his book "The Payoff: Why Wall Street Always Wins"), thinks Mr. Gensler is an exception to the usual rule that industry insiders make ineffective regulators. In Mr. Connaughton's assessment, "It would be difficult to find someone better suited than Gensler - who now has consistently shown determination and exceptional capability - to be a more effective regulator of complex banking and derivatives issues."
Mr. Gensler is not working in government with an eye to his future prospects in the private sector; he burned those bridges a long time ago.
In contrast, Mr. Gensler has good relationships on Capitol Hill, having previously served as an adviser to Senator Paul Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland (and having a hand in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which seeks to strengthen corporate governance).
Not all Republicans like Mr. Gensler. They should get over this. As the Republican Party modernizes, it has to do more than pay lip service to transparency. Jon Huntsman put it well during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination: the United States needs markets to function properly, and this is possible only when the rule of law is in effect for everyone, without exceptions for the big and powerful.
The Obama administration has apparently asked Mr. Gensler to stay at the C.F.T.C., and one downside of his departure would be that his most obvious potential successors are not likely to push so hard for reform, and some might even allow a rollback of gains already achieved. But given that only a limited number of experienced and proven reformers can get jobs with this administration, we should want them in places where they can have the most impact.
Brooksley Born, whose credentials as a reformer are second to none, hopes that Mr. Gensler will stay at the C.F.T.C. for another term. I agree that would be a good outcome. But with regard to financial reform issues during the second Obama administration, the position of deputy Treasury secretary looks set to be highly influential - and able to engage across the board on financial sector issues. 
Mr. Gensler should get the job.

HEADLINE: Rahul Gandhi Steps Forward

BYLINE: GARDINER HARRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The heir apparent of the Congress Party gave the most candid speech of his political career to date. 

 BODY:
NEW DELHI - He described himself as "irrelevant," said he did not want to be a politician, or at least a hard-nosed one. And he worried openly that he is going bald.
Rahul Gandhi, the vice president of the Congress Party, which dominates India's ruling coalition, gave one of the most important speeches of his political career Thursday before the Confederation of Indian Industry, but despite widely being seen as the present government's best hope for holding onto power, he insisted during his hourlong remarks that he did not have the answers and was not particularly important to the country's future.
"Give one individual all the power you want. Give him everything. He cannot solve the problems of a billion people," Mr. Gandhi said in a perhaps a veiled reference to his most important rival, Narendra Modi, who has said his record as chief minister of Gujarat demonstrates that he can improve India's economy. "Give a billion people the power to solve their problems, it will be done immediately." 
In a sea of people wearing suits and ties, Mr. Gandhi wore a white kurta pajama and brown sandals. And he spoke repeatedly about the need to bring the poor and the marginalized into India's political processes and economic growth. 
He was dismissive of the notion that one man or one leader could transform the country, which he described as the Indian political model "where you're going to have the one guy who is going to come, and he's going to fix everything. He's going to come on a horse."
Mr. Gandhi is of course the son, grandson and great-grandson of previous Indian prime ministers. His forebears are so much on the minds of those around him that in introductory and concluding remarks Thursday, two different people from the Confederation of Indian Industry referred to him as Rajiv Gandhi, India's assassinated prime minister who was Rahul Gandhi's father and the husband of Sonia Gandhi, Congress Party president.
Mr. Gandhi spoke of radically transforming the country's political parties to improve grassroots participation in politics, and he spoke admiringly of the primary system in the United States in which President Obama had to prove his mettle as a candidate before being able to run for president.
"The legislative engine in India is basically 5,000 people," he said, including members of parliament and state legislatures. But he said that fewer than 200 people select who those people will be, referring to the party insiders who pick who will run for office. 
"A lot of problems come from this," he said. "No one talks about this and says, 'Let's open this thing up.'"
Mr. Gandhi spoke for about 25 minutes from prepared remarks in which he said the government needs to accelerate the building of infrastructure, particularly "the roads on which our dreams are paved." And he told a lengthy story of taking a 36-hour express train from Gorakhpur to Mumbai and speaking to many of the passengers about their hopes and dreams. 
"That's the spirit of this country," he said. "Forward-moving, brave, not one of them was pessimistic."
During the rest of his remarks, he strode about the stage with a hand-held microphone, speaking extemporaneously for nearly 40 minutes in response to just two questions.
He said that India's power comes from its complexity and its compassion. He told of meeting a Chinese official who asked Mr. Gandhi why the world was talking about China and not India. Mr. Gandhi turned the question back on the official, who answered that China was an object of interest because it was powerful and India was not. 
Using a member of the audience, Mr. Gandhi demonstrated how he answered back by squeezing the person's hand in an iron grip and saying, "This is how China applies its power."
Then he embraced the person and said, "This is how India applies its power."
"India is sometimes described as an elephant. We're not an elephant," he said. "We're a beehive."
He said the decentralized, blindingly complex and seemingly chaotic nature of Indian society is a strength, not a weakness.
He said his role in Indian society is "an accident of fate. I come from a chain of people." But from that accident, he had a single aim in his life, he said: "I want to give. No, I want to help Indian people to find their voice."
The speech won him a standing ovation from a crowd of nearly a thousand, and he promised to return.

HEADLINE: Regulators Blamed in Foreclosure Review

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: A new report in Washington is placing blame on federal regulators and private consultants for a botched review of foreclosures. | Steven A. Cohen spoke to DealBook about his new Picasso. | Banks are making more loans to businesses, but the low rates raise concerns about profitability. | A federal judge dealt a blow to a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase of misleading investors. 

 BODY:
A new report in Washington is placing blame on federal regulators and private consultants for a botched review of foreclosures. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency designed a flawed review process that the consultants mishandled, says a draft of the report by the Government Accountability Office, Ben Protess and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook.
The Senate Banking Committee also plans to hold a hearing next week to examine the foreclosure review and other missteps at consultants like Promontory Financial and Deloitte & Touche, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. Regulators from the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are likely to testify at the hearing on April 11, according to DealBook. "Senator Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat leading the inquiry, is expected to broadly question the quality and independence of consulting firms that are paid billions of dollars by the same banks they are expected to police." 
The concerns emerged when the consultants, under orders from regulators to see if homeowners had been wrongfully evicted, conducted an inefficient review of only a small fraction of foreclosed loans, ultimately leading regulators to cancel the review. "The Senate hearing comes at a difficult time, particularly for the consultants. Regulators at the Fed and the Comptroller of the Currency's office are questioning the prudence of relying on consultants so heavily, according to government officials briefed on the matter." The consultants have long enjoyed a privileged status in Washington; Promontory announced this week that it had hired Mary L. Schapiro, the former chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
COHEN ON HIS PICASSO | It turns out that Steven A. Cohen's purchase of Picasso's "Le Rêve" from the casino magnate Stephen A. Wynn was completed in early November, before the insider trading case against Mr. Cohen's hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, entered a serious phase. "The timing was bad," Sandy Heller, Mr. Cohen's art adviser, said on Wednesday. And what does the hedge fund titan himself think of the painting? "When you stand in front of it, you're blown away," Mr. Cohen told DealBook.
The new details about the Picasso emerged as another legal headache developed for Mr. Cohen. A federal appeals court revived a lawsuit that Patricia Cohen, his ex-wife, had filed against him in 2009, accusing him of hiding millions of dollars in assets at the time of their divorce years earlier.
Without addressing the merits of the case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan said the trial court judge had improperly dismissed it on the grounds that Ms. Cohen filed the suit after legal deadlines had passed. Among the allegations by Ms. Cohen is that SAC was a "racketeering scheme" that engaged in insider trading. A spokesman for SAC said that the "decades-old allegations by Mr. Cohen's former spouse are patently false and entirely without merit."
CONCERNS WITH A RISE IN BUSINESS LENDING | 
A recent surge in banks lending to businesses "is starting to flash some warning signs," DealBook's Peter Eavis says. "The concern is that banks are making loans to businesses at rates that are so low that they may end up being unprofitable. A recent survey by the Federal Reserve shows that American banks are charging an average of just 2.83 percent on so-called commercial and industrial loans. That's down from 3.4 percent a year earlier."
ON THE AGENDA | 
The Bank of Japan on Thursday announced an aggressive monetary easing effort. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England are also set to announce decisions on monetary policy. Janet L. Yellen, vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, speaks at an event of the Society of American Business Editors and Writers in Washington at 5 p.m. Steve Case, the AOL co-founder, is on CNBC at 2 p.m. Bill Gross of Pimco is on Bloomberg TV at 3:30 p.m.
A LEGAL SUCCESS FOR JPMORGAN | 
A federal judge dealt a blow to a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase of misleading investors in mortgage-backed securities. Judge Jed S. Rakoff dismissed claims from the Belgian-French bank Dexia, over losses on $1.6 billion of the investments, significantly limiting the potential legal bill in the case, Jessica Silver-Greenberg reports in DealBook. "The lawsuit was being closely watched on Wall Street, in part because it could provide a window into another high-stakes suit facing the industry. In 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, accused 17 banks of selling $200 billion of dubious mortgage securities to the housing finance giants. At least 20 of the securities at issue were also included in the Dexia case, according to an analysis of court records."

HEADLINE: Politics and Personalities at the Central Banks

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: An interview with Neil Irwin, author of &#8220;The Alchemists: Three Central Bankers and a World on Fire,&#8221; which looks at how Ben Bernanke and two European counterparts have handled years of crisis. 

 BODY:
Before Ben S. Bernanke became chairman of the Federal Reserve, he served on the school board in Montgomery Township, N.J., as it debated whether to raise taxes to build schools.
In "The Alchemists: Three Central Bankers and a World on Fire," Neil Irwin, a columnist for The Washington Post, recounts that Mr. Bernanke, then a professor of economics at Princeton University, ultimately cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of raising taxes.
"Bernanke's instincts were to side with the low tax group," a former colleague, Dwight Jaffee, told The Washington Post, "but he would look at the numbers and make computations about whether it made sense to build new schools."
"He really has faith in doing the numbers right and then living with them," Mr. Jaffee said. 
The book, a history of central bankers as firefighters, is sprinkled with similarly illuminating anecdotes about Mr. Bernanke and his crisis-years peers at the world's major central banks, particularly Mervyn King of the Bank of England and Jean-Claude Trichet of the European Central Bank.
Mr. Irwin, a former colleague, breathes considerable life into the dry work of central banking. Indeed, the book is most convincing in making an argument that it does not quite make explicitly: that personalities and politics dictate central bank policy as much or more than economic theories.
Following is a condensed transcript of our recent e-mail exchange.
 Q. 
 Americans generally view the financial crisis as a domestic event, and it's already fading from memory. A central message of your book seems to be that it was primarily a European event, and it's not over yet. 
 A. 
 If history teaches one thing, it is that when a severe global financial panic sets in, it can easily bend and warp and metastasize. That's how what we once quaintly called the subprime crisis came to have such varied effects as banking collapses in Iceland and Ireland and Cyprus, a lost decade for the British economy, and a series of events that nearly unraveled 60 years of progress toward a united and peaceful Europe. At its worst, those types of unpredictable domino effects can lead to some very bad places, of which the Great Depression and World War II are the prime examples. Fortunately nothing nearly that bad has happened this time. But as catastrophic as the 2008 experience was for the U.S. economy and millions of Americans, it was closer to the start of the crisis than the end. 
 Q. 
 You illustrate in striking detail that the Fed's efforts during the crisis often were focused on Europe - a point that was little understood at the time in part because of the Fed's intentional obfuscation. The efforts were necessary because the world runs on dollars. The obfuscation was necessary because the Fed has no mandate to help other countries. Do we need a different system to fight global crises? 
 A. 
 On paper, the system of national central banks would seem to be ill-suited for addressing the crisis we faced, and have continued to face, for the last half-decade. In theory, Ben Bernanke is charged with maintaining stability for the U.S. economy, full stop, and what happens beyond our borders is only his concern if it redounds to affect the U.S. economy. But in practice, I found that the global central bankers have an extraordinary ability to think of themselves as part of the same team.
The most concrete example of that is the international swap lines that were first used on large scale in the fall of 2008 and repeatedly extended during acute phases of the European crisis. In simple terms, the Fed would give dollars to the E.C.B. or Swiss National Bank or Swedish Riksbank, and get euros or Swiss francs or Swedish kronor in return, with the transactions to be reversed at a fixed date. Those international central banks would then lend the dollars to banks in their countries, helping to prevent their financial systems from freezing up. At the peak these swap lines totaled $583 billion.
So why was the Fed so comfortable making such vast U.S. taxpayer resources available to the rest of the world? It is deeper than just the various legal guarantees that ensured the swap lines were virtually risk free for the Fed. It also has to do with the bonds formed over years of meals and seminars in Basel, Switzerland, and at various international gatherings. There is a deep-seated attitude of mutual trust.
 Q. 
 Central bankers repeatedly underestimated the real-world impact of allowing financial firms to fail during the recent crisis. Mr. King let Northern Rock hit bottom; Mr. Bernanke threw up his hands as Lehman Brothers collapsed; Mr. Trichet made the same mistake several times over. Why was it so hard for central bankers to anticipate a lesson that seems so terribly obvious in retrospect? 
 A. 
 After all the activism we've seen from the central banks these last few years, it's easy to forget that these are economists schooled in how the free market ought to work. In most cases, the idea of using central bank resources to rescue banks that are failing due to their own errors violates their basic understanding of how things should be. Sometimes it has been that pro-market ideology that has driven their reluctance to act. Other times it is political constraints; central banks may be designed to be independent from politics, but that doesn't mean politics don't matter. For Mr. Bernanke, in the case of Lehman, the reality is that political will for bailouts had worn thin within the Bush administration (and there were no obvious policy tools to rescue Lehman). A central banker is always going to be more comfortable taking action at the outer limits of his authority if he knows political authorities have his back.
 Q. 
 Which of the three men would make the best dinner companion? 
 A. 
 No question: Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England. I am told he is a marvelous dinner companion, charming and erudite, with a twinkle in his eye and a dry wit.
 Q. 
 You've written that you do not expect Mr. Bernanke to serve a third term as Fed chairman. Do you think he deserves one? 
 A. 
 On merit, he has absolutely earned another four years; he has kept the U.S. and world economies from coming unglued. But I also think that central bankers or any high government officials serving for too long can be dangerous. I wonder how much of the Fed's failure in the period before the crisis can be attributed to the sense that Alan Greenspan, who served for 17 years, was an all-powerful demigod who had mastered the art of managing the U.S. economy. We limit the president to eight years, the F.B.I. director (in theory) to 10 years, and the E.C.B. limits its president to eight years. Eight years for a Fed chairman seems about right to me.
 Q. 
 You describe the efforts the financial industry made to secure a second term for Mr. Bernanke, including bank executives like Lloyd Blankfein and Jamie Dimon lobbying senators on his behalf. What should the public make of this relationship between banks and their primary regulator? 
 A. 
 It is troubling. I have often found while reporting on financial regulatory issues that many of the strongest defenders of the Fed as an institution also happen to be the people who are paid to lobby for the banking sector. A variation of this seems to exist in many arenas where there is a deeply technical industry that requires intensive regulation, in areas like mining safety and regulation of nuclear plants. One way to make sure regulators are acting in the public's interest rather than the interest of the regulated industry is to create a strong esprit de corps at the regulator, and the Fed is better at that than most agencies, with a high-functioning environment and maybe less of a revolving door than some places. But it's far from ideal.
 Q. 
 There is a powerful scene near the end of your book: people drinking on an Athens rooftop while neo-Nazis march through the streets below. Contrasting those two sides of Europe, you write that it is the work of central bankers "to bring back a world of economic possibility that would again suppress the ugliest instincts that lurk in the hearts of men." In your view, where does that work now stand? 
 A. 
 We've moved past the most intense phase of the crisis. The United States is not going to fall into depression. Europe will probably remain peaceful and united, though the human tragedy in Greece and Spain is already immense and I am less confident of its continued unity than I was before Cyprus flared up. The central bankers have succeeded at getting us past a set of profound threats to human well-being, for now at least. New ones will emerge, and they will be different from those of the past. How should the financial sector be regulated to restore prosperity without pumping up a series of bubbles? How should governments adjust to an epic demographic shift that will stress fiscal policy? How do the central banks disentangle themselves from years of intense activism to prop up economies and rescue banks and restore their place as behind-the-scenes technocrats rather than first responders? The crisis is over in a narrow sense, but the challenges for the central bankers are as great as they have ever been.

HEADLINE: Culture, Class and the Decline of Marriage

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Different marriage models and their cultural consequences. 

 BODY:
Continuing with my promised series of responses to Kevin Drum on gay marriage, here's his demographic case that growing public support for same-sex wedlock can't possibly have any connection to the wider retreat from marriage:
I don't think the demographic details back up Douthat's case. Take a look at the demographic groups where marriage has declined: very famously, it's been among poor and working class women, and especially among poor and working class black women. I'll concede that I might be off base here, but I think Douthat is assuming that recondite arguments over procreation and gay marriage, which are common in his highly-educated social group, are also common in the groups where marriage has declined. I doubt that very much. What's more, support for gay marriage is lowest in precisely the groups that have abandoned traditional marriage in the largest numbers. If the procreation argument were really affecting marriage rates, you'd expect to see the biggest impact in the groups where this argument is most commonly advanced, and in the groups that most strongly support gay marriage. Instead we've seen the opposite. 
It's true that support for gay marriage has historically been strongest among the most educated Americans, who also tend to postpone childbearing till after wedlock in far greater numbers than do the poor and working class; likewise, it's been historically strongest among whites and weaker among minorities, and whites tend to enjoy greater family stability as well. (Note that "historically" - I'll return to this below.) These points are excellent evidence against the apocalyptic proposition that mere support for gay marriage will "destroy" heterosexual marriage, and plausible evidence for the argument that gay marriage either has no impact on people's attitudes toward the institution, or (as some of its conservative supporters hope) actually serves to buttress marriage's influence over people's lives.
But there's another story you can tell here, about how different models of marriage work out (or don't) for different communities and socioeconomic groups. Liberal doubts about the past existence of a procreative grounding for marriage notwithstanding, there's a general understanding that the combination of the sexual revolution, economic change, and shifting gender norms have altered the way Americans conceptualize marriage, what they expect out of the institution, and how it shapes their romantic and reproductive choices. There are different takes on how this change has worked and what it means, celebratory and critical and everywhere in between - from Stephanie Coontz's line about "how love conquered marriage" to Justin Wolfers and Betsey Stevenson's description of a new "consumption partnership" model of wedlock to the George-Gergis-Anderson view of a "revisionist" view of marriage displacing a "conjugal" understanding. But I think a lot of people would recognize the phenomenon as the National Marriage Project describes it:
Over the last four decades, many Americans have moved away from identifying with an "institutional" model of marriage, which seeks to integrate sex, parenthood, economic cooperation, and emotional intimacy in a permanent union. This model has been overwritten by the "soul mate" model, which sees marriage as primarily a couple-centered vehicle for personal growth, emotional intimacy, and shared consumption that depends for its survival on the happiness of both spouses. Thus where marriage used to serve as the gateway to responsible adulthood, it has come to be increasingly seen as a capstone of sorts that signals couples have arrived, both financially and emotionally-or are on the cusp of arriving.
As the passage suggests, this model didn't just spring into being fully formed in 1968 or so: It developed gradually, through experiments and experience and also through cultural conflict with alternative models - both a more institutional and procreation-oriented model, which remained (and still remains) influential, especially among more religious Americans, and the more purely libertine, entirely deinstitutionalized approach to sex and relationships that gave us so many wonderful trends in the 1970s. To the extent that the "soul mate"/capstone model has steadily gained ground relative to the alternatives, it's because it seems to offer a plausible, stabilizing balance between sexual freedom and sexual restraint, new gender roles and traditional forms, adult liberty and children's needs, the secular and the spiritual. And it offers, as well, a model of marriage that can easily encompass gay and lesbian partnerships as well as male-female ones, which is why the idea of same-sex wedlock has passed so quickly from seeming absurd to seeming commonsensical.
But whereas the institutional model was associated with similar family structures for rich and poor alike, the soulmate/capstone model has thus far only really been stabilizing for the upper and upper middle classes. For the most vulnerable Americans, poor African-Americans and then whites, the new model never had a chance to work: The '70s-era combination of sudden sexual freedom and economic stagnation - and if you accept the Charles Murray thesis, perverse welfare policies - more or less demolished traditional family structures in a generation, helping to create the underclass as we know it today. For Middle America, meanwhile, there has been a slower but unmistakable drift away from two-parent households and stable families, which has accelerated as the forces propping the older, institutional understanding - traditional Christianity, in particular - have seen their influence over American life diminish. Only among the college-educated has the new model brought anything like the kind of stability that Americans took for granted half a century ago - mostly, one might submit, because the rewards for following a careful "education, job, marriage, kids" trajectory are so obvious that college-educated American understand the marriage-procreation connection intuitively, as a kind of gnostic wisdom that doesn't need to be spelled out.
In the rest of the country, though - well, again, I think the National Marriage Project has it mostly right:
[Disconnecting] normative links among sex, parenthood, and marriage ... generally works well enough for highly educated Americans, who tend to focus first on education and work, then marriage, and then children, and who see early parenthood as an obstacle to their bourgeois success sequence ... But it does not work out so well for less-educated Americans, who greatly value children, do not have bright educational and professional prospects, and also do not believe their romantic relationships or marriages meet society's new bar for a capstone marriage. Indeed, their love of children and the disconnect between their soul-mate ideals and their real-word experiences leave less-educated Americans much more likely to have children outside of marriage, to cohabit, or to divorce when their relationship or their financial situation fails to measure up to expectations.
But the fact that this model isn't working out that well in non-college educated America hasn't prevented the values associated with it from spreading apace, with each succeeding American generation - Boomer, X, Millennial - being more likely to embrace a more flexible view of marriage's connection to procreation, and a less normative view of marriage generally. Those values have spread, in part, because of economic trends that have further weakened marriage: Shifting values, in this sense, are a consequence of instability as well as a cause. (If you grow up with fewer models of a successful 2-parent around you, you're more likely to simply accept the separation of sex, marriage and family as the Way Things Have To Be.) But they have also spread because they work out well for the people who set the tone for the culture, and who therefore don't see why their values shouldn't be preached and modeled and embodied - in sitcoms and movies, reality shows and glossy magazines, and everywhere that mass media works to shape attitudes and aspirations, whether about the proper way to spend your 20s or the kind of money that you need to spend to make your wedding a true capstone moment. (Liberals who scoff at the idea that pop culture has this kind of influence should read Jonathan Chait's excellent New York essay on Hollywood liberalism, for a start.)
Nor is it only mass media: Our politics sets a cultural tone as well, and the people (politicians, consultants, talking heads) who mostly decide what counts as A National Crisis, what counts as The Civil Rights Cause of Our Time, and what gets back-burnered as A Complicated Sociological Phenomenon In Need of Further Study are themselves all people for whom the post-sexual revolution landscape looks pretty darn stable, and whose interests naturally turn to other issues, other causes, other trends.
This is where the same-sex marriage debate enters in, I think. It's because of the capstone/soul mate model of marriage, certainly, that gay marriage has found so much support so fast - but it's also that the case for gay marriage itself is a form of advocacy on behalf of that model, and (perhaps more importantly) against the traditional/institutional model's tighter sex-marriage-procreation link. And not, pace Drum, in some "recondite" way that ordinary people are unlikely to follow. The case for gay marriage, as advanced first in culture and then in politics, says 1) the cool people know that marriage is primarily about who you love, and only secondarily about how and when and whether you have kids, 2) the uncool people, political parties and religions that say otherwise are intolerant, bigoted, homophobic and dumb. This is a very effective, very comprehensible, not-at-all recondite argument - that's why it's winning! But it doesn't just depend on the newer model of marriage; it advances that model's imaginative hold as well. It's not just a political argument: It's a public teaching about what marriage is and isn't, which communities are praiseworthy and which are problematic, which ideas deserve a hearing and which deserve only scorn. And again, it requires a certain willed naivete not to see how it might influence people's ideas about their own lives, about their own (potential) marriages, about the older model of marriage and the institutions and beliefs associated with it, and so on.
I think if you look at the Millennial generation, that's (part of) what you see happening. Overall, the steady generational shift in attitudes toward marriage and family has gradually been swamping the differences between the social classes that pundits used to take for granted. If you browse this National Marriage Project report, for instance, you'll see that in their attitudes toward sex and marriage and their likelihood of church attendance, moderately-educated Americans have been converging with well-educated Americans since the 1970s: It used to be that Middle America was clearly more traditionalist than upper and upper middle class America, more "institutionalist" about marriage and more religious overall, but recently the moderately-educated have become more secular and socially liberal while upper middle class opinion has either remained the same or become slightly more socially conservative (in part, I suspect, because many evangelical Christians have moved from the lower middle to the upper middle class). Likewise on gay marriage specifically: Overall, age and religion divide Americans on same-sex marriage much more than class does, and for the rising generation the class division almost evaporates. (As does the gap between whites and Hispanics - and African-Americans are catching up.) The data isn't online, but I contacted the Pew Research Center and they confirmed that the big gay marriage gaps that Drum is referencing, between the liberal upper middle class and everyone else, simply don't exist for the Millennial generation: "There is almost no difference," they told me, "in support for gay marriage between 18-29 yr olds with college degrees (71%) and those who haven't graduated college (65%)."
So we have this convergence, which is mostly middle America drifting toward upper middle class norms and ideas about marriage, and drifting away from the (mostly religious) institutions that preach a stronger connection between sex, procreation and wedlock. And here's what's striking: As middle American ideas about marriage have converged with upper class ideas, their outcomes have converged with the destabilized lower class. Middle American divorce rates and out-of-wedlock birth rates tracked with the college-educated until the 1980s; they've been converging with high school dropouts ever since. A generation ago, it seemed at least plausible that 21st century America would have two (relatively) stable marriage cultures - one upper middle class and more socially liberal, one lower middle class and more socially conservative. But in the current generation, the upper class's values have triumphed, and the lower-middle marriage culture has gone into steeper decline.
This is why it makes the most sense, whether we're talking about gay marriage in particular or changing ideas about marriage in general, to zero in on Millennial attitudes, because it's the Millenials and late-born generation Xers whose marital and reproductive choices are actually driving trends right now. If, as social conservatives contend, the symbolic severing of marriage and procreation has the potential to shape attitudes and mores, then obviously you wouldn't expect a big impact on already-married people long past their childbearing years. You'd expect any effect to show up, instead, among people setting out on their life course. And whether the gay marriage debate has had any actual impact or not, if you break things down generationally there really is a clear correlation between 1) support for same-sex unions, 2) a belief that marriage and parenthood are basically separable (and that their growing separation might be a good thing) 3) a retreat from institutional religion and with it, a further retreat from the institutional understanding of wedlock 4) the likelihood of substituting cohabitation for marriage and having at least your first child out of wedlock.
Are these linked trends mostly about gay marriage? No, no, and no. (I think that same-sex marriage is a consequence that's looped back and become a cause as well, but trends 2, 3 and 4 would obviously be with us with or without trend 1.) And do they have a major economic component that the foregoing has slighted? Yes, absolutely. (One obvious reason why middle American outcomes have been converging with more downscale Americans is that wages have stagnated in the 2000s and jobs have grown scarcer for people, and especially men, without a college degree.)
But the fact the economic trends are easier to white-paper and run regressions on doesn't mean that the culture doesn't matter, that ideas don't matter: They do, they do, they do. And if we can't do anything about these trends (the subject of my next post) or don't want to do anything about them (because we think the gains in human welfare are worth it), it's all the more important to be clear-eyed, as we prepare to take the next step in marriage's transformation, about what this transformation has meant, and done, and cost.

HEADLINE: Thinking Straight About Debt

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: It&#8217;s not popular. 

 BODY:
A heads-up: I'm doing This Week this week. Also on the panel: David Stockman. This should be, um, interesting.
So, a few more thoughts on debt and what it does and doesn't signify. 
Start with the numbers that Stockman loves to cite, showing the ratio of total debt, public and private, to GDP:
Stockman, and to be fair quite a few people, would have us see this as evidence that we have been on a vast spending spree (Stockman is big on sprees), living far beyond our means and leaving us with no choice except a drastic reduction in spending. After all, debt is about 200 percent of GDP higher than it was before 1980. Isn't this a giant burden on the nation?
OK, the sheer size of that number should tell you immediately that this can't be right. Yes, we have run trade deficits and moved from being a net creditor to being a net debtor, but it's not that big a deal (and we still earn more on our foreign assets than we pay on our foreign liabilities). So the surge in debt reflects a surge in money Americans owe to other Americans.
I wrote about this analytically a while back, laying out a stylized framework in which it is literally impossible for the nation to live beyond its means - because there is neither foreign trade nor investment - so that debt growth is always about one group within the country lending to another. This can present problems, partly because it concentrates risk on the leveraged parties, partly because of the possibility of forced deleveraging. But the issue in the latter case isn't that we as a nation have overspent and need to spend less; it's that some people are being forced to spend less, and we have a depression because other people won't (NOT can't) spend more.
This is how you want to think about debt: it's not a burden on the nation's resources, because it's mainly money we owe to ourselves, and it's a problem not because we have to tighten our belt but because debt is currently leading to spending that's less than we need to maintain full employment.
I would add that one thing the model doesn't cover is debt of financial intermediaries, which is a big part of the real story and if anything bears even less resemblance to the notion of debt as a consequence of national overspending; to a large extent it's just an accounting issue, because old-fashioned deposits aren't counted as debt even though they are.
Maybe a short way to put all this is to say that we have a real problem with excessive leverage; that's not at all the same thing as the nation being deeply in hock to some external player or players. And failing to understand that difference is a way to get both the nature of our crisis and the shape of appropriate policies totally wrong.

HEADLINE: Consumer Bureau Says 4 Insurers Made Kickbacks to Mortgage Lenders

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: As part of a settlement, four insurance firms will pay a combined $15 million to settle claims that they paid kickbacks to mortgage lenders for more than 10 years in order to sell mortgage insurance to home buyers. 

 BODY:
A federal regulator set up after the financial crisis to protect consumers announced enforcement actions against four insurance companies on Thursday, asserting that the firms paid kickbacks to mortgage lenders for more than 10 years. 
The accusations of the regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, focus on mortgage insurance, a product that many borrowers were required to purchase if they didn't make a sizable down payment when buying a house. The bureau claims that, because of the kickbacks, home buyers may have had to pay more for the mortgage insurance. The arrangements examined by the agency were the latest example of how murky insurance transactions could be used to cover up payments of questionable intent. 
"Illegal kickbacks distort markets and can inflate the financial burden of home ownership for consumers," Richard Cordray, the bureau's director, said in a statement. "We believe these mortgage insurance companies funneled millions of dollars to mortgage lenders for well over a decade." 
Settlements with the four firms require that they pay a combined $15 million in penalties. The companies are the Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation, the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation, Radian Guaranty and the United Guaranty Corporation, a subsidiary of the American International Group. 
The bureau's investigation covered deals struck in the years before the housing bust, when using mortgage insurance from private companies was a lot more common. Mortgage banks often steered borrowers toward mortgage insurance provided by certain companies. The consumer agency claims that the insurers made disguised payments to mortgage lenders in order to gain business. 
The bureau didn't name the banks that it said received the kickbacks. "Because we are not done with this matter, there are still a lot of things we can't talk about," Kent Markus, assistant director for enforcement, said. 
According to the bureau, the insurers made the kickbacks in the form of separate insurance payments back to the mortgage lenders, called reinsurance. These payments didn't appear to provide real economic value to the mortgage insurers, according to Mr. Markus. 
In agreeing to the bureau's orders, which were filed with the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, none of the four insurers admitted or denied the allegations. 
In its statement, Mortgage Guaranty Insurance said it had "obtained actuarial opinions from independent actuaries reflecting that the reinsurance premiums paid by MGIC were reasonably related to the risk assumed by the captive reinsurers." 
Genworth said that when it set up its reinsurance arrangement, also known as captive reinsurance, it had used guidance from the Department of Housing and Urban Department. "Genworth followed the guidance, and had the arrangements tested by independent third parties to verify that the H.U.D. requirements were met," the company's statement said. In its statement, Radian made a similar point about using H.U.D.'s guidance. 
Genworth and Mortgage Guaranty Insurance also disputed whether borrowers were financially harmed by the insurance arrangements. 
In the settlement, the four companies are prohibited from entering any new captive insurance arrangements with mortgage lenders for 10 years. 
In a statement, Jon Diat, a spokesman for A.I.G., the owner of United Guaranty, said the unit "believes these practices complied with the law and were fair to consumers, but settled the matter to avoid the distraction and expense of protracted litigation."
Because reinsurance deals can be malleable and opaque, companies have been under scrutiny for using them to mask the real motivation for payments. One prominent case was a deal at the start of the last decade between A.I.G. and a unit of Berkshire Hathaway that made the former's balance sheet look healthier than it was. In 2010, Berkshire agreed to a $92 million settlement with federal agencies over the arrangement.
Since the financial crisis, there has been less demand for private mortgage insurance. Banks require larger down payments now, removing the need for private mortgage insurance. Meanwhile, the federal government, through the Federal Housing Administration, guarantees many mortgages with small down payments.

HEADLINE: After Stagnation, a Revival for Mexico's Financial Sector

BYLINE: ELISABETH MALKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Mexico&#8217;s growth prospects are attracting investment banks and investors hunting for ways to gain greater exposure to international markets. 

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY - When Banco Santander held the $4.13 billion public stock offering of its Mexico subsidiary here last September, a mariachi band and Mexican folk dancers set the festive mood for a media breakfast in a sun-filled dining room atop the stock exchange's skyscraper.
The offering - the largest ever in Mexico and trailing only initial public offerings from Facebook and Japan Airlines in terms of size in 2012 - was just one sign of the strong revival of the nation's financial services sector.
 Both global and local banks are jostling to underwrite stock issues. Mexican companies are looking for financing to help expand and make acquisitions. New structured finance products are attracting billions from local pension funds. 
And with the continuing crisis in Europe and lackluster growth hurting the United States and other economies, Mexico's growth prospects are attracting investment banks and investors hunting for ways to gain greater exposure to international markets.
"It's the coming of age of the Mexican market," said Eduardo Cepeda, J.P. Morgan's senior country officer.
It is a marked change from just a few years ago, when the loss of manufacturing jobs to China and recession in the United States had left the country's economy stagnant for the better part of a decade.
The current atmosphere is not without risks. For one, the new government has yet to present a convincing plan for tackling organized crime and drug cartels, which carry out kidnappings and gruesome killings that still dominate headlines. And persistent low wages in Mexico also serve to tamp down domestic demand.
Still, changes have taken place to foster optimism in the financial services industry. The new government of President Enrique Peña Nieto, who took office in December, has managed to recast the country's image by moving vigorously on legislation to attack problems that are a drag on growth.
Even before Mr. Peña Nieto took office, prudent policies had whittled away government debt, built up foreign reserves, controlled inflation and stabilized the peso. Growth of about 4 percent in 2011 and again in 2012 outpaced Brazil.
"Investment bankers benefit from upswings and downturns," said Mauro Guillén, a professor of international management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. "Everybody is expecting a lot of deals in Mexico."
The financial services industry is making up for lost time, jumping back into an emerging market that had long been overlooked. The sector's growth is also being helped by an important new player in the local market: Mexico's pension funds, which manage nearly $160 billion in assets. That figure is expected to double over the next six years, according to Carlos Ramírez Fuentes, the president of Consar, the government's pension fund regulator.
"The Mexican financial system is still relatively small," Mr. Ramírez said. "The resources are growing fast, and you need different alternatives for investment."
Mexico created a pension plan 15 years ago that channels a percentage of each worker's salary into a private fund, run by a manager called an Afore, a Spanish acronym.
For the first decade, Afores were limited to buying government debt. As regulators began to relax the rules, the funds diversified into corporate debt, and then into the stock market and structured finance instruments.
The pension funds continue to "redefine the capital markets" in Mexico, said Jaime Martínez-Negrete, the president of Morgan Stanley Mexico, which opened a broker-dealer in late 2010 to serve the local market. "It's a market that is becoming more deep and broad in its products."
To attract investment from those pension funds, Mexico's stock market and the finance ministry created a special vehicle, a structured equity security known as a CKD.
The CKD allows investors to buy into a publicly traded fund that typically invests in infrastructure, real estate and private companies. Since they were first created in 2009, there have been 29 issues, worth about $4.8 billion.
A subset of the CKDs has been Mexico's version of real estate investment trusts, known as Fibras. "There is enormous potential for growth and development for CKDs and Fibras," said Gema Sacristán, chief of the financial markets division at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington. "Mexico's regulators should continue looking for new investment schemes and institutional investors."
Mexico's stock market is also showing signs of revival, although it is still relatively small compared to Brazil's, its main rival in Latin America. With only a handful of new issues a year or even less, the stock market is worth just 46 percent of gross domestic product, compared with about 150 percent for Brazil, Luis Téllez, the president of the Mexican Stock Exchange, said.
But initial public offerings are showing signs of life. Mr. Téllez said he expected 15 I.P.O.'s this year, although the total amount they raise may be lower than in 2012 because of the size of the Santander deal. Last month, Sempra Energy's Mexico subsidiary raised $600 million in the exchange's third corporate I.P.O. of the year.
Also among this year's offerings was the I.P.O. of Grupo Sanborns, the retail arm of the billionaire Carlos Slim Helú's empire. It sold $950 million in shares to finance expansion.
Both foreign and domestic investors are buying the shares, Mr. Téllez said. "For foreign investors, it is very reassuring that there are Mexican institutional funds that can also take the paper."
There are a number of more subtle factors working in favor of more stock offerings, bankers say. One of those is an evolution in the closely held family-owned businesses, which have been reluctant to list or have so few shares floating that they are very illiquid.
Another change may be a move by more multinationals, like Santander and Sempra, to sell shares in their subsidiaries in Mexico, where growth prospects are higher than at home.
Wal-Mart's Mexican subsidiary, for example, which is the country's largest private employer, trades on the Mexican exchange at about double the price-to-earnings ratio that Wal-Mart Stores trades at on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Right now, we have experienced the longest period in three decades of a continuous open window for equities," Mr. Martínez-Negrete said.
The market for credit is also growing. After the peso crisis of 1994 sent Mexico's banks into free fall, they were sold off to global banks. But the new owners were conservative about lending in Mexico. The banks are strongly capitalized and have complied with new international standards known as Basel III.
The government's sound finances means it can issue 30-year bonds priced in pesos. Foreign funds are buying along with local ones. "This shows a lot of confidence in the currency and in the credit of the government," Mr. Cepeda said.
For the first time in many years, local companies are generating cash and looking to expand at home and abroad, said Alfredo Capote, the head of investment banking at Banamex, Citigroup's Mexico subsidiary. "Investors like these stories because there are very few stories of growth and consolidation around the world," he said.
At the same time, foreign manufacturers are returning to Mexico as a production platform for the recovering American market. At the top of that list are global automakers, which are investing $10 billion in new assembly plants.
Mexico "has exported its way to prosperity," said William H. Gross, the founder of Pimco, which has been accumulating Mexican sovereign debt over the last 18 months. "They now own dollars as opposed to owing dollars."

HIGHLIGHT: The scourge of 24-hour news is now doing to the weather what it did to public affairs and the stock market. 

 BODY:
Things started to go wrong with the weather when the Weather Channel decided on its own last year to give every winter storm a proper name. Snow, no matter if it was simply falling on cedars, and frost, even if it was historically known as Jack, nipping at your nose, were gone. Thereafter came Winter Storm Brutus, Winter Storm Nemo, Winter Storm Saturn - some serious meteorological thugs. 
No wonder we're scared. More than news, sports or even adorable kitty videos, weather is by some measures now the most-accessed type of information on the Internet. As weather the generic has been overtaken by weather.com, the commercial brand that crosses all media platforms, barely a week passes without a reason to hide under your bed, remote in one hand, freeze-dried food in the other. 
The scourge of 24-hour news, in which stuff that isn't important gets its own countdown clock, is now doing to the weather what it did to public affairs and the stock market. It's making us all a little jumpy and anxious, with a twisted view of the normal rhythms of the seasons. 
Consider "Snowquester," the storm that was supposed to shut down Washington, D.C., last month. Predictions were calling for up to a foot of snow, which would leave the world's most powerful democracy at a standstill. The run on grocery stores was stunning: a can of lentil soup, for a few hours, was worth more than bad advice from Newt Gingrich. The Weather Channel's flood stud, Jim Cantore, was dispatched to the capital for live updates, waiting, waiting, waiting. 
And then - nothing. Rain fell, with some wet snow. The predictions for Snowquester were no more accurate than those of Dick "Landslide" Morris in his confident call of a Mitt Romney victory.

No matter. Tornado season had arrived. Off to Texas and the Gulf Coast. "Wednesday night will be dangerous!" the Weather Channel warned all this week, as their map's high-def red cloud moved across the South. It wasn't dangerous. 
I consider myself something of a weather nerd, and confess to having conversations that go on far too long about low-pressure systems in the Gulf of Alaska, or hail that can dent a rental car. I've seen "The Perfect Storm" a half-dozen times, though I wish no one would ever use those words to describe anything but the book and the movie. 
But I've learned not to spend too much time watching what should be the weather equivalent of SportsCenter. In parts of the High Plains, in Montana, in Southeast Alaska, weather is indeed vital to daily existence - it can mean the difference between life and death for pilots, long-haul truckers, fishermen. My experience over the years, watching the Weather Channel while waiting out militia standoffs in the rural West, was that it made me think I was never going to get home for the weekend. 
When weather is so heavily anthropomorphized and given countdowns and deadlines, it helps no one. Well, maybe the ratings. Weather.com, and the Weather Channel and now Weather Underground (all under the corporate umbrella of NBCUniversal Media) already draw 163 million monthly unique visitors to their sites. 
But just because they have a monopoly on weather information - with a share of the audience for this subject estimated at 89 percent - doesn't mean they can mess with the great lament about the weather: everybody talks about it, nobody does anything about it.
For more than half a century, the National Hurricane Center, working with other governments, has been naming hurricanes. These storms, as we've seen, can erase cities and kill hundreds. They are not trivial. When regional governments, acting on advice and forecasts from federal meteorologists, urged people to get out of Hurricane Sandy's path last fall, it proved a lifesaver. Disasters do not need competition from ratings-hungry storm chasers.
By naming routine winter storms Gandalf, or Khan, the Weather Channel is trying to become the news, and is changing behavior. Triton, another name given another typical winter storm, was said to be "targeting California" not long ago, like North Korean nukes. 
The effect is to trivialize the real thing, to put breathless graphics and histrionics ahead of science and public safety. You saw the same thing happen to the stock market when Jim Cramer brought clown-show theatrics and spittle-spewing outbursts - "buy! buy! buy!" - to decisions that should call for patient analysis. Many people lost a bundle in the run-up to the last recession when they trusted stock tips from a cable television barker.
The local stations, and some newspaper video sites, have picked up on the trend. Where I live, in Seattle, the seasons are usually benign, but when a threat of a half-inch of snow beckons, the media jockeys now go into full Defcon 1 mode, naming the storm and searching the sky for first flakes. The city is paralyzed in anticipation. Alas, the locals may soon be replaced by an outsourced, and regionally tailored, model from the Weather Channel. Say goodbye to your likable chucklehead in a fashion-challenged outfit. 
This week, one of the featured stories on weather.com was a piece on "how to deal with storm stress." Here's a suggestion in that regard, with a lovely spring forecast ahead for most of the country this weekend: don't watch the Weather Channel.

HIGHLIGHT: The Volkswagen Group vies for the world&#8217;s top position as Porsche unveils a plug-in hybrid Panamera. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 The Volkswagen Group has said it wants to be the world's top carmaker. To do that, it will need to recruit a virtual army of new employees. The company expects to double production, swelling its ranks by 50,000 people over the next several years. Most of Volkswagen's growth is likely to occur in China, where it is poised to supplant General Motors as the top seller. (autoblog.com) 
 According to automakers, an increase in United States housing prices caused a 3.4 percent rise in March pickup truck and sport utility vehicle sales. Home prices had their biggest 12-month surge since 2006, leading to stronger light truck sales to small companies. Auto industry executives said new financing options had also spurred sales. All told, the increase amounted to more than $15 million in truck sales. (The Chicago Tribune)
 A North Carolina woman went missing for three days after a state trooper found her car in a ditch and ordered it towed away. Authorities eventually found 62-year-old Carolyn Ann Watkins. She was still in her car, dead. The trooper, who has since been placed on paid administrative duty, did not notice she was there when he wrote his on-scene report, which said, "Note: No driver at the scene of this collision." (The Associated Press)
 Will Hyundai bring a pickup truck to America? That's a definite maybe from Lee In-cheol, the company's vice president for international sales. There is no word on what size the truck will be or when it will be sold, but in light of a recent free trade agreement between the United States and South Korea, the 25 percent Chicken Tax will expire in seven years. That means a foreign built truck in South Korea is a possibility. (autoblog.com)
 Porsche's updated Panamera is poised to thrust the German automaker into the previously unlikely realm of super-fuel-efficient cars. The company said the new Panamera S E-Hybrid - a plug-in - achieved 76 miles per gallon, compared with the old standard hybrid model's 31 miles per gallon. While European bureaucrats work out the validity of Porsche's fuel economy test methods, the horsepower numbers seem real enough. A 316 horsepower, gas-power 3-liter V-6 and a 94 horsepower electric motor can launch the Panamera S E-Hybrid to 62 miles per hour in 5.5 seconds, taking it to a top speed of 168 miles per hour.

HEADLINE: What Makes a College 'Selective' - and Why It Matters

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Studies of selective colleges &#8212; which have more resources and higher graduation rates than others &#8212; are often based on 200 to 250 institutions based on categories chosen by Barron&#8217;s. 

 BODY:
When researchers study selective colleges, they often use a group of 200 to 250 colleges, based on categories chosen by Barron's, which publishes a popular college guide. I have cited such research in severalrecentarticles and wanted to provide the list of those colleges.
The first thing many people will notice about the list is that it includes a broad array of colleges: public and private, large and small, extremely selective and less so. Selective colleges - as higher-education researchers tend to define them - are not just the Ivy League, Stanford, Duke and the other usual suspects. They're also Virginia Tech, the University of Pittsburgh, Ohio State, Texas A&M, Bard, Fordham, New College of Florida, the Colorado School of Mines and five University of California campuses. 
New York has the most colleges on the list, with 29. Thirteen states do not have a college on the list: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.
The main importance of this list is not that a degree from these colleges is enormously more valuable than a degree from less selective colleges. Some research finds that the college from which people graduate has little to no effect on their long-term prospects. The list matters, instead, because more selective colleges tend to have more resources than unselective colleges - and much higher graduation rates. 
All else equal, students who attend less selective colleges are much less likely to graduate, according to a large recent study, which was published as a book, "Crossing the Finish Line." On average, workers with a bachelor's degree earn about 40 percent more per week than workers who attended some college but did not complete a four-year degree. Workers with a four-year degree are also much more likely to be working.
Perhaps most worrisome, many high-achieving, low-income students do not attend a selective college, despite their qualifications, and ultimately do not receive a bachelor's degree. Among the top 4 percent of students in the high school class of 2008, based on test scores and grades, only 34 percent of those from low-income households attended a selective college, according to Caroline Hoxby and Christopher Avery.
The list of selective colleges here spans Barron's four top designations: most competitive, highly competitive plus, highly competitive and very competitive plus. Next to each college's name appears its Barron's designation, which is based on the entering students' grades and test scores, and the state in which the college is located.
In their recent studies on low-income students, Ms. Hoxby, Mr. Avery and Sarah Turner used a universe of colleges spanning all four categories. In other work, by Anthony Carnevale of Georgetown, the definition spanned only the first three categories, which reduced the list by about 50 colleges, to slightly less than 200.
Mr. Carnevale and Jeff Strohl, both of the Center -on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown, provided us with the Barron's data. The version shown here comes from the 2009 guide and includes the 236 colleges in the top four selectivity categories. The list is grouped by state, though readers can also sort colleges alphabetically or by selectivity group.

HEADLINE: The Limits of Military Power

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Chuck Hagel gave his first major policy address as secretary of defense. 

 BODY:
Chuck Hagel gave his first major policy address as secretary of defense and devoted a good amount of space to a fundamental issue: the parameters of conventional military power. 
Mr. Hagel laid out that although the United States "is emerging from more than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan," the "threat of violent extremism persists and continues to emanate from weak states and ungoverned spaces in the Middle East and North Africa." Other dangers include "the increased availability of advanced military technologies in the hands of state and non-state actors, the risk of regional conflicts that could draw in the United States, the debilitating and dangerous curse of human despair and poverty, as well as the uncertain implications of environmental degradation." And let's not forget cyber warfare, which has "grown into a defining security challenge, with potential adversaries seeking the ability to strike at America's security, energy, economic and critical infrastructure with the benefit of anonymity and distance."
In other words a catalog of horrors. Or more precisely an extremely diverse catalog of horrors, which calls for a diverse problem-solving approach.

"The United States military remains an essential tool of American power," Mr. Hagel said, "but one that must be used judiciously, with a keen appreciation of its limits. Most of the pressing security challenges today have important political, economic, and cultural components, and do not necessarily lend themselves to being resolved by conventional military strength. Indeed, the most destructive and horrific attack ever on the United States came not from fleets of ships, bombers, and armored divisions, but from 19 fanatical men wielding box cutters and one-way plane tickets."
What the secretary seems to understand is that-basically-we can't bomb or "shock and awe" our way out of every conflict, and that our whole military structure is out of date.
What he didn't mention-but which I hope is also on his mind-is that in addition to structural and strategic issues, we need to reconsider our legal approach to national security.
A thorough "re-thinking" of American defense will have to include a push to clear away the post-9/11 detritus: the Authorization for Use of Military Force, the Patriot Act, the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, military tribunals...the list goes on.

HEADLINE: How the I.R.S. Punishes Working Parents

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: Quick, what&#8217;s wrong with this sentence: &#8220;Most working mothers who pay for child care do so out of their after-tax income&#8221;? 

 BODY:
Quick, what's wrong with this sentence: "Most working mothers who pay for child care do so out of their after-tax income"?
And what's the important difference between the two headlines below?
How the I.R.S. Hurts Mothers
As Child Care Costs Rise, Families Seek Alternatives 
Do I really have to say it?
All together now: Who's responsible for providing or paying for child care? Parents.
Male parents. Female parents. Transgendered parents. Single parents. In some cases, grandparents. But there is no written rule (although we all know there's an unwritten one) that says that when both parents work, the mother's salary goes first to child care. In fact, this is a ridiculous notion - unless, of course, you subscribe to the idea that a mother who works outside the home must pay for the child care that she alone is obligated to provide.
Lilian V. Faulhaber, an associate law professor at Boston University who wrote the opinion piece "How the I.R.S. Hurts Mothers," is absolutely right that tax policy favors families in which one parent does not earn an income or earns substantially less than the other. "There are several reasons for this," she writes. "The federal child and dependent-care credit, which is supposed to help with these expenses, decreases as household income increases; the lower-paid spouse's earnings are taxed at a higher marginal rate because of the other spouse's earnings; and child care is paid out of after-tax income."
These policies are problematic and need to be changed. But they do not punish women alone. These are policies that punish families: families that could better balance caregiving and breadwinning if they could divide those jobs more evenly; families that could be headed by two earners instead of one; families that could save more for college, for retirement, for emergencies, if the Internal Revenue Service didn't treat dual-income parents in this punitive manner. They are also policies that punish our economy: as Catherine Rampell wrote in "Lean In, Dad," for The New York Times Magazine, when we limit work-force participation by particular groups, we limit economic growth.
Professor Faulhaber is so right about the consequences of these tax policies, and her suggestions for changing them are so smart, that challenging her on the language may seem churlish. But policies that push women out of the work force are not a women's issue. They are not even a family issue. The question of how we enable parents to both provide for their children and care for them is a social and economic issue, and it needs to be framed as one we all share.
Instead, we consistently place child care duties - providing them or paying for them - in the mother's realm. Even the Census Bureau, in its "Who's Minding the Kids" report, continues to classify the time fathers spend caring for their children while mothers work as "child care," but not the time mothers spend while fathers work. (Last year, when I asked about that, the author of the report said a mother was not "caring for the child only while Dad works. She's probably caring for the child 24 hours, and so Dad is able to go to work regardless." This year, the language used to put the child care burden on Mom is different - she's called the "reference parent," not the "designated parent" - but "in households where both parents are present, the mother is the reference parent," so nothing has really changed.)
It shouldn't need to be said, but when two parents are in the home, both of them, regardless of gender, are equally responsible - physically, financially and emotionally - for the children in their care. Those parents may have varying arrangements regarding who provides for the family in what ways and when, but policies that affect their choices and agreements affect us all.

HEADLINE: Polls Find Continued Support for Stricter Gun Laws and a Path to Citizenship

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI and DALIA SUSSMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Recent polls found majority support for a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons and support for a process for illegal immigrants to become citizens, but with strong partisan division. 

 BODY:
As Congress prepares to debate gun safety laws and tries to hash out an immigration overhaul, recent polls find continued public support for stricter restrictions on firearms and a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally.
A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday found majority support for a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. An overwhelming majority (9 in 10) favors universal background checks, even though nearly half of voters think the government will use that information to confiscate legally owned guns. 
Similarly, an inaugural Morning Joe/Marist poll found that nearly 9 in 10 Americans support background checks for gun owners, nearly 6 in 10 support legislation banning the sale of assault weapons, and 6 in 10 support stricter laws over all concerning the sale of firearms. 
On immigration, an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday found nearly 6 in 10 Americans favor a process for illegal immigrants to become citizens, but with strong partisan division. While 73 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of independents agree with a path to citizenship, 60 percent of Republicans oppose it. 
A Pew Research Center survey conducted in mid-March and released last Thursday found similar results, with about 7 in 10 Americans saying that immigrants living illegally in the United States should be eligible for permanent residency (24 percent) or citizenship (43 percent).
Polls out this week also found that more voters trust President Obama over Republicans to handle the budget deficit; a split among registered voters on same-sex marriage increased support for the legalization of marijuana; and a wide partisan gap in views of global warming. 
A McClatchy-Marist poll conducted last week finds Mr. Obama with an edge among registered voters on who they trust to make the right decisions about the budget deficit, and more voters blame congressional Republicans rather than the president for gridlock on the issue. But it's not all good news for the president in the poll, with a majority disapproving of his handling of budget negotiations and of the economy. The Quinnipiac poll found 50 percent of registered voters say they support same-sex marriage, while 41 percent oppose it. A majority says that the question of its legality should be decided on the basis of the United States Constitution, and not state by state. A Pew Research Center poll released Thursday finds a majority of Americans - 52 percent - support legalizing marijuana use, up from 41 percent in a Pew poll in 2010. Support ranges from 64 percent of those under age 30 to just 33 percent among those 65 and older (still, that's up from 22 percent among seniors in 2010). Six in 10 say the government should not enforce federal laws prohibiting marijuana use in states that allow it. Pew also reported findings of partisan division over global warming. While nearly 7 in 10 Americans say there is solid evidence the earth is warming, just 4 in 10 say it is because of human actions. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say human activity is the cause. But just 1 in 5 Republicans say humans are the source, and half say there is no evidence of global warming.

HEADLINE: Polls Find Continued Support for Stricter Gun Laws and a Path to Citizenship

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI and DALIA SUSSMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Recent polls found majority support for a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons and support for a process for illegal immigrants to become citizens, but with strong partisan division. 

 BODY:
As Congress prepares to debate gun safety laws and tries to hash out an immigration overhaul, recent polls find continued public support for stricter restrictions on firearms and a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally.
A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday found majority support for a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. An overwhelming majority (9 in 10) favors universal background checks, even though nearly half of voters think the government will use that information to confiscate legally owned guns. 
Similarly, an inaugural Morning Joe/Marist poll found that nearly 9 in 10 Americans support background checks for gun owners, nearly 6 in 10 support legislation banning the sale of assault weapons, and 6 in 10 support stricter laws over all concerning the sale of firearms. 
On immigration, an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday found nearly 6 in 10 Americans favor a process for illegal immigrants to become citizens, but with strong partisan division. While 73 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of independents agree with a path to citizenship, 60 percent of Republicans oppose it. 
A Pew Research Center survey conducted in mid-March and released last Thursday found similar results, with about 7 in 10 Americans saying that immigrants living illegally in the United States should be eligible for permanent residency (24 percent) or citizenship (43 percent).
Polls out this week also found that more voters trust President Obama over Republicans to handle the budget deficit; a split among registered voters on same-sex marriage increased support for the legalization of marijuana; and a wide partisan gap in views of global warming. 
A McClatchy-Marist poll conducted last week finds Mr. Obama with an edge among registered voters on who they trust to make the right decisions about the budget deficit, and more voters blame congressional Republicans rather than the president for gridlock on the issue. But it's not all good news for the president in the poll, with a majority disapproving of his handling of budget negotiations and of the economy. The Quinnipiac poll found 50 percent of registered voters say they support same-sex marriage, while 41 percent oppose it. A majority says that the question of its legality should be decided on the basis of the United States Constitution, and not state by state. A Pew Research Center poll released Thursday finds a majority of Americans - 52 percent - support legalizing marijuana use, up from 41 percent in a Pew poll in 2010. Support ranges from 64 percent of those under age 30 to just 33 percent among those 65 and older (still, that's up from 22 percent among seniors in 2010). Six in 10 say the government should not enforce federal laws prohibiting marijuana use in states that allow it. Pew also reported findings of partisan division over global warming. While nearly 7 in 10 Americans say there is solid evidence the earth is warming, just 4 in 10 say it is because of human actions. Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats say human activity is the cause. But just 1 in 5 Republicans say humans are the source, and half say there is no evidence of global warming.

HEADLINE: A New Electric Car With an Old Name

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: The new venture, which is in Detroit&#8217;s Fisher Building, bought the brand name of an early 20th century maker of E.V.&#8217;s. 

 BODY:
The fledgling Detroit Electric car company introduced its first product, the fully electric SP:01 two-seat roadster, on Wednesday. Like the Tesla Roadster, the SP:01 will be built on a Lotus Elise chassis. Detroit Electric will handle only final assembly of an initial production run of 999 vehicles. 
The Detroit Electric name is familiar to automotive historians. The early 20th century electric-vehicle manufacturer produced about 13,000 cars in its nearly 30-year history. This new venture, which has its headquarters in Detroit's Fisher Building, acquired the brand name from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Detroit Electric is assembling SP:01 prototypes in Europe. The car's top speed is 155 miles per hour and its time from zero to 62 m.p.h. is 3.7 seconds, the company said.
The SP:01 is powered by a 201 horsepower (150 kW) electric motor mounted behind the passenger cabin. The Lotus Elise donor car's manual gearbox delivers the power to the rear wheels. In the Lotus, the manual gearbox has six forward speeds, but in the torque-rich electric car only four are used, with fifth and sixth gears blocked off. However, to achieve that 155 m.p.h. top speed, fifth gear must be reinstated. That fifth ratio can be added as an option at the time of purchase. A two-speed automatic will also be available. Steering and suspension components are similar to those of the Lotus, but have been modified to better suit the SP:01's weight distribution.
Two lithium-polymer batteries provide electricity. According to a Detroit Electric media release, the SP:01 achieved a range of 180 miles on the European driving cycle. The company said a 7.7 kWh home charging unit could fully charge the car in about four hours.
The car's body is carbon fiber, which sits on Lotus's aluminum tub-style chassis. The company said the car weighed 2,400 pounds.
Detroit Electric said the SP:01 would go on sale in several markets in the United States by the end of August. Pricing will start at $135,000, but will vary depending on vehicle specifications and local taxes.
An earlier version of this post referred incorrectly to how the Detroit Electric car company obtained rights to its name, which was abandoned when the original company of that name went out of business in 1939. The United States Patent and Trademark Office authorized the new use of Detroit Electric providing the name was used "in a way that is relevant and positive for the city." The name was not purchased from a previous owner.

HEADLINE: Obama Administration Seeks to Overhaul International Food Aid

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- An Obama administration plan to change the way the United States distributes its international food aid has touched off an intense lobbying campaign by a coalition of shipping companies, agribusiness and charitable groups who say the change will harm the nation's economy and hamper efforts to fight global hunger.
Proponents of the plan, however, say it would enable the United States to feed about 17 million more people each year, while helping to fight poverty by buying the crops of farmers in poor countries. 
According to people briefed on the soon-to-be released fiscal year 2014 budget, the administration is expected to propose ending the nearly 60-year practice of buying food from American farmers and then shipping it abroad.
The administration is proposing that the government buy food in developing countries instead of shipping food from American farmers overseas, a process that typically takes months. The proposed change to the international food aid program is expected to save millions in shipping costs and get food more quickly to areas that need it.
The administration is also reportedly considering ending the controversial practice of food aid ''monetization,'' a process by which Washington gives American-grown grains to international charities. The groups then sell the products on the market in poor countries and use the money to finance their antipoverty programs.
Critics of the practice say it hurts local farmers by competing with sales of their crops.
The United States spends about $1.4 billion a year on food aid and is the only major donor country that continues to send food to humanitarian crisis spots, rather than buying food produced locally.
In a letter to members of Congress and the Obama administration, more than 60 organizations like the USA Rice Federation and the American Maritime Congress defended the way the program is currently run and called on lawmakers and the Obama administration to resist changing it.
''Growing, manufacturing, bagging, shipping and transportation of nutritious U.S. food creates jobs and economic activity here at home, provides support for our U.S. Merchant Marine, essential to our national defense sealift capability, and sustains a robust domestic constituency for these programs not easily replicated in foreign aid programs,'' the groups wrote.
Twenty-one senators from farm states also wrote to the Obama administration last month, after being lobbied by the groups, asking that the food aid program be kept in its current form.
James Caponiti, executive director of the American Maritime Congress, a trade group, said the proposed changes to the food aid program would have a devastating effect on shippers, because the law requires that 75 percent of food aid has to be transported on American-flagged ships.
''We are talking about hundreds of jobs lost,'' Mr. Caponiti said. ''This is a very, very bad idea.''
David Evans, the American president of the Phoenix-based charity Food for the Hungry, one of several aid charities that signed the letter opposing changes to the food aid program, worries that Congress may cut the food aid budget altogether if federal dollars are used to buy food abroad.
''This sets a dangerous precedent,'' he said. ''If the money is not supporting the purchasing of U.S. commodities, then it will lose support in Congress. And as a result, $1.5 billion in critical resources will be gone.''
But other charities like Oxfam and CARE support the Obama administration change, saying reform is needed. The groups say that a large percentage of food aid is spent on shipping costs, and as the costs have risen the amount of food the United States has shipped to countries that need it has fallen.
''The current food aid program is not mission driven or about poor people,'' said Gawain Kripke, director of policy and research for Oxfam. ''It's about moving product.''
The groups say they are especially glad to see the Obama administration end the practice of giving charities food to sell in local markets to help finance their antipoverty and development programs because the system is plagued with inefficiencies, and it may also hurt some of the very poor people it aims to help.
In 2007, CARE, one of the world's biggest charities, lost about $45 million a year from its budget when the organization decided to stop taking food from the government to sell and finance its work in developing countries.
''It was a big part of our budget, but we decided that it's much more efficient to buy products locally and we could reach more people,'' said Blake Selzer, a senior policy advocate with CARE.
A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office, Congress's investigative arm, also concluded that the system of supplying food to charities to sell for cash was ''inherently inefficient.'' The G.A.O found that nearly $300 million was lost because of inefficiencies in the program. A report last year sponsored by Alliance for Global Food Security, which is made up of food companies and religious charities, found that supplying food to charities to sell did not harm local markets.
Efforts to reform the food aid program are not new.
In 2007, President George W. Bush proposed similar changes. The proposal, however, also ran into stiff opposition from the potent alliance of agribusiness, shipping and charitable groups, and Congress quickly killed the plan.
But now, amid tight federal budgets, reform proponents say Congress might be more receptive to changing the food aid program.
''From a taxpayers' and policy perspective, the food aid program is clearly in need of reform,'' said Timi Gerson, director of advocacy for the American Jewish World Service, a charity that supports food aid reform. ''The only thing getting in the way is politics and special interest.''

Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Artist and Visionary: William Matthew Prior Revealed' (through May 26) William Matthew Prior (1806-1873), the subject of this fascinating exhibition, painted portraits in the ''American primitive'' mode. His paintings of solemn, pie-faced tots, stiffly posed yet animated by some inner mystery, are especially compelling. But he had the chops to paint like a well-trained academician too. He was also an abolitionist who, at some risk to his reputation, painted portraits of black people; they are among his best works. He was also into spiritualism, and he was a savvy entrepreneur. He was, altogether, a most remarkable character. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
&#x2605; Asia Society: 'The Artful Recluse: Painting, Poetry, and Politics in 17th-Century China' (through June 2) With the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, China's intellectual elite, many of them artists who worked in the imperial government, were thrown into a tailspin. Confucian ethics demanded filial devotion to the old regime. But how were they to demonstrate it? One way was to remove themselves from active life and signal their resistance through art. How they did so is the subject of this compellingly fine-grained painting show. Some artists sacrificed their lives for principles; others used recluse status as a career move. The emotional weight, psychological depth, and intellectual complexity of the work of this time is what comes through here. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'LaToya Ruby Frazier: A Haunted Capital' (through Aug. 11) This preternaturally mature body of work by a 31-year-old photographer connects bedrooms and streetscapes, the suffering of loved ones and the afflictions of a ''distressed municipality'' (the state's official term for Ms. Frazier's hometown, Braddock, Pa.). Simultaneously introspective and extroverted, it's composed of arresting black-and-white photographs that sometimes look like studio portraits or social documentaries but aren't fully at home in either category. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Life, Death and Transformation in the Americas' (continuing) For generations, one of the first things visitors to Brooklyn Museum encountered was the Hall of the Americas, the two-story rotunda right off the main lobby. And when you were in it, you knew you were home. A few years ago during renovations, the museum put the Americas material in storage, but now it's back in new galleries on the fifth floor. The look is very different -- ultraminimalist Arctic white and sky blue -- but the 102 objects, from a collection that is a jewel in Brooklyn's crown, are utterly gripping. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (through Aug. 4) Born in Ghana and long a resident of Nigeria where he maintains a productive studio, El Anatsui has for the past decade been creating spectacularly large, fabric-like sculpture from countless numbers of liquor-bottle caps linked together with twists of copper. The work weaves together ideas about colonialism, politics and economics, and is absolutely gorgeous. The Brooklyn show, which originated at the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, also includes a number of the artist's earlier and now-overlooked carved wood pieces, which are well worth studying. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
The Frick Collection: 'Piero della Francesca in America' (through May 19) Reuniting six panels from an altarpiece by Piero, this ravishing show approximates an intimate quattrocento chapel in the Frick's grand Oval Room. At the center of the installation is a seventh painting, the Clark Art Institute's ''Virgin and Child Enthroned With Four Angels,'' which comes from a different altarpiece in the painter's hometown, Sansepolcro, and exemplifies Piero's uncanny orchestration of figures, architecture and religious symbolism. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Gutai: Splendid Playground' (through May 8) The first large, in-depth examination of Japan's best-known postwar art movement is a mind-shifting event that brings together all the mediums it encompassed, brilliantly interwoven. The eccentrically made paintings suggest that Japan produced Abstract Expressionism's strongest second generation, the artists who most convincingly and directly extended Pollock's innovative drip technique. But the show reveals little-known precedents for Happenings, Minimalism and various strains of Post-Minimalism. It should permanently dislodge any notion of postwar modernism as a strictly Western phenomenon. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: The Hugo Boss Prize 2012: Danh Vo' (through May 27) Known mostly for attenuated, elliptical works, this year's Hugo Boss recipient opts for density and robustness with a display of some 4,000 items that once belonged to the artist Martin Wong (1946-99). Installed wonder-cabinet style in a shelf-lined gallery, the items range from art to artifact to tchotchkes; leap across cultures; and trickle from high to low, where racial stereotypes and kitsch frequently take over. It gives us an artist who has decided to function as a curator and an archaeologist and to keep the honor of his prize in motion. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Zarina: Paper Like Skin' (through April 21) ''Paper is an organic material, almost like human skin,'' the artist Zarina Hashmi has said. In her exhibition at the Guggenheim, it's that and more: paper is sculpture, poetry, currency and, above all, a kind of permanent home for a nomadic spirit. Her art speaks poignantly, though sometimes opaquely, of relocation and exile; works like the 2001 woodcut ''Dividing Line'' reference the violent 1947 partition of India and Pakistan, while ''Ten Thousand Things,'' a set of small paper collages recreating works from her oeuvre, nods to Duchamp's museum-in-a-suitcase. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423 3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'No Country: Contemporary Art for South and Southeast Asia' (through May 22) American museums are increasingly collecting contemporary art from outside the Western Hemisphere, and the Guggenheim, supported by the financial corporation UBS is leading the pack. This inaugural show in the acquisitions campaign highlights work from South and Southeast Asia. Certain artists -- like Amar Kanwar, from India, and Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook, from Thailand -- have international reputations. Others, like the sculptor Tang Da Wu, from Singapore, and the painter Aung Myint, Myanmar, both born in 1940s, are less familiar. Nearly all the work of the roughly two dozen artists refers in partisan, political and personal ways to specific histories. The inclusion of those histories in our art museums is long, long overdue. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; The Jewish Museum: 'As it were... So to speak: A Museum Collection in Dialogue With Barbara Bloom' (through Aug. 4) Ms. Bloom, invited to organize a show from elements of the museum's collection, has turned to the Talmud for inspiration. Weaving together real and fictional narratives, historical and literary sources, she creates new and often ambiguous contexts for ceremonial and decorative objects like Torah pointers, Kiddush cups and spice containers. Somehow she manages to quote Nietzsche, Freud, Leonard Cohen, Joan Didion, the Bible and various Wikipedia entries, all without losing her own probing, skeptical voice. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'James Nares: Street' (through May 27) Far from pedestrian, this show revolves around a ravishing, 61-minute video projection by the artist James Nares. Called ''Street,'' it consists of long, slow-motion pans of people going about their business on the sidewalks and streets of New York City. To go with it, Mr. Nares combed through the museum's permanent collection and came up with a fascinating array of thematically related photographs, prints, paintings and drawings having largely to do with human and vehicular traffic. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: Impressionism, Fashion and Modernity (through May 27) The title may suggest a double-dose of pandering, but the show itself is a stunning combination of great paintings, ravishing gowns, historical clarity and pitch-perfect contextualizing. Demonstrating how the Impressionists and more conservative painters alike used the latest fashions to define their sitters as real people, it builds fascinating webs of new information and viewpoints around some of the best-known, most beloved paintings of all time, quite a few of which don't often travel to this country. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Path of Nature: French Paintings from the Wheelock Whitney Collection, 1785-1850' (through April 21) ''Sparkle with repose'' was the effect the British artist John Constable said he was after in his landscapes. His French contemporaries had the same idea. Today, Constable's a star. But León Pallière? Adrien Dauzats? Alexandre-Hyacinthe Dunouy? Only wonkish scholars are likely to know their names. Lucky for them, and for us, that one of those scholars is Whitney Wheelock III, who has a passion for French art from the years between neo-classicism and Romanticism, and a special love for gleaming little oil sketches done out of doors. In 2003 he gave his pictures to the Met, where 50 of them, along with some exquisitely funky genre paintings, make up this small gem of a show. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Drawing Surrealism' (through April 21) This sensational show of 165 works by 70 artists from 15 countries traces the movement from its early automatist stirrings to the doorstep of Abstract Expressionism. Expanding the field of players with numerous new names, it also has a wonderful clarity, organized according to the techniques that the Surrealists commandeered (collage and photography), breathed life into (frottage, decalcomania and exquisite corpse) and frequently crossbred. It may be among the best encapsulations of Surrealism you will ever see. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Smith)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Degas, Miss La La and the Cirque Fernando' (through May 12) Viewers catching their first glimpse of ''Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando'' will tend to agree with an early Degas biographer who called the painting ''one of his most surprising canvases.'' But after a close look at this curious 1879 picture of an aerialist hanging from a rope by her teeth (on loan from the National Gallery in London, and displayed with related studies, sketchbooks, circus programs and other ephemera), they will recognize Degas's skeptical eye and classical perspective on modern entertainment. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Inventing Abstraction: 1910-1925' (through April 15) The pursuit of the holy grail of early modernism at its most feverish is presented as a multiple-medium, multinational effort in this dizzying, magisterial cornucopia. The 350-plus works by 84 artists encompass painting, sculpture, music, poetry, dance, film and photography; alternate between the tentative and the prescient; and capture something of both the terrors and thrills of the project, with clusters of paintings by Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian among the high points. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Edvard Munch: The Scream' (through April 29) A version of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' is on view at this museum for the next six months, having come almost straight from the auction block. Protected by a Plexiglas box, like the Mona Lisa, it has been given a prominent perch opposite van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' in the fifth-floor painting and sculpture galleries. There is talk of timed tickets. But if you can put up with all the pageantry, you'll have a rare chance to get acquainted with ''The Scream'' in person and in context. The museum has built a mini-exhibition around the work, surrounding it with Munch paintings and prints that amplify its motifs and mood. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Projects 99: Meiro Koizumi' (through May 6) It would be hard to find another work of contemporary art that protests war with such soulful grace as Meiro Koizumi's ''Defect in Vision'' (2011), the main attraction of this small show. This 12-minute, black-and-white video dramatizes a final conversation between a kamikaze pilot and his wife, both of whom are blind, as they eat together in a small, old-world-style dining room. It is a riveting meditation on the doomed, myth-saturated mind of Japan's warrior class in the last days of World War II. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light' (through Aug. 12) With nearly 160 works ranging from photographs of London in the 1930s and during World War II to nearly abstract Surrealist nudes from the 1950s and '60s, this impeccable survey makes a strong if slightly over-edited argument for Brandt as one of the founders of modern photography. It sticks to vintage prints and brings a wonderful lucidity to a persistent balance of art and humanity that is, as it is frequently described: strange, mysterious and irresistible. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through Aug. 5) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Neue Galerie: 'German Expressionism 1900-1930: Masterpieces From the Neue Galerie Collection' (through April 22) German Expressionism was a messy, complicated movement, with numerous stylistic and philosophical variations. It's not easily corralled into a tidy overview, despite the best efforts of the Neue Galerie in this collection show. The installation sorts everything into two groups, using the rubrics of ''primitivism'' and ''modernity.'' ''Primitivism'' seems to mean the gallery of jarringly bright, vigorously brushy paintings by members of the Brücke and the Blaue Reiter; under ''modernity'' are Neue Sachlichkeit portraits by Otto Dix, George Grosz, Christian Schad and others, made with caustic humor and an eye for the grotesque. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; New Museum: 'NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' (through May 26) History is written by the winners, which in contemporary art usually means the market. It's often also written by people who weren't on the scene and have to take the winners' word for what happened and what mattered. Such is the case with this retrospective show that too often favors the currently best-selling survivors of a fraught era over many now less well-known on-the-ground players. There's good art here, but the spirit of a furiously skeptical utopian moment -- very high, very low -- rarely breaks through the institutional nostalgia. And the chance to probe some market myths -- exactly how political was that 1993 ''political'' Whitney Biennial? -- is lost. Like all surveys of the immediate past, ''NYC 1993'' will get everyone kvetching, and it's a must-see, if only to find ways to bring the story into the present differently. Nari Ward's 1993 installation ''Amazing Grace'' in the New Museum's next-door space is for the ages. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Radical Terrain' (through April 29) The third and last of three beautifully produced, back-to-back mini-surveys in the series Modernist Art From India, this exhibition combines landscape painting done in India in the years following independence in 1947 with recent work by young artists -- some South Asian, most not -- that corresponds to or comments on the older art. Small in size and unfamiliar in content, the show is large with history. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Blues for Smoke' (through April 28) As a musical category blues is hard to pin down, and this show makes the job harder, which seems to be its point. It's saying: blues isn't a thing; it's a set of feelings, a state of mind, maybe a state of grace. In origin, it's African-American, developing with gospel and jazz, and folding into R&B, funk and hip-hop. But it has long since become a transethnic, transcultural phenomenon bigger than music, an enveloping aesthetic that includes art. And when you have art by the likes of Zoe Leonard, Kerry James Marshall, Rachel Harrison, Martin Wong, William Pope.L, Alma Thomas, Wu Tsang and David Hammons, you cannot go wrong. Whitney Museum of American Art, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum: 'Jay DeFeo: A Retrospective' (through June 2) The American artist DeFeo, who died in 1989 at 60, is famous for a single work, a gargantuan painting -- nearly 12 feet tall -- called ''The Rose,'' which she labored on exhaustingly for eight years, even after it had been extracted out of her San Francisco studio with a forklift. In the absence of other evidence, many people tend to see the piece as the sum of her accomplishment, but to this view the Whitney's tenderly shaped and visually absorbing survey says: No. There's more, and different. ''The Rose'' may have been the pivot point of her career -- DeFeo herself said as much -- but streams of inventive, if less spectacular work, work flowed toward it and from it. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
Galleries: 57th Street
&#x2605; Philip Guston: 'A Centennial Exhibition' (through April 20) On the 100th anniversary of this Abstract Expressionism best-known apostate, this large exhibition includes one of his last abstractions but concentrates on the indelible figurative work of his last decade -- the 1970s -- which did so much to inspire the painters of the 1980s. Several paintings are refreshingly unfamiliar, including ''Alfie in Small Town,'' which commemorates a placid West Highland terrier who once called this gallery home. McKee Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue near 57th Street, (212) 688-5951, mckeegallery.com. (Smith)
Joe Zucker: 'Empire Descending a Staircase' (through April 27) This is something of a comeback show for one of the most restless and ambitious painters to emerge from the 1970s, who habitually combines eccentric painting processes with weird subject matter and weirder materials. On crumbling drywall in lush tones of gray, his latest works depict the fluted columns and capitals -- usual to important buildings since the Greeks -- in a state of collapse. You can almost see the dust rising. Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue near 57th Street, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
&#x2605; Luigi Ghirri: 'Kodachrome' (through April 20) The photographs of Luigi Ghirri (1943-92), as seen in this show of selections from his 1978 book, ''Kodachrome,'' sometimes bring to mind American color photography by William Eggleston and Joel Sternfeld but have a dreamier quality and a more persistent sense of artifice. Images that at first seem to be ordinary vacation shots gradually reveal an eerie obsession with symmetry. Elsewhere, ocean vistas and Alpine landscapes turn out to be restaurant murals, billboards or postcards. In the book Mr. Ghirri writes of a ''labyrinth, the walls of which are ever more illusory ... to the point at which we might merge with them.'' Matthew Marks, 526 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Rosenberg)
Miroslaw Balka: 'The Order of Things' (through April 13) The single rousingly portentous sculpture here involves black liquid continually gushing from suspended, industrial-size hoses into a pair of giant bins made of rusty steel plate. Since its title refers to a book by the French philosopher Michel Foucault, you know that big ideas are afoot. Maybe it is an allegory of the mindlessly self-perpetuating machinery driving modern civilization. Something like that. Gladstone, 530 West 21st Street, (212) 206-7606, gladstonegallery.com. (Johnson)
Al Held: 'Alphabet Paintings' (through April 20) Al Held (1928-2005) was one of the last and best of the big-impact abstract painters to emerge from the postwar era. ''Alphabet Paintings'' is an exhilarating show of seven paintings dating from 1961 to '67, a transitional period during which Mr. Held based compositions on simple, geometric shapes and, more remarkably, letters of the Roman alphabet. At 8 ½ by 12 feet, ''The Yellow X'' (1965) is spectacular. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212) 242-7727, cheimread.com. (Johnson)
Justin Matherly: 'All industrious people' (through April 27) The concrete casts in Mr. Matherly's first solo at Paula Cooper are modeled on stone reliefs from Mount Nemrud, an excavated temple in Turkey. Mr. Matherly seems most interested in its iconography of power transmitted through touch; his steles show the Hellenistic king Antiochus I receiving divine authority through handshakes with the gods. At the same time, a platform made of metal walkers suggests weakness and precariousness; nearby, smudged inkjet monoprints based on photographs reduce the features of the Nemrud site to blurry abstractions. Paula Cooper Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (R0senberg)
&#x2605; 'Painted on 21st Street: Helen Frankenthaler from 1950 to 1959' (through April 13) As revealed by this fabulously unruly exhibition, the little-known work leading to Frankenthaler's 1952 ''Mountains and Sea'' -- famous cornerstone of color Field painting -- should be an immutable part of art history. Equally inspiring is the display of the better-known varieties of wild beauty that it unleashed. Altogether we see a fearless young woman, unencumbered by rules or ideology, making free with painting's materials and history, bending other artists' styles and motifs to her own highly individual expressive needs. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Dieter Roth. Björn Roth (through April 13) Concentrating on the collaborations of the Swiss-German maverick Dieter Roth (1930-98) and his son Bjorn, this sprawling show adds a veneer of class to the inauguration of Chelsea's latest oversize trophy gallery. Numerous large, messy works noisily navigate the border between art and life. But the best does so quietly: the 128-monitor video piece ''Solo Scenes'' simply records the elder Roth living out life in his studio-home in Basel. Hauser & Wirth, 511 West 18th Street, (212) 790-3900, hauserwirth.com. (Smith)
Galleries: Other
Charles Harlan: 'Cave' (through April 14) In his second gallery solo, this young New York artist pushes the ready-made to new extremes of scale but still keeps it simple, squeezing a corrugated steel culvert 10 feet across and 15 feet long into a space that barely holds it. Inspired by Nancy Holt's pipe sculptures and Richard Serra's heft, the work eats space, alters sound and creates a precarious cavelike opening. And, when struck by the afternoon sun, it seems to acquire a series of shining, almost-neon ribs that turn out to be seams. JTT, 170a Suffolk Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 574-8152, jttnyc.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info.

Out of Town
'Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Art and Design, 1848-1900' (through May 19) A large and well-done survey of paintings, drawings, books, furnishings, textiles and even stained glass includes such classics as John Everett Millais's ''Ophelia'' and Henry Wallis's ''Chatterton.'' It also enables a clear assessment of England's ever-popular mid-19th-century art movement, whose legacy is fittingly full of contradictions. Using brazenly modern colors, the brotherhood nonetheless turned toward the past, fashioning a nostalgic, literary, costume-heavy, clichéd style that demeaned women had little to do with modern life. The best works here are the landscapes, which are unfortunately in short supply. National Gallery of Art, on the National Mall between Third and Seventh Streets NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Smith)
'Albrecht Dürer: Master Drawings, Watercolors, and Prints from the Albertina' (through June 9) Albrecht Dürer had it all: the eye of a Raphael, the brains of a Leonardo, the looks of a cleaned-up Kurt Cobain. Traditionally, the category of great artist implies great painter, and Dürer was that, though there's reason to think that he was at his most inventive, involved and expansive in his works on paper. Evidence for that argument is in this startlingly generous loan exhibition of more than 100 works on paper that includes some of his best known images. National Gallery of Art, on the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'The Civil War and American Art' (through April 28) On the surface, this probing, perspective-altering exhibition, one of many events commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, looks straightforward, even ordinary. We know most of the paintings and photographs on sight; they're classics. What we know less well is their meaning within the context of the nation's single greatest internal catastrophe, and that's what the show is about. It travels to the Metropolitan Museum of Art this spring, running from May 21 to Sept. 2. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-7970, americanart.si.edu. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'Nam June Paik: Global Visionary' (through Aug. 11) Including a large and fascinating trove of material from the Nam June Paik archive, acquired by the Smithsonian from the artist's estate in 2009, this survey of the avant-garde musician, multimedia wizard and video art pioneer (1932-2006) looks startlingly current despite the preponderance of analog televisions and other obsolete hardware. It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-1000, americanart.si.edu. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Yale University Art Gallery (continuing) In a museum era dominated by vying forces of bad economics and compulsive building, it's a miracle when something comes out right, which makes the opening of the splendidly renovated and expanded Yale University Art Gallery a happy event. The angels of art, design and budgetary planning were on duty. Everything worked. The country's oldest university art museum has arrived at a kind institutional ideal of opposites in balance: an encyclopedic teaching museum, big enough to get lost in, small enough for intimate art encounters. New galleries of Indo-Pacific art are a particular attraction, but so are other collections, including one of the countries premier holdings in American art and a small, matchless display of very early Italian Renaissance painting. A special exhibition, ''Societe Anonyme: Modernism for America,'' made up of Yale-owned material, is on view through July 14. 1111 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu.

Last Chance
&#x2605; 'Jean-Michel Basquiat' (closes on Saturday) It is not true that only the good die young, but Jean-Michel Basquiat did at 27 in 1988. He was not only good; at his best he was one of the most original artists of his generation. If that sounds like an extravagant claim, have a look at the high-quality selection of 59 of his bristling, faux-primitive paintings in this show. There is not a lot of art from the '80s that feels this alive today. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com. (Johnson)
'Beat Memories: The Photographs of Allen Ginsberg' (closes on Saturday) During two periods in his life -- from the early 1950s to about 1964 and from the early '80s until his death in 1997 -- the poet Allen Ginsberg made photographs and added handwritten captions. Images of his now famous pals, including the writers Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs and Gregory Corso, as well as Neal Cassady, their logorrheic muse, make this show required viewing for Beat fans. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)
Nancy Dwyer: 'Painting and Sculpture, 1982-2012' (closes on Sunday) Ms. Dwyer's sculptures in the form of three-dimensional words were among the most incisively political works of the late 1980s and '90s. With its mahogany cabinetry topped by glass over green leather, ''Desk of Envy'' (1988) resembles a piece of corporate furniture except that it is constructed to spell the word ''envy'' in bold block letters legible from above. It resonates anew in light of the Occupy Wall Street movement as do many other works in this potent retrospective. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, (718) 937-0727, flcart.org. (Johnson)
'Interior' (closes on Saturday) Expertly selected by the independent curator Barry Rosen, this exhibition of mostly gallery artists welcomes the artist-designer Roy McMakin to the fold. The interiors under consideration include rooms, houses, hearts and minds, and are featured or implied in paintings by Nell Blaine, Jane Freilicher, Manny Farber, Fairfield Porter, Jess and Biala; fictional postage stamps by Donald Evans; photographs by Rudy Burckhardt; and collages by Joe Brainard, as well as Mr. McMakin's furniture-sculptures and fastidious drawings. Tibor de Nagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 262-5050, tibordenagy.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: 'Oh, Canada' (closes on Monday) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada's identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan's hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt: Tender Love Among the Junk' (closes on Sunday) Mr. Lanigan-Schmidt makes luminous art out of trash: candy wrappers, cling wrap, reflective plastics, aluminum foil, plastic bottles, beer cans and too many other kinds of cheap refuse to list. As this four-decade retrospective reveals, his devotion to his materials and hobbylike processes has yielded an oeuvre of transcending beauty, eroticized religiosity and poignant autobiography. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
Zanele Muholi: 'Faces and Phases' (closes on Saturday) Since 2006, this South African artist has been making photographic portraits of black lesbians and transgendered people in her home country and in places she travels. Her first New York solo includes 29 beautiful pictures from 2011 and 2012. The format is uniform, with all subjects seen at half-length, often against a patterned ground. Consistent throughout is the direction on the gaze: straight at the camera, with looks that convey self-assurance, defiance (there are many folded arms), sadness, and suspicion. Yancey Richardson Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (646) 230-9610, yanceyrichardson.com. (Cotter)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Artist's Choice: Trisha Donnelly' (closes on Monday) The 10th artist invited to select an exhibition from the Modern's collection does the series proud. Installed in three far-flung galleries within the museum's vaunted painting and sculpture collection, her effort disturbs the march of masterworks by concentrating on photographs, drawings and other works on paper as well as several kinds of design. At every turn it asks what is art, who is an artist and what makes for greatness? (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
'Virginia Overton' (closes on Saturday) In this spare but beautiful show two very different conceptions of sculpture -- as environment and as object -- create a spare but satisfying interplay of the five senses. A large wall covered with rough red cedar planks mimics painting and alters the entire space, tilting it on end, while exuding that bracing cedar smell. An eccentric fountain gives the term ''hot tub'' new meaning, emitting sound and steam while using the most luxurious of all bathroom fixtures. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Portland Museum of Art: 'Lois Dodd: Catching the Light' (closes on Sunday) This modest, but revelatory exhibition pays overdue tribute to an artist who has spent some 60 years quietly painting her immediate surroundings with an insistent, sometimes daring economy and a startling range of brushwork and styles, from nearly trompe-l'eoil to nearly abstract. A wonderful understanding of color and light provide some of the through lines, as does an attraction to nature, homey architecture and windows, and a conviction that pictorial space is one of painting's central materials and great mysteries. Seven Congress Square, Portland, Me., (207) 775-6148, portlandmuseum.org. (Smith)

HEADLINE: British Premier Says Nuclear Risks Highlight Need for Deterrent

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
LONDON -- Citing tensions with Iran and North Korea, Prime Minister David Cameron offered a strong defense of Britain's nuclear deterrent on Thursday, traveling to Scotland to challenge nationalists seeking independence who want to expel nuclear-armed submarines from Scottish bases.
Blending geopolitics with his opposition to Scottish independence, Mr. Cameron welcomed home the crew of a nuclear-armed submarine based in western Scotland and told defense industry workers that their jobs were more secure in a united Britain. 
Mr. Cameron spoke as a sense of crisis built on the Korean Peninsula and the United States said it was accelerating the deployment of an advanced missile defense system to Guam in the next few weeks to protect American naval and air forces in case North Korea carries through with a threatened missile attack.
Britain maintains a force of four nuclear submarines that patrol year-round carrying Trident missiles. But lawmakers are locked in a debate about the cost of replacing them at a time when Scottish nationalists, committed to nuclear disarmament, say they would not allow the submarines to be based in an independent Scotland.
Scots ages 16 and over living in Scotland are eligible to vote in a referendum on independence in September 2014, but the ballot is already tugging at British politics.
In an article in The Daily Telegraph, published before he went to Scotland, Mr. Cameron said the global nuclear threat had ''if anything, increased'' since Britain built a nuclear deterrent more than 60 years ago during the cold war.
''I know there are some people who disagree with our nuclear deterrent and don't want us to renew it,'' Mr. Cameron said. ''There are those who say that we don't need it anymore, because the cold war has ended. There are those who say we can't afford Trident anymore, so we either need to find a viable cheaper option, or rely on the United States to protect us.''
But ''the nuclear threat has not gone away,'' he added. ''In terms of uncertainty and potential risk it has, if anything, increased.''
With Iran pursuing nuclear ambitions and North Korea testing nuclear devices and missiles, Mr. Cameron said, ''does anyone seriously argue that it would be wise for Britain, faced with this evolving threat today, to surrender our deterrent?''
He described the North Korean government as ''highly unpredictable and aggressive.''
In his remarks to defense industry workers in Scotland, Mr. Cameron said, ''Being part of the U.K. opens doors for the Scottish defense industry around the globe.''
''Scotland counts for more on the world stage because it is part of the United Kingdom, and Scottish defense jobs are more secure as part of the United Kingdom,'' he said. ''The business community tell me that they want certainty. And I want to offer that certainty by saying that I remain absolutely committed to the defense of the United Kingdom and to the future of defense jobs in Scotland.''
Angus Robertson, the defense spokesman of the Scottish National Party, said the prime minister's promises to support the defense industry in Scotland represented ''just the same old, same old'' pledges from British governments that had left Scotland at an economic disadvantage.
''It just shows that when it comes to defense, Westminster isn't working for Scotland,'' Mr. Robertson said, referring to the seat of British power in London, ''and an independent Scottish Parliament would take far better defense decisions for Scotland.''

HEADLINE: Social Programs Facing A Cutback In Obama Budget

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama next week will take the political risk of formally proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare in his annual budget in an effort to demonstrate his willingness to compromise with Republicans and revive prospects for a long-term deficit-reduction deal, administration officials say.
In a significant shift in fiscal strategy, Mr. Obama on Wednesday will send a budget plan to Capitol Hill that departs from the usual presidential wish list that Republicans typically declare dead on arrival. Instead it will embody the final compromise offer that he made to Speaker John A. Boehner late last year, before Mr. Boehner abandoned negotiations in opposition to the president's demand for higher taxes from wealthy individuals and some corporations.
Congressional Republicans have dug in against any new tax revenues after higher taxes for the affluent were approved at the start of the year. The administration's hope is to create cracks in Republicans' antitax resistance, especially in the Senate, as constituents complain about the across-the-board cuts in military and domestic programs that took effect March 1. 
Mr. Obama's proposed deficit reduction would replace those cuts. And if Republicans continue to resist the president, the White House believes that most Americans will blame them for the fiscal paralysis.
Besides the tax increases that most Republicans continue to oppose, Mr. Obama's budget will propose a new inflation formula that would have the effect of reducing cost-of-living payments for Social Security benefits, though with financial protections for low-income and very old beneficiaries, administration officials said. The idea, known as chained C.P.I., has infuriated some Democrats and advocacy groups to Mr. Obama's left, and they have already mobilized in opposition.
As Mr. Obama has before, his budget documents will emphasize that he would support the cost-of-living change, as well as other reductions that Republicans have called for in the popular programs for older Americans, only if Republicans agree to additional taxes on the wealthy and infrastructure investments that the president called for in last year's offer to Mr. Bohener.
Mr. Obama will propose other spending and tax credit initiatives, including aid for states to make free prekindergarten education available nationwide -- a priority outlined in his State of the Union address in February. He will propose to pay for it by raising federal taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products.
''The president has made clear that he is willing to compromise and do tough things to reduce the deficits, but only in the context of a package like this one that has balance and includes revenues from the wealthiest Americans and that is designed to promote economic growth,'' said a senior administration official, who, like others, declined to be identified confirming details about the coming budget.
''That means,'' the official added, ''that the things like C.P.I. that Republican leaders have pushed hard for will only be accepted if Congressional Republicans are willing to do more on revenues.''
But just this week, Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, the House majority leader, reiterated the party's antitax stance and called for reducing spending by cutting waste and making changes in federal programs. The growth in the so-called entitlement programs, especially for health care, is a main driver behind projections of mounting federal debt as baby boomers age and medical costs rise.
Mr. Obama's budget was due in February but administration officials said it was delayed by the year-end fiscal negotiations and resulting tax changes. It will arrive on Capitol Hill hours before the president dines on Wednesday evening with a dozen Senate Republicans -- his second such parlay in recent weeks.
While the group is likely to also discuss gun-safety and immigration legislation, the timing of Mr. Obama's budget release is all but certain to make it a prime topic.
Some Senate Republicans have been urging the president to speak out more to Americans about his ideas for reducing the growth of entitlement programs. While the White House posted the offer to Mr. Boehner on its Web site this year, aides previously said that Mr. Obama would not include its provisions in his official budget documents. To do so, some said, would expose him to Democrats' criticism that he is too quick to compromise and allow Republicans to embrace the proposals for spending cuts, in particular the C.P.I., but ignore those for tax increases.
Neither the president nor senior aides privately hold much hope that Republican leaders -- Mr. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader -- will compromise. So Mr. Obama's strategy of reaching out to other Senate Republicans reflects a calculation that enough of them might cut a budget deal with the Democratic Senate majority. If that happens, the reasoning goes, a Senate-passed compromise would put pressure on the House to go along.
According to administration officials, the president's budget plan would reduce projected annual deficits by $1.8 trillion over 10 years, even with the select spending increases. To offset the initiatives' cost and avoid adding to deficits, Mr. Obama will propose the tobacco tax increase, a limit of $3 million on how much people can accumulate in tax-preferred savings accounts and repeal of a loophole that allows people to collect both disability and unemployment benefits.
Together with the $2.5 trillion in deficit reductions that Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans have agreed to since 2010, that would bring the total deficit reduction to more than $4.3 trillion over 10 years by the administration's computations -- just over the goal that both parties have set for stabilizing the growth of the national debt.
The deficit, which for this fiscal year is expected to be equal to 5.5 percent of the size of the economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, would decline to 1.7 percent by 2023, according to officials.
Of the more than $2.5 trillion to date in projected 10-year budget savings, nearly 80 percent would result from spending cuts. The rest would derive from tax increases on high incomes that became law on Jan. 1, in the tax agreement that the two parties reached at year-end when the efforts for a broader deficit-reduction deal collapsed.
Mr. Obama's proposals to reduce deficits $1.8 trillion more over a decade track his offer to Mr. Boehner, adjusted for the roughly $600 billion in higher taxes that became law in January. He will propose more than $600 billion in new revenues -- his last offer had called for $1.2 trillion in taxes -- mostly by limiting to 28 percent the deductions that individuals in higher tax brackets can claim. Congress has ignored that idea in past years.
Deficits would be reduced another $930 billion through 2023 as a result of spending cuts and other cost-saving changes to domestic programs, and $200 billion more due to reduced interest payments on the federal debt.
Mr. Obama's proposed spending reductions include about $400 billion from health programs and $200 billion from other areas, including farm subsidies, federal employee retirement programs, the Postal Service and the unemployment compensation system.
In Medicare, the savings would mostly come from payments to health care providers, including hospitals and pharmaceutical companies, but Mr. Obama also proposes that higher-income beneficiaries pay more for coverage.

HEADLINE: An Underground Passion for a Star's Stuff

BYLINE: By DAVID ROONEY

 BODY:
Since the dawn of time -- well O.K., since the mid-'60s -- gay men have been fiercely divided into love-her or hate-her camps by their feelings for Barbra Streisand. The intensity of those relationships is perhaps equaled by the subject's self-regard, at least based on the evidence of her hilariously unnecessary 2010 coffee-table book, ''My Passion for Design.''
The volume is a personal tour and chronicle of the creation and construction of Ms. Streisand's extensive Malibu compound, a ''dream refuge'' that includes a Connecticut-style mill house and water wheel. (Why not?) The author is also credited as principal photographer for the book, available in both regular and limited signed-and-numbered deluxe editions, the latter in a cloth-covered box that also includes a DVD, directed and narrated by... guess who? A steal at $500! 
But even in the more modest $60 version, this is a jaw-dropping digest of narcissism, obsessive folly and stifling tastefulness, which makes it a delicious target for satire. Jonathan Tolins has turned this tome into a springboard for ''Buyer & Cellar,'' a featherweight but irresistible play about celebrity false bonding, the solitude of über-fame and the seductive allure of expensive chintz.
A wonderful solo vehicle for Michael Urie to purvey his wicked winsomeness, the show, which opened on Wednesday at the Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, is a work of extravagant fiction, albeit one rooted in bizarre fact. The sheer excess of Babs-ylonia is of less interest to Mr. Tolins than the actual underground Main Street in the basement of a barn on the estate. Inspired by Winterthur, the American decorative arts museum in Delaware, it's an avenue of quaint storefronts -- a doll shop, an antiques emporium, a gift shoppe, a vintage clothing boutique, etc. -- all built to house Ms. Streisand's vast collection of ''stuff.''
''Remember, this is the part that's real,'' Mr. Urie says before he slips into character, with a nod of complicity that reads, ''Crazy, right?'' That character is Alex More, a struggling gay Los Angeles actor licking his wounds after being fired as the mayor of Toontown at Disneyland.
The play's cheeky premise is that since Ms. Streisand has fabricated herself a shopping mall with one customer, it also requires an employee to run it. That's where the freshly hired Alex comes in. Idling away his days in this subterranean arcade with only the purr of the frozen yogurt machine for company, he is a symbol for the indignities endured by out-of-work actors in survival jobs. But Alex's boredom is instantly forgotten when his employer pops downstairs to browse.
As related by Alex, either to the audience or to his excitable screenwriter boyfriend, Barry, his rapport with the boss evolves from awed fascination through mischievous curiosity and coy flirtation to the illusion of mutual respect, perhaps even friendship. To outline the surreal encounters that mark those transitions would spoil the fun. But the wit and invention of Mr. Tolins's writing and the immersive storytelling skills of Mr. Urie are such that not only do they spin a sturdy narrative out of this preposterous situation, they actually persuade you to buy into it.
What makes the show so enjoyable, however, is that it stops short of outright mockery. Even at its most irreverent the satire is tempered by affection and a hint of reluctant admiration -- though Barry's dissection of ''The Mirror Has Two Faces'' is savagely on target.
Staged on a spare white-on-white set that makes economical use of projections and lighting effects to switch locations, the play benefits from Stephen Brackett's crisp direction. No less controlled is Mr. Urie's nimble performance, which, unlike his character on ''Ugly Betty,'' never veers into campiness. Juggling both sides of every conversation, including Alex's tête-à-tête's with la Streisand, he brings a supremely light touch and a droll detachment to situations of ''Twilight Zone'' oddness, but also welcome suggestions of tenderness.
The play could be called inconsequential, ultimately amounting to little more than the anti-aspirational message that who we are is more important than what we acquire. But as a reflection on all of us ''struggling to make a perfect little world to fit our life into'' it's a seriously funny and remarkably sustained slice of absurdist whimsy on which both Barbra lovers and haters will be sold.

HEADLINE: Hero of the Bronx Is Now Accused of Betraying It

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU; Julie Turkewitz contributed reporting. Alain Delaquérière contributed research.

 BODY:
Desperate to block FreshDirect's move to their corner of the South Bronx, Mychal Johnson and his neighbors decided to turn to someone they hoped would help them take on the popular grocery delivery service and its political supporters. Their battle had become one of the most divisive in the Bronx in years, pitting promises of economic development against fears of lost quality of life.
So on a sweltering day last July, Mr. Johnson rang the bell at the Hunts Point office of Majora Carter, whose work as an environmental activist fighting for the South Bronx had earned her fame and fortune, including a prestigious MacArthur ''genius'' fellowship. Because she had started her career fighting truck traffic, he believed she would share their concerns about traffic and pollution from the relocated fleet of delivery trucks.
But as he waited on the sidewalk to ask for her help, an office worker opened the door just wide enough to tell him to put his request in writing. More than a week passed after Mr. Johnson and his group, South Bronx Unite, sent an e-mail inviting Ms. Carter to meet. Then the answer arrived. She would be happy to meet -- for her usual rate of $500 for new clients. 
''That was really a blow,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''Here's this person who has won quite a few awards for being an environmental activist, and here we have some real environmental concerns, and we can't even have a meeting without getting a template response with a price tag attached.''
Not long after, Ms. Carter was hired by FreshDirect to make the company's case to the community.
The story of Majora Carter, 46, is one of the best known in the South Bronx. The youngest of 10 children, she grew up in Hunts Point and later emerged as a fierce defender of its residents against urban blights like truck traffic and garbage dumps. Smart and passionate, with a high-wattage smile for the cameras, Ms. Carter was soon touring the Arctic with former President Jimmy Carter, hosting a Peabody-winning public radio show, and commanding tens of thousands of dollars in speaking and consulting fees.
Ms. Carter's meteoric rise also made her a polarizing figure. Many former allies and neighbors say that Ms. Carter trades on the credibility she built in the Bronx, while no longer representing its interests. They say she has capitalized on past good deeds in the way that politicians parlay their contacts into a lobbying career, or government regulators are hired by the companies they once covered.
''You can't have it both ways,'' said Eddie Bautista, executive director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance. ''Either you're an honest broker and accountable to the community, or you're working for a business interest and accountable to that.''
In a phone interview, Ms. Carter insisted that she had never stopped working to support the South Bronx. She said she would have supported FreshDirect even if she was not paid, saying that she had never been anti-business and that the company would create jobs, provide access to healthy foods, and promote local food-based businesses. ''I thought that ultimately they would be able to provide a net benefit to the community,'' Ms. Carter said.
She addressed the criticism by ticking off some of her many honors and noting her status as a ''thought leader.'' Her husband, James Chase -- who tends to Ms. Carter's public image as a vice president of her consulting firm -- called charges that she was financially motivated ''revolting.'' Nothing has highlighted the division over her legacy like the continuing battle over FreshDirect. The planned opening of a new headquarters for the company in the Bronx escalated from a not-in-my-backyard campaign to an acrimonious debate over how to help an area struggling with high rates of unemployment, obesity, diabetes and asthma.
State and city officials promised the grocer a $128 million package of cash and tax breaks to move to a vacant site on the Harlem River Yard from a location it had outgrown in Queens, in an effort to keep the company from accepting subsidies to move to New Jersey. The announcement brought about immediate protests and eventually a lawsuit accusing FreshDirect and city officials of systematically understating traffic problems and other effects.
Class implications idled near the surface: FreshDirect had become a hit with Manhattan residents who paid a premium to have their groceries dropped off at their doors, but it did not serve most of the Bronx, including the very streets where the government-subsidized headquarters were planned. (The company eventually expanded deliveries to the rest of the borough and introduced a program to accept food stamps, both of which it said were planned.)
The criticisms even extended personally to Ms. Carter. Neighbors had long gossiped that she spent more time at her husband's 1,500-square-foot, rent-stabilized loft in TriBeCa than at her own home in Hunts Point. That only changed, they said, shortly before she was hired by FreshDirect.
FreshDirect, which plans to move to the Bronx by 2015, entered into a one-year contract with the Majora Carter Group last August. (Neither Ms. Carter nor FreshDirect would disclose the amount of her contract.)
''Majora has been instrumental in introducing FreshDirect to the South Bronx community,'' John Leeman, chief marketing officer for FreshDirect, said in a statement. ''She's helped us raise awareness about our plans to create jobs, increase food access, and move to a green transportation fleet among other things.''
Ms. Carter was once a person whom companies feared. A graduate of the Bronx High School of Science and Wesleyan University, she got started in community organizing at the Point Community Development Corporation, a respected nonprofit group in Hunts Point. Known for charming supporters and opponents alike, she relished the spotlight, unlike many of her fellow organizers who preferred to stay in the background. Her courtship of the news media helped bring new visibility to environmental injustices faced by poor communities.
In 1999, Ms. Carter was at the center of a community campaign to defeat a proposed waste transfer station in Hunts Point, which residents feared would result in more diesel truck traffic. At a meeting, she shouted at members of another community group, South Bronx Clean Air Coalition, for supporting the proposal: ''You are accepting money from them and playing their community partner.''
''The ironies are just breathtaking,'' said Mr. Bautista, who witnessed that confrontation. ''The very thing she accused them of, she's doing the same thing now. Talk about coming full circle.''
Ms. Carter explained that her opposition to a waste transfer station that would have overburdened the South Bronx with trucks hauling garbage did not compare with the advantages now being offered by FreshDirect. ''That's a very simplistic way of trying to look at a complex situation and, again, net benefit,'' Ms. Carter said.
After founding Sustainable South Bronx, a nonprofit group focusing on work force development and environment, Ms. Carter won a prestigious $500,000 grant in 2005 from the MacArthur Foundation, which called her a ''relentless and charismatic urban strategist who seeks to address the disproportionate environmental and public health burdens experienced by residents of the South Bronx.''
A few years later, Ms. Carter parlayed her newfound celebrity into a for-profit consulting company, the Majora Carter Group. Her company Web site says it is focused on creating green jobs and shows a long list of awards and honors, including being named among the ''100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs'' by Goldman Sachs last year.
''She put the Bronx on an international stage,'' said Ruben Diaz Jr., the borough president, who bestowed a citation of merit in 2011.
As Ms. Carter's reputation suffered among some of her old supporters, who said she had an irritating tendency to overstate her contributions, others insisted that she has been misjudged.
Stephen Ritz, the dean of students at Hyde Leadership Charter School in Hunts Point, said that Ms. Carter mentored his students and used her contacts at the Hunts Point market to help him secure a weekly donation of 1,500 pieces of fruit to the school. ''I think there's a lot of jealousy,'' Mr. Ritz said. ''It's much easier to run your mouth than run a business.''
Since signing with FreshDirect, Ms. Carter has linked the grocer to a half-dozen groups like Health People, whose executive director, Chris Norwood, applauded Ms. Carter for forging public-private partnerships to benefit the local economy.
But the work has also eroded some of her connections. Her relations with the Point, where she got her start, have soured. And Sustainable South Bronx, the group that she founded and led until 2008, is now supporting South Bronx Unite, which is leading the effort to block FreshDirect's move and has emerged as her most vocal critic.

HEADLINE: China Flaunts Regional Clout With Manhunt

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ and BREE FENG

 BODY:
BAN MOM, Laos -- It was 100 miles downstream from China, on the banks of the Mekong River, where a notorious drug lord slipped ashore in the dusk into the hands of law enforcement.
Security officials from Laos arrested the trafficker, Naw Kham, but the international manhunt that led to his capture was organized in Beijing, by top Chinese government officials intent on making him pay for the killings of 13 Chinese seamen on the river, which has become a major trade route into China.
The bodies of the Chinese, the crew of two cargo boats, were found badly mutilated on the Thai side of the river in early October 2011. The killings, the worst slaughter of Chinese citizens abroad in recent memory, angered the Chinese public. Chinese investigators insist that Mr. Naw Kham was the mastermind of the murders.
China's search for Mr. Naw Kham, overseen by its powerful Ministry of Public Security, was a hard-nosed display of the government's political and economic clout across Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, the three countries of Southeast Asia that form the Golden Triangle. The capture shows how China's law enforcement tentacles reach far beyond its borders into a region now drawn by investment and trade into China's orbit, and where the United States' influence is being challenged. 
It took six months for China to catch Mr. Naw Kham, a citizen of Myanmar in his 40s, a man of many aliases who was at the center of the booming synthetic drug business in the Golden Triangle, once known for its opium.
What came next was quick: the authorities flew the drug lord from Laos to China, tried him in a provincial court and executed him last month in a highly publicized live television broadcast that captured the proceedings until just moments before he received a lethal injection.
The Chinese hunt for Mr. Naw Kham was methodical and unyielding.
Immediately after the killings of the sailors, the Chinese government invited senior officials from the three countries that form the Golden Triangle to Beijing.
There, it pressured the countries to participate in Chinese-led river patrols, intended to ensure security for the river trade. Meng Jianzhu, who was China's minister for public security, flew to Myanmar to meet with President Thein Sein, and Wen Jiabao, then China's prime minister, spoke by telephone to his Thai counterpart, Yingluck Shinawatra, to urge her cooperation.
It fell to Liu Yuejin, leader of the antinarcotics bureau of the Ministry of Public Security, to coordinate the three-country search. Like the F.B.I., the ministry operates more than 20 liaison offices in places around the world, including the United States.
Mr. Liu took up temporary headquarters at Guan Lei, on the Mekong River in southern Yunnan Province, and sent Chinese officers to the three capitals to work as liaisons with local officials. He was in touch with these officers every day, Mr. Liu said.
Mr. Naw Kham proved to be a formidable target.
He had operatives within the Burmese and Thai armies and the Laotian security forces, according to an Asian official who works in the Golden Triangle and who spoke of the delicate case on the condition of anonymity. To counter Mr. Naw Kham's web of protection, China was able to rely on contacts developed over the past decade from the training of more than 1,500 police officers in Southeast Asia, the official said.
China also had an array of informers -- ''flip-flops,'' the official said -- from among the increasing number of Chinese petty traders and businessmen in the region.
''He had his people, we had our people,'' acknowledged Mr. Liu in a rare interview with a foreign reporter in his office in Beijing.
The Chinese were so intent on catching up with Mr. Naw Kham that security forces considered using a drone to kill him.
The drone idea was eventually abandoned even as Mr. Naw Kham outfoxed his pursuers in Myanmar's mountainous jungles, said Mr. Liu, a precise man with a photograph of himself at a Mao heritage site on his office wall.
The Chinese news media reported that Mr. Liu's superiors had ordered that Mr. Naw Kham be captured alive. Mr. Liu, whose antinarcotics bureau runs a fleet of unarmed drones for surveillance in China's border areas, insisted that the idea was shelved because of legal restraints.
''China using unmanned aircraft would have met with problems,'' he said. ''My initial reaction was that this was not realistic because this relates to international and sovereignty issues.''
But China had another asset, on the ground. In northern Laos, 10 miles south of where Mr. Naw Kham would eventually be arrested, a lavish Chinese-owned casino called the Kings Roman, decorated with statues of larger-than-life Roman figures and a huge crown affixed to its roof, operates in a special economic zone run by Chinese businessmen on the edge of the Mekong.
The complex feels like a Chinese enclave: street signs are in Chinese, and Chinese currency, the renminbi, is favored over the Laotian kip. The casino offers stretch limousines for its customers, and a caged tiger to pet. It maintains its own Chinese security force, which probably played a role in the search for Mr. Naw Kham, the Asian official said.
In the beginning, the Chinese had no idea of Mr. Naw Kham's whereabouts, and did not know on which side of the river he was hiding, Mr. Liu said. Gradually, they began picking up his tracks.
In December 2011, they learned he was in northern Laos. ''Naw Kham had many friends, including in the local police,'' Mr. Liu said. ''His friends would alert him and protect him, and local officials would delay operations by leading us down the wrong road, literally.''
With the help of his supporters in Laos, Mr. Naw Kham evaded the Chinese and at night escaped across the river to Myanmar. ''Under Lao norms, law enforcement activity is not done after dark,'' Mr. Liu said wryly.
Once back in Myanmar, Mr. Naw Kham shuttled between hiding places in the mountains around the district of Tachilek, a center for the manufacture of methamphetamine. The factory-made drug has overtaken opium as the most lucrative product in the Golden Triangle, and antinarcotics officials say it was central to Mr. Naw Kham's empire.
One of the links between Mr. Naw Kham and the two boats with the 13 Chinese seamen involved 920,000 methamphetamine pills, with an estimated value of $6 million, on board, according to the Thai police.
The Chinese authorities say the drugs were planted on the boats. Some Thai authorities contend that Mr. Naw Kham knew the boats were laden with drugs and sent his men to punish the crews for not paying protection money as they sailed from China into Thai waters.
Other Thai officials say that nine members of an elite Thai military unit were also involved in the killings of the Chinese seamen. Mr. Liu said that he agreed with that assessment, and that the nine Thai soldiers should be prosecuted.
The factories for making the methamphetamine pills are hidden throughout the mountainous terrain of Shan State in Myanmar, an area Mr. Naw Kham knew instinctively, Mr. Liu said.
In February and March 2012, the Chinese investigators missed him twice. But each time the Chinese closed in, they swept up supporters, increasing the chances they would flush him out, Mr. Liu said.
''There were gunfights where people were captured or killed, others were frightened off, and so he had fewer and fewer people around him,'' Mr. Liu said.
As Mr. Naw Kham's security net evaporated in Myanmar, the Chinese learned that he planned to escape across the Mekong River to Laos in a small boat, Mr. Liu said. The Laotians were alerted. ''This time we didn't have to persuade the Lao to act,'' he said.
Mr. Naw Kham landed on the muddy banks with two associates. The Laotian police captured him as he tried to flee, Mr. Liu said.
Mr. Liu denied having his own men on the spot, but it was almost certain that Chinese agents were on hand, the Asian official said.
For China, the arrest was a substantial victory, said Paul Chambers, director of research at the Institute of South East Asian Affairs at Chiang Mai University in Thailand, and an author of the book ''Cashing In Across the Golden Triangle.''
''The capture of Naw Kham sends a message that no group or state is going to be allowed to mess around with China on the Mekong River,'' Mr. Chambers said. ''Everyone now knows the top dog on the Mekong is China.''
In some ways, China's operation to scoop up the drug lord echoed Gen. John J. Pershing's endeavor to capture Pancho Villa, the Mexican revolutionary leader who in 1916 killed 18 Americans in New Mexico, Mr. Chambers said.
At the time, President Woodrow Wilson wanted to demonstrate that under the Monroe Doctrine, the United States was the power in Mexico, and that a popular folk hero would not be permitted to challenge it.
''China has its own Monroe Doctrine in the region, and this is the Pancho Villa case of the Mekong,'' Mr. Chambers said.
But there were two distinctions.
''No. 1, the Chinese caught Naw Kham,'' Mr. Chambers said, alluding to Pancho Villa's skill in dodging General Pershing's army. ''And No. 2, for smart diplomacy, they gave the credit to Laos.''

HEADLINE: Citing Art and Money, 7 Cuban Dancers Defect to U.S.

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN; Larry Rohter contributed reporting.

 BODY:
They are in their early 20s, trained at one of the world's most prestigious ballet companies, and they now confront a cold new world: the competitive, often precarious and very much nonsubsidized American dance scene. 
In one of the larger such group defections, seven young members of the National Ballet of Cuba split from their troupe during a tour in Mexico in recent weeks and have made their way to the United States.
The dancers are members of the corps de ballet, a company spokesman in Cuba said on Thursday, confirming the defections. He identified them as Randy Crespo, Edward González, José Justiz, Ariadni Martín, Luis Victor Santana, Annie Ruiz Díaz and Alejandro Méndez.
Four of the dancers talked about their decision on a program on América TeVé, a Spanish-language station in Miami. ''It was difficult, because all of our families are there in Cuba,'' Ms. Ruiz Díaz said. ''We're thinking of a better future, both economically and artistically.''
The seven join a long roster of dancers, not to mention baseball players and other athletes, who have made their way to the United States from Cuba. Many of the dancers have permission from the Cuban authorities to stay in the United States to perform, but those tend to be soloists and stars. Five National Ballet dancers stayed behind in Canada in 2011, and three in 2007.
Cuba is a rich source of ballet talent, thanks to the empire built by Alicia Alonso, 91, the determined director of the National Ballet, who helped found what would become the company in 1948, and Fidel Castro's support for building a ballet tradition. Several of the dancers interviewed on América TeVé praised Ms. Alonso, who persevered although she has been largely blind for decades.
Many Cuban dancers who defected in recent decades have found places in major companies in the United States. But Jane Hermann, the dance agent who has helped bring the National Ballet to the United States on a half-dozen tours, said it was not always easy.
''We are not state subsidized,'' Ms. Hermann said of the American scene, pointing out that few companies pay a full year's salary. ''I would just hate to see these children end up waiting tables because they can't get a job to allow them to rent an apartment.'' She added that one or two National Ballet dancers defect from most of the tours she has booked.
At the same time, she acknowledged that a lack of money for the National Ballet in recent years had left the company in a moribund artistic state. ''It's economic, but it's also artistic,'' she said. ''There isn't a great deal of creativity going on there because Alicia can't see.''
Ms. Ruiz Díaz said she was game for anything. ''The kind of work I do doesn't matter, to get to the future I want,'' she said. ''I see myself dancing ballet, classical, contemporary, Neo-Classical. I'd like to dance in various branches -- but to dance.''

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Climb Unexpectedly to a 4-Month High

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits hit a four-month high last week, suggesting that the labor market recovery may have lost some momentum in March. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 28,000 to a seasonally adjusted 385,000, the highest level since November, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It cautioned that the estimate was imprecise because the week included Easter.
Economists, who had expected claims to drop to 350,000, said while the rise partly reflected difficulties adjusting the data during the Easter and spring breaks, there was no doubt the pace of job growth had eased.
On Friday, the government releases its employment report for March. According to a Reuters survey of economists, employers added 200,000 jobs to their payrolls last month after hiring 236,000 workers in February. The unemployment rate is seen holding steady at 7.7 percent.
But a weaker reading is possible after a report from the payroll processor ADP showed that private employers added the fewest jobs in five months in March.
Goldman Sachs expects the economy to have created 175,000 jobs last month, noting that the tone of labor market indicators softened in March, especially in light of the so-called government sequester, which is cutting $85 billion in spending.
''The sequester is likely to slow March payroll growth, and payrolls have outpaced broader measures of labor market improvement over the last few months,'' said Sven Jari Stehn, an economist at Goldman Sachs.

HEADLINE: Fed Weighs A Reaction To Stirrings Of Recovery

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials are grappling publicly with a better kind of problem than most they've confronted in recent years: what if the labor market continues to improve more rapidly than they had expected?
The economy added an average of 187,000 jobs a month from September to February, slightly faster than the average monthly pace from 2004 to 2006, the best years of the last economic upswing. The government plans to release a preliminary estimate Friday morning of March job creation.
Some Fed officials have suggested in recent weeks that if economic growth continues on its present trajectory, the central bank should begin to roll back its economic stimulus campaign by the middle of the year, ahead of expectations. 
But the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and his allies remain wary that another surprising spring will be followed by another disappointing summer. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman, who is viewed as a potential successor to Mr. Bernanke, reflected that caution in a speech on Thursday.
''I am encouraged by recent signs that the economy is improving and healing from the trauma of the crisis, and I expect that, at some point, the F.O.M.C. will return to a more normal approach to monetary policy,'' she said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy for the central bank.
For now, she said, the Fed needs to remain focused on reducing unemployment.
Ms. Yellen also commented obliquely on her own future. Asked whether the economics profession, and central banks, needed more women in positions of power, she responded that such a need was ''something we're going to see increase over time, and it's time for that to happen.''
The Fed announced last year that it intended to hold short-term interest rates near zero so long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent. It also said that it would buy $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to accelerate the decline. By expanding its asset holdings, the Fed continuously increases the scale of its effort to stimulate the economy.
Stronger data has raised hopes that the economy is once again growing fast enough to reduce the unemployment rate, which stood at 7.7 percent in February, little changed from 7.8 percent in September. But more than 20 million Americans are unable to find full-time jobs and it is not yet clear that the recent uptick in the economy is sustainable. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.77 percent on Thursday, indicating that some investors are pessimistic about the economy's prospects.
In recent months, weekly claims for unemployment benefits have declined. But the Labor Department reported on Thursday that claims spiked in the latest week to the highest level in four months, although it cautioned that the estimate was unusually imprecise because the week included Easter.
''House prices are going up more than I would have expected six months ago,'' Ms. Yellen said. ''I think it's making people feel a whole lot better.'' She added: ''I don't have any doubt that our policies are contributing to the lowest interest rates, whether it's borrowing for a car or borrowing for a mortgage. I believe that that is not only caused by our policy, but our policy is contributing.''
John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said on Wednesday in Los Angeles that he might support a reduction in the volume of the Fed's asset purchases by summer and a suspension of the program before the end of the year.
''I'm hopeful that the economy has finally shifted into higher gear,'' said Mr. Williams, who supported the purchases last year.
Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, reiterated on Thursday her view that the Fed should scale back immediately. Ms. George cast the sole dissenting vote at the last two meetings of the Fed's policy-making committee. She told an audience in El Reno, Okla., on Thursday that she was more concerned than her colleagues that the Fed's efforts to suppress borrowing costs could result in financial instability and faster inflation.
Ms. Yellen and other officials, however, seem inclined to postpone any decisions. The pace of economic growth has remained weak relative to the pace of job growth. The most recent round of federal spending cuts has only just begun to show results. And Fed officials have overestimated the strength of the recovery repeatedly in recent years, only to find the economy needed still more help. Caution may now dictate doing more rather than less.
''I have not seen enough evidence yet to convince me that 2013 is going to break out of that pattern that we've seen, really over the last four years,'' Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said on Thursday in Dayton, Ohio, according to Bloomberg News. Mr. Lockhart, who spoke as part of a panel discussion, said that it might be appropriate to curtail purchases late this year or early next year if the economy continued to add at least 180,000 jobs a month. Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, who appeared on the same panel, set a higher bar, saying he'd like to see ''200,000-a-month increases for like six months,'' Bloomberg News reported.
Deciding when to stop buying is complicated, because the benefits of the asset purchases are both mechanical and psychological. The Fed is mechanically suppressing borrowing costs, but it is also reinforcing in the public eye its broader commitment to hold down borrowing costs for years to come. Fed officials argue that suspending its purchases would maintain a constant level of downward pressure on borrowing costs, because the Fed would continue to hold the same quantity of bonds. But investors have responded to the suspension of earlier rounds of asset purchases as if the Fed were signaling the start of a broader retreat, reducing the economic benefits of the policy even without shrinking the portfolio.
In recent months, Fed officials said they had concluded that reducing the volume of purchases, rather than stopping abruptly, could help the Fed to communicate with investors more precisely.
''In my view,'' Ms. Yellen said, ''adjusting the pace of asset purchases in response to the evolution of the outlook for the labor market will provide the public with information regarding the committee's intentions and should reduce the risk of misunderstanding and market disruption as the conclusion of the program draws closer.''

HEADLINE: Ukraine's Thorny Road to Association

BYLINE: By KOSTIANTYN YELISIEIEV

 BODY:
On March 30, John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Kiev and now director of the Center for Complex Operations at the National Defense University in Washington, wrote on these pages that the anti-democratic policies of the Yanukovich administration in Ukraine were holding up signing an Association Agreement with the European Union, and that the ''most persuasive step'' Kiev could take would be to free two imprisoned opposition leaders, Yulia Tymoshenko and Yuri Lutsenko (''Ukraine can't have it both ways''). Ukraine's ambassador to the E.U. offers Kiev's position.
A year has passed since Ukraine and the European Union initialed the Association Agreement. It has been a difficult time and is unlikely to become any easier in the run-up to the Vilnius Eastern Partnership Summit in November when the Association Agreement, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (D.C.F.T.A.) agreement, should be signed. 
Following the Ukraine-E.U. summit in February, Kiev and Brussels are building upon a common understanding that Ukraine needs to demonstrate determined action and tangible progress on a number of key issues. We have already started to deliver.
Unfortunately, the E.U. remains hesitant, which raises two questions: Who will win if Ukraine and the E.U. fail to sign the Association Agreement? And will European capitals assume responsibility for the consequences of not signing the Association Agreement with 46 million Ukrainians?
First, not signing the Association Agreement will be a clear ''lose-lose'' situation for both the E.U. and Ukraine. It will be an illogical and tragic missed opportunity, a huge disappointment for Ukrainians who are truly Europeans, and a significant geopolitical failure for E.U. foreign policy. If the E.U. cannot rise to the challenge in its neighborhood, how can it expect to be taken seriously elsewhere in the world?
Second, the D.C.F.T.A. matters not only for Ukraine but also for the E.U. For the Union, it will open a promising new market, which is of critical importance at a time of economic recovery. By rejecting the deal with Ukraine, the E.U. would in fact punish European industries, enterprises, investors and businessmen, depriving them of lucrative opportunities.
Third, the Agreement will provide instruments to start building Europe inside Ukraine. The judiciary is a good example. Would an ad hoc solution to the cases that are of particular concern to Europe bring Ukraine any closer to European standards of the rule of law?
To address a problem and prevent its recurrence one should fight its roots rather than its consequence. The Association Agreement with its binding mechanisms would provide the needed tools to eradicate systemic shortcomings that are on the Union's wish list -- including the cases of special interest, election law, corruption, the rule of law, and so forth.
Fourth, failure to sign the Agreement risks affecting the security situation in the region. The Association Agreement contains political guarantees for Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Those who are against the Association Agreement challenge the notion of an independent and stable Ukraine, a key factor for regional security.
Fifth, the E.U. must not ignore public opinion in Ukraine. Determination to conclude the Association Agreement has united Ukraine's political parties, including prominent opposition leaders and the diaspora. The Agreement is also broadly supported by Ukrainian civil society, and the reason is simple: It is an instrument for public control over the government, motivating it to implement reforms.
Last but not least, the Agreement will put an end to the innuendos and speculation regarding Ukraine's choice for the future. The scale and significance of a formal association between Ukraine and the E.U. are the reasons behind an increase in attention to the issue from both supporters and opponents.
The closer we come to signing, the more opposition we face. I believe, and I hope I am wrong, that the road to the Agreement's entry into force will be ever thornier.
Unfortunately, so long as the European Union fails to take a decisive strategic decision on the place of Ukraine in its foreign policy priorities, there will be endless pretexts to delay bringing Ukraine closer. My words should not be interpreted as rejecting the need for Ukraine to deliver on reforms. We are committed to that -- not to win praise in Brussels, but for the sake of our citizens.
With the Association Agreement in force, this transformation will take place faster and more efficiently, turning it into a catalyst for systemic reforms and the democratic transition of Ukraine from a post-Soviet to a modern European state.
We are destined to sign the Agreement this November. While today the key to the Association Agreement is in Kiev, there are duplicates in some E.U. capitals. We need to be robust, resilient and strong enough to turn these keys together, and anchor Ukraine within the Union.
Kostiantyn Yelisieiev is the ambassador of Ukraine to the European Union.

HEADLINE: A City So Charming That Many Visitors Never Leave

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS GILL

 BODY:
SANTIAGO -- Chile, especially its capital, Santiago, can be appealing to anyone who values clean streets, efficient public transportation and honorable law enforcement.
''I lived in Argentina for two years and the economic turmoil there can be unbearable,'' said Kristina Schreck, who was born in California. ''But in Chile, the economy is solid and the country is safe.''
Ms. Schreck, who owns a Santiago public relations firm, Azure, moved to Chile in 1998 on a four-month sabbatical and never left, even heading the Chile tourism board's media relations department at one point. ''I stayed in Chile because at the time I saw a lot of opportunity here,'' she said. ''I still see a lot of opportunity.'' 
In 2011, Ms. Schreck and her husband began searching for a home in Providencia, a neighborhood near the center of Santiago. ''There are many lovely old homes and apartments in Providencia,'' she said, ''and we felt that downtown was too hectic and scrappy and Las Condes, farther uptown, was too antiseptic.''
They bought a three-bedroom apartment in February 2011 for 80 million Chilean pesos, or about $169,000, and invested the equivalent of $10,000 in renovations.
''I love the beautiful parquet floors and that the back rooms look out over the patio of a church and its lush gardens, and that I can see the Andes from my home office window,'' Ms. Schreck said. ''The location is ideal, close to the Metro and across the street from the Parque Forestal, a farmer's market and the Mapocho River.''
In the last two years property values have risen sharply in Santiago. Ms. Schreck says she and her husband could now sell the apartment, which covers 160 square meters, or 1,722 square feet, for about 140 million Chilean pesos, based the recent sale prices of some smaller properties in the neighborhood.
The city's real estate market has performed well, despite a short dip after the 2008 global downturn, said Matt Ridgway, who owns Chile Investments, a real estate agency that specializes in vineyard properties south of the capital and restored historic houses in Santiago and the coastal city of Valparaiso.
''Prices rebounded quickly, though, and have risen very fast, 10 to 20 percent per year, since,'' Mr. Ridgway said.
Victor Danús Ríos, regional director of the real estate company Re/Max Chile, said the country's economic, political and social stability in recent years has helped generate growth.
''Coupled with good action taken by financial authorities, this has allowed a very positive outcome to the global crisis,'' he said, noting that in December, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, recognized the country's strong economy. He added that foreigners considered Chile to be a safe haven for investment, particularly in mining and agriculture, so real estate sales -- especially to Russians, Venezuelans and Argentines -- have increased noticeably in recent years.
Colombians, Bolivians, Peruvians and others from the region have long flocked to Santiago for a better standard of living, and there have been many North Americans and Europeans who have come to Chile on business and decided to stay or have returned later to buy second homes. A foreigner does not need to be a full-time resident to buy property but is required to have a tax identification number and to hire legal representation for the transaction.
While there are no official data on home sales to foreigners, evidence of the city's English-speaking residents is easy to find on Santiago's streets: restaurants like California Cantina and a half-dozen British pubs; Szot, a microbrewery owned by an expatriate from California; and an English-language newspaper.
The environmental allure is not difficult to understand. Chile's capital, which has about five million residents, is a short drive from ski resorts in the Andes and the beaches of the Pacific coast. The snow-capped mountain peaks to the east of the city can be seen on clear days, while the Mediterranean-like climate is ideal for growing grapes. Some of the world's best-known vineyards are within the Santiago metropolitan area.
Most foreigners moving to Chile base themselves in the capital. (Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport, 16 kilometers, or 10 miles, from the city center, has direct connections to most major North American and European cities.) But unlike other similarly sized cities in South America, where quality housing tends to be concentrated in just a few locations, upper-end homes are found in many parts of Santiago.
Families tend to prefer the more suburban feel of northern districts like Las Condes and Vitacura, where brick and stucco houses are the norm. Young couples and singles like to be in more lively districts closer to the city center, like Providencia or Bellavista, where high-rise apartment buildings, most of which are five to 20 stories tall, are more common.
Most apartment buildings are modern builds and, because of the occasional earthquake, all structures must meet strict local regulations. Some older structures, like the 1920s-era townhouses in the Bellas Artes/Lastarria district, still can be found, although they are rapidly being demolished to make way for new developments.
''The rise in the value of land in Greater Santiago has reached 257 percent in 10 years,'' Mr. Danús Ríos said.
He noted that prices for new properties tended to be about 20 percent higher per square meter than resales. In central Santiago, he continued, sales averaged 798,000 pesos per square meter, or $158 per square foot, while Providencia averaged 1.48 million pesos per square meter and Las Condes 3.76 million pesos per square meter.
Properties now on the market in Santiago include large estates in the northern districts, like an Italian-style villa in Vitacura, listed for $4.84 million by Engel & Völkers Chile, to a three-bedroom apartment at the W Residences, above the W Hotel in Las Condes, listed for $1.76 million by Sotheby's International Realty. (Upper-end properties are often listed in U.S. dollars rather than pesos.)

HEADLINE: 'In a Moment It Can All Be Gone'

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
The broken leg felt round the country -- during college basketball's showcase event -- left teammates and coaches in tears and television networks turning away from video of the gruesome injury. It also inflamed the debate about the treatment and care of unpaid college athletes who help generate hundreds of millions of dollars for their universities.
The injured player was Kevin Ware, a sophomore guard for Louisville, playing in the N.C.A.A. tournament. He was taken to a hospital and had surgery to repair compound fractures of his tibia. Louisville officials said the university had a secondary policy on its varsity athletes, ensuring that Ware, who also has his family's primary insurance, will incur no out-of-pocket expenses in his rehabilitation.
But Ware is likely to be personally responsible for any health care expenses related to the injury after he leaves Louisville. Injuries sustained in college athletics that linger or develop into chronic conditions are generally not covered by a university's or the N.C.A.A.'s medical insurance once an athlete has left college. 
Louisville officials declined to specify the terms of the policy that covers Ware or to say who would handle his medical bills if the injury led to problems later, after he left the university. The N.C.A.A. said it was not able to comment on a specific athlete's medical condition.
''Ware's injury underscores just how vulnerable college athletes are: in a moment it can all be gone,'' said Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association, an advocacy group for athletes. He added, ''Once you're a former player, you're on your own.''
Bob DeMars, who played four years as a defensive lineman for Southern California, from 1998 to 2001, tore the posterior cruciate ligament in each knee while playing for the Trojans. He also sustained a serious neck injury and separated both shoulders.
''I wake up with a lot of things bothering me sometimes, and my knees are unstable,'' said DeMars, 33, a filmmaker and part-time teacher. ''If my knee goes out because I don't have a P.C.L. and my anterior cruciate ligament tears and I'm hobbled for the rest of my life, I hope Southern Cal helps me pick up the pieces. But they don't have to.
''College athletes aren't employees, so there's no workmen's compensation. They tell us we're student-athletes because it's not a job. But it sure is a business, and it's not a nonprofit.''
If Ware's medical claims exceed $90,000, he will also qualify for the N.C.A.A.'s catastrophic insurance program, which has some continuing coverage under certain conditions. The N.C.A.A. has additional supplemental insurance for injuries that occur during championships events.
But not all colleges generate as much revenue through athletics as Louisville does; the university took in more than $40 million through its basketball program alone last year. Many colleges outside the N.C.A.A.'s top athletic tier do not offer comprehensive secondary policies to their varsity athletes. The N.C.A.A. requires an institution only to certify that each athlete has some kind of primary medical insurance, which is usually a family policy.
''And if an athlete's parents don't have a policy, then the college offers them the same policy they offer regular students,'' said David Dranove, a health economist and a professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. ''That is usually a group policy that's not particularly generous and not tailored to the kinds of injuries that occur in sports, which often require specialized surgeries, long rehabilitations and expensive tests'' like magnetic resonance imaging tests.
''So the colleges treat the athletes like regular students,'' he continued, ''when they're routinely exposed to much more hazardous conditions where injury is common.''
American labor law created decades ago established that workers exposed to injuries in the normal course of their jobs should not be expected to pay because of those injuries, Dranove said. ''The N.C.A.A. is 100 years behind the rest of the country,'' he said.
Even at top-tier institutions -- as well as at the hundreds of medium-size and small colleges that have sports programs -- secondary insurance policies can have significant coverage gaps. In addition, not many injuries are serious enough to reach the $90,000 deductible that triggers the N.C.A.A.-sponsored policy.
Valerie Hardrick, whose son Kyle was a basketball player at Oklahoma, was stunned to discover she owed $10,000 for an M.R.I. and other tests performed on her son when he injured his knee in 2010. Her private insurance paid for about $20,000 in other medical bills, but the M.R.I. was classified as an out-of-pocket expense.
Hardrick did not get the bill for the M.R.I. until nearly a year later, after Kyle's scholarship was not renewed, Hardrick told a Congressional panel on college athletics in 2011.
''There's a lot they don't tell you about when you sign for an athletic scholarship,'' Hardrick said. ''They ought to tell you what insurance won't cover.''
Concerns about inequitable treatment of college athletes last year caused the California Legislature to pass a bill known as the Student-Athlete Bill of Rights. It requires universities that generate more than $10 million in annual media revenues from athletics -- four California universities qualified immediately -- to provide equivalent academic scholarships to varsity athletes who are injured and lose their athletic scholarships. It also mandates that the institutions pay the health care premiums for low-income athletes and cover all deductibles for injuries related to participation in an intercollegiate sport.
''A significant number of people are starting to see that we should start protecting these athletes as laborers,'' said Paul H. Haagen, the co-director of the Center for Sports Law and Policy at Duke University. ''Effectively, the N.C.A.A. has lost the public-relations war, and the entire idea of the student-athlete and amateurism erodes. That's also because there is incentive to exploit the athletes.''
The vast majority of high-level athletes are on yearly scholarships that are renewable at the discretion of the institution, and complicated and onerous N.C.A.A. restrictions on outside jobs and private contributions often put varsity athletes at a financial disadvantage compared with the rest of the student body. As a result, the pressure on the N.C.A.A. to alter its policies substantially is growing. Ware's injury has heightened the focus on another issue: health insurance coverage.
''Change is coming to collegiate athletics because there are all these multiple problems,'' said Warren Zola, a sports law professor at Boston College. ''You see the state legislatures and even Congress getting involved. The leaders in higher education might want to be proactive and make their own changes before change is forced on them.''
As for Ware, with his broken leg in a cast, he is expected to attend Louisville's game Saturday in the N.C.A.A. tournament's Final Four, an annual highlight on the American sports calendar.
''We all wish the best for Kevin, and I'm glad he got the best care available,'' Huma, the National College Players Association chief, said. ''But there are plentiful financial resources available in college athletics to ensure that all injured athletes -- at all levels and not just at the biggest schools in the Final Four -- get treated in a similar way.''

HEADLINE: Jury Selection Continues In Trial on Jackson's Death

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
A global corporation accused of pushing a beloved entertainer to his death. A family whose internal squabbles have been tabloid catnip for decades. A courtroom crowded with lawyers, but off limits to television cameras.
And, of course, the earning potential of Michael Jackson.
Those are some of the elements in the latest trial over Jackson and his financial legacy: a wrongful-death civil suit, begun this week in Los Angeles, that pits Jackson's family against the company behind the concerts Jackson had been preparing for when he died in June 2009. 
In the suit, Jackson's mother, Katherine, and his three children accuse the Anschutz Entertainment Group, or A.E.G., of negligence and breach of contract by hiring Conrad Murray, the doctor who administered the anesthetics that killed him.
The suit seeks damages of what Jackson could have earned if he had lived. Kevin Boyle, a lawyer for the Jacksons, said that ''economic experts will testify that the loss of earning capacity is approximately $1 billion to $5 billion, based primarily on A.E.G. projections.''
A.E.G. denies the accusations and contends that Dr. Murray was hired by Jackson himself. In a separate criminal trial, Dr. Murray was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in 2011, and is serving a four-year prison sentence.
The company faces risk whether it wins or loses the case. While Jackson's indiscretions are now well known, and were laid out in Dr. Murray's televised trial, A.E.G. has less of a public profile and is being cast as a villain. In the court of public opinion, at least, it may find little sympathy.
''A.E.G. is in a no-win situation,'' said Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the concert industry trade magazine Pollstar. ''Katherine Jackson and family are trying to paint A.E.G. as a soulless corporation that was exploiting Michael. No matter what the court decides, some people will refuse to accept the verdict.''
A.E.G., owned by the billionaire Philip Anschutz, has sports and entertainment properties around the world, including Staples Center and in Los Angeles and O2 Arena in London. The company was put up for sale last year, but withdrawn last month, reportedly because the bids were lower than the $8 billion to $10 billion that Mr. Anschutz wanted.
The civil case against the company hinges on who hired Dr. Murray. The Jackson family says that A.E.G. hired him for $150,000 a month, and pressured Dr. Murray to get Jackson ready for the concerts without regard to Jackson's health. A.E.G. says that Jackson insisted on Dr. Murray, and that any payment was only an advance that would be paid by Jackson.
Either way, the case highlights how Jackson's business was conducted differently from that of most stars.
''Outside rarefied artists doing rarefied deals with monolithic entertainment companies, one would not generally see this sort of claim arise from a recording agreement or other engagement agreement with an artist,'' said Kenneth J. Abdo, a music industry lawyer who represents artists.
Nearly four years after Jackson's death, the case and the news media's coverage of it demonstrate the public's continued fascination with Jackson, and with the lurid side of the entertainment business.
During his life, Jackson was acquitted in a child molesting trial, and his various exploits -- plastic surgery, traveling with a chimpanzee -- made him a regular target of gossip. But the circumstances of his death, coming just as he was trying to revive his career and rebuild his finances, have bolstered his value as a brand, said Jo Piazza, the author of the book ''Celebrity, Inc.: How Famous People Make Money.''
''The fact that he died in the midst of a redemption narrative not only makes him endlessly fascinating,'' Ms. Piazza said, ''but has made him much more lucrative in death than he was at the end of his life.''
Jackson's estate, saddled with more than $500 million in debt at his death, has been stabilized through an array of music deals with Cirque du Soleil, the film ''Michael Jackson's This Is It,'' a video game, merchandising and other projects. In a court filing last May, the estate said it had gross earnings of $475 million since Jackson's death.
The civil case is expected to last three months and may involve testimony from stars like Diana Ross, Prince and Quincy Jones.
The judge in the case, Yvette M. Palazuelos of Los Angeles Superior Court, has barred cameras, but CNN and NBCUniversal have asked her to reconsider, and an order is expected soon.
Jury selection began on Tuesday and may continue through the week. Potential jurors were given a 25-page form that asked them 123 questions, including, ''Did you hear, read or see anything in the media about Michael Jackson's death?''
The trial is being held in a courtroom with a gallery with only 45 seats, with just a few available to the public through a daily lottery. Most of the rest are reserved for reporters and lawyers.

HEADLINE: With Pep Talks Coming From Central Banks, the Markets Make Modest Gains

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks ended higher on Thursday after the Bank of Japan announced aggressive policies to lift its economy, but weak jobs data in the United States capped gains.
The Bank of Japan's surprising stimulus plan came with supportive comments from officials in Europe and at the Federal Reserve, suggesting that central bank actions will continue supporting the world's economy to the benefit of stocks. Interest rates seemed to respond to the stimulus.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 15/32, to 102 4/32, and the yield fell to 1.77 percent from 1.82 percent late Wednesday. 
The iShares MSCI Japan Index exchange-traded fund jumped 4 percent, to $10.89, while United States-listed shares of Toyota climbed 4.7 percent, to $105.63 and WisdomTree Japan, another exchange-traded fund, rose 7.5 percent, to $43.88.
The Fed's stimulus, along with signs of improvement in the United States economy, have helped stocks rally since the start of the year. While the Standard & Poor 500-stock index is up 9.4 percent since the start of the year and broke its nominal closing record last week, it has yet to surpass its intraday high of 1,576.09, and this week investors have mostly pulled back.
''The Fed officials certainly have been going out of their way to point out that they're staying the course and sticking with their program, which has probably been reassuring for markets,'' said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Ill.
An unexpected jump in weekly jobless claims to a four-month high raised questions about the labor market's recovery a day ahead of the Labor Department's widely watched monthly jobs report. A report on Wednesday showed that in March United States companies hired at the slowest rate in five months.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 55.76 points, or 0.38 percent, at 14,606.11. The S.& P. 500 index gained 6.29 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,559.98. The Nasdaq composite index was up 6.38 points, or 0.20 percent, at 3,224.98.
Among the latest comments from Fed officials, Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Fed, suggested the program to stimulate the economy would continue for at least a few more months. Charles Evans, head of the Chicago Fed, said rates could stay at rock bottom until the unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent. The rate was 7.7 percent in February.
The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, opened the door to an interest rate cut as soon as next month.
The retailer Best Buy rose 16.1 percent, to $25.13, after saying it would offer a 30 percent discount on Apple iPad 3 tablets in the United States.
Shares of Facebook rose 3.1 percent, to $27.07, after the company introduced applications that let users display versions of their Facebook newsfeed and messages on the home screen of a wide range of devices based on Google's Android system.
Analysts said Facebook's move could divert users from Google's services. Its shares fell 1.4 percent, to $795.07.
The report about jobless claims was the latest bit of disappointing economic news. Claims jumped to 385,000 in the latest week, confounding expectations that claims would drop by 7,000, to 350,000.
Friday's labor report was expected to show 200,000 jobs were created last month, according to a Reuters survey. The unemployment rate was expected to remain at 7.7 percent.
Earnings forecasts have declined heading into first-quarter reports, which are set to begin next week with Alcoa. S.& P. 500 earnings are expected to rise just 1.6 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from a Jan. 1 growth forecast of 4.3 percent.
If a majority of results beats expectations, as has been the trend, ''There's a good chance we could see the markets resume their upward trend,'' said Mr. Jankovskis.

HEADLINE: Obama's Fund-Raising Trip Becomes Forum on Pipeline

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; John M. Broder contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Appearing at the home of an outspoken critic of the Keystone XL pipeline, President Obama on Wednesday night told a group of high-dollar donors that the politics of the environment ''are tough.''
Mr. Obama appears to be leaning toward the approval of the pipeline, although he did not specifically mention it to the donors. But he acknowledged that it is hard to sell aggressive environmental action -- like reducing pollution from power plants -- to Americans who are still struggling in a difficult economy to pay bills, buy gas and save for retirement. 
''You may be concerned about the temperature of the planet, but it's probably not rising to your No. 1 concern,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And if people think, well, that's shortsighted, that's what happens when you're struggling to get by.''
Mr. Obama delivered his remarks to a group that hardly needs to worry economically: Thomas F. Steyer, the hedge-fund billionaire, and his wife, Kat Taylor, along with 100 guests at their home who each paid $5,000 to $32,400. The event was the first of four over two days in Northern California, the president's first fund-raising drive in hopes of winning a friendlier Congress in 2014.
On Thursday, Mr. Obama wound up his trip with a fund-raiser in suburban Atherton, where he ran through his usual agenda: immigration, gun control and greater investment infrastructure. But his comments about Kamala D. Harris,the California attorney general, drew the most notice on the Internet.
''She is brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough. And she is exactly what you'd want in anybody who is administering the law, and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake,'' the president said. ''She also happens to be by far the best-looking attorney general in the country.''
As for the pipeline, the State Department, which has jurisdiction over the project because it crosses an international border, will hold a public hearing on an environmental impact statement, on April 18 in Grand Island, Neb. The review process for the pipeline, which would carry heavy crude oil from Alberta's tar sands to refineries on the Gulf Coast, is expected to last until summer.
The challenge for Mr. Obama is to find a way to balance the political demands of supporters like Mr. Steyer, who has criticized the pipeline, with the insistence of Republicans, Canadian officials and some unions that the pipeline will create jobs and lower the cost of fuel in the United States. The president also faces pressure from some members of his party who argue that the economic benefits of the pipeline are too important to ignore. Last month, 17 Democratic senators signed on to an amendment backing construction of the pipeline. Included in the group were seven senators from conservative or swing states who are up for re-election in 2014.
In the face of those pressures, at the fund-raiser on Wednesday -- and at a second one at the home of the billionaire philanthropists Ann and Gordon Getty -- the president sought to reassure his supporters that he would continue to fight for environmentally friendly policies.
''Despite a very aggressive agenda on the other side to block action, we've been able to double fuel-efficiency standards on cars,'' Mr. Obama said at Mr. Steyer's home. ''We've been able to take mercury out of our air. We have been able to reduce carbon emissions in this country and have made not only this a healthier place to live, but have also begun to address in a serious way one of the biggest challenges of our time, and that is the challenge of climate change.''
Later, at the Getty home, the president said the political debate needs to ''break out of this notion that somehow there's a contradiction between us being good stewards of the environment and us growing this economy.''
''They are not a contradiction,'' he said. ''We can grow this economy fast and faster if we are seizing the opportunities of the future and not just looking at the energy sources of the past.''
Even as he spoke at the second fund-raiser, about 100 opponents of the pipeline protested outside, waving signs and chanting, ''What do we want from our president? No pipeline for the 1 percent!'' and ''When I say pipeline you say kill! Pipeline! Kill!''
Inside, Mr. Obama told the donors that the best way to assure environmental action is to send more Democrats to Washington, returning the House to Democratic control and putting Representative Nancy Pelosi of California back in the speaker's office.
''If we're going to deal with climate change in a serious way, then we've got to have folks in Congress, even when it's not politically convenient, to talk about it and advocate for it,'' he said.
Earlier in the evening, the president said he was eager to work with Republicans who were willing to compromise. But he said he needed more Democrats to fully achieve an agenda his adversaries were trying to block.

HEADLINE: After Stagnation, a Revival for Mexico's Financial Sector

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- When Banco Santander held the $4.13 billion public stock offering of its Mexico subsidiary here last September, a mariachi band and Mexican folk dancers set the festive mood for a media breakfast in a sun-filled dining room atop the stock exchange's skyscraper.
The offering -- the largest ever in Mexico and trailing only initial public offerings from Facebook and Japan Airlines in terms of size in 2012 -- was just one sign of the strong revival of the nation's financial services sector.
Both global and local banks are jostling to underwrite stock issues. Mexican companies are looking for financing to help expand and make acquisitions. New structured finance products are attracting billions from local pension funds. 
And with the continuing crisis in Europe and lackluster growth hurting the United States and other economies, Mexico's growth prospects are attracting investment banks and investors hunting for ways to gain greater exposure to international markets.
''It's the coming of age of the Mexican market,'' said Eduardo Cepeda, J.P. Morgan's senior country officer.
It is a marked change from just a few years ago, when the loss of manufacturing jobs to China and recession in the United States had left the country's economy stagnant for the better part of a decade.
The current atmosphere is not without risks. For one, the new government has yet to present a convincing plan for tackling organized crime and drug cartels, which carry out kidnappings and gruesome killings that still dominate headlines. And persistent low wages in Mexico also serve to tamp down domestic demand.
Still, changes have taken place to foster optimism in the financial services industry. The new government of President Enrique Peña Nieto, who took office in December, has managed to recast the country's image by moving vigorously on legislation to attack problems that are a drag on growth.
Even before Mr. Peña Nieto took office, prudent policies had whittled away government debt, built up foreign reserves, controlled inflation and stabilized the peso. Growth of about 4 percent in 2011 and again in 2012 outpaced Brazil.
''Investment bankers benefit from upswings and downturns,'' said Mauro Guillén, a professor of international management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ''Everybody is expecting a lot of deals in Mexico.''
The financial services industry is making up for lost time, jumping back into an emerging market that had long been overlooked. The sector's growth is also being helped by an important new player in the local market: Mexico's pension funds, which manage nearly $160 billion in assets. That figure is expected to double over the next six years, according to Carlos Ramírez Fuentes, the president of Consar, the government's pension fund regulator.
''The Mexican financial system is still relatively small,'' Mr. Ramírez said. ''The resources are growing fast, and you need different alternatives for investment.''
Mexico created a pension plan 15 years ago that channels a percentage of each worker's salary into a private fund, run by a manager called an Afore, a Spanish acronym.
For the first decade, Afores were limited to buying government debt. As regulators began to relax the rules, the funds diversified into corporate debt, and then into the stock market and structured finance instruments.
The pension funds continue to ''redefine the capital markets'' in Mexico, said Jaime Martínez-Negrete, the president of Morgan Stanley Mexico, which opened a broker-dealer in late 2010 to serve the local market. ''It's a market that is becoming more deep and broad in its products.''
To attract investment from those pension funds, Mexico's stock market and the finance ministry created a special vehicle, a structured equity security known as a CKD.
The CKD allows investors to buy into a publicly traded fund that typically invests in infrastructure, real estate and private companies. Since they were first created in 2009, there have been 29 issues, worth about $4.8 billion.
A subset of the CKDs has been Mexico's version of real estate investment trusts, known as Fibras. ''There is enormous potential for growth and development for CKDs and Fibras,'' said Gema Sacristán, chief of the financial markets division at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington. ''Mexico's regulators should continue looking for new investment schemes and institutional investors.''
Mexico's stock market is also showing signs of revival, although it is still relatively small compared to Brazil's, its main rival in Latin America. With only a handful of new issues a year or even less, the stock market is worth just 46 percent of gross domestic product, compared with about 150 percent for Brazil, Luis Téllez, the president of the Mexican Stock Exchange, said.
But initial public offerings are showing signs of life. Mr. Téllez said he expected 15 I.P.O.'s this year, although the total amount they raise may be lower than in 2012 because of the size of the Santander deal. Last month, Sempra Energy's Mexico subsidiary raised $600 million in the exchange's third corporate I.P.O. of the year.
Also among this year's offerings was the I.P.O. of Grupo Sanborns, the retail arm of the billionaire Carlos Slim Helú's empire. It sold $950 million in shares to finance expansion.
Both foreign and domestic investors are buying the shares, Mr. Téllez said. ''For foreign investors, it is very reassuring that there are Mexican institutional funds that can also take the paper.''
There are a number of more subtle factors working in favor of more stock offerings, bankers say. One of those is an evolution in the closely held family-owned businesses, which have been reluctant to list or have so few shares floating that they are very illiquid.
Another change may be a move by more multinationals, like Santander and Sempra, to sell shares in their subsidiaries in Mexico, where growth prospects are higher than at home.
Wal-Mart's Mexican subsidiary, for example, which is the country's largest private employer, trades on the Mexican exchange at about double the price-to-earnings ratio that Wal-Mart Stores trades at on the New York Stock Exchange.
''Right now, we have experienced the longest period in three decades of a continuous open window for equities,'' Mr. Martínez-Negrete said.
The market for credit is also growing. After the peso crisis of 1994 sent Mexico's banks into free fall, they were sold off to global banks. But the new owners were conservative about lending in Mexico. The banks are strongly capitalized and have complied with new international standards known as Basel III.
The government's sound finances means it can issue 30-year bonds priced in pesos. Foreign funds are buying along with local ones. ''This shows a lot of confidence in the currency and in the credit of the government,'' Mr. Cepeda said.
For the first time in many years, local companies are generating cash and looking to expand at home and abroad, said Alfredo Capote, the head of investment banking at Banamex, Citigroup's Mexico subsidiary. ''Investors like these stories because there are very few stories of growth and consolidation around the world,'' he said.
At the same time, foreign manufacturers are returning to Mexico as a production platform for the recovering American market. At the top of that list are global automakers, which are investing $10 billion in new assembly plants.
Mexico ''has exported its way to prosperity,'' said William H. Gross, the founder of Pimco, which has been accumulating Mexican sovereign debt over the last 18 months. ''They now own dollars as opposed to owing dollars.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pressure Builds On Rutgers President

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE; Nate Schweber and Steve Eder contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Robert L. Barchi arrived at Rutgers University in September as a man with no time to waste.
Gov. Chris Christie had pushed through a plan to reorganize higher education in the state, and he wanted it done in less than a year. No one knew how much it would cost, but it was clear that Rutgers would have to find a way to pay for it.
As Barchi has pushed toward that goal in his first six months on the job, he has alienated faculty, state legislators and the student body. He has been accused of marginalizing needy students, shortchanging major departments and acting detached and even dismissive.
All this has left Barchi little good will as he finds himself at the center of a Rutgers basketball scandal, with faculty and students asking why he waited for news media outrage to fire Coach Mike Rice, instead of dismissing him when he learned of his abusive behavior last fall. 
Some faculty members have seized on the crisis to call for Barchi's resignation. Others suggest that he was so focused on the merger of Rutgers and the state medical schools that he did not have enough time last fall to consider that Rice's berating of students and throwing basketballs at their heads violated basic university values -- and that the fact it was on video was a disaster waiting to explode.
''What we're struggling with is a president who has a mission that doesn't apparently involve active involvement in university life,'' said Thomas Prusa, a professor of economics. ''Maybe if the president was more tuned in, he would think that we have 58,000 students, 18 to 22 years old, and what exactly is happening? He is throwing balls at students' heads? And he's calling them what? He was not interested in that. He was interested in how do I make this merger work.''
On Thursday, the university continued to draw fire for its handling of Rice. The president of the State Senate, Stephen M. Sweeney, called for the athletic director, Tim Pernetti, to resign. One of Rice's assistants, Jimmy Martelli, resigned Thursday after ESPN reported that he too was on videos berating players and hurling basketballs at them.
As more faculty members signed a letter calling for his resignation, Barchi did not respond to requests for comment, and he canceled a long-scheduled town-hall-style meeting at the Newark campus.
The reorganization of the state's higher education system, passed by the Legislature in June, reflected the sheer force of will of Christie, whose predecessors had tried and failed to pass similar plans.
The chief requirement was the merger of Rutgers and the three schools of the long-troubled University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, attaching two to the Rutgers campus in New Brunswick and one to Camden, by July 1, 2013. Officials argued that having a medical school would raise the prestige of Rutgers, allowing it to attract more grant money, which would make up for chronic funding problems in a state that spends less than most on public higher education.
But the plan was hard fought, with students and faculty protesting it had been done too hastily and legislators warning that no one knew how much it would cost. Trustees signed off on it only reluctantly in November.
Barchi, a physician who had been president of Thomas Jefferson University, a Philadelphia medical school, was considered an ideal person to oversee the merger.
He has put the cost of the merger at $75 million and has said that the university cannot expect help from the state in paying. In meetings with senior administrators, he has argued that the university can make up some of those costs by attracting more out-of-state students, who pay premium tuition.
To lure more enrollees, he wants to raise the average SAT scores of incoming students, which would also raise Rutgers's rankings in the prestigious Association of American Universities. The university's entry into the Big Ten athletic conference, engineered by Pernetti, was another part of that bid for prestige. That bid could have been complicated by the videos of Rice's behavior, which Pernetti first saw last November, just as the university was completing terms with the Big Ten. At the time, Rice was suspended for three games and fined $50,000, a punishment that critics now view as far too soft.
On Thursday, as rumors of high-level resignations swirled on campus, some Rutgers donors stood behind the university's leaders, reaching out to board members to voice their support.
Steven Plofker, a real estate developer and donor, said that while Rice ''clearly stepped over a bunch of boundaries that are unacceptable,'' Barchi and Pernetti deserved another chance.
In New Brunswick, faculty members complain that in trying to pay for the merger, Barchi froze hiring in the school of arts and sciences, the largest faculty on campus.
His first town hall meeting with students, in late February, got terrible reviews in the student newspaper, which reported that he spent most of the time discussing the merger and almost none taking questions from students, and that he dismissed concerns about student debt.
The bid for prestige has set off alarms particularly at the Newark campus, where average SAT scores are lower, but students routinely outperform predicted graduation rates. Newark has some of the programs that Rutgers needs to remain a research university -- the business school and a law school among them. But faculty say Barchi wants to turn it into a satellite campus so that Rutgers would not have to count its students' SAT scores in the average.
Barchi has announced plans to merge the law schools in Camden and Newark under one banner. The university is also building a new business school attached to the New Brunswick campus. It is circulating plans to move many of Newark's neuroscience programs to New Brunswick, and to eliminate the Graduate School in Newark, moving its strongest programs to a new, larger school in New Brunswick.
The reorganization law was supposed to give Newark and Camden a more equitable share of money, requiring that each get separate line item in the state budget. But Barchi's administration submitted one number for Rutgers in the state budget, and inserted a provision that would void the requirement for separate funding for Newark and Camden. Officials in Camden and Newark say they were barely consulted, if at all.
''The number of things that have been done without even consulting senior leadership on campus is endlessly frustrating,'' said Jack Lynch, the associate dean of Arts and Science in Newark.
Barchi's initial strategic plan for the university designates the mission of Newark as ''diversity,'' the mission for New Brunswick as ''research,'' and Camden as ''service.'' That he is shortchanging Newark, faculty members say, suggests he does not care about diversity.
''To propose to defund and destabilize the most diverse campus in the country is unconscionable, especially one with the level of success of Rutgers-Newark,'' said Maggie Shiffrar, dean of the Graduate School in Newark.
''I think he's in a really tough financial bind,'' she said. ''He's made it very very clear that he wants Rutgers to move up in the rankings. How do you do that when you not only have to do things that are expensive, but you're not getting money to cover those expenses?''
The fear about diversity was fanned last month when Barchi met with a Latino faculty advisory group in New Brunswick. When a professor expressed her frustration as a ''female of color'' at Rutgers, he replied that he had experienced similar or worse difficulties as a white man early in his career, because departments wanted to hire minorities.
The meeting prompted about 100 faculty members to sign a letter of protest.

HEADLINE: Saudi Foothold in Texas

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
PORT ARTHUR, Tex. -- It is hard to imagine the desert sands of the Persian Gulf being any farther away than from this swampy refinery port known for Cajun food, sport fishing and being the birthplace of Janis Joplin.
But right in the middle of town stands a strategic outpost for Saudi Arabia's global ambitions, although one that the Saudis appear loath to publicize.
The giant Motiva oil refinery, which just completed a $10 billion expansion that makes it the largest processor of gasoline, diesel and other petroleum products in the United States, is owned by Saudi Aramco and Royal Dutch Shell in a 50-50 partnership.
Saudi Aramco's investment in the refinery expansion is meant to ensure that Saudi Arabia will retain an important market for its crude in the United States at a time when American politicians are declaring their intention to wean the country off imported oil. Adding to the urgency for the Saudis is the fact that the United States is vastly increasing its production and replacing OPEC crude with that from oil sands in Canada. 
The expansion of the Port Arthur refinery comes during a particularly complicated period in United States-Saudi relations, as the two countries try to manage changes sweeping the Arab world. While Riyadh has cracked down on dissent and generally resisted efforts to spread democracy in the region, the Obama administration has been less resistant to the changes.
But the Saudis have helped the United States and the global economy by increasing exports to moderate oil prices and top up worldwide supplies as the West applies sanctions against Iran. Saudi Arabia has been able to tap into its spare capacity, mostly lower-quality heavy sour crudes, to stretch its exports. Most refineries cannot easily process those crude oils, but the expanded Motiva refinery here can, freeing other Saudi grades for other markets.
''The Saudis are securing a home for their heavy crude,'' said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. ''But there is no question that security is also part of the equation. In Saudi Arabia, oil and politics always mix.''
The refinery expansion, which has had its share of cost overruns and mishaps, is nothing if not mammoth. It contains a million feet of pipe and a thousand miles of instrument cables; 63,000 concrete pilings were driven into the swamplands to stabilize the skyscraping distillation and heating towers.
But what is almost hidden at this marvel of chemical engineering is the critical Saudi Arabian presence, aside from a couple of Saudi Aramco coffee-table books on display in the executive offices and a pair of Saudi and Saudi Aramco flags inside the refinery's small museum. Tucked away in an administration building, the museum also includes photographs of some visiting Saudi Aramco executives. Only a couple of Saudi trainees work at the plant, which has roughly 2,000 employees and contractors.
''They want to be relevant but invisible,'' Lawrence J. Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, which is partly financed by the oil industry, said of the Saudis.
He added, ''The Motiva relationship guarantees the Saudis an important but subtle footprint in the United States, and they want to have some negotiating strength when geopolitical issues in the Middle East and elsewhere arise.''
The importance of the refinery to Saudi Arabia has been underscored by Khalid Al-Falih, Saudi Aramco's president and chief executive, who has visited the refinery twice in the last year and is scheduled to come back again in a few months.
''Our commitment to this market is unwavering,'' he told energy executives at the IHS-CERA energy conference in Houston in March shortly after his most recent visit.
Brett D. Woltjen, the refinery's production manager, said that Mr. Al-Falih did not come with much fanfare.
''He does have his team of people but it's small,'' he said. ''It doesn't feel like we're being invaded.''
Saudi Aramco is already the world's biggest oil company with monopoly rights over Saudi Arabia's 260 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and the world's fourth-largest natural gas reserves. But with the Motiva refinery's increased capacity, the Saudi company is also now well on its way to achieving its goal of surpassing Exxon Mobil as the world's largest refiner in the next few years, with joint ventures in places like China, South Korea, India and the Netherlands.
As the central tool of the Saudi Kingdom's economic and foreign policy, Saudi Aramco, with its broadening reach in global refining and petrochemical markets, can enhance Saudi influence in China and other emerging global centers while it profits from selling finished products that fetch higher prices than crude oil.
When the decision to invest in the refinery expansion was made in 2007, Port Arthur looked like a sure bet to refine more Saudi oil. Production of similar Venezuelan and Mexican grades of crude was falling while American demand for gasoline was growing. But over the last three years, domestic United States oil production has been booming, thanks to new drilling technologies, and imports of crudes from Canadian oil sands have been soaring.
Imports of Saudi oil dropped from 1.8 million barrels a day in 2003 to just over 1 million barrels a day in 2010, replaced primarily by Canadian oil that over the same seven years increased from 2 million to 2.8 million barrels.
Despite the changing market conditions, the Motiva expansion is helping to stem the decline of Saudi imports, which revived last year to 1.4 million barrels a day largely because of a buildup of storage for the refinery.
Now the Motiva refinery, like others around the Gulf of Mexico, needs to deal with the problem of slumping demand for gasoline in the United States, the result in part of the flat economy and increasingly efficient cars.
But Motiva executives said they, like their competitors, were prepared to export much of their production, especially diesel to Latin America where the market is growing.
Saudi Aramco first invested in the Port Arthur refinery in 1989 as part of a broader deal with Texaco, giving the Saudi company a half-interest in Texaco refineries and gasoline stations in 33 states.
Saudi officials acknowledged publicly at the time that their goal was to become the United States' No. 1 source of imported oil, a position they would alternate with Mexico and Venezuela over the next decade.
In 2002, after Texaco was purchased by Chevron, its stake in what became known as Motiva Enterprises was bought by Shell and Saudi Refining, a subsidiary of Saudi Aramco. Today, Motiva also has two refineries in Louisiana and markets its production through a network of 7,700 Shell-branded gasoline stations across the United States.
Motiva's crown jewel is its refinery here. The expansion allowed the facility to refine various varieties of crude oil and more than doubled its production capacity to 600,000 barrels a day of diesel, gasoline, jet fuel and other products.
The refinery is designed primarily to refine various grades of Saudi crude and crudes that Shell produces in the Gulf of Mexico, but it has the flexibility to process crude from Canadian oil sands and from other American and Latin American fields. (The proposed Keystone XL pipeline being considered by the Obama administration would connect the Canadian oil sands fields to Port Arthur, a major refinery hub.)
But the expansion did not come without problems, or without causing friction between Shell and Saudi Aramco executives over cost overruns, financing and other issues. Shortly after the expansion was completed last spring, a chemical leak and fire in a new distillation unit designed to process 325,000 barrels of crude a day sidelined much of the new facility until January. The unit came back up to its intended capacity in late February.
Saudi Aramco declined to comment on the refinery or the company's relationship with Motiva Enterprises. But in an interview, Robert W. Pease, Motiva's president and chief executive, praised the Saudi commitment to supplying oil to the United States.
''The fact that Saudi Arabia continues to supply crude into the United States -- even during periods when market pricing in the East suggests more should have gone there -- is beneficial to the American customer,'' he said.
Mr. Pease answers to a board that consists of Shell and Saudi Aramco executives.
''We've had some challenging issues,'' Mr. Pease said. ''How do you fund this project? What are the expectations? And, we have some robust dialogue.'' But he added that ''I think the relationship has gotten stronger.''
Saudi Aramco and Shell keep the commercial terms of their agreement confidential.
''Trying to get into any rights, sales rights or obligations, or any of those, I couldn't begin to talk about it,'' Mr. Pease said.
But several experts say that Motiva guarantees that a large amount of Saudi oil will be imported. They also say that Saudi Aramco discounts Saudi crude sales to Motiva through various accounting adjustments and credit lines with generous terms.
''The Saudis are going to have to keep discounting the crude for the joint venture to buy it,'' said David L. Goldwyn, who served as the State Department's coordinator for international energy affairs in the first Obama administration. ''That makes it probably first a Saudi geopolitical asset by guaranteeing some market share even at a discounted price.''

Previews and Openings
'The Assembled Parties' (in previews; opens on April 17) Nobody could accuse Richard Greenberg of slacking this season. Within weeks of unveiling his take on ''Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' and a month ahead of the ''Far From Heaven'' musical adaptation for which he wrote the book, Mr. Greenberg introduces this new work. Directed by Lynne Meadow for Manhattan Theater Club, it focuses on a well-heeled Upper West Side Jewish family whose stability is threatened at the dawn of the 21st century. The cast includes Jessica Hecht, Judith Light and Jeremy Shamos. Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (David Rooney) 
'The Big Knife' (in previews; opens on April 16) Following last year's sterling revival of ''Golden Boy,'' the Clifford Odets appreciation season continues with this production from Roundabout Theater Company. The caustic 1949 work drew on Odets's firsthand experience as a Hollywood screenwriter to observe the machinations behind the studio management of a star embroiled in a scandal that threatens to end his career. Doug Hughes directs an ensemble headed by Bobby Cannavale and Marin Ireland, along with the veterans Richard Kind and Chip Zien. American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Rooney)
'The Call' (in previews; opens on April 14) No, it's not a stage version of the Halle Berry girl-in-peril movie. Tanya Barfield's politically charged drama concerns a couple whose choice to adopt a child from Africa prompts them to question their identity as white Americans. Leigh Silverman directs the co-production between Playwrights Horizons and Primary Stages, with a strong cast that includes Kelly AuCoin, Kerry Butler, Eisa Davis, Crystal A. Dickinson and Russell G. Jones. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'Collapse' (previews start on Sunday; opens on April 16) As the title suggests, Allison Moore's comedy depicts a world falling apart. Widely produced at theaters across the country over the past two years, the play centers on four middle-class people trapped when the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River in 2007, their woes further fueled by the global financial crisis the next year, post-traumatic stress disorder and sex addiction. The production comes courtesy of the Women's Project, with Jackson Gay directing. New York City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Rooney)
'The Dance of Death' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on April 18) A New York company whose mission is to shake the starch out of classical theater, Red Bull presents this new Strindberg adaptation by Mike Poulton, best known for his 2003 take on Turgenev's ''Fortune's Fool.'' Joseph Hardy directs Daniel Davis, Laila Robins and Derek Smith in the savage battle of wills that ensues when a figure from the past intrudes on the sour marriage of a military captain and a former actress on an isolated island. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, redbulltheater.com. (Rooney)
'Here Lies Love' (in previews; opens on April 23) You were expecting a conventional bio-musical from a creative team that includes the maverick musicians David Byrne and Fatboy Slim, the director Alex Timbers and the choreographer Annie-B Parson? Exploring the abuse of power, this show deconstructs the journey of the Filipina first lady and shoe hoarder Imelda Marcos as an immersive dance-club experience. The audience stands throughout, weaving among the performers in a 360-degree scenic and video environment. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Rooney)
'I'll Eat You Last: A Chat With Sue Mengers' (previews start on Friday; opens on April 24) One fabulous larger-than-life broad who blazed through the 1970s takes on another in this solo vehicle by John Logan (''Red''), fresh off rejuvenating the James Bond franchise with his screenplay for ''Skyfall.'' Though fans can lament that Bette Midler won't be singing in her first Broadway appearance in more than 30 years, Miss M should find ample scope for her irrepressible wit in this portrait of the legendary Hollywood superagent, renowned for her stellar client list, her parties, her caftans and her sailor-mouth vocabulary. Joe Mantello directs. Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Jekyll & Hyde' (previews start on Friday; opens on April 18) The indefatigable composer Frank Wildhorn was a short-term tenant on Broadway with ''Wonderland'' and ''Bonnie & Clyde.'' But this show, with a book and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse, ran for almost four years in its 1997 production and went on to play across the globe. Starring as Robert Louis Stevenson's 19th-century London medic with the dangerous personality disorder is Constantine Maroulis, with Deborah Cox as the kindhearted prostitute Lucy. Directed and choreographed by Jeff Calhoun, the production plays a limited 13-week engagement at the end of its national tour. Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway at West 46th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Rooney)
'Julius Caesar' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on April 12) Gregory Doran, the recently appointed artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, conceived this fresh twist on the political tragedy after reading margin annotations in a copy of the text passed around by prisoners on Robben Island, among them Nelson Mandela. Performed by an all-black British cast and featuring live contemporary West African music composed by Akintayo Akinbode, this reinterpretation traces parallels between ancient Rome and Africa's turbulent history over the past half-century. Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Rooney)
'The Last Will' (previews start on Friday; opens on April 17) Austin Pendleton directs this final chapter in Robert Brustein's trilogy examining the life of William Shakespeare, presented by the Abingdon Theater Company. Following ''Mortal Terror'' and ''The English Channel,'' the play speculates on the mysteries of Shakespeare's later years back in Stratford. It posits that a fatal illness clouded his ability to distinguish fact from fiction, prompting him to accuse his neglected wife of cuckolding him with his brother, while Richard Burbage urged the addled playwright to return to London and resume working. June Havoc Theater, Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-2055, abingdontheatre.org. (Rooney)
'Macbeth' (previews start on Sunday; opens on April 21) Two figures clinically survey the action, but the speaking roles are the exclusive domain of Alan Cumming in this feverish reimagining of the Scottish play as the obsessive torment of a haunted psychiatric patient. The Tony-winning director John Tiffany (''Once'') and Andrew Goldberg (''The Bomb-itty of Errors'') stage the audacious National Theater of Scotland production, seen briefly in New York last summer at the Lincoln Center Festival. It lands on Broadway for 73 performances, giving a wider audience the chance to watch the polysexual Mr. Cumming ply his erotic skills on himself as an incentive for murder. Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Matilda the Musical' (in previews; opens on Thursday) This musical take on Roald Dahl's beloved 1988 children's novel features four young actresses each having a go at Matilda, the telekinetic little girl with beastly parents and an even worse headmistress, Miss Trunchbull (Bertie Carvel, in his Broadway debut, repeating his best actor Olivier Award-winning London performance). A draw for the parents may be Tim Minchin, an Australian musician and comedian who wrote the music and lyrics. Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Eric Grode)
'Motown: the Musical' (in previews; opens on April 14) He has been a boxer, a record store owner and perhaps the greatest hit-making producer of all time, so why shouldn't Berry Gordy add Broadway book writer to his résumé? He has a decent safety net in the form of the peerless Motown song catalog, which includes several tunes he had a part in writing. Expect to see and hear Smokey, Diana, Marvin and many, many, many others, all directed by Charles Randolph-Wright and supported by a relatively luxurious 18-piece orchestra. Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Grode)
'The Nance' (in previews; opens on April 15) A stock figure of traditional burlesque, the nance was a stereotypical sissy usually played by a heterosexual performer. That's not the case in Douglas Carter Beane's new play, which stars Nathan Lane in the title role of a man juggling his career as a beloved stage headliner with a messy secret life in the gay underground of 1930s New York. Jack O'Brien directs an ensemble that reunites Mr. Lane with his ''Producers'' cast mate Cady Huffman. Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Nikolai and the Others' (in previews; opens on May 6) The always inventive David Cromer directs a large cast that includes Blair Brown, Michael Cerveris, Alvin Epstein, Kathryn Erbe, John Glover and Stephen Kunken in this latest excursion into history from Richard Nelson. Set in Westport, Conn., during a spring weekend in 1948, the play considers the questionable ways in which American art was financed at the start of the cold war. It focuses on a gathering of Russian émigrés, among them George Balanchine and Igor Stravinsky, retracing the roots of their collaboration on the ballet ''Orpheus.'' Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Orphans' (in previews; opens on April 18) Alec Baldwin returns to Broadway post-''30 Rock,'' flanked by Ben Foster and Tom Sturridge in Lyle Kessler's 1983 drama about two almost feral brothers holed up alone in a run-down North Philadelphia row house, and the wealthy kidnapped criminal who becomes a surrogate father to them. A week into rehearsals the production made headlines when Shia LaBeouf abruptly exited after backstage disagreements; Mr. Foster stepped in to take his place. Daniel Sullivan directs. Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Pippin' (in previews; opens on April 25) The 1970s redux on Broadway didn't fare well last season, with neither ''Godspell'' nor ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' sticking around long. But Diane Paulus managed to make the countercultural relic ''Hair'' feel vital and relevant in her thrilling 2009 revival. She might also be the right person to give a fresh take on Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson's 1972 show about a restless royal heir seeking his ''Corner of the Sky.'' First seen at the American Repertory Theater, where Ms. Paulus is artistic director, the show features Matthew James Thomas, Patina Miller, Terrence Mann, Charlotte d'Amboise and Andrea Martin, with circus and acrobatic elements created by Gypsy Snider of the Montreal-based troupe 7 Fingers. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'The Testament of Mary' (in previews; opens on April 22) Before it became a searing novella, the Irish author Colm Toibin's eloquently humanized first-person account of the post-Crucifixion years of Mary, mother of Jesus, was an acclaimed monologue performed at the Dublin Theater Festival in 2011 by Marie Mullan under the direction of Garry Hynes. This new production, starring Fiona Shaw, is the latest chapter in the long and fruitful creative partnership between Ms. Shaw and the director Deborah Warner, whose work together was last seen on Broadway in a blazing ''Medea'' in 2002. Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'The Trip to Bountiful' (in previews; opens on April 23) The director Michael Wilson has a distinguished history staging the work of Horton Foote, most recently with ''Dividing the Estate'' and ''The Orphans' Home Cycle.'' In his production of Foote's 1953 drama, Cicely Tyson returns to Broadway for the first time in 30 years to play Carrie Watts, a role that has won acclaim for Lillian Gish, Geraldine Page and Lois Smith. The lead character is an elderly Texas woman determined to make one final journey to her hometown, against the wishes of her family. Starring alongside Ms. Tyson are Cuba Gooding Jr., Vanessa Williams, Condola Rashad and Tom Wopat. Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
Broadway
'Ann' Holland Taylor wrote and stars in this solo show about Ann Richards, the straight-shooting onetime governor of Texas. Ms. Taylor's engaging performance goes beyond impersonation, though the script is neither a dramatically shapely piece of writing nor a deeply probing character study (1:55). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, lct.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may occasionally feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Breakfast at Tiffany's' Holly Golightly does not. Go lightly, that is. Everyone in this lugubrious stage adaptation of Truman Capote's beloved 1958 novella gives the impression that what they're doing onstage is hard labor. Sean Mathias directs Richard Greenberg's adaptation with a cast that includes Cory Michael Smith, George Wendt and as Holly, Emilia Clarke (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Hands on a Hardbody' A daring new musical that burrows into the hearts of average men and women facing fierce economic headwinds: a cross-section of Texans vying to win a Nissan in a grueling endurance test. The terrific score, by Trey Anastasio (of Phish) and Amanda Green, locks into an authentic roots-rock groove and hugs it tight, even if the show cannot always surmount the linear nature of its story (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Lucky Guy' Nora Ephron's elegy and valentine to the rough-and-tumble of big-city newsrooms and scoop-hungry reporters, starring Tom Hanks as the columnist Michael McAlary, is written with a true fan's avidity. Directed with bells and whistles by George C. Wolfe, this is less a fully developed play than a boisterous swapping of fond anecdotes about the end of a life and the end of an era (2:00). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella' This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us ''Oklahoma!,'' has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Portraying a woman mired in what appears to be a permanent midlife crisis, the marvelous comic actor Kristine Nielsen provides much of the laughing gas in Christopher Durang's uneven but intermittently delightful riff on Chekhovian themes. David Hyde Pierce and Sigourney Weaver also star in Nicholas Martin's production, smoothly transferred from a sellout run Off Broadway (2:30).

Off Broadway
&#x2605; 'All in the Timing' One of the zestier plates of theatrical tapas to be had. This 20th-anniversary production of David Ives's popular anthology of mini-plays, directed by John Rando, leaves you feeling lighter, but not emptier. There's nutrition in these sketches about (gulp!) relativity and randomness, and surprising substance in their silliness. Carson Elrod leads a bouncy cast (1:45). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Belleville' Amy Herzog's sensationally good new drama is both a nail-biting psychological thriller and a keenly observed -- and ultimately heart-rending -- portrait of a young couple (the terrific Maria Dizzia and Greg Keller) whose marriage suddenly begins to unravel under the pressure of secrets and lies. Anne Kauffman directs the flawless production (1:35). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org. (Isherwood)
'Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale of Musical Mystery' Charles Busch livens up this fun adaptation of the kid's novel about a family enduring some turmoil after adopting a rabbit that may be a vampire (1:05). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, dr2theatre.com. (Jason Zinoman)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'Donnybrook!' This revival of Johnny Burke and Robert E. McEnroe's 1961 musical (itself an adaptation of ''The Quiet Man,'' the 1952 St. Patrick's Day perennial about an Irish-American boxer's fraught courtship of a redheaded spitfire), jettisons the most dated, disturbing and indulgent elements of the movie but retains the essential sentimental blarney. With a fine cast and crisp direction by Charlotte Moore, the result is as fresh as a morning after rain in the west of Ireland (2:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Andy Webster)
'A Dream Play' This National Asian-American Theater Company production, adapted by Sung Rno and the director Andrew Pang, never really finds its footing with this thorny Strindberg drama (1:25). Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101, here.org.(Claudia La Rocco)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Webster)
'Fuenteovejuna' Sometimes, when your boss starts raping and pillaging in the office, the grunts just have to beat him to death with a calculator. If that premise is confusing, so is the rest of a new adaptation of this 17th-century classic play, about a gallant Spanish town that rose up and killed its tyrannical overlord but refused to implicate anyone in his death. The production retains its original Spanish (with English captions) but has been poorly grafted onto a modern-day office setting (1:20). In Spanish with English subtitles. Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 225-9999, repertorio.org. (Catherine Rampell)
'Happy Birthday' Written by Anita Loos in 1946 as a vehicle for Helen Hayes and now revived by the Actors Company Theater, this rather endearingly madcap romantic comedy suffers from a boilerplate narrative (and now, no Helen Hayes) (1:40). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (La Rocco)
'Hit the Wall' Ike Holter's impassioned evocation of the Stonewall Riots and Eric Hoff's vigorous production are strongest when stylized interpretation eclipses conventional realism. The drama is being staged just a stone's throw from Christopher Park in Greenwich Village where the events depicted occurred, amplifying the historical echoes of the June night in 1969 when drag queens, gay men and lesbians pushed back during a routine police raid. While the freewheeling play traffics in stereotype and anachronism with mixed results, it adopts a vernacular that speaks sincerely and directly to today's gay youth, inviting them to honor the earlier generation that broke the chains of marginalization and invisibility (1:35). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, smarttix.com, (212) 868-4444. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Honky' This daffy take on race by Greg Kalleres may have been more cutting edge about 25 years ago, but it's still hilarious. A teenager is killed for his trendy sneakers, and everybody associated with the shoe -- the designer, the guy who created the advertising campaign, the president of the shoe company -- has to come to grips with issues of attitude and perception. Oh, and along the way someone invents a pill to cure racism (1:45). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, urbanstages.org. (Neil Genzlinger)
'The Last Five Years' Jason Robert Brown has mounted a stylish production of his two-character musical about the waxing and waning of young love. Adam Kantor and Betsy Wolfe play aspiring artists whose paths diverge. Their story is told in songs that are skillfully written but, like his characters, are on the generic side (1:25). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)
'Love in the Time of Cholera' Directed by José Zayas and performed by an efficient four-actor crew, Caridad Svich's adaptation of the Gabriel García Márquez novel is pleasing but lightweight. A production cannot live on romance alone. In Spanish with subtitles (2:00). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 889-2850, repertorio.org. (La Rocco)
'The Madrid' Edie Falco, whose face usually seems like an open window, pulls down the blinds in Liz Flahive's muted, murky play about a runaway kindergarten teacher, directed by Leigh Silverman. Ms. Flahive has a poet's hand for echoing imagery. But this production often feels paralyzed in its contemplation of the mystery of everyday lives (2:10). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Brantley)
'The Mound Builders' The director Jo Bonney's revival of Lanford Wilson's 1975 work, about the relationships among an archaeologist and his family and associates, mostly lacks the emotionally nuanced performances the play's delicate textures require (2:15). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Much Ado About Nothing' The splendid Jonathan Cake is an exuberant, witty Benedick opposite Maggie Siff's Beatrice in an otherwise mostly zest-free production of Shakespeare's romantic comedy, directed by Arin Arbus for Theater for a New Audience (2:40). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, dukeon42.org. (Isherwood)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Zinoman)
&#x2605; 'Old Hats' Bill Irwin and David Shiner, the peerless neo-vaudevillian jesters behind the long-running hit ''Fool Moon,'' have concocted a winning new compendium of nifty clown routines. The pixie-ish singer-songwriter Nellie McKay makes for a perfect musical foil in this ebullient, thoroughly charming variety show (1:50). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Passion' Staged by John Doyle, a minimalist with a scalpel, this hypnotic revival of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's musical study of love beyond reason comes across as a pulsing collective fever dream, while reminding us that startling clarity can come from such dreams. Ryan Silverman, Judy Kuhn and Melissa Errico expertly embody the show's compelling central triangle (1:45). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Revisionist' As a Polish Holocaust survivor in Jesse Eisenberg's somewhat implausible new play, Vanessa Redgrave reminds us why she's considered the greatest actress of her generation. She inhabits her character with precision and authority, making us feel like humble, privileged trespassers in an exotic world. Mr. Eisenberg almost holds his own portraying her graceless young American cousin (1:45). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Brantley)
'Shaheed: The Dream and Death of Benazir Bhutto' Anna Khaja plays eight characters in her one-woman show that mixes fact and fiction to understand the complicated, contradictory person that was Benazir Bhutto. Ms. Khaja, who wrote the script, is a better actress than writer, and some of the characters seem thin. Still the show reminds us of why Bhutto was so interesting (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, cultureproject.org. (Saltz)
&#x2605; 'Talley's Folly' Danny Burstein and Sarah Paulson give performances of translucent feeling in this loving Roundabout Theater Company revival of Lanford Wilson's 1979 romantic pas de deux about two misfits in 1944 Missouri trying to find a mutual rhythm. Directed with sympathy and insight by Michael Wilson (1:35). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Women of Will' Mixing casually delivered scholarly exposition with intensely rendered performance, this impassioned exploration of Shakespeare's heroines by Tina Packer traces their evolution through their language. When Ms. Packer and her co-star, Nigel Gore, get down to the business of acting, it's not just poetry in motion, it's thought made flesh. Eric Tucker directs (2:30).

&#x2605; 'Clown Bar' This goofy but very funny homage to noir films and pulp novels finds a cop up against a crew of demented clowns (1:10). Parkside Lounge, 317 East Houston Street, East Village, (800) 838-3006, www.pipelinetheatre.org. (Ken Jaworowski)
'Detroit '67' Dominique Morisseau's overly tidy drama uses the riots that plagued the title city as a background to formulaic stories about a brother and a sister at odds and an interracial romance (1:15). National Black Theater, 2031 Fifth Avenue, near 125th Street, East Harlem, classicaltheatreofharlem.org, (866) 811-4111. (Isherwood)
'Geek!' Crystal Skillman's fantasia about two girls at an Ohio anime convention on a quest to meet a comic artist is a heartfelt valentine to fandom. This production is also a riot of visual invention, though the story only grazes deeper themes. Nevertheless, the always interesting Ms. Skillman remains a talent to watch (1:20). Incubator Arts Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, incubatorarts.org. (Webster)
&#x2605; 'The Norwegians' There is every chance that C. Denby Swanson wrote this odd, dark, profane comedy -- about really sweet Scandinavian hit men in Minnesota and the young women who hire them -- after falling asleep during ''Fargo.'' But this low-budget guilty pleasure delivers solid laughs while making fun (in mostly nice ways) of various ethnicities and American states. And one actress demonstrates how good Mary-Louise Parker might be as a stand-up comic (1:30). Drilling Company Theater, 236 West 78th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Gates)
&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00). Wednesdays only. Duplex Cabaret Theater, 61 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, pattiissues.brownpapertickets.com. (Rooney)
'Saga' This wonderfully theatrical puppet show, about the human impact of the financial crisis in Iceland, loses some of its power when it turns dark and violent (1:05). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (866) 811-4111, wakkawakka.org. (Zinoman)
'The Sister' Eric John Meyer's 70-minute play -- about a husband (Jeb Kreager) who verbally abuses his wife, Leanne (Alley Scott), and sister-in-law (Erin Mallon) -- may be intended as a dark comedy. But despite moments of absurdist wit, it feels more like a domestic hothouse of spleen and invective (1:10). Fourth Street Theater, 83 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, dutchkillstheater.com. (Webster)
&#x2605; 'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended. A guided tour of Wonderland, created by Third Rail Projects, leads its participants through a series of rooms and an interactive evening of dance, poetry, food and drink (2:00).

'Totally Tubular Time Machine' This show is less a play or musical than a big, campy, drinking party, with a little bit of singing thrown in. Held at an '80s-theme dance club in Midtown, it features celebrity impersonators who wander through the crowd handing out party favors (lollipops from Katy Perry, trucker hats from Justin Bieber) and taking turns at karaoke. The impersonations come with varying degrees of similitude and singing talent (2:00). Saturdays only. Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com. (Rampell)

Last Chance
&#x2605; 'The Flick' (closes on Sunday) The new play from the terrifically gifted Annie Baker (''Circle Mirror Transformation,'' ''The Aliens'') is a typically keenly observed and compassionate portrait of the emotional and ethical complications that arise in the relationships among three employees of a dumpy rural movie theater.

&#x2605; 'For Love' (closes on Friday) Three women in their 30s contend with love (or the lack of it) in this riotously tart and fiercely energetic dramedy set in Dublin. The performances and pungent, expletive-laden dialogue, delivered in the taut cadences of the north Dublin suburbs, drive the production, which, yes, offers romance (however fleeting) and plenty of laughs (1:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Webster)
'Forever Dusty' (closes on Sunday) If Kristen Holly Smith turned up to your costume party in Dusty Springfield drag and started singing, there would be no mistaking the woman she was channeling. But doing a passable impersonation is a far cry from capturing the essence of one of the most distinctive female vocalists of all time, as this amateurish inflated cabaret act demonstrates. This misconceived bio-musical is a soulless tribute to the platinum-haired, panda-eyed queen of white soul (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, foreverdusty.net.

&#x2605; 'Saint Joan' (closes on Saturday) With just four actors playing 24 characters, Bedlam's wonderfully high-spirited production of Shaw's 1920 semi-tragedy leads its audience into, out of and all over the space. Eric Taylor's inventive direction and the four superb performers make it well worth the schlep. Running in repertory with the Bedlam company's ''Hamlet'' (3:00).

HEADLINE: Statutory Rape, Twitter and a Generational Divide

BYLINE: By VIVIAN YEE

 BODY:
TORRINGTON, Conn. -- Two 18-year-old high school football players had been arrested, accused of the statutory rape of two 13-year-old girls. Their friends then rallied to their defense, attacking the girls on Twitter. And so, when the Twitter posts brought national condemnation to this old mill town, the principal of Torrington High School decided it was time to appeal to her students' better natures.
In her note on March 22, the principal, Joanne R. Creedon, urged the students to ''get that spotlight on the good.'' Among other student-sponsored good deeds, she said, the Interact Club was holding a dodgeball tournament for charity that Friday. ''Come out for one of these events, have fun, and show everyone what T.H.S. is really about,'' she wrote.
The dodgeball tournament seemed to go off without a hitch. But the next Monday, the winning team appeared in a picture on the front page of The Register Citizen, the local newspaper -- extending their fingers in 2's and 1's, for the ''21'' on the football jersey of one of the accused players, Edgar Gonzalez, who remains in jail. 
The paper had found the photo on Instagram. Someone had posted it with a label: #FreeEdgar.
The older residents of Torrington, a city of 36,000 in northwestern Connecticut bypassed by economic recovery, would like their town to be known for its middle-class values, for the way people lend a hand to their neighbors. But they have seemed helpless as Torrington has become synonymous with #FreeEdgar, the defiant Twitter hashtag that has come to stand for everything the teenagers believe is wrong with the arrests -- and everything outsiders believe is wrong with the town.
When The Register Citizen published several teenagers' Twitter messages defending Mr. Gonzalez and the other football player, Joan Toribio, both seniors, on March 20, a minor scandal became a town preoccupation. It brought unavoidable if rough comparisons to the rape case in Steubenville, Ohio, last year, where repeated violations of a teenage girl were chronicled in social media.
In the last two weeks, two 17-year-old boys were arrested, charged, like the 18-year-olds, with sexual assault involving 13-year-old girls. All along, social media have continued to buzz, and Torrington's parents and school officials have been left to play catch-up, trying to bridge a generational divide that has never felt so sharp here before.
Twitter accounts normally used to complain about homework, to chatter and to flirt were instead used to accuse the girls of ''destroying'' the young men's lives. ''Snitch,'' they called one girl, asking why only the male students were being prosecuted if she, too, said yes to having sexual relations. Some people worry that the two girls, who were sending Twitter messages back and forth and to the young men until early February, not long before the first arrests, have seen the messages about them.
''Young girls acting like whores there's no punishment for that,'' one student posted the day after Mr. Gonzalez's arrest on Feb. 20, continuing, ''young men acting like boys is a sentence.''
Many adults in the community have been aghast at the posts, particularly those attacking the girls. They also have expressed frustration that many teenagers do not understand the statutory rape law, which is predicated on the notion that juveniles are not mature enough to consent to sex with an older partner. The furor prompted Kenneth Traub, the Board of Education chairman, to convene a community forum on sexual assault, with members of the Police Department and sexual assault counselors.
''It's a hard time in Torrington right now,'' said Barbara Spiegel, executive director of the Susan B. Anthony Project, a center here for battered women and victims of sexual assault.
School officials have asked Ms. Spiegel's counselors to meet with students, including those in the dodgeball photo, acknowledging that administrators must try to change teenagers' attitudes without being able to regulate what they say online. At Torrington Middle School, where the two victims are in eighth grade, administrators also called an assembly to warn against online ''name-calling.''
''It's not completely uncharted territory, but it's new,'' Ms. Spiegel said. ''A while back it was Myspace, and then it was Facebook, and then it was sexting, and now it's Twitter.''
The school superintendent, Cheryl F. Kloczko, has urged parents to speak to their children, telling them that inappropriate posts can result in suspension or expulsion. But no students, Mr. Traub said, have yet gone before the board for a social-media-related expulsion hearing. (Mr. Traub said he did not know whether there had been any suspensions, and Ms. Kloczko declined to comment.)
Adding to the district's challenges is that while there is plenty of speculation online about the statutory rape case, there is little official information. The police have said only that the arrests of Mr. Toribio and Mr. Gonzalez, both residents of a modest housing complex known as Highwoods, stemmed from separate episodes around Feb. 10; one of the victims' parents reported an assault to the police on Feb. 11.
Mr. Toribio is free on $100,000 bond; his lawyer, Charles Brower, declined to comment. Mr. Gonzalez, who also faces several charges related to a March 2012 robbery, is being held at the New Haven Correctional Center. His lawyer, J. Patten Brown III, said he intended to fight the charges at trial.
Mr. Toribio, Mr. Gonzalez and the two 17-year-olds, whose names have not been disclosed because they are minors, face similar charges of risk of injury to a minor and second-degree sexual assault, which in Connecticut is defined as sex with someone who cannot legally consent to sex, like someone under 16. (The law makes an exception if those involved are less than three years apart.) The police have not said whether the arrests are related, only that there are two victims.
''The chick, she should get in trouble, too,'' a high school sophomore, who declined to give his name, said in an interview outside the school last week. ''It's probably a regular thing she does. It wouldn't surprise me.''
At times, adults in Torrington have struggled to grasp teenagers' online habits as much as students have struggled to grasp the consequences of their posts. At one news conference, Ms. Kloczko broke into tears, saying that while the district tried to teach students moral behavior, ''sometimes it seems that just isn't enough.''
Mr. Traub said he believed that the Twitter messages were posted ''just to get a reaction.''
''I put no weight in any comments made online,'' he said. ''I don't believe in Twitter. I don't believe in Facebook. I don't think that 13-year-olds should spend as much time online as they do.''
In the middle of the controversy is The Register Citizen, which has strived since 2010 to welcome the community into its newsroom, inviting local residents to participate in daily news meetings, but now finds itself both scolding that community and defending its coverage of it.
In editorials, the newspaper has admonished that '' 'statutory' rape is rape'' and ''rape is not O.K.,'' and called for tighter controls on bullying, positions many readers have cheered. It also published ''15 good things about Torrington High School'' after students accused it of drawing undue negative attention to the school. Several students and parents complained when the newspaper published teenagers' Twitter handles and messages -- a move the editor, John Berry, said ''helped stress that people couldn't turn around and say, 'It's not my kids.' ''
Jessica Glenza, the lead reporter on the coverage of the cyberbullying of the girls, said people had asked whether she had searched for offensive Twitter posts that could tie the case to the rape in Steubenville.
''No, because who would expect to find something like that?'' she said. ''No one would.''
Since then, several Twitter accounts that used the #FreeEdgar hashtag have been shut down or made private. But the 13-year-old girls are still posting. They write about school, movies, friends and, once in a while, about sadness.

HEADLINE: Deer Breeding Industry Looks To Lawmakers to Relax Rules

BYLINE: By CODY PERMENTER. 
cpermenter@texastribune.org

 BODY:
TERRELL, Tex. -- In the early 1980s, when the deer breeding industry was in its infancy in Texas, Robert Williams bought his first deer, Old Bambi, for $250. He had no plans for the deer; he simply knew that he enjoyed nature and wanted to watch the buck's antlers grow.
''I just wanted deer, I loved deer,'' he said. 
Mr. Williams, 74, now owns a 1,200-acre white-tailed deer breeding and hunting operation here in Terrell, about 35 miles east of Dallas. The industry has grown statewide, generating an estimated $652 million in economic activity annually, according to a 2008 Texas A&M University study.
Oversight of the industry could change significantly during this legislative session, as the Texas Deer Association -- a lobbying group for deer breeders -- pushes for measures to ease some regulations. The group says current oversight is constraining the industry, but environmental groups say the industry has overstepped its bounds by shifting its strategy away from conservation and toward support for the commercial hunting industry.
In Texas, it is legal to breed deer on private property with a permit. Although the deer belong to the state, breeders can sell them and run hunting operations, making the industry a major player in the state's rural economy.
Gilbert Adams III, the president of the deer association, said there was a ''perceived antagonistic relationship'' between the Texas Parks and Wildlife and deer breeders who feel that the agency is too harsh in enforcing bureaucratic regulations like proper tagging.
One bill the association supports is House Bill 2092, by State Representative John Kuempel, Republican of Seguin, which would change the industry's regulating agency from Texas Parks and Wildlife to the Texas Animal Health Commission. Mr. Adams said the change would benefit the industry because the commission has more expertise in animal health and disease prevention.
''Deer breeding concerns more of an agricultural enterprise -- it is a ranching activity,'' Mr. Adams said. The commission's members, he said, are ''the animal husbandry experts in Texas.''
But Gary Joiner, the chief executive of the Texas Wildlife Association, said Parks and Wildlife was better suited to oversee the industry because deer are not like the livestock that the animal health agency has traditionally overseen.
''Deer are a public resource, a native resource that should be protected,'' Mr. Joiner said.
Other legislative measures under consideration this session would institute a clearer appeals process for revoked breeder permits and allow breeders to sell venison.
But not all of the proposals have the deer association's support. Among those is a bill by State Representative John Davis, Republican of Houston, that would increase to 60 days, from 10, the time before a deer could be hunted after being released by a breeder.
J. David Anderson, the chairman of the Texas Wildlife Association's White-Tailed Deer Management Committee, testified in a March hearing that many pen-raised deer are not wild when they are released. A 60-day release, he said, would help deer become acclimated to their new environment, while also reducing the perception that they were bred just to be hunted.
Mr. Williams, the deer breeder, said changing the release date would harm the deer. He said deer are at their weakest 60 days before the Texas hunting season starts, in late September. Bucks are just beginning to grow back the small nubs where they have shed their antlers, he said, and not releasing a deer at its peak condition would put it at risk of infection.
''They aren't looking out for the health of the deer,'' Mr. Williams said.

HEADLINE: Construction Groups Criticize Limits in Guest Worker Deal

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Several major construction industry groups are criticizing the agreement reached last week over how many low-skilled guest workers should be granted visas each year, complaining that the proposed limits were ''unrealistic.'' The trade associations, including Associated Builders and Contractors and the National Electrical Contractors Association, issued a statement late Wednesday highlighting their concerns about the proposal between the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. 
Many immigration experts expect that deal -- or much of it -- will become part of the immigration bill being developed by a bipartisan group of eight senators, and a representative of the trade associations stressed on Thursday that the statement was not an effort to jettison the immigration proposals but to suggest improvements.
The Chamber-labor deal calls for admitting 20,000 guest workers the first year, with the total climbing to 75,000 after four years, and future numbers adjusted according to the unemployment rate and industry needs as determined by a new federal bureau. The agreement caps the number of guest construction workers admitted each year at 15,000, and in a bow to labor unions, bars admission for any higher-skilled workers like electricians, crane operators or elevator repair technicians.
''We are deeply concerned with the size and the scope of the temporary guest worker program in the proposal now being drafted by the 'Gang of Eight' senators,'' the groups wrote in a statement first reported by Politico. ''Capping the amount of visas for the construction industry at only 15,000 in an industry that currently employs nearly six million workers is simply unrealistic and destined to fail.''
The trade associations added that a program that fails to provide enough visas to meet demand ''will inevitably make it harder to fill critical labor openings and make it impossible to secure the border.''
Associated General Contractors of America, Leading Builders of America, the National Association of Home Builders and the National Roofing Contractors Association also signed the letter.
Union leaders pushed hard to minimize the number of guest workers allowed, arguing that they hold down wages and take jobs away from Americans, especially when including 1.3 million people in the construction industry who are unemployed. Randel Johnson, the chamber's senior vice president for labor and immigration issues, defended the program, saying it ''features a streamlined process for employers to register job openings that can be filled by temporary foreign workers, while still ensuring that American workers get first crack at every job.''
On Thursday, Geoff Burr, vice president of federal affairs for Associated Builders and Contractors, tried to tamp down worries that some trade groups were trying to kill the legislation.
''The construction industry strongly supports comprehensive immigration reform, and the last thing we want is for current reform efforts to fail,'' Mr. Burr said in a statement. ''Our statement yesterday was an attempt to help improve the Senate reform package.''

HEADLINE: Data Leak Shakes Notion of Secret Offshore Havens and, Possibly, Nerves

BYLINE: By ANDREW HIGGINS; Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Paris, and Chris Cottrell from Berlin.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- They are a large and diverse group that includes a Spanish heiress; the daughter of the former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos; and Denise Rich, the former wife of the disgraced trader Marc Rich, who was pardoned by President Bill Clinton. But, according to a trove of secret financial information released Thursday, all have money and share a desire to hide it.
And, it seems safe to say, they -- and thousands of others in Europe and far beyond, in places like Mongolia -- are suddenly very anxious after the leak of 2.5 million files detailing the offshore bank accounts and shell companies of wealthy individuals and tax-averse companies.
''There will be people all over the world today who are now scared witless,'' said Richard Murphy, research director for Tax Justice Network, a British-based organization that has long campaigned to end the secrecy that surrounds assets held in offshore havens. The leaked files include the names of 4,000 Americans, celebrities as well as more mundane doctors and dentists. 
It is not the first time leaks have dented a thick carapace of confidentiality that usually protects the identities of those who stash money in the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Liechtenstein and other havens. Nor, in most cases, is keeping money in such places illegal.
But the enormous size of the data dump obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a Washington-based group that, along with affiliated news media organizations, announced its coup on Thursday, has punched a big hole in the secrecy that surrounds what the Tax Justice Network estimates are assets worth at least $21 trillion held in offshore havens. ''This could be a game-changer,'' said Mr. Murphy, the author of a book about offshore tax shelters. ''Secrecy is the key product these places sell. Whether you are a criminal laundering money or just someone trying to evade or avoid taxes, secrecy is the one thing you want.'' Once this is gone, he added, ''it creates an enormous fear factor'' and has a ''massive deterrent effect.''
And lifting the curtain on the identities of those who keep their money offshore is likely to cause particular anger in austerity-blighted Europe, where governments have been telling people to tighten their belts but have mostly turned a blind eye to wealthier citizens who skirt taxes with help from so-called offshore financial centers.
The leaked records, mainly from the British Virgin Islands, the Cook Islands and Singapore, disclose proprietary information about more than 120,000 offshore companies and trusts and nearly 130,000 individuals and agents, including the wealthiest people in more than 170 countries. Not all of those named necessarily have secret bank accounts, and in some cases only conducted business through companies they control that are registered offshore.
The embarrassment caused by Thursday's revelations has been particularly acute in France, where the Socialist president, François Hollande, who wants to impose a 75 percent tax on millionaires, has been struggling to contain a political firestorm touched off this week by a former budget minister's admission -- after months of denials -- that he had secret foreign bank accounts.
The scandal looked set to widen on Thursday as senior members of the government were forced to confront allegations that Mr. Hollande and others may have been aware that the budget minister, Jérôme Cahuzac, who resigned on March 19, was lying but failed to act.
Adding to the president's trouble, the name of a close friend and treasurer of his 2012 election campaign, Jean-Jacques Augier, appeared in connection with the files released Thursday by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Mr. Augier, according to the newspaper Le Monde, was identified as an investor in offshore businesses in the Cayman Islands, another well-known tax haven.
Mr. Augier, a friend of Mr. Hollande's, denied to Le Monde and Agence France-Presse that he had done anything illegal or improper. He said he had invested in funds that invested in China, and that he had no personal bank account in the Cayman Islands or any direct personal investment there. He conceded only that ''maybe I lacked a bit of caution.''
Others identified included Maria Imelda Marcos Manotoc, a provincial governor and eldest daughter of the former Philippine president; Olga Shuvalova, the wife of Russia's deputy prime minister, Igor Shuvalov; Gunter Sachs, a German playboy and photographer who committed suicide in May 2011 at age 78; and Baroness Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza, Spain's wealthiest art collector and the widow of a Thyssen steel company billionaire. The president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, and his wife, Mehriban, were featured in the documents as having set up an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands, while their two daughters appeared in connection with three other offshore outfits.
The consortium did not specify how it got the information or where it came from. On its Web site, the group said ''the leaked files provide facts and figures -- cash transfers, incorporation dates, links between companies and individuals -- that illustrate how offshore financial secrecy has spread aggressively around the globe, allowing the wealthy and the well connected to dodge taxes and fueling corruption and economic woes in rich and poor nations alike.''
In Germany, now gearing up for national elections in September and a country with both a strong sense of social justice and a long history of tax evaders sneaking money into nearby Switzerland, politicians expressed concern, even outrage, over the disclosures. Of particular concern were indications that big banks in Germany and elsewhere are deeply involved in moving money beyond the reach of tax authorities.
''We should introduce tougher penalties for those financial institutions that are ideal for tax fraud or take part in it,'' Peer Steinbrück, the Social Democratic Party's candidate for chancellor, was quoted as saying in the daily newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.
The issue of tax avoidance has become a highly charged issue across much of Europe, particularly in richer northern countries that are increasingly fed up with demands for bailout money from heavily indebted countries like Greece. A key demand of a recent bailout deal announced for Cyprus was that the nation drastically shrink its role as a financial center and, many in Germany suspect, a haven for money laundering.
Robert Palmer, a policy adviser for Global Witness, a London research group that focuses on corruption, said the naming of offshore account holders could have powerful political reverberations across Europe because ''it shows that if you are wealthy and well connected you play by different rules.''
He said the information released so far did not shed any new light on how offshore finance works but was still significant because it identified people who used hidden shelters.
''This is very unusual because it is so difficult to get any information out of these places,'' he said. ''It adds to the picture of how easy it is to move money around and will build up the anger of people who are being asked to make cuts but see that there are people out there who benefit hugely from the system.''
The disclosure of offshore financial information is also a potential embarrassment for Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, in that much of the data released so far related to the British Virgin Islands, a British-ruled territory in the Caribbean.
Mr. Cameron had earlier spoken about the importance of tax and financial transparency and pledged to make it a priority issue at a meeting of the leaders of the Group of 8 advanced industrial nations in Northern Ireland in June.
The British Caribbean territory, however, is notoriously secretive and, Mr. Palmer said, one of the most egregious offenders in enabling wealthy people to hide their money to avoid taxes.
In a statement issued Thursday, Global Witness called on Mr. Cameron and fellow Group of 8 leaders to ''crack down on anonymous company ownership.''

HEADLINE: An Independent Scotland

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''A Vote on Scottish Independence'' (editorial, March 28): 
Latest figures show that 36 percent of Scots support independence, with 46 percent against. A swing of just over five points would put the ''yes'' campaign ahead.
A Scottish government calculation of Scotland's gross domestic product per head places us eighth in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development league table of wealthy nations; Britain is 17th. Scotland generates 9.9 percent of British tax revenues, in return for 9.3 percent of spending. Therefore, Scotland is financially stronger than Britain.
No European Union member can be made to join the euro, and Scottish government policy is for an independent Scotland to keep the pound and share a ''sterling zone'' with the rest of Britain. We look forward to having Scotland rejoin the family of independent nations after a ''yes'' vote in September 2014 -- working in cooperation with our friends in the rest of Britain and in the United States.

HEADLINE: Finding A Rate That's Fairer Than Libor

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Perhaps it is time to feel sorry for the big banks, at least when it comes to Libor. If they do what some regulators want, it appears they will be directly defying other regulators. If they do what those other regulators want, they may end up facing criminal charges.
Libor, if you have not been paying attention, is the London interbank offered rate -- or rates, since there are dozens of them. For decades, it has been the dominant determinant of floating interest rates, with trillions of dollars in loans and derivatives priced off those rates.
Now it is ridiculous. It purports to be the rate at which banks can borrow from each other. Every day banks submit the rates at which they could borrow money, on an unsecured basis, in various currencies and varying maturities. Those rates are averaged, after the highest and lowest ones are eliminated, and that becomes that day's Libor rate.
These days there is a problem: banks almost never borrow from each other, particularly at longer maturities. So the rates are fictitious -- or at least not based on any information that could be verified. 
Before, during and after the credit crisis, the rates were being manipulated by bankers, often with the approval of top management. Sometimes the motive was to make the bank look better -- what does it say about a bank if its peers evidently will not lend money to it at the same rate they will lend to others? -- but other times the motive was just to rig markets so traders could make money. It was sort of like betting on a soccer match: profits are much more likely if you fix the match before you place your bet.
Three major banks -- Barclays, UBS and the Royal Bank of Scotland -- were fined a total of $2.5 billion by authorities in Britain and the United States. It appeared to be a fine case of international regulatory cooperation.
But now that cooperation is breaking down. In the United States, Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the man whose determination to do something helped to expose criminal behavior that evidently did not seem all that outrageous to some others, is pushing to get rid of Libor entirely. He argues that it no longer really exists, assuming it ever did, and wants to find a new benchmark for floating interest rate contracts.
But Britain and the European Commission appear to be determined to save Libor. This week new governance rules took effect in Britain, and the European Commission is moving in the same direction. The new rules call for better governance, with efforts made to assure there is no cheating by traders.
Some banks, understandably, would just as soon get out of a business that has sullied reputations and cost billions. Some have tried to resign from the panels that determine Libor and its cousin, Euribor, a similar but less widely used system of base rates. But both European and British regulators view the existence of the benchmarks as critical and have warned banks not to leave.
''Interbank interest rate benchmarks are of systemic importance,'' said Michel Barnier, the European commissioner in charge of markets. He said European legislation would force banks to submit rates.
To Mr. Gensler, the Europeans are moving in the wrong direction. ''We have seen a significant amount of publicly available market data that raises questions about the integrity of Libor today,'' he said in a speech last month. He said that there was very little unsecured interbank trading going on, and that even when other interest rates fluctuated widely -- rates that include credit-default swaps on the very same banks -- each bank tended to submit the same rates day after day.
He noted that a task force of the International Organization of Securities Commissions recommended earlier this year that ''a benchmark should as a matter of priority be anchored by observable transactions entered into at arm's length between buyers and sellers in order for it to function as a credible indicator of prices, rates or index values,'' adding, ''I agree with this.''
To put it mildly, there is no reason to think the interbank lending market fits that bill now, and there are reasons to think it will be even less true in the future. Mr. Gensler said some banks believed the new Basel capital rules regarding liquidity would make it prohibitively expensive for one bank to lend to another for more than 30 days at a time. If so, there will be no such lending.
Mr. Gensler would like to develop an alternative and points to two options. One would essentially be dependent on the federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend reserves to one another. The other would be based on rates charged on secured loans. In each case these are real markets, at least in dollar-based transactions. He would like to phase in one of them as a replacement for Libor.
Whether such a tactic could work is not clear. There are a lot of contracts in existence based on Libor, and changing them by legal fiat might not pass judicial muster. And Mr. Gensler's suggested way of doing that raises its own questions. Essentially, he would allow derivatives based on Libor to keep trading for a couple of years while derivatives based on the new interest rates also traded, and in that way establish relationships between the two rates. So if Libor was, on average, 30 basis points above a new rate, then a Libor contract calling for interest payments of 200 basis points over Libor would be converted into a contract calling for paying 230 basis points more than the new rate.
A major problem with that is that to establish the relationship between the two rates depends on treating the Libor rates as if they are real. The fact they are not is the major problem Mr. Gensler sees in the current system.
The new British rules, as proposed, called for auditors to certify bank Libor policies every year, and allowed private lawsuits by persons or institutions who believed they had been harmed by manipulative and inaccurate Libor submissions. But banks complained that regular audits might cost so much that the requirement would ''adversely affect the incentives for firms to participate in the benchmark.''
When the final rules came out last week, they made a couple of important changes. Audits may be less frequent than every year. And private lawsuits would be prohibited in Britain.
Whether such suits can proceed in the United States is unclear.
A federal judge in New York has allowed some claims of commodity price manipulation to proceed, although she rejected others because reports of possible problems in the Libor market, starting in 2007, meant that the statute of limitations had expired.
It is not clear whether statute of limitations issues could derail a suit filed by Freddie Mac, the government-owned mortgage company, against the banks that set Libor and the British Bankers Association, which administered it. Freddie argued that it had entered into many contracts under which it received payments based on Libor. If the banks depressed those rates by submitting artificially low rates, as some have admitted, Freddie was harmed. It would be interesting if the courts ruled that because everyone should have known the market was fixed, those who fixed it are not liable.
There seems to be no way to turn Libor into a legitimate rate, given the way market perceptions of banks have changed. So any bank that submits rates that do not accurately reflect what it would have to pay may be subject to future legal action in the United States. But any bank that raises the rates it submits could raise doubts about its own creditworthiness. And the Europeans plan to make banks continue to submit rates.
Although it is not a case that any bank has made publicly, it could be argued that the spirit of Libor was preserved by the banks that lied. It was originally intended as a virtually risk-free private sector interest rate.
An accurate Libor, from 2007 on, would have reflected the banks' poorer credit, and would therefore no longer be such a risk-free rate. A borrower paying 100 basis points over Libor would wind up paying a premium over a real risk-free rate that was much larger than it had agreed to pay. Overcharging borrowers would not have helped the economy recover from the Great Recession.
Libor has clearly become ridiculous. But long before that happened, it became ubiquitous. Europe wants to preserve the latter, even if it does leave the former in place indefinitely. A better course would be to find a rate whose meaning will not change over time, and base future contracts on it. A rate based on secured loans makes the most sense.

HEADLINE: His Vanished (or Manipulated?) World

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
Eyewitness to history or manipulative mythmaker? The one blurs so easily into the other in socially concerned photojournalism. Separating truth from fantasy in the Depression-era photographs of impoverished Americans by Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange and others is not easy. The question is especially pertinent in the case of Roman Vishniac, who documented the lives of Orthodox Jews living in Eastern European shtetls in the late 1930s.
After World War II, widely published photographs from Vishniac's project came to signify in the popular imagination the human essence of what the Nazis' genocidal program destroyed. ''A Vanished World,'' the title of the 1983 book of his pictures of that pre-Holocaust world, nicely captured the nostalgic, elegiac mood of Vishniac's images. 
''Roman Vishniac Rediscovered,'' an extensive exhibition at the International Center of Photography, promises a new picture of this revered photographer's career. Drawn from an archive of more than 30,000 items, the exhibition does a lot to round out Vishniac's story, but whether it will alter how he is perceived is debatable. Maya Benton, an adjunct curator at the center, who met his daughter, Mara Vishniac Kohn, and began studying the collection in 2001, organized the show.
Born near St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1897 into an affluent Jewish family, Vishniac moved to Berlin in 1920 to escape the revolutionary havoc. In 1941 he and his wife and two children arrived in New York, where he resided until his death in 1990. He set up a portrait studio where he photographed celebrities like Marc Chagall.
After the war he revisited Europe to document displaced persons camps, and also photographed ruins in Berlin, but in later decades he concentrated on what will be the biggest revelation for viewers who know his only ''Vanished World'' pictures: a professional career in photomicroscopy. In a small, dark side room you can view a slide show of digitized photographs of microbes, crystals and other tiny things that he made from the 1950s to the late '70s.
The heart and soul of the show remain, however problematically, his photographs from the '30s. The earliest and most interesting pictures are of Ms. Vishniac Kohn as a child, posed in front of shops and poster-covered walls. A museum label explains that he had her pose to ward off suspicion that he might be a spy. His real interest was in the flags and signs displaying swastikas here and there in the background. These ominous, coolly furtive pictures are riveting, like scenes in a Hitchcock thriller.
The shtetl photographs also get much of their power from what viewers know is to come for their subjects. Yet there are few overt signs of anti-Semitic violence. The world Vishniac focused on was far from that of the assimilated, cosmopolitan Jews who lived in big cities. Showing cramped rooms and narrow cobblestone streets inhabited by bearded rabbis, boys with long side locks and lots of doe-eyed children gazing melancholically into the camera, Vishniac's photographs picture a tradition-bound world that had escaped modernization and could have existed a hundred or more years before with little alteration. These images are vivid yet oppressively sentimental.
A 2010 New York Times Magazine article by Alana Newhouse about Ms. Benton's discovery of the Vishniac archive gives a good account of what is at stake in framing his career now. One thing Ms. Benton learned from studying Vishniac's many unpublished photographs, contact sheets and negatives, as well as scrapbooks, letters and other writings, some of which are on display here in vitrines, was that he had a flexible relationship with truth. He captioned pictures falsely to enhance their pathos, claiming in one, for example, that a girl in it owned no shoes, though she appears properly shod in another photograph.
Such manipulations can be excused by the fact that Vishniac was not operating as a journalist. While he claimed to have gone to the shtetls on his own initiative, he was actually commissioned by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, which used his emotionally catchy photographs in campaigns to raise money to help European Jews.
Knowing his penchant for prevarication undermines the impact of some images. Considering ''Grandfather and Granddaughter, Warsaw'' (1935-38), in which a young woman and an old man pass by each other outdoors, you might wonder: Were they really related?
Critical debate also revolves around public reception of the shtetl photographs. In her article Ms. Newhouse notes that the popularity of ''A Vanished World,'' which won a National Jewish Book Award in 1984, has had partly to do with its evocation of a kitschy myth of European Jews that was epitomized in ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' Some critics think Vishniac's pictures give a distorted sense of history by substituting the image of a homogeneous minority group for a population that was in fact socially and economically highly diverse.
These questions are not brought to the fore by the exhibition; there is no catalog with authoritative essays sorting out the controversial issues. But that is understandable: It is the first comprehensive exposure of previously unknown and lesser-known aspects of Vishniac's life and career and, perhaps properly, leaves to others the task of coming to terms with the photographs that made him famous.
Still, it is a missed opportunity. The conventional myth of Vishniac as the Modernist hero-photographer remains largely intact for now.
''Roman Vishniac Rediscovered'' is on view through May 5 at the International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street; (212) 857-0000, icp.org.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 17, 2013 

 CORRECTION:
An art review on April 5 about ''Roman Vishniac Rediscovered,'' at the International Center of Photography in Manhattan, contained several errors.
No evidence exists that Vishniac spliced negatives to create images of events that never happened, according to the center.
The donation of his archive to the center is under consideration, but has not taken place.
While Vishniac documented Orthodox Jews in Eastern Europe, he did not do so in Germany. And while he did photograph ruins of Berlin after World War II, the reason he was sent there was to photograph displaced persons camps, not the ruins.
He photographed Albert Einstein in Princeton, N.J., not at his portrait studio in New York.

HEADLINE: Desperately Seeking "Serious" Approval

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Will they ever learn? 

 BODY:
Sigh. So Obama is going with the "chained CPI" thing in his latest proposal - changing the price index used for Social Security cost adjustments. This is, purely and simply, a benefit cut. 
Does it make sense in policy terms? No. First of all, there is no reason to believe that the chained index is a better measure of inflation facing seniors than the standard CPI. It's true that the standard measure arguably understates inflation for the typical household - but seniors have a different consumption basket from the young, one that includes more medical expenses, and probably face true inflation that's higher, not lower, than the official measure.
Anyway, it's not as if the current level of real benefits has any sacred significance. The truth - although you'll never hear this in Serious circles - is that we really should be increasing SS benefits. Why? Because the shift from defined-benefit pensions to defined contribution, the rise of the 401(k), has been a bust, and many older Americans will soon find themselves in dire straits. SS is the last defined-benefit pension still standing - thank you, Nancy Pelosi, for standing up to Bush - and should be strengthened, not weakened.
So what's this about? The answer, I fear, is that Obama is still trying to win over the Serious People, by showing that he's willing to do what they consider Serious - which just about always means sticking it to the poor and the middle class. The idea is that they will finally drop the false equivalence, and admit that he's reasonable while the GOP is mean-spirited and crazy.
But it won't happen. Watch the Washington Post editorial page over the next few days. I hereby predict that it will damn Obama with faint praise, saying that while it's a small step in the right direction, of course it's inadequate - and anyway, Obama is to blame for Republican intransigence, because he could make them accept a Grand Bargain that includes major revenue increases if only he would show Leadership (TM).
Oh, and wanna bet that Republicans soon start running ads saying that Obama wants to cut your Social Security?

HEADLINE: Depression, Not Ended

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Austerity USA. 

 BODY:
Lousy jobs report. OK, you don't want to put too much stress on one month's numbers, yada yada, but it doesn't look at all good. 
But is this really a surprise? I mean, it's true that the incipient housing recovery has made many people somewhat optimistic - I've been one of them - but when all is said and done, we are following strongly contractionary fiscal policy in an economy in which monetary policy is still ineffective because of the zero lower bound. How contractionary? Look at CBO's estimates of the cyclically adjusted budget deficit (third column):
That deficit has declined from 5.6 percent of potential GDP in 2011 to 2.5 percent in 2013 - that's 3 percent of GDP, which is a lot of austerity. Not all of that cut has even hit yet - the sequester isn't in the macro numbers yet - but the rise in the payroll tax is very clearly driving the latest bad numbers, which show big declines in retail.
This is really stupid; as long as we're at the zero lower bound, austerity is a huge mistake. Yet for what, the third time since 2009, all discussion in Washington has turned away from job creation to deficits (even though the debt problem has largely faded away) and the need for an early Fed exit from stimulus (even though unemployment remains high and inflation low).
Clearly, the answer is to cut Social Security!

HEADLINE: Sequestration and the Jobs Report

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: The mandatory federal budget cuts don&#8217;t seem to account for sluggishness in the labor market &#8212; at least, not yet. 

 BODY:
The March jobs report came in much weaker than expected, with employers adding just 88,000 workers over the course of the month. Did sequestration - the $85 billion in mandatory budget cuts that Congress never managed to unwind, despite promises to the contrary - take a bite? 
The short answer is no. At least according to the preliminary data, sequestration does not seem to be particularly at fault. 
Government employment actually climbed during March, if you exclude the Postal Service, which shed nearly 12,000 workers. Economists expect the government ranks to take a hit as agencies and offices carry out their budget cuts before the end of the fiscal year in September. 
But not yet. The budget cuts formally came into effect on March 1, and many agencies waited to see if Congress might undo them later in the month. Furloughs, layoffs, contract changes and other disruptions have started accumulating, but remain very small at this point. Economists expect the jobs hit from sequestration to be significant, but backloaded toward the end of the year.
But another change emanating from Washington seems as if it might be having a serious effect on jobs: the expiration of the payroll tax cut. In January, Congress effectively increased payroll taxes by declining to extend a temporary tax holiday. That wiped out a full year's worth of wage gains for millions of Americans, and economists expected it to depress consumer sentiment and consumer spending. 
Lo and behold, the retail sector showed significant weakness in this report, perhaps evidence of families' having less spending money and cutting back at the mall. Employment dropped by 24,000 positions, with significant declines in clothing stores, garden supply stores and electronic stores. 
Granted, that could just be statistical noise, and next month's revisions could erase the drop. In other government reports, the retail sector has looked just fine. Commerce data showed consumer spending surging, and separate private reports have showed consumer confidence climbing. But it could be that families are spending a little less, thinning retailers' profits and forcing them to cut back on staffing.

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund America

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: More liabilities, but more assets too. 

 BODY:
Still thinking about debt; and it seems to me that there's an important aspect of the story that isn't getting any play, namely, the extent to which US debt has in effect been issued to buy assets overseas. 
Here's what the figures for US assets abroad and foreign assets in the US look like:
What we've seen is a lot of financial globalization, with both assets and liabilities rising fast. The liabilities have gone up more than the assets, so we've gone from being a net creditor to a net debtor, but the fact that both sides have gone up matters, because the way America invests isn't the same as the way it borrows.
Basically, we issue debt and buy equity: US liabilities consist largely though not entirely of bonds - yes, there are a lot of foreign-owned companies, but they're a much smaller factor - while US assets abroad consist mainly either of direct investments (companies we own) or stocks. Because US assets are higher-yielding although riskier than US liabilities, we still earn more from our investments than we pay on our liabilities. In the aggregate, America is a bit like a hedge fund that borrows to make risky investments; that's arguably not a good thing, but it's not a story of living beyond our means.
Now, the point for the debt discussion is that the bonds we sell to foreigners count as part of the US debt number, but the assets we buy abroad don't count against it. So financial globalization would show up as a rise in "American debt" even if we were buying just as many assets as we were selling, and therefore not living beyond our means at all. 
Parsing the data to put a number on this effect is tricky, because I don't know how the "claims reported by banks, not reported elsewhere" - about $3 trillion in both assets and liabilities - pops up. But a rough guess is that this financial globalization effect - an effect that is all about leverage, not at all about overspending - has added between 30 and 50 percent of GDP to the reported US debt ratio.

HEADLINE: Clinton Continues Her Advocacy for Women's Rights as Private Citizen

BYLINE: AMY CHOZICK


HIGHLIGHT: Hillary Rodham Clinton offered a glimpse on Friday of how she will fill her at least temporary role as a private advocate for women and girls in a speech at the Women in the World Conference. 

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton offered a glimpse on Friday of how she will fill her at least temporary role as a private advocate for women and girls, walking arm in arm with Tina Brown at the Women in the World Conference, an annual women's rights event sponsored by Newsweek and The Daily Beast, which Ms. Brown oversees. 
"I have been challenged in boardrooms and official offices around the world, but fighting to give women and girls a fighting chance isn't a
nice thing to do," Mrs. Clinton said. "It isn't some luxury that we get to when we have time on our hands to spend doing that."
Mrs. Clinton does have time on her hands now as she transitions to her post-government life and faces constant speculation about whether she still has presidential ambitions.
A crowd of women waiting to get in to see Mrs. Clinton speak moved rapidly, shoving their way into the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center to see the former secretary of state speak. The enthusiasm immediately prompted chatter about whether Mrs. Clinton and her team could bottle that enthusiasm for the 2016 presidential election. The crowd let out a huge cheer as Ms. Brown introduced Mrs. Clinton by asking "The big question about Hillary is, what's next?" 
Mrs. Clinton has said she will carve out a role for herself in the Clinton Foundation, the global charitable organization started by President Bill Clinton after he left office. Her speech on Friday gave a glimpse into what that advocacy will look like. Mrs. Clinton evoked her role as the nation's chief diplomat, but also drew on earlier experiences as first lady.
"It is past time to embrace a 21st century approach to advancing the rights and opportunities of women and girls," she said. She referred to Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager shot by the Taliban for trying to get an education, and a gang-rape victim in India.
"When women are liberated, so are entire societies," Mrs. Clinton said. "We must understand this, too, and not only understand it but act on it."
Mrs. Clinton also touched on domestic issues, like equal pay and the importance of training women in math and science, that she had championed as a Democratic presidential candidate in 2008. She referred to a "Glass Ceiling Index" published by The Economist that ranked countries based on opportunities for women and other factors. "The United States was not even in the top ten," she said.
The gender gap in American politics became stark during the 2012 presidential election. Some 55 percent of women voted for President Obama, compared with 52 percent for Mitt Romney. In the 2008 presidential election, Mr. Obama beat Senator John McCain among women by 13 percentage points.
As soon as Mrs. Clinton left the stage, her daughter Chelsea took a seat to host a panel called "Grooming Titans of Tech" about women in
technology.

HEADLINE: Based on Relative Yields, Stocks Look Cheap

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The earnings yield on stocks is now higher than the investment yield on junk bonds. Either stocks are cheap or junk bonds are expensive. Or both. 

 BODY:
My Off the Charts column this week looks at the popularity of junk bonds. Since 1999, they have outperformed stocks during both bull and bear markets. Issuance of such bonds has risen to record levels around the world, and yields are at historic lows. 
Those declining yields have produced capital gains for bond owners, making the bonds more attractive to those who invest based on recent history.
As I talk to people these days, there seems to be widespread conviction that stocks are expensive, and that getting into the market now is highly risky. After all, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have risen to nominal record highs at a time when the American economy is hardly putting on an inspiring performance and Europe continues to stumble along. 
Somehow people are not impressed by the fact that the S.&P. 500 has earnings that are about 80 percent higher than they were in 1999, when the index reached levels almost as high as those reached this year. 
At the suggestion of Bob Barbera, the co-director of Johns Hopkins University's Center for Financial Economics, I compared the earnings yield on the S.&P. 500 to the yield on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch high yield bond index since 1994. Here are the results:

There are, of course, caveats. The earnings yield is simply the operating earnings for the companies in the stock index over the past 12 months, divided by the price of the index at the end of each quarter. There is no guarantee that earnings will be as good over the next year. (But of course, there is no guarantee that all bonds will continue to make their interest payments, either.) The earnings yield is the inverse of the more commonly cited price-earnings ratio.
Earnings come in varying qualities, as companies play games with numbers. The operating earnings are compiled by S.&P., which tries to eliminate one-time events from reported profits, but S.&P. no doubt makes some decisions about which people could quarrel. These numbers should not be taken as absolutely definitive. 
 And earnings yield is not the same thing as a dividend yield. Presumably the earnings that are not paid out in dividends are being reinvested for the shareholders' benefit, but you won't have to work very hard to find historical examples where that did not work out well for the shareholders.
But with all that, it is clearly unusual for stocks to be yielding more than bonds. And stocks have upsides that bonds lack. Earnings may rise. (They usually do, at least over time.) Bond payouts are fixed. If they change, it will be because the company ran into trouble and halted earnings payments.
At current low levels of interest rates, it is hard to make a case that junk bonds are a better investment than stocks.

HEADLINE: Why Sanford vs. Colbert Busch Could Be Competitive

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Former Gov. Mark Sanford secured the Republican nomination and will face Elizabeth Colbert Busch in the race for South Carolina&#8217;s First Congressional District, which is solidly Republican. But this election is not typical. 

 BODY:
Former Gov. Mark Sanford won a runoff election this week, securing the Republican nomination for South Carolina's First Congressional District. He will face the Democratic nominee, Elizabeth Colbert Busch, in a May 7 general election. 
The First District, which runs from Hilton Head Island in the south to north of Charleston, is solidly Republican, and typically a Congressional race in the conservative Lowcountry would provide little suspense: Republicans have held the seat since 1981.
But this election is not typical. Mr. Sanford enters the general election with significant personal baggage, having spent six days in 2009 in Argentina with a woman who was not his wife while telling his aides he was "hiking the Appalachian Trail." (He and the woman are now engaged.) Ms. Colbert Busch, meanwhile, is an accomplished businesswoman with deep ties to the district's business community. She is also the sister of the comedian Stephen Colbert. The odd matchup, in turn, takes place in an off-year special election. Special elections usually mean low turnout, and low turnout often means a Republican-leaning electorate. But special elections can also provide surprising results. 
A number of well-informedobservers think the election could be competitive.
There have not yet been any nonpartisan polls of the race, but a survey by Lake Research Partners for the Colbert Busch campaign showed the Democrat ahead of Mr. Sanford, 47 percent to 44 percent. (Partisan polls have historically overestimated their candidate's standing by about six percentage points.) Another poll, by the left-leaning Public Policy Polling, showed similar numbers, with Ms. Colbert Busch leading Mr. Sanford 47 percent to 45 percent.
Both those polls, however, were conducted before Mr. Sanford officially secured the Republican nomination. His chances of winning a seat in Congress may depend largely on his ability to consolidate the conservative vote. He received 57 percent in Tuesday's two-way runoff election, and will need to win over voters who just cast ballots against him.
How likely are the First District's Republicans to stay in the party's camp? South Carolina is known as a deep-red state, but the First District boasts a more moderate brand of conservatism. The district's lines were redrawn after the 2010 census, and Georgetown and Horry Counties were moved elsewhere. The result is an electorate roughly the same in terms of Democrat versus Republican but less defined by cultural conservatism and focused more on fiscal restraint.
Voters in downtown Charleston (the tip of the peninsula), Mount Pleasant and Isle of Palms in the district's north are generally affluent and less strident on social issues. "This is the economic conservative heart of the district," said David Wasserman, the House editor for the Cook Political Report.
Hilton Head Island in the south is also characterized by a more moderate Republicanism, partly thanks to the many transplants from the Northeast who have moved to the region.
While on its own, the First District's fiscal conservatism may not help Ms. Colbert Busch - Mr. Sanford represented the district in the late 1990s and is known as a fiscal hawk - the fact that the district is less socially conservative means fewer voters may disqualify Ms. Colbert Busch for her support of same-sex marriage and abortion rights.
Moreover, the First District is solidly Republican, but not overwhelmingly so. It has a Cook Partisan Voting Index score of R+11. It is rare, but Democrats have won congressional districts with similar scores. North Carolina's Seventh District, which also has a score of R+11, is home to Representative Mike McIntyre, a Democrat. The Fourth Congressional District in Utah has a score of R+14 and is also represented by a Democrat, Jim Matheson.
The Republican Party has held the seat for more than 30 years, but there have been close calls. In 2008, the First District's Republican Representative, Henry E. Brown Jr., just barely won re-election against the Democrat, Linda Ketner, 52 percent to 48 percent. It's worth noting, however, that Mr. Brown was dogged by a controversy over a fine he received for allowing a fire on his property that spread to Francis Marion National Forest, and he ran what was generally regarded as a lackluster campaign.
The key to this race, according to Robert Oldendick, a professor of political science at the University of South Carolina, may be "whether Sanford's ethical-moral issues will hurt him among female voters or whether his 'limited government-lower taxes' mantra will be the more important issue."
So far, the taint of scandal seems to have remained with Mr. Sanford. The survey by Public Policy Polling found his favorability ratings underwater, with 34 percent of voters saying they had a favorable impression of him and 58 percent saying they had an unfavorable one. The poll from Public Policy Polling also found that women were slightly more likely than men to have an unfavorable view of Mr. Sanford, but there was not much of a gender difference.
Ms. Colbert Busch is viewed favorably by 45 percent of voters, according to the same poll; 31 percent view her unfavorably (her unfavorable rating may go up as the campaign heats up and she faces Republican ads).
Ms. Colbert Busch - with a famous brother and a nonpolitical background - is an unusual candidate, and "this is certainly a promising moment for a different kind of candidate to step forward," said Mark Tompkins, an associate professor of political science at the University of South Carolina. 
But the First District is still heavily Republican. The close race in 2008 took place in a presidential election year and amid a national Democratic wave. 
Ms. Colbert Busch has a chance, but she "still has to run an almost flawless campaign," Mr. Oldendick said.

HEADLINE: Reclaim the Center

BYLINE: STEVEN RATTNER


HIGHLIGHT: It&#8217;s time for the sensible majority to speak up and push for a rational approach to our fiscal challenges. 

 BODY:
NOT surprisingly, troubled economic times often beget proselytizers of wacky, extreme ideas. The stagflation of the 1970s blessed us with damaging wage and price controls and the utterly counterintuitive supply-side notion - famously drawn on a napkin - that cutting taxes would lead to higher tax revenues.
The American economy is surely in better shape today, but the fringe ideas (even from prominent commentators) for how to address growing federal debt are neither less numerous nor less dangerous. 
From the left comes the proposition that given the slow economy, we should defer attending to the problem of mounting obligations - and the truly delusional idea that growing federal debt doesn't matter because we owe most of it to ourselves.
Meanwhile, conservatives have put forth increasingly draconian budget plans. In his new book, my friend David Stockman stumps for a balanced budget amendment, a potentially disastrous idea that should have exited the stage years ago.
It's time for the sensible center to rise up and push for a rational approach to our fiscal challenges.
Above all, we must not become dispirited to the point where we repeat past mistakes of embracing superficially appealing, but ultimately deleterious, radical ideas.
So let's be clear about a few key principles of a centrist solution. First, there is no conflict between believing that we urgently need to address our long-term fiscal problems and also need to support short-term initiatives to boost our economy.
But any such measures should be temporary and focus on investment projects that will enhance our competitiveness. Additional tax cuts or consumption-oriented spending programs would provide no more benefit for the economy than dropping hundred-dollar bills from airplanes.
Second, our long-term fiscal challenges are genuinely frightening and can't be airbrushed away. In addition to $12 trillion of debt held by the public, we've racked up, by various projections, some four times that amount in unfunded obligations, principally for Medicare and Social Security.
Yes, this is money that we've taken out of our children's pockets: money that should have paid for our own retirement and health care bills, which our children will almost certainly end up paying instead.
The magnitude of these obligations is just too gargantuan to ever be fully reversed, but we must start now to bend that curve, particularly because any changes in Medicare and Social Security must be phased in over a long period of time. (The menu of policy options is, by now, familiar; we need to start making hard choices.)
That said, in a fragile economy, with the average American still earning less than he did a dozen years ago (after adjustment for inflation), federal belt tightening must occur gradually, a concept that is apparently foreign to both Mr. Stockman and Representative Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee.
For his part, Mr. Ryan seeks a balanced budget over the next 10 years, which he would achieve by eviscerating core programs from Medicaid to food stamps while repealing Mr. Obama's health care plan (but retaining the new revenue embedded in it).
So draconian are his cuts in these programs that he achieves balance in his budget without touching Social Security or cutting materially more from Medicare over the next 10 years than Mr. Obama would.
As a consequence, Mr. Stockman has derided Mr. Ryan as "intellectually dishonest" and his budget as "bogus."
But he says little about his own plans for Medicare and Social Security, other than that their benefits should be tied to recipients' incomes.
As for Mr. Stockman's intentions with regard to the rest of the budget, we get a clue in his call to eliminate 10 cabinet departments and Federal agencies. Heaven help us if he should ever have his hands on the nation's budget levers again.
The fact is, we will not balance the budget in this country anytime soon - the size of our unfunded liabilities and the costs of our aging society would make doing so irresponsible.
And in any event, modest budget deficits can be part of a responsible fiscal policy, particularly if government spending can be tilted toward investment-oriented areas.
But at the moment, our fiscal policy can't be described as anything resembling responsible. For us to make progress, the time has come for the centrists to reclaim the stage from the extremists.

HEADLINE: Wrestling's Private Equity Champion

BYLINE: LYNNLEY BROWNING


HIGHLIGHT: Michael Novogratz, a principal at the Fortress Investment Group and former Princeton wrestler, is trying to get wresting restored to the Olympics after the International Olympic Committee voted to eliminate the sport from the Games starting in 2020. 

 BODY:
Michael Novogratz, a principal at the Fortress Investment Group and former Princeton wrestler, is trying to score an emergency takedown. Since the International Olympic Committee voted to eliminate wrestling starting in 2020, Mr. Novogratz has been working the phones from a war room inside Fortress's 46th-floor headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. 
His goal - to restore the sport's Olympic berth - has been sharpened into a strategic overhaul of wrestling's standing, akin to a corporate turnaround. 
"This is now, like, my part-time job," said Mr. Novogratz, a co-founder of Fortress Investment Group, a private equity and hedge fund group that manages more than $53 billion in assets. 
 He and volunteers, including Greg Elinsky, a former champion wrestler in the National Collegiate Athletic Association who spent 11 years at Goldman Sachs, aim to raise $3 million to hire marketing and public relations firms and strategists to lobby for the sport. Time is short: the I.O.C. meets in St. Petersburg, Russia, in May, then in Buenos Aires in September to take a final vote on the issue. 
So far, Wall Street's little-known wrestling club has raised $1.2 million. Contributors include James Dinan, the chief executive of hedge fund York Capital Management, whose son, Michael, wrestles at Horace Mann School in the Bronx and was a waterboy for the United States wrestling team in last year's London Games; Richard Tavoso, Mr. Novogratz's college teammate who is head of global arbitrage and trading at RBC Capital Markets; Todd Boehly, the president of investment firm Guggenheim Partners who was a Maryland State champion in high school; Andrew Barth, a bond manager at American Funds who wrestled at Columbia University; and Paul Tudor Jones II, the billionaire founder of the Tudor Group, a hedge fund firm. (Mr. Jones did not wrestle but was a welterweight boxing champion at the University of Virginia.) 
But amid the drama inside the I.O.C. and the International Association of Associated Styles, the sport's international governing body known as Fila, the task involves herculean wrangling as much as hard-nosed strategizing. 
"The I.O.C makes decisions based upon political and personal animosities and friendships," said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor specializing in sports at Smith College. "It's an irrational process." 
 In coming days, Mr. Novogratz, the new spokesman for U.S.A. Wrestling, the sport's governing body in the United States, plans to court two million American enthusiasts to help unify the sport's major Web sites. 
The organization recently hired KOM Sports Marketing, a branding agency in Colorado Springs, Colo., where the United States Olympic Committee is based. Another goal: having Fila hire Teneo Holdings, a consulting and investment firm, to press wrestling's cause. 
Mr. Novogratz, the founder of Beat the Streets, a wrestling program in New York, sees wrestling's popularity in Iran, Japan, Turkey and Central Asia as untold selling points. 
On another front, he wants to see a promotional film made with cameos by Ray Lewis, the just-retired N.F.L. linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens and the actors Ashton Kutcher, who wrestled in high school, and Channing Tatum, who plays an Olympic wrestler in the forthcoming movie "Foxcatcher."

HIGHLIGHT: North Korea&#8217;s leader looks increasingly isolated in his war of words with the outside world. But Pyongyang&#8217;s European spokesman says Kim Jong-un can still rely on a dedicated band of devotees abroad. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Kim Jong-un may lead the world's most isolated state, but the North Korean leader is not entirely without foreign allies as tensions rise on the Korean peninsula.
According to his top man in Europe, an aristocratic Spaniard named Alejandro Cao de Benós, foreign volunteers have flocked to sign up for an International Defense Brigade to defend the country in the event of a showdown with the United States.
Around 430 had put their names down by Tuesday, the former IT consultant told Spain's El Confidencial Digital news Web site shortly before he headed for Pyongyang. 
The 38-year-old special delegate of North Korea's Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries says on his blog that he started recruiting for the Brigade after receiving hundreds of e-mails from sympathizers around the world who wanted to do something to help confront the U.S. military menace.

- Alejandro Cao (@DPRK_CAODEBENOS)3 Apr 13
As founder of the Korean Friendship Association, Mr. Cao de Benós has moved up the ranks in Pyongyang to become the only foreigner to work officially for the North Korean government, which has granted him honorary citizenship. 
He claims the K.F.A. has 15,000 members. It attracts the kind of niche enthusiasts who "jostle to outdo each other with their trainspotters' grasp of the minutiae of North Korean life," according to Tim Hume of Britain's The Independent.
Despite Mr. Cao de Benós's devotion to all things North Korean, it took him a decade of wooing the authorities in Pyongyang before he was granted permission to set up the country's first Web site, which has since painted an invariably rosy picture of life north of the 38th parallel.
Mr. Cao de Benós has said he was first drawn to North Korea in 1990 when, as a serious-minded teenager, he was seeking a solution to the world's problems.
"I didn't want to dedicate my life to be a slave in the capitalist system," he told Mr. Page in an interview last year. "My dream was to be a part of the revolution."
Born in the Catalan city of Tarragona to an aristocratic family with a strong military tradition, he says he is heir to the titles of Baron of Les, Count of Argelejo and Marquis of Rosalmonte and has not given up the idea of one day claiming them, according to El Confidencial Digital.
As Pyongyang's voice to the outside world, the portly former soldier has been much in demand in the present crisis. But, as he explains on his Facebook page, he is turning down further interviews until he gets back from Pyongyang at the end of the month.
Before he left, he insisted that new sanctions on Pyongyang would barely affect the North Korean economy. "We want peace," he told Russia Today's Spanish-language service. "But we won't go on our knees to get it."
As for his International Defense Brigade, he says the list is open until mid July when it will be handed to Pyongyang as a gesture of solidarity with the North Korean people in their "just cause."

HEADLINE: Marriage and Historical Inevitability

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: A response to the more determinist arguments for why marriage has declined. 

 BODY:
And now to finish up my triptychof replies to Kevin Drum on marriage. Here's his conclusion:
The economic and social forces behind the decline in marriage are decades old: stagnant incomes for men, growing incomes for women, an incarceration explosion that's left black male communities decimated, and a feminist revolution that made single parenthood more socially acceptable. Against that backdrop, I guess I find it unlikely that a fairly esoteric debate about procreation, which took place mostly among the chattering classes, had a significant impact on the people who are actually abandoning marriage.
My last post tried to deal a bit with the question of whether the debate about procreation is really esoteric, but I want to use Drum's "take the long view" point to discuss the more determinist arguments for current trends in marriage culture, which I've been reading lately from a lot of writers I respect. 
Drum is basically making the liberal version, which tends to focus on the deep power of post-1960s socioeconomic trends; you can find another take in this post by the Atlantic's Derek Thompson, which emphasizes the changing economic incentives (including, to his credit, the incentives created by legal abortion) facing working class couples since the 1970s. Up to a point, theirs is an argument that I agree with, in the sense that I think everything from wage stagnation to mass incarceration to the impact of the Great Recession is important to understanding what's been happening to the social fabric in middle America, and important to designing any kind of policy response.
But I also think culture and economics, ideas and incentives, are all entangled at a deep level, working in cycles and feedback loops rather than in simple causal arrows - and thus it's a mistake to treat changes in what people believe, and particularly the sweeping generational changes in how Americans conceptualize the links between sex and marriage and procreation, just as epiphenomena of economic pressure. And it's a particularly convenient mistake for social liberals, because it enables them to downplay the fact that these changes are also their own ideological victories - victories that have been accompanied by, well, many of the negative consequences that social conservatives warned against in the first place. In large ways and small, and now at a suddenly-accelerating pace (today gay marriage, tomorrow marijuana legalization, etc.), we're getting the culture that social liberalism wants - less traditionally religious and more socially permissive, with fewer normative ideas about how sex and love and childbearing fit together. And if conservatives would profit from acknowledging the economic forces shaping these realities, liberals would profit from acknowledging that maybe, just maybe, a cultural transformation that they've long favored is coming at a cost.
Then there's a still-deeper form of determinism on these questions, which acknowledges the significance of culture and the power of ideology and ideas, but then argues that today's trend away from the institutional/procreative view of marriage is simply too deeply rooted in the logic of modern liberal society to be shifted from its course. Here's Damon Linker taking us back to the cultural revolution wrought by the birth control pill to explain why the contemporary landscape was inevitable; here's Noah Millman taking us back to women's suffrage; here's Dan McCarthy taking us back to Thomas Hobbes.
And up to a point, I agree with their arguments as well. I was pretty much convinced that gay marriage was inevitable ten years ago (maybe because I read this remarkably prescient Ramesh Ponnuru piece), and most everything I've written on the subject in the last few years has been informed by that assumption. If a serious look at culture vindicates social conservatives in certain ways, it also helps explains why they've lost, and lost, and lost.
But to the cultural inevitabilists I'd just say this: As much as liberalism and modernity and the sexual revolution have reshaped human relations, they have not - or not yet, pending the Singularity - alchemized human nature into something entirely different. A glance at post-1960s trends will demonstrate that the birth control pill did not actually sever sex from pregnancy and childbearing. An hour in a nursery will remind you that the decline of the two-parent family hasn't eliminated the basic desire of children to know their parents. A fair-minded look at the fabric of American life will reveal significant advantages to being connected to the kind of communities that are still shaped by the older marital ideal. And both politics and writing, in different ways, exist in part to assert human agency in the face of trends that seem inexorable and impersonal - to hold up ideals even when fewer people are living up to them, to try to shape and redirect trends rather than taking them as a given, to mitigate the excesses of revolutions and try to preserve the best of the old even when the new comes rushing in.
I understand the unfolding historical logic of the retreat from marriage as well as anyone, and I'm under no illusions that the present move to formally redefine the institution represents any kind of uniquely transformative moment in that process. But it's the moment we're in now, and so it affords an opportunity to talk about the process as a whole, to raise questions about whether our current historical momentum is identical with progress, to note the merits of alternative models that we're not only drifting away from but, as of now, deliberately leaving behind.
That doesn't mean pretending that there's some political strategy the Republican Party should embrace to turn public opinion on a dime: There isn't, and that's been obvious for a while. But even when you're in the process of surrendering on a particular point, it makes a difference how surrender happens, and what - if anything - you can persuade your victorious opponents to concede. Because even when change seems inevitable, the pace of that change is not; because history is littered with trends that seemed unstoppable and then stopped; because ideas can hibernate as well as die. And because nobody knows the future.
Nobody knows the future.

HEADLINE: The Employment Rate

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The share of Americans with jobs may tell us more about the state of the recovery than the unemployment rate. 

 BODY:
Spare a moment for an overlooked economic indicator: The employment rate.
The government said Friday that 58.5 percent of Americans over the age of 16 had jobs in March. 
This employment rate has held remarkably steady since 2010, never higher than 58.7 percent or lower than 58.2 percent. Job creation has basically kept pace with population growth. Nothing more. The share of Americans with jobs is still stuck about 5 percentage points lower than before the recession.
This may seem surprising. After all, the unemployment rate - the labor market indicator that gets all the attention - has fallen from 9.8 percent to 7.6 percent over the same three-year period.
But it's only surprising because people tend to treat the unemployment rate as an inversion of the employment rate. In fact, the government counts people as unemployed only if they are actively looking for work. A majority of unemployed people fall into a third category: neither working nor looking.
It is this third category, which in March included about 36.7 percent of all American adults, that has grown as official unemployment has declined. 
Some of those people are retired or disabled. Some are stay-at-home parents. And some of them have stopped looking for work because they have given up hope of finding work. The government estimates membership in each of these groups. It is clear, for example, that a growing share of Americans is elderly. But it is impossible to know how many 66-year-olds would return to work if jobs were available, or how many parents would put children in day care if they could earn enough to cover the cost. 
The unemployment rate treats all of these people as invisible. The employment rate treats them all as potential workers. The truth surely lies in between: It has become a little easier, but not much, to find work if you want it. 
An earlier version of this post misstated the percentage of American adults who are neither working nor looking for work. In March, the figure was about 36.7 percent, not 34 percent.

HEADLINE: Discuss Tensions on the Korean Peninsula

BYLINE: SHREEYA SINHA and SU HYUN LEE


HIGHLIGHT: To supplement the reporting of our colleagues on the ground, The Lede would like to hear from readers who live on the Korean peninsula or have family members there. 

 BODY:
As our colleague Martin Fackler reports, "Despite the steady drum beat of war talk, life seems to go on as usual in most of South Korea," even near the heavily fortified border that separates the American ally from the increasingly belligerent North.
To supplement the reporting of our colleagues on the ground, The Lede would like to hear from readers who live on the Korean peninsula or have family members there. Have the increasing tensions affected you? What should the South Korean government and the international community do to address the issue? Join the discussion by submitting a comment in the thread below, in English or Korean, or post your thoughts on Twitter, with the hashtag #NYTWorld. We will update this post with a selection of views. 
For a sample of what is being said in South Korea this week, here is some of what three Seoul residents told Su Hyun Lee of The Times this week. (Their comments were translated and edited for clarity.)
 Seong-ki Kim, 71, who is retired:
Nothing has changed in my life because I feel that even though the rhetoric is heightened, I don't think North Korea will actually do anything because it would mean demise for them as well. I think North Korea is doing this to put its people and South Koreans in constant fear so they can control them.
We have our own defense system, don't we? I think the government is doing well. But I don't think we should stimulate North Korea too much. I think the press is causing problems because North Korea seems to be triggered by the rowdy press.
 Kyu-hyun Kim, 60, who owns a convenience store:
The economy seems to be wobbling. People aren't buying as much and everything seems a little confused. This is not like the past where we could survive on our own. If I die, we all die. If we live, we will all live.
Nothing has shown to be dangerous so far, but the biggest variable is the Kaesong industrial complex. We can't cut North Korea off because this would not be good for both Koreas and for North Korea in particular.
Kim Jong-un concerns me, however. His father used to provoke bit by bit, but this young leader is making all these outrageous threats just to show something to the world. I am worried that he might actually try to attack on the spur of the moment.
The best course is to calm North Korea down. I think there will be conflict of some sort coming up. But as the proverb goes, "Soil hardens after rain." I hope upcoming limited conflicts can help us avoid all-out war.
 Dae-gi Ahn, 32, who works in advertising:
I think Park Geun-hye is handling things very well at the moment and I am very happy with the current defense minister.
I think South Korea should be tougher at this moment and we should not return to engagement policies toward North Korea like the sunshine policy of the past liberal governments. We should be more aggressively firm now that they are trying to close down Kaesong industrial complex and show them that we have strength. We need to show them that with the alliance with the United States, North Korea is nothing.
I have a feeling that something like the Cheonan corvette sinking will happen again soon. I don't think North Korea will try anything bigger than that kind of provocation, though, because they know how strong the Korea-U.S. alliance is, particularly with the backing of the U.N. and other members of the international community.

HEADLINE: Judge Approves MF Global Liquidation Plan

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Judge Martin Glenn of the United States Bankruptcy Court on Friday cleared the way for the defunct brokerage firm to sell its remaining assets and return money to creditors. 

 BODY:
A day after MF Global's bankruptcy trustee hinted he might sue top executives for "negligent conduct," his separate plan to liquidate the firm secured court approval, ushering in a final phase of a case that rattled Wall Street and prompted a federal investigation. 
At a hearing in bankruptcy court in Manhattan on Friday, nearly 18 months after the brokerage firm imploded, Judge Martin Glenn cleared the way for Louis J. Freeh, the trustee, to sell the firm's remaining assets and return money to creditors. For Mr. Freeh, a former director of the F.B.I. who is liquidating MF Global's estate, the ruling was a major step toward ending the largest Wall Street bankruptcy since the financial crisis.
 When the firm collapsed - and improperly tapped customer money to plug a gap in its own finances - the blowup consumed Wall Street and Washington. MF Global, then run by Jon S. Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey, became a byword for excessive risk-taking and the target of a federal investigation into $1.6 billion in missing customer money.
Criminal and civil investigations continue. And in a report released on Thursday, Mr. Freeh suggested that he might sue Mr. Corzine and other top executives, accusing them of engineering a "risky business strategy" and ignoring "glaring deficiencies" in internal controls.
Mr. Freeh pointed to Mr. Corzine's outsize bet on European debt. While the bonds were not by themselves to blame for the fall of MF Global, the bet alarmed investors and rating agencies, sending the firm into a tailspin.
Mr. Freeh agreed to postpone the lawsuit while he pursued mediation with Mr. Corzine. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine argued that "there simply is no basis for the suggestion that Mr. Corzine breached his fiduciary duties or was negligent." The spokesman, Steven Goldberg, added that "the trustee's report, with its allegations of negligent conduct, is a clear case of Monday-morning quarterbacking."
Judge Glenn's decision to approve the liquidation plan will empower Mr. Freeh to wind down his role in the case. When the plan becomes effective, he will hand the reins in part to a committee of MF Global creditors.
Mr. Freeh attended the hearing on Friday to speak in favor of the liquidation deal.
Under the plan, MF Global will pay up to 34 percent of claims filed by hedge funds and other unsecured creditors that owned MF Global bonds. The hedge funds, including Silver Point Capital, supported the plan.
JPMorgan Chase, one of MF Global's largest lenders, will fare better. The bank is expected to collect up to 76 percent of its claims under the plan approved on Friday.
The firm's customers, whose money vanished after the bankruptcy, are also poised for a big payout. James W. Giddens, a trustee whose job was to return money to customers, has recovered most of the funds from MF Global's banks and clearinghouses. Mr. Giddens, who already returned about 89 percent of the missing money, recently sought court approval to dole out up to about 97 percent.

HEADLINE: China Escalates Its Response to Outbreak of Avian Flu

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Shi Da contributed research from Beijing. Donald G. McNeil Jr. contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- With confirmation that a sixth person has died from a mysterious avian-borne virus, Chinese officials escalated their response on Friday, advising people to avoid live poultry, sending virologists to chicken farms across the country and slaughtering more than 20,000 birds at a wholesale market in Shanghai where the virus, known as H7N9, was detected in a pigeon.
News of the outbreak dominated China's main Internet portals. There were photographs of workers in white coveralls carrying out the culling in Shanghai and recommendations that people take banlangen, a popular herbal cold remedy. Anxious residents have been crowding emergency rooms at the first sign of respiratory problems. And at a KFC restaurant in Beijing, employees stood idle as mounds of fried chicken went largely unsold. 
''They say it's O.K. to eat cooked chicken, but I'd rather not take the chance,'' Zhang Minyu, 41, said as she coaxed her young son to order a soft-serve ice cream instead.
Roughly 10 years after severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, began here and spread across the globe, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing nearly 800, the deadly influenza outbreak is testing a government known for its lack of transparency and reluctance to divulge damaging news. The timing has not helped: The Chinese public has already been outraged by record levels of air pollution this year, and have been frustrated by the government's apparent inability to determine the source or cause of deaths of more than 16,000 pigs found floating last month in the river that supplies drinking water for Shanghai.
Although some critics have asked why it took so long to publicly announce the outbreak of the H7N9 virus, public health experts have so far commended the government for responsiveness and transparency in the five days since officials identified the first victims.
''It was the Ministry of Health and Family Planning that first came to us and volunteered the information,'' said Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization in Geneva. ''Their response has been excellent.''
Health officials around the world are monitoring the outbreak, which has killed nearly half of the 14 people in whom the virus has been diagnosed. What they fear most is that the disease will mutate so that it can spread from human to human; there has yet to be a confirmed case of transmission between humans. However, the state news media on Friday reported that Shanghai officials had placed in quarantine a person with flulike symptoms who had contact with a victim of H7N9.
Experts say the virus appears to respond to existing influenza medications like Tamiflu and Relenza. In the United States, federal health officials on Thursday said they had begun working on a vaccine for H7N9.
At the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's first news conference about the H7N9 outbreak, its director, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, said close cooperation between his organization and its Chinese counterpart had helped enable China to post the sequence of the new virus on a public database. He said Americans planning to go to China should still go, but follow longstanding recommendations to avoid birds and other animals.
John Oxford, a professor of virology at Queen Mary, University of London, warned of a potential pandemic should H7N9 undergo a mutation that allows human-to-human transmission. ''On my earthquake scale, I'm quite concerned because influenzas have a greater history of emerging and spreading,'' he said.
His worries were heightened, he said, by the relatively high fatality rate and the virus's apparent spread through poultry without any evident signs of illness. Referring to another avian virus, one that since 2003 has decimated poultry stocks in Southeast Asia and killed more than 300 people, he said, ''If a flock of chickens or ducks gets H5N1, it will kill them and set off alarm bells, but this virus seems to be a bit more tricky.''
Even the government acknowledges that SARS was a public health debacle. The Chinese authorities tried to conceal the outbreak, hiding sick patients from the World Health Organization, whose members were barred for five weeks from visiting Guangdong Province, the outbreak's epicenter. The secrecy, experts agree, allowed the virus to spread within China and across the globe.
Writing on his microblog account, Yu Shenghai, a researcher at the China Economic Research Center, warned the authorities against hiding information about the current outbreak. ''I hope the government won't be self-deceiving and mislead ordinary people,'' he wrote. ''We learned a lesson from SARS with a cost of blood. A nation is hopeless if it doesn't recall its past, and a government is incompetent if it doesn't reflect on its history.''

HEADLINE: Judge Approves Bank of America Settlement

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Bank of America on Friday won a federal judge's approval for a $2.43 billion settlement with investors who said the lender hid crucial information when it bought Merrill Lynch. The accord, among the largest investor settlements stemming from the recent global financial crisis, was approved by Federal District Judge P. Kevin Castel in Manhattan. Judge Castel called the settlement ''fair, reasonable and adequate.'' Shareholders said Merrill's mounting losses and bonus plans should have been disclosed before investors voted on the merger in December 2008. Bank of America denied the plaintiffs' claims, but the chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, has said the settlement would remove uncertainty for bank.

HEADLINE: Boehner Dismisses Talk of Budget Compromise Based on Obama's Numbers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The speaker of the House, John A. Boehner, waved aside reports on Friday that President Obama would seek a new budget compromise next week, accusing the president of again demanding tax increases in exchange for ''modest entitlement savings.''
''If the president believes these modest entitlement savings are needed to help shore up these programs, there's no reason they should be held hostage for more tax hikes,'' Mr. Boehner said in a statement. ''That's no way to lead and move the country forward.'' 
At the same time, Mr. Obama's supporters on the left quickly vented their anger about his plans, saying they would not accept changes to Social Security and Medicare that would threaten the programs and harm beneficiaries.
''Evidently the president either does not understand or does not care how critically important Social Security and Medicare are, not just to seniors but to middle-aged and younger workers for whom these programs are likely to be even more crucial,'' said Eric Kingson, a co-chairman of the Strengthen Social Security coalition, a group of unions and left-leaning organizations.
The sharp reaction was a preview of what is likely to come on Wednesday when the president formally unveils his annual budget for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. The New York Times reported on Friday that the document would call for a deal similar to the final compromise offer that Mr. Obama made to Mr. Boehner last year before talks fell apart -- cuts to entitlement programs in exchange for new revenues from tax increases.
Among those cuts is a change in the way inflation is calculated for Social Security called a ''chained'' Consumer Price Index, which Republicans have supported in the past. Administration officials said the president would only accept such proposals now if Republicans were willing to support increased revenues.
The reaction from both sides also demonstrates how little space there is in Washington for a bipartisan deal when it comes to tax and spending issues.
For the president, the budget proposal -- which will come two months after he is required by law to release a federal spending plan -- appears to be another attempt to test whether Republicans can accept further tax increases under any circumstances.
''It is not the ideal proposal, but the president recognizes, unlike, I guess, Republicans, that we're not in the business in Washington of getting everything we want,'' said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. ''That does not happen.''
But, Mr. Carney added, ''the president believes that we ought to deal with our deficit challenges in a balanced way, and he's looking for partners on the other side of the aisle who agree with him.''
To that end, the president is to have dinner with a dozen Republican senators on Wednesday evening just after he releases his budget.
The reaction from Mr. Boehner and other Republicans suggests that a deal remains elusive, in large part because Republicans remain suspicious about how far the president is willing to go in making serious entitlement cuts that would anger his supporters.
Mr. Boehner said that the president had ''never lived up to his rhetoric'' about being willing to cut entitlement programs.
''In reality, he's moved in the wrong direction, routinely taking off the table entitlement reforms he's previously told me he could support,'' Mr. Boehner said in his statement.
Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, the House majority leader, also seemed unimpressed. On CNBC's ''The Squawk Box,'' he said that if the president agreed with Republicans about some entitlement changes, he should agree to make them without additional tax increases.
Mr. Cantor said he did not understand ''why we just don't see the White House come forward and do the things that we agree on.'' But, he added, ''I am in a wait-and-see mode as to whether this White House is really serious.''
White House officials noted that the Social Security inflation proposal was something that Republican leaders, including Mr. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, once embraced.
''They have been advocated by Republicans,'' Mr. Carney told reporters Friday. ''It means Republicans' being willing to accept what speaker of the House John Boehner said was good policy three months ago -- not an outlandish request.''
Advocates of taking action to confront the nation's debt praised Mr. Obama's proposals. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the president's proposals ''point the way toward an emerging bipartisan consensus between the administration and Congressional leaders over essential fiscal issues.''
Liberals, however, are already balking.
''President Obama's plan to cut Social Security would harm seniors who worked hard all their lives,'' said Anna Galland, the executive director of the liberal group MoveOn.org. ''Under this plan, a typical 80-year-old woman would lose the equivalent of three months' worth of food every year. That's unconscionable.''

HEADLINE: Junk Bonds Get Junkier, but Still Sell Briskly

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
JUNK bonds have never been more popular, even if they no longer deserve to be called high-yield bonds, the more polite description that Wall Street prefers.
During the first quarter of this year, a record $133 billion of such bonds were sold around the world. While sales in the United States fell a little short of the record set in the third quarter of last year, that was more than made up for by rising sales in Europe and Asia.
At the same time, the yield on such bonds has fallen to the lowest level on record. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield index yielded 5.7 percent at the end of the quarter, as can be seen in the accompanying graph. That was down from 6.1 percent at the end of the year, and from 8.3 percent at the end of 2011. Junk bonds are those rated below investment grade by the bond rating agencies, and their current popularity reflects the search for yield by many investors, whose alternatives include savings accounts that pay almost nothing. 
To some, that is cause for concern. In a speech to the Economic Club of New York last week, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, pointed to ''potential excesses in certain corners of the financial markets,'' saying the high-yield market and the related leveraged loan market ''do seem somewhat frothy.''
He added, however, that even if those markets were to incur major setbacks, the overall economy might not be badly affected. ''The size of the asset classes in question is relatively modest, and most of the investors in these assets are not highly leveraged,'' he said. ''So if asset valuations were to adjust sharply and some investors experienced painful losses, I do not expect that such a shock would threaten financial stability.''
Since the last century, high-yield bonds have generally done better than stocks in good markets, and better than stocks in bad markets as well. In 2008, the Merrill Lynch high-yield index fell 26 percent, while the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index was a negative 37 percent. And when recovery came, the bonds rose more. In 2009, the bond index leapt more than 57 percent, well over the return of more than 26 percent on an investment in stocks. But that advantage has disappeared this year. In the first quarter, the bond index returned 2.9 percent -- including capital gains from rising prices and the interest received on the bonds. But the S.& P. 500, including reinvested dividends, rose 10.6 percent.
Martin Fridson, the chief executive of FridsonVision, a research firm, notes that the spread between Treasuries and junk bonds has fallen for three consecutive quarters. He says it is unlikely that will continue, and forecasts that spreads will widen in the current quarter. If so, investors in high-yield bonds could lose money as prices decline.
The perceived frothiness of the high-yield market would seem to be illustrated by the relatively low difference -- or spread -- between the yields on junk bonds and on United States Treasuries. At the end of the first quarter, it was 4.86 percentage points, well below the historical average.
Moreover, the yield on Merrill Lynch's index of lowest-quality junk bonds -- those rated CCC plus or lower by Standard & Poor's -- is 9.3 percent, only a few basis points higher than the record low set in spring 2007, as credit markets were about to fall. But Treasury rates were much higher then, so the level of speculation would seem to be much lower.
Mr. Fridson also noted that nearly a third of the companies that issued high-yield bonds for the first time in 2012 were among the lowest-quality borrowers. ''When high-yield managers are under pressure to invest large cash inflows, as they were last year, and when high-yield issuers feel no particular pressure to borrow, the financing window may open to lower-quality credits that would be excluded under other circumstances,'' he wrote in a commentary published by Standard & Poor's Leveraged Commentary and Data.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Junk Glitters: Global issuance of high-yield bonds -- also known as ''junk bonds'' -- reached a record $133 billion in the first quarter of 2013. That came as the average yield on such bonds reached a record low and the interest rate spread -- the difference between high-yield and Treasury bond yields -- fell well below historic averages. Over the last 13 years, such bonds have done much better than stocks. (Sources: Thomson Reuters

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees China as Lever to Press North Korea

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Jane Perlez contributed reporting from Beijing, and Neil MacFarquhar from the United Nations.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration, detecting what it sees as a shift in decades of Chinese support for North Korea, is pressuring China's new president, Xi Jinping, to crack down on the regime in Pyongyang or face a heightened American military presence in its region.
In a flurry of exchanges that included a recent phone call from President Obama to Mr. Xi, administration officials said, they have briefed the Chinese in detail about American plans to upgrade missile defenses and other steps to deter the increasingly belligerent threats made by North Korea's young leader, Kim Jong-un.
China, which has been deeply suspicious of the American desire to reassert itself in Asia, has not protested publicly or privately as the United States has deployed ships and warplanes to the Korean Peninsula. That silence, American officials say, attests to both Beijing's mounting frustration with the North and the recognition that its reflexive support for Pyongyang could strain its ties with Washington.
''The timing of this is important,'' Tom Donilon, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, said in an interview. ''It will be an important early exercise between the United States and China, early in the term of Xi Jinping and early in the second term of President Obama.'' 
While administration officials cautioned that Mr. Xi has been in office for only a few weeks and that China has a history of frustrating the United States in its dealings with North Korea, Mr. Donilon said he believed that China's position was ''evolving.''
Judging whether China has genuinely changed course on North Korea is tricky: Beijing has appeared to respond to American pressure before, only to backtrack later. China, the North's only strong ally, has long feared the United States would capitalize on the fall of the North Korean leadership by expanding American military influence on the Korean Peninsula.
Nor has China given clues about its intentions in its public statements, voicing grave concern about the rising tensions while being careful not to elevate Mr. Kim's stature.
Chinese analysts say there are internal debates within the Communist Party and the military about how to deal with Mr. Kim, and how strongly to enforce the United Nations' economic sanctions that China signed on to last month.
The White House said it was encouraged by how swiftly China had supported the sanctions, which followed a North Korean nuclear test and a missile launch. But some diplomats and analysts say China has dragged its feet in enforcing them.
In a meeting with two senior American officials who traveled to Beijing two weeks ago to try to persuade China to enforce new banking restrictions on North Korea, Chinese banking leaders showed little sign of compliance, said Marcus Noland, an expert on North Korea at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
''But I wouldn't expect them publicize it,'' even if they did move ahead, Mr. Noland added.
Many analysts say the sanctions cannot succeed without China's cooperation, since it has close trade ties with North Korea and has in the past chosen to keep its government afloat by providing fuel and significant aid.
China continues to say economic sanctions will not work. A Chinese diplomat who is involved in policy on North Korea said recently that he thought China would enforce the new United Nations sanctions to a point but would not go as far as the Obama administration wanted.
Even if China does cooperate, it is unclear how far North Korea might bend; North Korea ignored China's entreaties not to conduct the nuclear test in February that set off the latest conflict with the United States and South Korea.
In the coming weeks, the White House will send a stream of senior officials to China to press its case, starting with Secretary of State John Kerry, who will travel to Beijing next Saturday, on an Asian tour that will also take him to South Korea and Japan.
In the short run, officials said, the administration wants the Chinese to be rigorous in customs inspections to interdict the flow of banned goods to North Korea. More broadly, it wants China to persuade Mr. Kim to cease his provocations and agree to negotiations on giving up his nuclear program.
On Friday, North Korea stoked tensions further by advising Russia, Britain and other countries that they might want to evacuate their embassies in Pyongyang in case of hostilities, according to Russian and British officials. Analysts dismissed the warning as a ploy to frighten the United States and its allies, perhaps to finally force concessions.
In Beijing, officials said Mr. Kerry also wants to reinvigorate the dialogue with China on climate change. And the United States is pushing the Chinese leadership to crack down on the proliferation of cyberattacks on American government and commercial interests originating in China.
Making progress on those issues will be easier if Washington is in sync with Beijing over North Korea. A week after Mr. Kerry's visit, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will spend four days in China to try to improve communication between the American and Chinese militaries. Any problem there is especially dangerous now, officials say, given China's expanded military ambitions and the intensified American activity in the region.
Mr. Donilon plans to visit Beijing in May. Part of the heavy rotation of diplomacy, officials said, is to compensate for the fact that Mr. Obama is not scheduled to meet Mr. Xi until September.
Based on their meetings with Mr. Xi so far, administration officials said they believed he viewed Beijing's relationship with Pyongyang more pragmatically than his predecessor, Hu Jintao, whose reluctance to act against Pyongyang so frustrated Mr. Obama that in 2010 he accused the Chinese of ''willful blindness'' toward North Korea.
Last month, Mr. Xi spoke by phone with the new president of South Korea, Park Geun-hye, telling Ms. Park how much China prized its ties with South Korea and offering China's assistance in the ''reconciliation and cooperation'' of the two Koreas. Such sentiments, analysts said, would have been inconceivable from President Hu.
By contrast, there has been little high-level contact between Mr. Kim and Chinese officials, which American officials cited as evidence of growing irritation on the part of the Chinese.
''What we have seen is a subtle change in Chinese thinking,'' Kurt M. Campbell, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, said in a speech Thursday at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. The Chinese now believe North Korea's actions are ''antithetical'' to their national security interests, he said.
That thinking has also surfaced in recent articles by Chinese scholars that have called into question China's policy. Deng Yuwen, the influential deputy editor of a Communist Party journal, wrote in The Financial Times that ''Beijing should give up on Pyongyang and press for the reunification of the Korean Peninsula.''
And yet Mr. Deng has since been suspended from his job, which underscores how little China's attitude has changed.
Some voices are urging China not to be rattled by the crisis. A hawkish major general in the People's Liberation Army, Luo Yuan, who often writes in the Chinese state-run news media, appeared unperturbed by the actions of Mr. Kim or by the dispatch of American ships and planes in support of South Korea.
When the current American and South Korean joint military exercises end this month, he wrote in a blog post on China's social media site, Sina Weibo, North Korea will calm down and return to the status quo of ''no war, no unification,'' which remains in China's favor.
Jeffrey A. Bader, a former Asia adviser to Mr. Obama, said he believes that any change will be subtle. The Chinese, he said, ''will continue to use similar language, and their public demeanor will be similar, but quietly, they will be much more aggressive, much more fed up and much more prepared to treat North Korea differently than in the past.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Falls As Exports Rise Sharply

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in February, the government reported Friday, as exports climbed near a record and the volume of imported crude oil fell to the lowest level in 17 years. 
The gap between exports and imports shrank to $43 billion in February, down 3.4 percent from a revised $44.5 billion in January, the Commerce Department said on Friday. It was the smallest trade imbalance since December, when the gap had declined to $38.1 billion, the lowest point in nearly three years.
Exports rose 0.8 percent, to $186 billion, close to the record set in December. Stronger exports of energy products and autos offset declines in sales of airplanes and farm equipment.
Imports were flat at $228.9 billion, with the volume of crude oil falling to the lowest point since March 1996.
The deficit with China shrank to $23.4 billion, the lowest point in 11 months. Exports to the European Union were down 0.9 percent in February, compared with January.
Through the first two months of this year, the United States deficit is running at an annual rate of $524.5 billion, down slightly from the $539.5 billion imbalance last year.
Economists expect the deficit this year will narrow slightly, in part because of continued gains in energy exports. A narrower trade gap lifts growth because it means American companies are earning more from overseas sales while domestic consumers and businesses are spending less on foreign products.
The economy as measured by the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 0.4 percent in the October-December quarter. Economists say they believe economic growth strengthened in the January-March quarter to around 3 percent.
In addition to increases in energy exports, economists are hopeful that exports of other products will rise this year as well, helped by stronger growth in some major export markets.
That forecast is based on an assumption that the European debt crisis will stabilize, helping lift exports to that region, and that growth in Asia will rebound further. The outlook for Europe has been clouded recently by problems in Cyprus and new worries that the debt troubles could destabilize more countries.

HEADLINE: MF Global Liquidation Plan Wins Approval From Court

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
A day after MF Global's bankruptcy trustee hinted he might sue top executives for ''negligent conduct,'' his separate plan to liquidate the firm secured court approval, ushering in a final phase of a case that rattled Wall Street and prompted a federal investigation. 
At a hearing in bankruptcy court in Manhattan on Friday, nearly 18 months after the brokerage firm imploded, Judge Martin Glenn cleared the way for Louis J. Freeh, the trustee, to sell the firm's remaining assets and return money to creditors. For Mr. Freeh, a former director of the F.B.I. who is liquidating MF Global's estate, the ruling was a major step toward ending the largest Wall Street bankruptcy since the financial crisis.
When the firm collapsed -- and improperly tapped customer money to plug a gap in its own finances -- the blowup consumed Wall Street and Washington. MF Global, then run by Jon S. Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey, became a byword for excessive risk-taking and the target of a federal investigation into $1.6 billion in missing customer money.
Criminal and civil investigations continue. And in a report released on Thursday, Mr. Freeh suggested that he might sue Mr. Corzine and other top executives, accusing them of engineering a ''risky business strategy'' and ignoring ''glaring deficiencies'' in internal controls.
Mr. Freeh pointed to Mr. Corzine's outsize bet on European debt. While the bonds were not by themselves to blame for the fall of MF Global, the bet alarmed investors and rating agencies, sending the firm into a tailspin.
Mr. Freeh agreed to postpone the lawsuit while he pursued mediation with Mr. Corzine. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine argued that ''there simply is no basis for the suggestion that Mr. Corzine breached his fiduciary duties or was negligent.'' The spokesman, Steven Goldberg, added that ''the trustee's report, with its allegations of negligent conduct, is a clear case of Monday-morning quarterbacking.''
Judge Glenn's decision to approve the liquidation plan will empower Mr. Freeh to wind down his role in the case. When the plan becomes effective, he will hand the reins in part to a committee of MF Global creditors.
Mr. Freeh attended the hearing on Friday to speak in favor of the liquidation deal.
Under the plan, MF Global will pay up to 34 percent of claims filed by hedge funds and other unsecured creditors that owned MF Global bonds. The hedge funds, including Silver Point Capital, supported the plan.
JPMorgan Chase, one of MF Global's largest lenders, will fare better. The bank is expected to collect up to 76 percent of its claims under the plan approved on Friday.
The firm's customers, whose money vanished after the bankruptcy, are also poised for a big payout. James W. Giddens, a trustee whose job was to return money to customers, has recovered most of the funds from MF Global's banks and clearinghouses. Mr. Giddens, who already returned about 89 percent of the missing money, recently sought court approval to dole out up to about 97 percent.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: If It's Aliens, At Least They Won't Be Naked

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
Lots of outlets -- Nickelodeon, ABC Family, the Disney Channel -- have taken aim at that elusive, possibly nonexistent swath of Americans who just want to be able to watch television together as a family without worrying that something distasteful or inappropriate for children will pop up. But everyone seems to have a different idea of what kind of content that demographic craves.
The newest competitor to enter the scrum is BYUtv, an offshoot of Brigham Young University, which on Sunday rolls out its first original drama series, ''Granite Flats.'' The show is set in the early 1960s, and this particular definition of family-friendly TV seems at first glance to have the television families of that era -- the Cleavers, the Nelsons, the Andersons -- in mind as its target audience. 
The show combines small-town drama and a science-fiction vibe and, for the youngsters, throws in a sort of Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew element, serving it all up with kid gloves. In this series, when a schoolyard bully and the new boy in town get into a fight, we see the initial shove, then the episode cuts to a commercial, and by the time it returns, the fight is over.
As the series opens, unusual chunks of metal have fallen from the sky onto Granite Flats, a military town in Colorado, with the casualties including a bird bath and a sheep. Also, a new family has just arrived: Beth Milligan (Annie Tedesco), a nurse, and her 10-year-old son, Arthur (Jonathan Morgan Heit). Beth's husband, an Air Force pilot, has recently died under circumstances that promise to remain unclear for a long while. Arthur, as he settles into his new home, sees a comet flash across the sky.
The local police chief begins to investigate the chunks of metal, but so do Arthur and two nerdy friends from school (Charlie Plummer and Malia Tyler). Meanwhile, at the military base, there is a huge explosion. Viewers can see that the culprit is probably a gas line damaged by that falling metal, but the townspeople go nuts, this being the middle of the cold war. They assume the Soviets have attacked.
And that seems like the connection point between the people of Granite Flats and the people who presumably are the intended audience for ''Granite Flats'': fear bordering on paranoia. The fictional Granite Flats residents of the early '60s are right to be afraid, because a lot of disruption is right around the corner: hippies, hard rock, black power, R-rated movies, Earth Day, soaring divorce rates, MTV, the global economy, cellphones, the Internet, ''16 and Pregnant.'' The people whom ''Granite Flats'' seems aimed at might well prefer to turn the clock back to a time before all of those things.
But hold on. It's easy to stereotype those who want a more family-friendly type of television as head-in-the-sand reactionaries who salute the flag every morning and then home-school their kids, yet that's an oversimplification. Having conservative social and political values is not the same thing as willful ignorance.
And it's possible that the people behind ''Granite Flats'' recognize this. A news release about the series says that it is ''based on little-known documented events from an ethically disputable chapter in United States military history.''
Hmm. Could it be that this show, with its sometimes clunky acting and its shopworn family dynamics, is actually going to explore the contradictions inherent in being conservative these days: flag saluters with a suspicion of government; family-values folks whose own families are often a mess?
A few more episodes will tell. Over the series's opening credits, the old Skeeter Davis song plays, the one with the lyric ''Don't they know it's the end of the world?'' It's either a blatant bit of audience-baiting or a refreshingly self-deprecating wink.

HEADLINE: Undersea Gas Offers Cyprus Hope for Future

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
LONDON -- If there are any bright spots in the gloom surrounding the economy of Cyprus, one place to look would be about 170 kilometers south of the coastal city of Limassol. There, about 1,700 meters below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea, is a potentially lucrative natural gas field called Aphrodite.
Noble Energy, the Houston-based company that found Aphrodite in 2011, has drilled only a single exploratory well in the mile-deep water 100 miles south of the island. But based on that early look, the company estimates that the field contains 142 billion to 227 billion cubic meters, or 5 trillion to 8 trillion cubic feet, of gas. It is a significant find -- potentially worth $45 billion or more at current prices, if it proves extractable. That would be enough to supply Cyprus's domestic needs for years and turn the debt-strapped country into an energy exporter.
''I am certain that gas will be the answer to our future,'' said Charles Ellinas, chief executive of the Cyprus National Hydrocarbons Co., a state concern that was recently formed to help spearhead development of a Cypriot natural gas industry. 
Cyprus has the potential to become one of the hubs of an eastern Mediterranean region that could become an important source of natural gas for Europe, at a time when political unrest is making supplies from North Africa uncertain.
Over the past two decades an Israeli-American-led group of small and midsize oil companies has made a series of big discoveries in what is known as the Levantine basin, an area loosely bounded by Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Egypt. Israel, which has begun gradually tapping the gas, began production in a big offshore field called Tamar on March 30.
Gideon Tadmor is the chairman of Delek Drilling and chief executive of Avner Oil, affiliates of Delek Group, an Israeli company that has led exploration in the area since the 1990s. He said the Israeli oil explorers had taken their cues from successful previous exploration to the south, in waters off Egypt. ''We had a notion there was a good reason for the geological play to extend beyond the geopolitical borders,'' Mr. Tadmor said.
While it is still hard to predict how large an exporter the eastern Mediterranean might eventually become, it is attracting industry attention well beyond the region.
''If you look at new sources of supply in the eastern Mediterranean, with what we've seen in Cyprus, in Israel and other places -- you've got to say those will probably be the real competition,'' said Al Cook, a vice president on the giant Shah Deniz pipeline project that BP is leading in Azerbaijan, which is meant to transport natural gas to Europe.
But enabling the Mediterranean to approach its energy potential will require navigating potentially treacherous politics. Any export deals by the Greek Cypriot government in Nicosia will risk the ire of Turkey, which warned during recent bailout negotiations that the Turkish Cypriot northern part of the island should share in any exploitation of natural resources. Cyprus has been divided since a Turkish invasion in 1974.
Meanwhile, Israel, where larger gas finds have been made by Noble and Delek, will also need to figure out what export routes make geopolitical and economic sense.
The priority for the Israeli government will be to make sure the country, which has long been dependent on imported fuel, is assured of sufficient domestic supplies. Only then would exports be authorized.
When the government does choose export routes for its gas -- a decision expected soon -- security and political considerations will probably take precedence. While pipelines might be less expensive, Israel is wary of sending gas north through Syria and Lebanon, both of which may have offshore gas deposits of their own.
Mr. Tadmor said many options were on the table for Israel as the industry awaited a decision from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new government on whether to permit exports and in what form.
''It could be L.N.G. onshore or offshore and also piped gas solutions like Jordan or even Turkey,'' he said. L.N.G. is liquefied natural gas, which can be carried on special tanker ships.
The recent thaw between Israel and Turkey brokered by President Barack Obama has made energy cooperation between the two countries more likely. Sending gas to Egypt, which has been running short of late, is also possible, analysts say.
Also under consideration is piping some Israeli gas to a Cypriot L.N.G. processing plant -- if one is built. Some of the companies are involved in both Cyprus and Israel. And the Aphrodite field may extend into Israeli waters, analysts say, which would be further reason for the countries to collaborate.
Mainly, it is the lure of substantial amounts of natural gas within easy reach of Europe, a huge consumer and importer of the fuel for industry and power generation, that has drawn some major fossil-fuels players to Cyprus. In January, Eni of Italy, with the South Korean giant Kogas as a 20 percent partner, signed an exploration deal for a huge swath of sea bottom off Cyprus. France's Total signed a similar agreement with Cyprus a month later.
''It is promising for Cyprus that companies the caliber of Eni and Total are getting involved -- that is an early sign of confidence,'' said Catherine Hunter, an analyst at the energy research firm IHS in London.
As for Cyprus, it is uncertain how much the country's gas can do for its besieged economy, and how quickly. In one big concession in its recently arranged bailout, the troika of international lenders -- the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission -- agreed that the country's gas reserves would remain under Cypriot jurisdiction.
Noble and its partners are preparing to drill a second well to help confirm the size of Aphrodite. So far, the volumes of gas that the companies think they have discovered, while suggesting a large find, are not far above the minimum analysts say would justify building a multibillion-dollar facility to liquefy the gas for transport by ship.
Mr. Ellinas says that L.N.G. is the preferred option for exporting the gas but that the big liquefaction plant he envisions for Vassilikos, an industrial site on the south coast, would cost $6 billion for the first of what might eventually be three export units.
But if the costs can be justified, such a plant would provide ''flexibility, security and everything else,'' he said. ''We can export to Europe and everywhere else. If you have a pipeline and gas prices go down you are stuck.''
Construction of an L.N.G. plant would take four to five years, once a final investment decision was made, which could stretch the finances of the Cypriot government and the balance sheets of the companies that hold the leases for the Aphrodite field.
To put the potential construction bill into perspective, Cyprus's entire economy -- before the crash, at least -- was only about &#x20ac;18 billion, or $23 billion, and the country is counting on its recently arranged &#x20ac;10 billion bailout to prevent more of its banks from collapsing.
Noble, for its part, has a relatively modest annual capital budget of about $4 billion, and has commitments elsewhere, including Israel.
One banker, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the costs of developing Cyprus's deepwater gas would probably be so high that an L.N.G. project would be only marginally profitable for the government at current gas prices, unless more gas was found. Mr. Ellinas, though, predicted that much more would be discovered.
Other options include a less-expensive floating L.N.G. facility. The most affordable approach might be an offshore pipeline to Turkey. But no matter how grim its financial predicament, the government of Cyprus may have little interest in supplying its longtime enemy.
''A subsea pipeline is a lot cheaper than an L.N.G. terminal, but a no-go politically,'' said Laura El-Katiri, a research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.
Of course, Cyprus's financial meltdown could lead to new attitudes. The country could come under pressure from its international creditors to adopt quicker ways to turn gas into cash -- even if it meant a Turkish pipeline. And the role of Mr. Ellinas's company, which was created by the previous Cypriot government, voted out of office in February, may come under review, said Ms. Hunter, of IHS.
L.N.G. might be the preferred choice of the Israelis. A liquefaction plant would be easier to guard than a long pipeline, which could be cut. Or if Cyprus built a plant, Israel might want to shunt some gas to that facility, to gain economies of scale. Delek is already a minority partner in Aphrodite.
''Setting up an export facility in an area under Israeli control appears to be the best alternative,'' an Israeli inter-ministerial committee said in September. The committee also recommended that a major international company be brought in to orchestrate development of the gas industry.
The offshore Tamar field, which began piping gas to the Israeli domestic market in late March, was developed by a consortium led by Noble and Delek. Tamar alone holds enough gas to power the Israeli economy for many years.
Now the two companies are working on plans for exploiting a much bigger field near Cypriot waters called Leviathan, which is double or triple the size of estimates for Aphrodite.
In December, Noble and its Israeli partners brought in an experienced L.N.G. player by reaching an agreement in principle with Woodside Petroleum, a company that operates a half-dozen L.N.G. plants in Australia. Woodside said at the time that the pact, which gave it a 30 percent stake in Leviathan, could lead to ''a key role in the potential development of a liquefied natural gas industry in Israel. ''
Mr. Ellinas, of Cyprus, said he hoped the Israelis would use the Cypriot L.N.G. plant and would hook Leviathan into it. That solution would certainly be one way to reduce costs. But in the end, each country may want to keep its big gas-processing investments close to home. In a tough neighborhood, control may trump economics.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Kremlin's World

BYLINE: By ARIEL COHEN

 BODY:
When the Russian Foreign Ministry released its updated Foreign Policy Concept in February, codifying Russia's global strategies, Washington yawned. Yet this document reveals much about the emerging ''Putin Doctrine.'' It further separates Russia from Western Europe and is especially critical of the United States. It also leaves no doubt: President Barack Obama's ''reset'' policy cannot possibly survive his second term. Here's the reality check.
Russia's new foreign-policy doctrine is rooted in the Soviet and czarist past. To quote Alexander III, Russia has two allies: its army and its navy. The doctrine rejects any alliance membership -- most of all NATO. 
Unfortunately, this Putin-approved doctrine is likely to lead to further disagreements between Russia and the West, despite Obama's continuing effort to reduce nuclear arms and stop ballistic missile defense modernization for Europe.
The Concept links arms control and missile defense, upholding Russia's persistent desire for enforceable ''legal guarantees'' that any future missile defense system ''will not be directed against Russian nuclear deterrent forces.'' Moscow will demand further U.S. concessions on missile defenses while refusing to cut its huge advantage in tactical nuclear weapons.
The Putin Doctrine calls soft power ''an integral component of modern international politics.'' Astonishingly, it casts soft power as a tool of the Russian government's commitment to ''universal democratic values'' and ''human rights'' -- Moscow style. This includes raising foreign awareness of the Russian language and culture to help burnish Russia's image abroad. Also in this category: the Kremlin's hiring of Goldman Sachs to improve investors' perception of Russia.
However, the Magnitsky affair, the anti-opposition crackdown, the incarceration of protesters and of the Yukos founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky -- who this year marks 10 years in prison -- fly in the face of such ''soft power'' exercises, especially when the Kremlin insists on labeling challenges from domestic opponents as ''foreign agent activities.''
Interestingly, Moscow blames America for a number of dislocations, which reflect massive Russian investments in U.S. government bonds and the dollar. It vituperates against deficit and national debt, the Fed's qualitative easings and the weak dollar (an ''unsuitable'' reserve currency, it insists). And Moscow goes way over the top in accusing Americans of adopting Russian orphans to collect disability payments or even for organ harvesting.
The Putin Doctrine places great emphasis on establishing lasting relations with neighboring countries. Given the disparity between the $2.5 trillion Russian G.D.P. and the much smaller economies of its neighbors, ''regional integration'' means, in practice, further Russian economic domination over its neighbors. Russia utilizes the Eurasian Economic Community, the Commonwealth of Independent States (C.I.S.) and the Collective Security Treaty Organization to assert its leadership.
According to the Concept, the Eurasian union would define the future of the C.I.S. and become a ''link between the European and Asia-Pacific regions.'' President Xi Jinping's first foreign visit -- to Moscow -- underscores Russia's commitment to its own ''pivot to Asia'' and the massive energy deals that could result.
The Putin Doctrine proclaims that the United Nations is the principal international institution through which Russia implements its foreign policy, because Russia has a veto in the U.N. Security Council. Further, the document states that there is a threat for ''world peace and stability'' from ''unilateral sanctions and other coercive measures, including armed aggression,'' outside the framework of the Security Council.
The Concept warns that ''some concepts that are being implemented are aimed at overthrowing legitimate governments in sovereign states under the pretext of protecting civilian population.'' This is a clear reference to the NATO action in Libya. At the time, Putin said the Security Council resolution was ''reminiscent of a medieval call for a crusade.'' After the murder of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens by Al Qaeda-linked terrorists, he apparently believes that even more strongly.
Russia strives to protect its own state sovereignty -- as well as Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. The Foreign Policy Concept here demonstrates Russia's resolve not to let humanitarian concerns trump its commitment to the Syrian regime -- a flat rejection of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine espoused by the Obama administration. Russia also hides behind the principle of noninterference in the case of the Iranian nuclear program. It resisted a new round of U.N. sanctions and repeatedly criticized the U.S./E.U. sanctions against Tehran.
The Foreign Policy Concept reflects Russia's deep resentment of any criticism of what it considers its ''internal affairs.'' The document warns of the ''destructive and unlawful use of 'soft power' and human rights concepts'' by other countries to put ''political pressure on sovereign regimes'' and interfere ''in internal affairs.'' These are clear references to the alleged U.S. support of the Arab upheavals, U.S. democracy promotion and the Magnitsky Act.
The public version of Russia's Foreign Policy Concept reveals much. Doubtless, the classified version would be even more fascinating.
Washington should huddle with European nations to formulate a realistic cooperation agenda with Russia. The agenda should include promotion of economic freedom, business ties, transparency, good governance and the rule of law, as well as cooperation in medicine, science and space.
The new Foreign Policy Concept reveals the choices made by Putin's Russia: an expanded sphere of influence; rapprochement with Beijing; and alienation from the West.
While Washington should continue its efforts to improve business ties, combat proliferation and protect human rights, ups and downs in U.S.-Russia and E.U.-Russia relations, unfortunately, will mar the future.

1913 Anarchist Cheats Guillotine
PARIS -- Léon Lacombe, the Anarchist murderer, who lost his claim to his boastful title of the ''uncapturable bandit'' when he fell into the hands of three intrepid detectives at the fête at La Villette, Paris, on March 11, revenged himself upon his captors yesterday [April 5] when he cheated the guillotine by committing suicide by leaping from the roof of the Santé prison after he had succeeded in making his escape from the exercise yard. Yesterday morning, as usual, Lacombe was taken out into the exercise yard, and for some ten minutes he strolled lazily round with his hands in his pockets. Then suddenly, the bandit dashed to the iron railing which encloses the yard, climbed it like a cat and managed to get his hands on the edge of the tiled roof of one of the prison buildings. 
1938 Philippine Freedom Delayed
WASHINGTON -- A joint memorandum issued today [April 5] under the signatures of President Roosevelt and President Manuel Quezon of the Philippine Commonwealth agrees to the postponement of the economic independence of the islands until 1960. Thus, this move which observers feel was forced by the war and tension in the Far East, in effect suggests that the American government retain its protectorate over the Philippines until 1960, instead of to July 4, 1946, when the Commonwealth was scheduled to come into full economic and political independence as a new-born nation. The Roosevelt-Quezon memorandum is more in the nature of a declaration of policy.
1963 Russia for 'Red Line' to U.S.
GENEVA -- The Soviet Union offered today [April 5] to open a direct communications link -- ''either telegraph or teletype'' -- with Washington as a safety measure to prevent accidental war. The idea of a so-called ''red line'' between President Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev was originally put forward by the United States as a measure to relieve world tension and reduce the risk of war by accident, miscalculation or failure of communications.

HEADLINE: A Sharp Drop In Job Growth Sows Concern

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL; Nathaniel Popper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It looks as if the spring swoon is back.
American employers added an estimated 88,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, compared with 268,000 in February, according to a Labor Department report released Friday. It was the slowest pace of growth since last June, and less than half of what economists had expected.
It also was the start of a third consecutive spring in which employers tapered off their hiring after a healthy start to the year. Slowdowns in the previous two years could be attributed to flare-ups in the European debt crisis, but this time the cause is less obvious. The recent payroll tax increase or other fiscal tightening in Washington could be partly to blame for the sudden retreat in hiring, but neither seems to be showing up much yet in other relevant economic data.
''People were starting to believe the economy was really picking up steam, and desperately wanted this report to be better,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at MFR Inc. ''But that didn't happen.'' 
Economists like Mr. Shapiro cautioned that the numbers, which are adjusted for normal seasonal variations, are volatile from month to month and are still subject to revision.
Nonetheless, the closely watched monthly jobs report was discouraging.
The unemployment rate, which comes from a different survey, ticked down to 7.6 percent in March, from 7.7 percent, but for the wrong reason: because more people reported dropping out of the labor force (meaning they are neither working nor looking for work), not because more people were hired.
The labor force participation rate has not been this low -- 63.3 percent -- since 1979, a time when women were less likely to be working.
Baby boomer retirements may account for part of the slide, but pessimism about job prospects in a mediocre economy still seems to be playing a large role, economists say.
''The drop in the participation rate has been centered on younger workers,'' said Mr. Shapiro, ''many of whom have given up hope of finding a decent job and are instead continuing in school and racking up enormous amounts of student debt, which has contributed to the recent surge in consumer credit outstanding.''
Investors initially responded to the jobs report by sending the major stock market indexes down more than 1 percent. But as the day went on, strategists sent out reports noting that the economic slowdowns in previous years ended up being temporary. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed back to end the day down only 0.4 percent.
''Given the noise in the data you don't want to set your pants on fire about it,'' said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.
Job gains in March were concentrated in professional and business services and health care.
The government again shed workers, as it has been doing for most of the last four years, though reductions at the Postal Service accounted for most of the latest decline. Economists expect more government layoffs in the months ahead as the effects of Washington's across-the-board budget cuts make their way through the system.
''While the recovery was gaining traction before sequestration took effect, these arbitrary and unnecessary cuts to government services will be a headwind in the months to come, and will cut key investments in the nation's future competitiveness,'' Alan B. Krueger, the chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement.
The latest report should quiet speculation that the Federal Reserve will take its foot off the monetary accelerator anytime soon, as some had suggested after a spike in hiring in February. Even before Friday's numbers came out, though, Fed officials had expressed concerns about not only the pace of job growth, but the quality of hiring as well.
''It's important to look at the types of jobs that are being created because those jobs will directly affect the fortunes and challenges of households and neighborhoods as well as the course of the recovery,'' Sarah Bloom Raskin, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, said in a recent speech.
She noted that relatively low-wage sectors like food services and retail businesses had accounted for a large share of the job growth in the last few years; a report in August from the National Employment Law Project, a liberal advocacy group, found that a majority of jobs lost during the recent recession were in the middle range of wages, while a majority of those added during the recovery had been low-paying.
In March, in fact, jobs in food services and drinking places accounted for the largest share of total American employment on record. Today nearly one in 13 American jobs is in this industry.
Ms. Raskin also expressed concern about temporary jobs, which account for a growing share of total employment.
''Temporary help is rapidly approaching a new record,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, who noted that there was also a rapid increase in temp hiring during the boom years of the 1990s. ''That of course means more flexibility for employers, and less job security for workers.''
Perhaps more distressingly, 7.6 million workers who want full-time work can find only part-time work, and their missing work hours do not count toward the official unemployment rate. The number of such workers fell slightly from February, but is still about where it was a year ago.
A broader measure of underemployment, which includes those reluctantly working part time as well as those who want jobs but have stopped looking, stands at 13.8 percent.
At the same time, long-term unemployment -- joblessness lasting more than six months -- has been a persistent problem ever since the recession ended in the middle of 2009. And it may be partly driven by the fact that many of the jobs available do not pay well enough to be worth taking.
''When I've had offers for positions they're part time or temporary, but the child care I'd need to pay to take the jobs is more costly than what I'd be getting paid for the job itself,'' said Linda Rubiano, 37, of Pennsauken, N.J., a single mother with a 3-year-old boy. She was laid off from her paralegal job, which she had held for five years, in January 2012. ''It's really, really frustrating.''
Getting people like Ms. Rubiano back to work soon is critical to the economy's future, experts say. In many cases, the longer people stay unemployed, the less employable they become.
''This seems to be a long-term sleeper crisis too, as we think about long-term unemployed workers who are in midlife and older workers who are likely dipping into retirement savings in order to stay afloat,'' said Christine L. Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project. ''We're setting ourselves up for somewhere, 10 years down the road, when a lot of retirees who didn't expect to live in poverty are going to be in poverty.''

HEADLINE: Tensions With North Korea Unsettle South's Economy

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL -- North Korea's torrent of threats -- and the matching show of military power and political resolve from the United States and South Korea -- began showing signs of unsettling foreign investors' confidence Friday.
The development magnified the challenges Seoul and Washington face. The two powers are trying to show the North's novice leader, Kim Jong-un, that they will not be blackmailed by his bluff and bluster. But at the same time, they do not want to escalate the tensions to an extent that they hurt the South Korean economy, the pride of the local population, or President Park Geun-hye's political standing at home.
''In the past, North Korea-related events had little impact or the markets recovered quickly,'' the South's vice finance minister, Choo Kyung-ho, told a meeting of top finance officials Friday. ''But recent threats from North Korea are stronger and the impact may therefore not disappear quickly.'' 
His comment came hours after the chief executive of General Motors, Dan Akerson, underscored the increased concern by saying that his company was making contingency plans for employee safety at its South Korean plants and that further increases in tensions would prompt G.M. to look at moving production elsewhere. In an interview with CNBC television, he said, ''If there were something to happen in Korea, it's going to affect our entire industry, not just General Motors.''
South Korean stocks slumped 1.64 percent Friday in a selling spree among foreign investors that analysts attributed to jitters over North Korea. The South Korean won also sank against the U.S. dollar.
Although South Koreans have become almost nonchalant after decades of on-and-off threats from North Korea, they believe that when things get ugly with the North, their globalized economy has much more to lose than the North's isolated and already highly sanctioned economy.
''The North Koreans are now using the propaganda in an extreme form to try to damage foreign direct investments into South Korea,'' said Tom Coyner, a member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea and author of ''Doing Business in Korea.'' ''They are, in a sense at this point, winning in an asymmetrical psychological warfare, attacking the economic strength of South Korea.''
War cries from North Korea have been factored into the stock market for decades. Still, its threats have grown in their intensity and frequency since the country upheld Mr. Kim as its top leader in late 2011, and especially after the United Nations imposed sanctions against the North following its nuclear test in February. The sanctions took direct aim at North Korea's Achilles' heel by focusing on cash transfers and luxury items, which the Kim regime uses to buy the loyalty of the elite.
North Korea has since called the Korean Peninsula ''back to a state of war'' and declared that it would launch ''pre-emptive nuclear strikes'' at the United States and its allies. It also said it would never bargain away its nuclear arsenal but rather expand it.
Also making this situation different was the way Washington and Seoul responded. South Korea matched the tone by declaring that if provoked, it would target the North Korean military leadership and by revising the rules of engagement to let its military respond more swiftly, forcefully and ''without political consideration.'' Meanwhile, the United States flew nuclear-capable bombers over the peninsula on training sorties and signed an agreement with Seoul to respond jointly to any North Korean provocation.
''The relentless show of force on a daily basis by not just North Korea, but also the U.S. and South Korea as part of their annual military exercises, has captured the attention of the world, and made the Korean Peninsula a place associated not with 'Gangnam Style' but with nuclear weapons and stealth bombers,'' said John Delury, an American scholar who teaches at Yonsei University in Seoul.
''Markets hate risk, even if it is the perception, rather than reality of risk,'' he added. ''This poses a serious challenge to President Park, who was elected on the basis of promises to keep growing the South Korean economy and improve relations with the North.''
Government officials said that the military tensions had so far had only limited effects on the markets. But for the South Korean economy, the North Korean imbroglio is an additional drag at an inopportune time. In the face of the weakening Japanese yen, which hurts South Korean exporters, South Korea recently announced a sharp cut in growth forecasts.
Officials vowed to ensure stability if the situation got worse.
An important test is whether North Korea will go so far as to close down a joint industrial park in the North Korean town of Kaesong. The complex, where South Korean factories use low-cost North Korean labor, is a major source of hard currency for Pyongyang and stands as the last major symbol of inter-Korean cooperation. Seoul officials have cited the project when they wanted to show foreign investors that North Korean harsh rhetoric is not always matched by action.
In a ''Global Political Insights'' report Friday, Citi Research said that ''barring an outbreak of wide-scale military conflict, we think North Korean brinksmanship will not impact the South Korean economic fundamentals.'' In a report earlier this week, Thomas J. Byrne and Steffen Dyck at Moody's Investors Service expressed similar views but also mentioned ''a heightened risk of military adventurism or miscalculation by the 30-something Kim Jong-un.''
Lee Beom-ho, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp., said that markets had traditionally tended to dismiss North Korean brinkmanship.
But this time, ''the targets of North Korean threat have expanded and the international community has become more sensitive,'' he said, referring to the North's growing nuclear and missile capabilities and American plans to deploy more interceptor missiles to the region. ''At the same time, there is doubt over the abilities of those who are supposed to deter North Korea, especially China.''
Millions of South Koreans live within range of North Korean artillery, with the area between Seoul and the border with North Korea developed into forests of high-rise apartments in recent decades for people commuting to the metropolis. Yet, previous provocations by North Korea have usually had an ephemeral effect on South Korea's equity and foreign exchange markets, occasionally even presenting buying opportunities.
In a sign of how accustomed South Korea has grown to the security provided by the military alliance with the United States, people in South Korea have shown few signs of agitation in recent weeks, even as North Korea has been bombarding their country almost daily with apocalyptic threats of ''final destruction.''
South Koreans remain more sensitive about foreign investors' moves.
During a previous North Korean nuclear crisis in 1994, the market proved resilient when a videotaped threat by a North Korean official to turn Seoul into ''a sea of fire'' was leaked to the media. But later that year, when Washington drew up plans to evacuate Americans from South Korea before a planned surgical strike at the North Korean nuclear facilities, South Koreans rushed to supermarkets, hoarding goods, and the stock market took a dive.
Officials and analysts in South Korea suspect that North Korea, no longer able to fight a conventional war or even start a major skirmish with the South without suffering a humiliating strike-back, was increasingly resorting to other forms of warfare, like hacking South Korean banks and broadcasters.
''Most people say they are used to a lot of blustering and posturing by North Korea and we should not take it too seriously,'' Mr. Coyner said. ''But it needs to be taken seriously in the sense that it is already proving to be effective where foreign multinationals are looking at political risk contingency option.''

HEADLINE: Drumbeat of War Plays in Background for South Koreans at North's Edge

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Su Hyun Lee contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MUNSAN, South Korea -- As Lee Jae-eun retrieved her squirming twins from day care and loaded them into a two-seat stroller, she barely glanced up at the olive green Blackhawk helicopter that swept overhead, just above the high-rise apartment buildings.
Even in peaceful times, low-flying military aircraft are a common sight in this residential community near the heavily fortified border that separates capitalist South Korea from the communist North. But these are not placid times, and the roaring helicopters are one more reminder of rising tensions wrought by North Korea's recent barrage of war threats. 
Still, said Ms. Lee, a 34-year-old homemaker, residents have resigned themselves to living with the constant risk, and occasional tantrums, from their bellicose northern neighbor.
''Sure, our radar is up to new danger,'' she said, holding one of her year-old daughters and surrounded by other mothers picking up their children. ''But living here makes you used to it. It's not such a big deal.''
In recent weeks, the heavily armed North's cherub-faced young leader, Kim Jong-un, has threatened South Korea and the United States with nuclear attack, declaring that a ''state of war'' exists on the Korean Peninsula. Refusing to be cowed, South Korea's newly elected president, Park Geun-hye, the democratic nation's first female leader, responded by ordering her generals to strike back if provoked.
Despite the steady drumbeat of war talk, life seems to go on as usual in most of South Korea, the industrial powerhouse that lifted itself from the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War to become one of Asia's economic success stories. Nowhere is the determination to hold on to the South's hard-won middle-class living standards more apparent than in Munsan, a distant suburb of the South Korean capital of Seoul that sits on the edge of the tense border: the demilitarized zone, or DMZ, which lies where the fighting stopped 60 years ago.
Once a collection of farming villages known for their local delicacy of tasty eel, Munsan was transformed into a boomtown of tall white apartment buildings and neon-lighted shops a decade ago during an era of political rapprochement with the North and soaring property prices in the fast-growing South. More recently, development has slowed after the global financial crisis hurt the South's export-driven economy and new tensions with the North have scared away some prospective buyers.
Some of the 47,000 residents who live here now say they have learned to accept the helicopters' near-constant rattling of their windows, and the columns of tanks that sometimes block roads during training exercises, making their children late for school. They say they have also learned how to ignore the rows of concrete bunkers and guard towers along the highway they use every morning to commute to Seoul, 35 miles to the south.
They just tune out the dangers and focus on enjoying their daily lives.
''Korea is the most dangerous place in the world, but we are numb to it,'' said Song Hyun-young, an employee in the real estate department of Paju city hall, which has jurisdiction over the town of Munsan. ''If something happens, we will all die together, so I don't really think about it.''
When pressed, many residents admit to feeling anxiety about the intensity of the North's most recent threats, and the fact that its nuclear arsenal is controlled by an untested, unpredictable leader. Some also partly blame their own country for imposing sanctions on the North, a closed and impoverished country.
''To be honest, the talk of nuclear attack is much scarier this time,'' said Ms. Lee, the mother of the twins. ''I think North Korea is cornered, and anyone who is cornered will strike back.''
Responding to such concerns, Paju city employees held an evacuation drill last week with the police, firefighters and the army. In the event of an attack, residents would be led to one of nine underground bomb shelters that the city built after the North's last violent provocation, the artillery bombardment of a South Korean island three years ago that killed two civilians. The shelters have been freshly stocked with flashlights, medicine, gas masks and first-aid kits, officials said.
But most residents have not taken similar precautions. None of the more than half-dozen residents interviewed said they were stockpiling food or supplies. Many said they were optimistic that such preparations were unnecessary. They were confident, they said, that the bonds of shared ethnicity between the two Koreas would prevail over political differences, and prevent the North from following through on its apocalyptic threats.
''The world thinks we are on the brink of war, but we are fine,'' said Gong Soon-hee, 55, a real estate agent whose small office was filled with wall-size maps showing a checkerboard of privately owned plots that abruptly end at the edge of the DMZ, just a few miles away. ''Koreans are good people, kind people, not stupid people who would just start a war suddenly.''
Despite the tensions, Ms. Gong said, new homebuyers continue to trickle in, lured by prices that have dropped to less than one-tenth of those in central Seoul. Most give no sign of noticing a formation of helicopters flying overhead as they check out apartments, she said.
''I guess we could hide in an underground parking garage if the shells start falling,'' she said, ''but we don't bother with escape plans.''
Others said the current standoff cast a spotlight on the fact that in the face of the North's threats, the South was in the weaker position because it had so much more to lose. Some said South Korea's biggest vulnerability was its unwillingness to sacrifice its much higher living standards, a sentiment that would make essentially buying off the North an easier option.
''If this is just going to continue until we give aid, then let's just give them some aid,'' Park Soon-yi, a 44-year-old homemaker, said with a laugh. But she was only half-joking, as she shopped in the upmarket Hillstate high-rise condominium and retail complex. ''Then they'll be quiet, and leave us in peace.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and Japan Agree on Returning Okinawa Land

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The United States and Japan agreed Friday on a new timetable for the return to Japan of a Marine airfield and other military bases on Okinawa, moving to solve a long-festering issue that has bedeviled America's ties with its largest Asian ally.
By agreeing to a clear timetable for the return of 2,500 acres, both nations are hoping to entice Okinawans to drop their opposition to the air base, which Washington and Tokyo want to move to another part of the island but which many Okinawans want to move off the island. Fierce local opposition has kept Japan from being able to follow through on a deal originally made in 1996 to allow the base and its noisy aircraft to be relocated to a less populated area of the island. 
Japan's hawkish new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has been trying to revive the long-stalled deal at a time of increasing tensions with China that have led many Japanese to support strengthening the alliance with the United States, Japan's longtime protector. The deal on Friday could help Mr. Abe politically, by making clear what Okinawans stand to gain by agreeing to keep the base.
It could also help the Obama administration if it finally leads to the end of an impasse that has left the future of the important air base in limbo, and that has undermined the Obama administration's strategic ''pivot'' to Asia.
Announcing the new agreement in a room filled with American and Japanese flags, Mr. Abe called it a significant step toward reducing the huge American military presence on Okinawa, a legacy of the United States' occupation of that tropical island after World War II. The base relocation is the centerpiece of a broader deal to eventually move some 9,000 Marines to bases in Guam, Hawaii and Australia.
''We are able to make progress in reducing Okinawa's burden in a visible manner,'' Mr. Abe said, joined by a dozen American and Japanese officials. ''I am extremely glad that everybody could sit down together today and reach a conclusion on this intractable issue.''
Friday's agreement tries to restart that plan by setting a target date of returning the Futenma base, in the center of the city of Ginowan, by as early as 2022, provided the replacement air base is operational. It also lays out a timetable for handing over five other American bases also in the crowded southern half of the island by the late 2020s.
Under the timetable, the first parcel -- an access road and surrounding land totaling 2.5 acres -- would be turned over to Japan this year.
In a bid to increase transparency and accountability, the new timetable also includes flowcharts outlining which government agencies in both countries need to take what steps for the land to be returned on schedule. American and Japanese officials said this was to prevent the deal from getting bogged down in murky bureaucratic proceedings, as happened in the past.
For the Obama administration, the agreement is meant not only to shore up one of America's most important security relationships in Asia, but also to demonstrate to other regional allies, as well as rivals, that the United States has the willpower to maintain its security presence despite its budget difficulties and fatigue from wars in the Middle East.
''This sends a clear signal to the region that we are committed to making hard choices to keep our force posture in Okinawa,'' said Mark Lippert, assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific affairs, who visited Tokyo to complete the agreement.
For Mr. Abe, restarting the relocation plan would fulfill a campaign pledge to improve ties with the United States as his nation faces a growing challenge from China over disputed islands near Okinawa. Becoming a fuller military partner of the United States has been a centerpiece of the prime minister's bid to reverse his nation's declining stature in the region after years of economic stagnation and its relative eclipse by China's rise.
However, he is also taking a political risk on an agreement that may fail to appease Okinawans' anger over what they see as an unfairly onerous American base presence.
The Abe government has been trying to whittle away at Okinawans' opposition with offers of generous financial aid and other efforts to court the island's governor, Hirokazu Nakaima, a base opponent who is a member of Mr. Abe's conservative governing party. In a sign the government's tactics may be working, Mr. Nakaima offered uncharacteristic words of praise Friday, though he warned that the central government still had to win over other local leaders.
''I think it is extremely good that the government is buckling down to deal in concrete terms with the return of bases,'' Mr. Nakaima told reporters in Naha, the Okinawan capital. ''But it is hard to evaluate the plan until I have had a chance to consult with mayors of the affected communities.''
One sticking point might be the timetable for moving the base, which is now pushed back another nine years. Under an earlier version of the deal in 2006, it would have been relocated next year. The original agreement to move the base was reached in 1996 after the gang rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by American servicemen.

HEADLINE: As Brazil's Influence Expands, So Does a Campaign Strategist's Success

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
SÃO PAULO, Brazil
FOR decades, presidential elections in Latin America have often involved that well-known fixture in the cable news landscape of the United States: the American political consultant.
Back in the 1970s, David Sawyer, a pioneer in the field, worked for the Venezuelan candidate Lorenzo Fernández. (He was trounced.) James Carville, the former Clinton adviser and now media celebrity, worked with Fernando Henrique Cardoso's successful 1994 campaign for president in Brazil, and Tad Devine, Al Gore's strategist, helped Manuel Zelaya win Honduras's presidential election in 2005.
But in a development reflecting the waning clout of one powerful nation in the hemisphere and the rising influence of another, Brazilian political consultants have begun to compete handily with their American counterparts, orchestrating campaigns throughout Latin America and beyond. No one exemplifies this shift in the region's political winds quite like João Santana.
In the past year, Mr. Santana, a hypercompetitive 60-year-old former lyricist for an avant-garde rock band who refers to elections as ''almost bloody combat,'' accomplished the uncommon feat of simultaneously running winning campaigns for three presidents: Danilo Medina, in the Dominican Republic; Hugo Chávez, in Venezuela; and José Eduardo dos Santos, in Angola. 
Like the American strategists who came before them, Mr. Santana and other Brazilian political consultants also know how to attract controversy. While he was shuttling across the Atlantic to manage campaigns in Latin America and Africa, Mr. Santana was also consolidating his role as one of the most influential behind-the-scenes advisers to Brazil's ruling Workers Party. His role as a gray eminence has been described by the newsmagazine Veja as ''capable of mapping out the weaknesses of adversaries with an acupuncturist's precision.''
Those skills also came into focus in Venezuela, where both Mr. Chávez, who died of cancer last month, and his opponent, Henrique Capriles Radonski, hired Brazilian consultants last year. Some critics of Mr. Chávez contended that it was an unfair race given the state propaganda apparatus at the incumbent's disposal.
One prominent Venezuelan political blog, Caracas Chronicles, went so far as to call Mr. Santana a ''Svengali,'' recognizing his sway in such races. ''It's airbrush politics at its finest,'' said Juan Nagel, an economist and a contributor to the blog, pointing to Mr. Santana's skill in softening the image of leaders like Mr. Chávez, whose democratic credentials had been challenged.
''The Brazilian recipe, never mind that he's helping elect horrible people, is all about winning,'' Mr. Nagel said.
In a rare interview here, Mr. Santana hit back at the criticism about his work for Mr. Chávez, saying, ''The impact our campaign had among Venezuelan voters speaks for itself.''
MORE recently in Venezuela, he said, he is ''indirectly assisting'' this month's election bid of Nicolás Maduro, Mr. Chávez's handpicked heir, without assembling a team in Caracas, the capital. One example of this work is a music video he conceived called ''He Will Be Born Again,'' portraying Mr. Chávez as a force permeating Venezuelan society.
Reflecting his acceptance of clients from across the political spectrum, Mr. Santana said he had also agreed to run the 2014 campaign for the candidate of Panama's Democratic Change, a center-right party, in addition to establishing a venture in Italy to start managing campaigns in Europe.
He described politics as an activity involving theater, music and even religious rites since ''primordial'' times, and, with a dash of humor, said about his field, ''Just as psychoanalysts help people to have sex without guilt, we help people to like politics without remorse.''
Before he entered the theater of politics, Mr. Santana viewed such challenges from other angles.
Seated at a table reserved for him in Parigi, a restaurant frequented by São Paulo's elite, he described an unusual trajectory. Born in the interior of Bahia, a state in northeast Brazil, he studied at Jesuit schools. He made an incursion into the world of music as a founder of the cutting-edge rock band Bendegó, before finding his way into journalism.
Around that time, Brazil's long stretch of military rule, from 1964 to 1985, had given way to a boisterous democratic transition. In 1992, as a reporter for the magazine Isto É, Mr. Santana helped secure a landmark scoop: an interview with a Brasília chauffeur who described a corruption scheme that contributed to the impeachment of the president, Fernando Collor de Mello.
He left journalism for Brazilian politics as a new field was coalescing for ''marqueteiros,'' as political marketers, or consultants, are known in Portuguese. Laws forced television networks to cede prime-time space for political advertising, and candidates scrambled to repackage campaign themes into tightly produced commercials in a nation where voting is mandatory.
After years of toiling for an array of campaigns, Mr. Santana received his big break in 2005 when Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, tapped him to run his re-election campaign. It was a crucial moment for Mr. da Silva: the approval rating of his government, battered by a vote-buying scandal, had fallen below 30 percent.
Mr. Santana helped to reverse that decline, recasting Mr. da Silva as a leader under siege by Brazil's elites while going on the offensive by claiming that his opponent would revive a program of privatizing state companies. With a boost from an improved economy, Mr. da Silva won in a landslide.
Paid well into the millions of dollars for some of his campaigns, Mr. Santana often relies on intense polling of voters, while assembling large teams that include camera operators, film editors and musicians. As Brazil began flexing its soft power under Mr. da Silva, Mr. Santana and other Brazilian consultants found themselves in greater demand.
In Peru, Ollanta Humala, a nationalist military figure who lost a 2006 presidential bid when he had to fight off comparisons to Mr. Chávez, hired Brazilian consultants for his 2011 campaign. He won after repositioning himself as a business-friendly moderate, repeatedly pointing to Mr. da Silva as a source of inspiration.
STILL, the rise of Brazil's marqueteiros may involve factors beyond the appeal of Brazil's governing model, which has come under criticism as President Dilma Rousseff has struggled with an economic slowdown. (Mr. Santana also ran Ms. Rousseff's 2010 campaign, helping her -- a cabinet minister who had never run for office -- evolve into a nimble communicator on television.)
Taylor C. Boas, a political scientist at Boston University who specializes in Latin American election campaigns, noted that Brazil is a large federal republic with an array of municipal, state and national elections. It shares features, he said, with the United States and Russia, two other nations where political consultants have used domestic campaigns as a springboard for foreign work.
''In Latin America, the Brazilians have the advantage of cultural proximity and languages that are not too dissimilar,'' Mr. Boas said, referring to Spanish and Portuguese. ''And as João Santana has shown repeatedly, they know how to manage sophisticated campaigns, and they know how to win.''
Beyond Latin America, Mr. Santana came under scrutiny last year in Angola, the oil-rich nation where Mr. dos Santos, already in power for more than 33 years, spent heavily on his effort to obtain a victory that few doubted. For Mr. Santana, it was an opportunity to establish a foothold in a region shaping up to be a frontier for political consulting as some African economies expand.
He said Brazilians held resilient ties to Africa, pointing to studies showing that about 70 percent of the people in Bahia, his home state, have African ancestry, largely from the region that is now Benin. ''I am proud to be one of them,'' he said. ''Our biological and cultural DNA supports our work in Africa.''

HEADLINE: Veterans' Programs Are Set For Raise in Spending Plan

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Facing growing criticism from Congress, veterans' groups and even late-night television hosts, the Obama administration announced on Friday that it would include significant increases for veterans' programs, including money for mental health services, in the budget it unveils next week.
The president's budget for the 2014 fiscal year will include $63.5 billion in discretionary funds for the Department of Veterans Affairs, a 4 percent increase over the current budget, said Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff. 
The spending plan calls for a 13.6 percent increase in discretionary spending, to $2.5 billion, for the Veterans Benefits Administration, the embattled agency within the department that oversees benefit programs, including education and disability compensation programs. And it will include $7 billion for mental health services, a 7 percent increase.
The budget will also propose spending nearly $300 million on two programs intended to digitize disability claims for wounded veterans. The department has more than 850,000 claims awaiting decisions, of which nearly 70 percent have been pending for more than 125 days, its benchmark for timely action.
President Obama also intends to propose making permanent two credits created to encourage businesses to hire veterans. Those credits, which are scheduled to expire at the end of the year, range up to $9,600 for hiring disabled veterans who have been unemployed for more than six months.
The president's budget proposal is largely a political document, a starting point in negotiations with Congress. But Mr. McDonough, appearing before reporters alongside the secretary of veterans affairs, Eric K. Shinseki, asserted that the proposed increases -- coming amid intense budget cutting across the federal government -- underscored Mr. Obama's priorities.
''The budget,'' Mr. McDonough said, ''lays out in pretty stark detail the president's commitment to our vets and to their families.''
The Obama administration has come under fire in recent weeks for its handling of veterans' issues, largely because of persistent and growing delays in processing compensation claims for injured veterans. (Many veterans complain about delays in obtaining health care as well, but the backlog in disability compensation has been a bigger issue.)
In recent weeks, Representative Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, called on Allison Hickey, the under secretary for benefits, to resign because of her failure to shrink the backlog.
Perhaps more damaging to the administration, the general public now seems to equate the backlog with poor care for veterans. Joe Klein of Time magazine has called on Mr. Shinseki to resign, and Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' has devoted several recent episodes to deriding the Obama administration for breaking promises on veterans' benefits, calling the backlog ''criminal.''
Veterans' groups have consistently complained about the slow processing of claims as well, though several major groups, including the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars and Disabled American Veterans, have come to Mr. Shinseki's defense.
Paul Rieckhoff, executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and a leading critic of the department, called Friday's budget announcement ''welcome'' but added that ''no one has said this is a money problem.''
''Really what we're talking about is execution,'' he said.
For Mr. Shinseki, who meets regularly with veterans' groups but does not often hold news conferences, the one-hour session in an ornate room at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building represented something of a departure, intended perhaps to counter criticism that he is aloof.
Most of the questions focused on the mountainous claims inventory, for which Mr. Shinseki did not offer any new proposals. Instead he emphasized the department's core strategy, which involves digitizing the paper-clogged process in every regional office by the end of the year.
Mr. McDonough also said that he had also begun convening experts from several federal agencies, like the Social Security Administration and Department of Health and Human Services, to offer advice on taming the claims inventory.
As he has consistently in the past, Mr. Shinseki asserted that the department was on schedule to eliminate the backlog by 2015. Asked whether he meant the beginning or end of that year, he replied simply, ''2015.''
Mr. Shinseki also noted that delays in processing claims were partly the result of Obama administration policies that expanded benefits, like for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. ''It was the right thing to do,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Overseas Finances Can Trip Up Americans Abroad

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
LIVING and working abroad may sound romantic. But having a financial life in more than one country -- if one of those countries is the United States -- is becoming increasingly complicated.
Managing an international financial life was once solely the purview of the superrich, who jetted around the world. But given the still-high unemployment rate in the United States, opportunities for middle-class jobs abroad, in areas like finance, oil and construction, are becoming more appealing.
By taking those jobs, though, many middle- and upper-middle-class Americans have found it more and more difficult to comply with requirements on reporting the existence and value of bank accounts overseas and to reconcile the taxes of different countries.
At the same time, Americans from immigrant families who have bank accounts in their home countries that they may have overlooked are being swept up by the same laws used to ferret out millionaires and billionaires stashing money in secret Swiss accounts. The Internal Revenue Service has increased its examination of such accounts, lawyers said, with serious penalties for those who have not reported them. 
So how should Americans working abroad or with a financial life in two countries manage their finances?
BASIC CONFUSION One of the great enemies of people working abroad is bad advice, especially since there are fewer sources to counter misinformation thousands of miles from home.
For example, Americans working abroad are eligible for the foreign earned income exclusion, which in 2012 exempted the first $95,100 from tax. But even if Americans earn less than that or are paying higher taxes in the country where they are working, they still need to file a tax return with the I.R.S.
''Some think if you're paying taxes in Germany and the Netherlands and the taxes are higher than in the U.S., you don't have to file a return,'' said Ian M. Comisky, partner at the law firm Blank Rome and co-author of ''Tax Fraud and Evasion.'' ''That's not accurate. You have to file a U.S. return, and you get a credit for it.''
Increased I.R.S. scrutiny of bank accounts abroad under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which began to take effect this year, means foreign banks must report more information on American account holders. Mr. Comisky said he had received calls from people with undeclared overseas accounts who asked if they could transfer the money to a friend who was not an American citizen and have that person transfer it back to them as a gift to avoid the penalties from years of not paying their taxes.
''I said, 'You can do it, but it's illegal,' '' Mr. Comisky said. ''That's pure tax evasion.''
There is also the issue of other countries' taxes that the United States does not recognize. Marylouise Serrato, executive director of American Citizens Abroad, a lobbying group, said many wealth, social and value-added taxes in Europe were not eligible for credits or deductions on American taxes. ''They could be a significant part of your foreign tax bill, but you can't apply them to your U.S. taxes, so you just pay them,'' she said.
While making mistakes on taxes is common, Frank Reilly, president of Reilly Financial Advisors, which has had an office in Saudi Arabia since the 1970s, said people working abroad also often made poor decisions about real estate.
With homes in the United States, there are two common problems. One is the logistical challenge of renting out a home you own from thousands of miles away. The other is deciding to buy a retirement home somewhere in the United States when you plan to work abroad for many more years. By the time you stop working, you may not want to live there.
The most financially destructive real estate problem comes when income and mortgage payments are in different currencies. ''When someone in the United States takes out a mortgage, they know that their payment is $1,300,'' Mr. Reilly said. ''When they take out a mortgage in euros, it could be 1,300 euros. That could be $1,500 or $1,800 or $2,300. They're exposed to currency fluctuations.''
Mr. Reilly said he counseled clients to imagine what a shift in the exchange rate could mean to them and asked some to consider putting many months of payments in that currency as a hedge.
ACCOUNT COMPLICATIONS While new American reporting requirements are meant to catch tax evaders, they are causing problems for people simply making a living abroad.
Ms. Serrato said her group had heard of many instances of Americans abroad having their accounts closed in the United States because the banks did not want to deal with the reporting requirements. On the other end, she has heard that opening accounts in different countries has become more difficult.
''We support the crackdown on tax evasion, but there has been a lot of blanket legislation put out there that can hit the unknowing or the unwitting,'' she said.
Foreign pension plans, for instance, are not considered tax-exempt under American law. Americans are required to report the plans to the I.R.S. as they would bank or investment accounts. Failure to do so carries harsh penalties.
''If you're a person who didn't know your pension account needed to be reported but you reported your checking and savings account,'' Ms. Serrato said, ''now you're faced with criminal penalties for a filing error and you could end up paying a penalty that could wipe out 50 percent of that account.''
The I.R.S. put a streamlined procedure in place in September for people working abroad who owe less than $1,500 in back taxes on these plans. People who owe more than that will be treated as ''higher risk'' cases, the I.R.S. said.
There is now a third, voluntary disclosure program in place for people with unreported money offshore. But now that the offshore inquiry has gone beyond traditional tax havens like Switzerland, lawyers said that immigrants and their children were coming under scrutiny. The increased attention on the Middle East and Asia for tax evaders -- or terrorist financiers -- is raising concern among people who have accounts in their home countries that they never thought to declare in the United States.
Robert J. Kipnees, a partner at the law firm Lowenstein Sandler, said he recently worked with two clients who had accounts at Bank Leumi in Israel, after the bank notified them that the I.R.S. was asking for all of its account information on American citizens.
''It's not just high-net-worth people,'' he said. ''You have people who are first- and second-generation Americans whose families left money behind in the old country and they did not know they had an interest in the account.''
PROPER PLANNING Americans who work abroad for foreign companies rather than companies with American ties may not be required to contribute to Social Security, which can affect the benefits they are eligible for when they retire. This puts a premium on saving on their own and creating a realistic financial plan.
Charles Crew, a chemical engineer, and his wife worked in Saudi Arabia for 36 years until they retired to Minneapolis. Mr. Crew, 62, said that when he was around 40 he realized he was not going to be able to count on Social Security. So he began saving through the plans offered by his employer, the oil company Saudi Aramco. ''They had a qualified retirement plan and a 401(k) plan, and both were administered by Vanguard in dollars,'' he said.
Like many expatriates who became used to living somewhere with far lower costs -- and spending like tourists when they returned to the United States -- Mr. Crew said he needed to adjust his expectations quickly and stick to the financial plan he had put together.
''You get excited being back and say, 'I lived away -- I should be able to treat myself,' '' Mr. Crew said. ''You can, but you need to look at some of these things and their impact on the long term and do that without the emotional element to it.''
That's sound advice for anyone.

HEADLINE: Korea Events Complicate Nuclear Talks With Iran

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and RICK GLADSTONE; David M. Herszenhorn reported from Almaty, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

 BODY:
ALMATY, Kazakhstan -- North Korea is more than 2,500 miles from the resumed nuclear negotiations that got under way here Friday between Iran and the six big powers, but North Korea's nuclear-arms bombast and the cautious foreign response are hanging over the negotiations in unsettling ways.
For the first time since Iran and the six powers restarted their dialogue a year ago after a long lapse, North Korea, which had held similar talks in the 1990s that collapsed in betrayal and mistrust, is simultaneously demonstrating an outcome that Iran may find enviable, nonproliferation experts said. North Korea's arsenal of nuclear weapons, however small, has nonetheless emboldened it to challenge the United States and other nuclear-armed powers, which have responded with caution and -- from North Korea's vantage point -- some degree of respect. 
''I do feel as if Iran has inevitably been drawing lessons from how the world is dealing with North Korea,'' said Valerie Lincy, executive director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a Washington-based research and advocacy group. ''I would imagine the lessons they're drawing are not the ones the Western powers would like: That you can weather sanctions, and renege on previous agreements, and ultimately if you stand fast, you'll get what you're looking for.''
Cliff Kupchan, an Iran specialist at the Eurasia Group, a Washington-based consulting firm, said that while Iran does not want to be viewed as an ''irrational cult state'' like North Korea, it also sees the conspicuous absence of talk about regime change by North Korea's adversaries in the current episode of heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
''These guys are smart, and they're shrewd,'' Mr. Kupchan said of Iran's leaders. ''They're well aware of what North Korea has gotten away with. They see that North Korea elicits fear and significant geopolitical ballast because it has nuclear weapons.''
Expectations for this latest round of negotiations have been modest at best, with little sign that the Iranian government was ready to accept an offer made by the six powers at the last round of talks in February: restrictions on its supply of dangerous enriched uranium in exchange for an initial modest easing of international sanctions, to be followed by further trust-building measures.
The Iranian delegation said as talks resumed that it had put forward a ''comprehensive proposal'' that it hoped would ''establish a new bedrock for cooperation.'' But negotiators representing the group of six powers said they had not seen anything new, suggesting they may have already hit a roadblock.
The talks were to continue on Saturday between Saeed Jalili, the lead Iranian negotiator, and Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief. She represents the so-called P5-plus-1, which are the five permanent members of the Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- plus Germany.
Michael Mann, a spokeswoman for Ms. Ashton, told reporters as the talks opened that ''the confidence-building measure has to come from Iran.''
But in what could be a sign that Iran's position has basically remained unchanged, Mr. Jalili began his visit to Almaty on Thursday with a speech to university students in which he insisted on his country's unfettered right to develop a civilian nuclear program, and accused the larger powers of hypocrisy because they have nuclear arms.
In the speech, Mr. Jalili suggested that his counterparts must simply ''accept the inalienable rights'' of Iran, specifically the right to enrich uranium, as part of any solution.
Throughout the dispute, the Iranians have asserted that their uranium enrichment activities are for civilian purposes and that AyatollahAli Khamenei, the supreme leader, issued a religious decree banning nuclear weapons in the country. Iran has also repeatedly argued that because it signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, its activities are by definition peaceful and legal.
At the same time the Iranians have refused to comply with Security Council demands that Iran suspend its uranium enrichment until unresolved questions about its nuclear intentions are answered, including indications that it has done work on triggers for atomic bombs.
Ms. Lincy, of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, said she believed Iran may be primarily interested in the negotiations in order to achieve some relief from the sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union, which have been causing increased economic pain -- but to do so without sacrificing its ability to make nuclear fuel.
Again, she drew a parallel to North Korea's negotiations more than two decades ago, when it negotiated a step-by-step deal for food and fuel assistance from the United States in exchange for promises to not to make nuclear weapons. That deal collapsed in 2002, when the Americans accused North Korea of secretly building a facility to enrich uranium.
In some ways, she said, the P5-plus-1 group's offer to Iran is similar in structure to that failed North Korea agreement -- initial moves by Iran, followed by eased sanctions, followed by further steps.
Gary Milhollin, executive editor of Iranwatch.org, a Web site published by the Wisconsin Project, said in an article before the latest talks had even begun that such an approach could be a mistake. ''The lesson from North Korea is that an interim agreement of this kind won't work,'' he wrote. ''Before making any halfway deal, U.S. and European diplomats should insist that Iran remove itself from the path that North Korea so easily followed.''
Others said the Iranians -- like the North Koreans -- had shown a great tenacity for enduring economic sanctions regardless of their severity, calling into question their value in any negotiation strategy.
In a study released before the latest round of talks, the National Iranian American Council, a Washington advocacy group that opposes the sanctions, said they had actually strengthened the Iranian government's resolve. ''Capitulation is seen as a greater threat to the regime's survival than even a military confrontation with the United States,'' the study said.
Some experts said they believed Iranian leaders were viewing North Korea's nuclear belligerence with some measure of alarm, however. In their view, the United States and others could use it as justification for even more ostracism of Iran, which has a brotherly military relationship with North Korea and has adopted some of its missile and weapons technology. The two countries, along with Syria, were the only ones that opposed passage of the Arms Trade Treaty on conventional weapons at the United Nations this week, for example.
''If the North Koreans really started a war, Iran will be subject to intense international pressures,'' said Mehrzad Boroujerdi, a professor of political science at Syracuse University. He said many people would fear ''the Iranians are as crazy as those guys and therefore we should contain them.''

HEADLINE: Before Playoffs, a Few Defeats May Actually Help

BYLINE: BENJAMIN HOFFMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Miami Heat will be the No. 1 seed and the team no one wants to meet in the Eastern Conference playoffs. 

 BODY:
It may sound ridiculous to declare six better than four or five, but when it comes to playoff seedings in the Eastern Conference, you could certainly make the argument that it would be better to be worse.
The imbalance of power between the East and the stronger West in the N.B.A., other than at the top, is still a major factor. But in the East's field of one favorite, the Miami Heat, the playoff seedings present a chance for teams to make LeBron James and his Heat someone else's problem. For some teams, including the Nets, that may make losing a few games as the regular season winds down seem awfully appealing.
The way the playoff structure works, the Heat, as the conference's No. 1 seed, will face the No. 8 seed in the first round; that will almost certainly be the Milwaukee Bucks. Major upsets have happened, and the Bucks are certainly an entertaining team, with Monta Ellis and Brandon Jennings providing highlights on offense while Larry Sanders, potentially the league's defensive player of the year, clogs up the middle. But provided the ailing Heat get back to health in time, they should be able to roll past the Bucks. 
Should Miami win, its second-round opponent would be the winner of the first-round matchup between the Nos. 4 and 5 seeds, currently the Nets and the Chicago Bulls, though the Atlanta Hawks, now sixth, remain a possibility. If Atlanta became the fourth or fifth seed, the team that fell to No. 6 would be able to avoid the Heat until the conference finals.
For the Nets, falling to No. 6 would seemingly be their best chance to reach the conference finals, the expectation set by their owner, Mikhail Prokhorov, for their first season in Brooklyn.
In the West, there is no team as intimidating as the Heat, regardless of the sterling records of the San Antonio Spurs and the Oklahoma City Thunder. But the most interesting development in the West has more to do with how none of the teams contending for the No. 8 spot seem all that determined to take it.
The Los Angeles Lakers are a half-game ahead of the Utah Jazz, with the Dallas Mavericks three gamesback. While the regular season is winding down, there is still enough time for any of those three teams to go on a run and take the final playoff spot. But all three went 6-4 in their last 10 games, delaying a chance to lock up the last playoff spot and become the eventual first-round opponent of either the Spurs or the Thunder.
The eventual No. 8 will have a difficult time advancing. It will be forced to play the No. 1 seed without the home-court advantage, which is a major issue for all three. The Lakers and the Mavericks are both 15-24 on the road, and the Jazz (11-27) are even worse.
 Field-Goal Title 
A season after he obliterated the competition for the N.B.A.'s field-goal percentage title, the Knicks' Tyson Chandler is unlikely to repeat the feat, despite being close to this season's leader, DeAndre Jordan of the Los Angeles Clippers.
Last season, Chandler's .679 percentage was a whopping .106 ahead of Dwight Howard, who finished second. This season Chandler has slumped to .637, which has him just behind Jordan for the highest mark among players with more than 150 attempts. But the threshold to qualify is 300 field goals made. Chandler would need 51 over the Knicks' seven remaining games, or an average of 7.3. The economical Chandler averages only 3.8, so unless he embraces his inner Carmelo Anthony, he will not be in the running.

HEADLINE: African North Americans and the War

BYLINE: ADAM ARENSON


HIGHLIGHT: Why blacks who had fled to Canada returned to fight for the Union. 

 BODY:
Thomas Peter Riggs was not like most soldiers. A private in the 54th Massachusetts regiment, his race would have stood out first to contemporary observers: Riggs was black, and his unit was the first to be organized in the North, after President Lincoln and the Union Army acquiesced to expanding the power of the Emancipation Proclamation with African-Americans fighting as soldiers. 
Riggs was striking in other ways. He was freeborn, in Schenectady, N.Y.- not a Southerner and not an ex-slave, as is popularly assumed about members of the United States Colored Troops. But, perhaps most unusual was that, when in March 1863 he went "to Buffalo for the purpose to enlist into a Company of Colored troops, that was there recruited for the 54. Mass. Regt," he and his traveling companion, John W. Moore, crossed into the United States from Canada, leaving behind their American-born families and work on the warehouse docks of Hamilton, Ontario. 
At the time of the outbreak of the Civil War, they were not even in the United States - they were living comfortably in freedom in Canada. So why did they return to fight? 
Most Americans assume the Underground Railroad was a one-way ticket to freedom, that African-Americans escaping the threat or reality of enslavement in the United States by escaping into Canada stayed there. They also assume that the African-Americans who moved north were all escaped slaves. 
Many were, of course, and many did remain. But recently, scholars have tempered the celebration of such escapes with a focus on the difficulties faced by those of African descent north of the American border - and, I have found in my ongoing research - the large numbers who returned to the United States during the Civil War and Reconstruction, to determine whether they could find work, fight for citizenship and gain a sense of equal rights and opportunities in a nation now committed to ending slavery. 
I call these men African North Americans, individuals of African descent who crossed or re-crossed the United States-Canada border in the years between 1850 and 1930. African North Americans sought a place to live securely with their families, to make and remake communities and to claim equal rights. Some stayed in the United States the rest of their lives. Others found Canada beckoning again; still others moved to Jamaica, Liberia and other countries. But many moved repeatedly around the Great Lakes and between the United States and Canada, seeking economic and social opportunities, without regard to the border. 
The 54th Massachusetts gained its fame through its valor in the battle for Fort Wagner, outside of Charleston, S.C., in July 1863, the battle captured in the climactic scene of the movie "Glory." It was there that Riggs; the regiment's white commanding officer, Robert Gould Shaw; and many other members of the 54th lost their lives in an unsuccessful charge on the fort. The Confederate soldiers threw the bodies of Shaw and his soldiers together into one trench - an act intended as an insult, but embraced as a point of pride by Shaw's family. 
Our account of Riggs comes from his mother's pension application, and from the testimony of John W. Moore, his fellow American-born dockworker who came that day to enlist with Riggs in Buffalo. For a number of years before his 1877 testimony, Moore was living in Detroit, alongside the Riggs family, though there was no sign if he had been employed as a gunsmith, his occupation when enlisted. 
As Moore explained, he had met Riggs in the winter of 1861-62, as they chopped wood together outside "Georgetown a town situated in Canada between Toronto and Guelph." Moore was born in Ontario County, N.Y., and appears in the 1861 Canadian census, with his wife and four children, in Trafalgar, Halton County, Ontario, on the other side of the lake. Riggs's family had traversed regularly from Schenectady to Prescott, Leeds County, Ontario, and to Howard, Kent County, Ontario. 
Even when dictated to lawyers and signed with an X - as John W. Moore's deposition was - these documents reveal the continuity of ties between antebellum experiences in Canada, shared wartime experiences, and a postwar life back on the American side of the Great Lakes borderlands, for United States Colored Troops veterans and those they left behind.
In Detroit and Windsor today, there is an International Underground Railroad Memorial, two related sculptures by Ed Dwight that demonstrate the uncertainty of life as a fugitive in the United States, and the joy passengers on the Underground Railroad felt upon reaching the Canadian side. Considering it, the historian Nora Faires wrote, "For African-descended people between the 1830s and the end of the U.S Civil War, this boundary was vivid, thick, and saturated with meaning." 
The experience of John Moore, Thomas Riggs and tens of thousands of others demonstrate that the journeys for freedom and the fight for rights continued for these African North Americans, whether in the South, North - or beyond the borders of the United States.

HEADLINE: Suburban Disequilibrium

BYLINE: BECKY M. NICOLAIDES and ANDREW WIESE


HIGHLIGHT: How can we keep from building a new inequality on top of the old one? 

 BODY:
 A little pocket of Los Angeles County tucked into the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains reflects a crucial facet of suburban life. There's tiny, wealthy Bradbury, a town that prides itself on having one of the richest ZIP codes in Los Angeles, where a house is on the market for $68.8 million. A couple of miles to the east is Azusa. This modest suburb is more than two-thirds Latino, a town of working families whose incomes and home values are a sliver of the wealth nearby.
These towns represent extremes of social inequality, but in Los Angeles and other areas, they reflect a defining pattern of contemporary suburban life. Nationwide, rich and poor neighborhoods like these house a growing proportion of Americans, up to 31 percent compared with 15 percent in 1970, according to a recent study by Sean F. Reardon and Kendra Bischoff. Meanwhile, iconic middle-income suburbs are shrinking in numbers and prospects. 
Today's suburbs provide a map not just to the different worlds of the rich and the poor, which have always been with us, but to the increase in inequality between economic and social classes.
From the historian's perspective, these patterns also reveal another truth about suburban places: their tendency to sustain and reinforce inequality. Bradbury and Azusa have maintained their spots in the top and bottom tiers of the Los Angeles suburbs for decades. The sociologist John Logan described this "stratifying" feature long ago, noting that localities held on to social advantages and disadvantages over time. Patterns are established, and successive waves of pressure - fiscal, political, social - tend to keep things moving in the same direction.
Some of this is obvious. High property values support high-achieving schools, which in turn increase property values and personal wealth. Racial redlining holds property values down, limiting investment in schools and preventing families from building equity, disadvantages that pass to the next generation like a negative inheritance. The point is not simply that rich and poor people live in different places through a kind of class sorting in the marketplace. The places themselves help to create wealth and poverty. Because of this power of places to fix inequity over time, current patterns are likely to outlive their residents.
Los Angeles embodies these processes in vivid ways, showing how recent trends have amplified uneven landscapes from the past. At the high end, San Marino, Palos Verdes Estates and La Cañada Flintridge have ranked for decades among the county's top municipalities. All are picturesque suburbs, sited in some of the most visually appealing locales in the Southland. Adding to these natural advantages, each is carefully controlled by land-use restrictions that freeze in place their landscapes of high-end homes and freeze out almost everyone else. In San Marino, these buffers are so strong that home prices actually rose during the recession. At the other end, working-class towns like Azusa, San Fernando and Maywood began and remain in a lower tier. These suburbs started modestly with small homes and slender public investments, and they passed these humble trappings down through time.
Globalization helps drive these patterns to new extremes. Money flows into suburbs like San Marino and Palos Verdes, where Asian immigrants buy up expensive properties and generously donate their time and money to the local schools. Money flows out of poorer suburbs like South Gate, Bell and Huntington Park, all heavily Latino, where disposable income is tight and many families export remittances to a home country. New poverty builds upon old impoverishment. Infrastructure is stretched as renters crowd into dwellings that were modest to begin with. The toxic footprint of departed industries is left behind for new residents to contend with.
Many of Los Angeles's middling suburbs have also slipped, especially those ravaged by plant closures since the 1980s. The southern section of blue-collar suburbs was hit especially hard. Here, suburbia transformed from comfortable communities housing unionized workers with well-paying jobs in local factories that gave them access to a middle-class lifestyle to fiscally strained communities housing immigrants working in low-paying, nonunion jobs.
Outer suburbs have fared little better. As home costs skyrocketed in recent decades, families chased "affordable" housing to the exurbs. They took on outsize mortgages and monster commutes, and they took with them congested roads, smog and sprawl. Compounding these strains, tax revenues lagged behind the cost of schools, roads, parks and libraries - the very infrastructure necessary to sustain middle-class life. This edifice came crashing down in the recession. In the Inland Empire, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, one in six homes entered foreclosure between 2006 and 2009. Billboards on the interstate recite a sad litany of child custody law, foreclosure counseling and addiction hot lines - symbols of the good life turned inside out.
Policies to redress suburban inequality must focus not only on factors like income but also on tax equity across metro areas and regional planning that fairly distributes resources and responsibilities (like affordable housing). We should limit the mortgage-interest deduction for second homes and for values above the regional median. These steps would reduce distortions that inflate housing prices and concentrate wealth in what are already wealthy places.
It is not enough to call for measures that stop suburbanization - the suburbs aren't going anywhere. If all we do is try to pretend away their radically unequal fortunes, we will just drop a new suburban inequality on top of the old one.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times and a look at the president&#8217;s weekly address. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
One of President Obama's comments turned calamitous on Thursday when some people accused him of being sexist for saying that Kamala Harris, the California attorney general, is the "best-looking attorney general in the country." He called her on Thursday night to apologize, Michael D. Shear reports.
 

        
Neither Republicans nor Democrats were excited about reports that Mr. Obama would unveil a budget similar to the compromise offer he made last year - cuts to entitlement programs in exchange for new revenues from tax increases, Michael D. Shear reports. The sharp reaction from both sides demonstrates how little space there is in Washington for a bipartisan deal when it comes to tax and spending issues.

        
Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, is writing legislation with a bipartisan group of lawmakers that would overhaul the nation's immigration laws. But some on Capitol Hill are wondering if he will even sign onto the bill. Mr. Rubio has begun to sound nervous when it comes to the legislation, and given the disdain some conservatives reserve for Republicans who consort publicly with Democrats, he has reason to be, Ashley Parker writes.
 Weekly Address 

        
President Obama said in this week's address that he is doing everything he can to "reignite the engine of America's growth: a rising, thriving middle class." He will send a budget to Congress next week that he calls a blueprint for middle-class jobs and growth, one that will reduce deficits while investing in the economy. "It's a budget that doesn't spend beyond our means. And it's a budget that doesn't make harsh and unnecessary cuts that only serve to slow our economy. We'll keep our promise to an aging generation by shoring up Medicare. And we'll keep our promise to the next generation by investing in the fundamentals that have always made America strong," he said. "Because that's what it'll take to make sure America remains strong in the years ahead - and to leave behind something better for our kids."

HEADLINE: Let's Meet

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
IT WAS HAPPY HOUR in Austin, Tex. The sun was sinking, and music was rising on East Sixth Street, a strip of bars and clubs with names the kid in you wants to shout out loud: Chuggin' Monkey, Dizzy Rooster, Jackalope. Closed to cars, the street was a thoroughfare for musicians, party promoters and people looking for beer and a good time. Little by little they found it, disappearing into bars and re-emerging on balconies, drinking from plastic cups and pulling on light jackets as a March wind blew, a reminder that spring was still just out of reach.
Most of these merrymakers (myself included) were not on vacation, despite the beer in their hands and the parties they would soon be off to until the wee hours. They were in town to attend South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive, the technology conference where entrepreneurs and executives soak up new ideas and unblushingly plug their own. But while conferences and festivals like SXSW, Aspen Ideas Festival, WebVisions, TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) and dozens of others have been career enhancers for years, they are also a terrific and overlooked leisure travel option -- particularly if you're vacationing alone. 
Think about it: the locations (like Austin, Aspen and New York) are tourist destinations in their own right; there's built-in entertainment (food crawls, walking tours, cocktail hours); and -- most important -- they draw people attracted to a common theme. Even if you're shy, all those meet-ups and lectures (not to mention the time you spend waiting in line to get into them) make it a breeze to strike up a conversation.
That 600-mile European bike tour you were contemplating? It's hardly the only way to meet like-minded travelers.
New Cities, New Connections
The stranger you meet at a conference might become your pal for an hour, an afternoon, a few days. He or she might become the Facebook friend you thumbs-up from 1,000 miles away, or the new friend that you'll visit each year for the rest of your life. Why, that stranger might even become your spouse.
Just how will you find these kindred spirits? Top conferences don't just offer lectures and workshops: there are also morning jogs, field trips and dinners. ''It's like the Club Med of the intellectual,'' said Rachel Shechtman, the founder of Story, a Manhattan boutique. Ms. Shechtman has attended conferences like TED, PopTech and Gel (Good Experience Live) for business and in the process has also met some of her closest friends. ''There's so much low-hanging fruit,'' she said recently while on her way to speak about the future of retailing at TEDxHollywood, ''that even if you are an introvert both the circumstance and the content of the conference allow for easy dialogue.''
Where that might lead, one never knows: Chelsea Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, met as teenagers at a Renaissance Weekend, the multigenerational ideas festival. And though they are one of the more high-profile conference love connections, they are part of a larger club. It's no secret that conferences are informal places for romance.
Dan Gould, 35, who has attended Renaissance Weekends, TED, EG (Entertainment Gathering) and a number of other conferences said they are self-selecting for people who have big ideas and want to change the world.
''You're not going to easily find someone like that on OkCupid or in a bar,'' he said. ''You have people who have similar values and who care about the same sorts of things.''
Mr. Gould, a founder of the video sharing site Chill.com, had heard of couples who met at one conference or another, but he never gave it much thought -- until he met a woman at TED. They happened to be seated near each other during a talk and, as is common at TED, they continued to bump into each other throughout the four-day conference.
He invited the woman, Marina Kim, 29, to dinner with his friends at a Brazilian restaurant. Turns out, she'd lived in Brazil for a while and taught him a thing or two about caipirinhas. At the end of the conference, he drove her to the airport. He didn't think a relationship was in the cards: he lives in Los Angeles; she lives in Washington, D.C. Yet they kept in touch, meeting up in cities like San Francisco, Washington and Malibu and, eventually, dating. Today, Ms. Kim splits her time between Los Angeles and Washington and -- this just in -- Mr. Gould said, ''Once I get a ring custom designed, I'm planning to ask her to marry me.'' (Ms. Kim, consider the question popped.)
Not everyone falls in love. But many delight in trying. At SXSW Interactive you might spend the morning chatting with someone about coding or crowd funding and, hours later, be re-enacting the ''Oh, Lover Boy'' scene from ''Dirty Dancing.''
As Kathryn Irwin, who first attended SXSW in 1994 and hasn't missed a year since 2000, put it: ''There's been some babies, there's been a lot of dating, and a lot of hooking up.'' Not necessarily in that order. After splitting with her husband in 2009, she too jumped into the SXSW dating pool. ''I was like 'Oh my gosh, there's so many beautiful men,' '' she said.
The best conferences for meeting people have a lot of attendees and a lot going on, both within and beyond the walls of a convention center. In fact, experienced conferencegoers often contend that the best connections are made not during lectures and workshops, but rather in hallways, on shuttle buses and in clubs around town. At SXSW last month there were group runs and yoga classes. There were bikes you could borrow free of charge to explore the city. There were cocktail hours in bars and tents and meet-ups for enthusiasts of typography, photography and space exploration. A food-truck park ensured that favorite local meals were within walking distance of the convention center.
Great conferences also have compelling lectures, making it impossible for strangers not to turn to one another and compare notes, say, on TED talks like Dan Pink (on the science of motivation) and the musician Amanda Palmer (on how artists can be funded by fans) or SXSW sessions like ''Al Gore on the Future,'' ''The New Golden Age of Human Spaceflight,'' ''The Future of Porn'' (an obvious conversation starter).
Of the three branches of SXSW (Music, Film, Interactive), in Austin, Ms. Irwin and other veterans I spoke with think Interactive, which lasts five days, is best for meeting people. Music is a clique, Ms. Irwin cautioned, and Film can be, too. Interactive, on the other hand -- where most people are in their 20s and 30s according to a survey of attendees -- is lovingly referred to as nerd spring break. And it has become more popular with each passing year: 30,621 people attended this year, up from 10,741 in 2009. More than 44 percent of this year's attendees defined themselves as single in the survey. ''Interactive is definitely a more solo group,'' said Ms. Irwin, who worked in accounting before becoming a programmer for SXSW Interactive. ''And they're most likely to network.''
Sometimes that happens before the conference even begins. For instance, in January, SXSW has organized mixers in San Francisco and New York for people who plan to attend: New Yorkers can meet fellow New Yorkers long before they arrive in Austin (and perhaps even save on costs by making plans to share cabs or rooms).
The networking continues at the airport. On any nonstop flight to a conference city a fellow passenger is bound to ask you (as one asked me) if you're attending. Your seatmate is probably going, too (mine was). And when at last you arrive and sit down in a ballroom or exhibition hall, the stranger beside you is likely to ask what you do or where you're from or why you've chosen to listen to a lecture about digital teleportation. SXSW goes a step further, offering meet-ups for ''newbies'' to facilitate friendships and teach conference first-timers how to survive the overwhelming number of panels and parties.
One new mixer, SXsingle, is an attempt by Ms. Irwin to formalize the dating scene there. Promoted with the maxim ''#SXsingle it's not just a hashtag, it's a lifestyle,'' the event took place in what felt like a cozy bar but was really the storefront of an advertising agency on East Sixth Street. Minutes after it began, the space was at capacity and a few latecomers had to wait outside. Beneath white Christmas lights, men and women from their 20s to 40s were chatting and sipping free beer and wine. Among them was Charlie Nox, the master of ceremonies and a San Francisco dating coach with a mop of dark hair. Asked how to make the most of traveling solo, particularly if travelers are not quite comfortable in their own skin, she replied: ''Rock your awkward.''
Translation: radical self-acceptance. Or, as Ms. Irwin explained, at a conference with self-declared geeks, you need not worry about being one. Rather, you might just find the perfect geek for you. Ms. Irwin, who is tall, blond and has a calling card with a photograph of her legs in mid-calf boots and the words, ''We met at SXSW,'' also describes herself as awkward -- until she has a drink. Indeed, she recalled the previous evening in which after a cocktail she ended up walking the streets of Austin rapping the Beastie Boys song ''Paul Revere.'' (Incidentally that sort of thing doesn't raise eyebrows at SXSW, where over 10 minutes I saw someone dressed as a mouse, a shirtless man in a cape, and former Vice President Al Gore.)
Ms. Irwin's plans for SXsingle go beyond her own Saturday night ambitions, however. ''I hope that it will start to create its own movement,'' she said. Her goal? To allow SXSW attendees to meet and flirt online through the festival's social networking site even before they arrive in Austin.
A Conference for Every Taste (and Budget)
If SXSW Interactive doesn't inspire you to book a flight, there are plenty of other options that might. Whatever your passion -- politics, the environment, wine, design, anime -- chances are there's a conference and a city that will intrigue you. Some, though, are more costly and difficult to attend than others, two reasons they have been called elitist.
The most exclusive and high profile conferences, like Aspen Ideas Festival where past speakers have included Barbra Streisand; Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister; and Amy Chua, the author of ''Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,'' tend to cost about the same as a cruise: $1,500 to $3,000. (Early registration for SXSW Interactive this year was $695 -- much less than other major conferences.) Tickets sell out fast. And don't even think about reserving a hotel room at the last minute.
At the top of the conference spectrum, otherwise known as the You're-Never-Ever-Going category, is the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. To attend, you must be a member of the forum and even then the base price of admission (membership plus the entrance fee) is upward of $70,000, as Andrew Ross Sorkin reported in an article a couple of years ago.
TED, which is $7,500 a person, might seem affordable by comparison, though you cannot simply buy your way in. Would-be attendees must be invited or submit an application with answers to questions like ''If a friend were to describe your accomplishments in up to three sentences, what would he or she say?'' and ''Can you share a memorable anecdote from your life that will give us a further sense of what makes you tick?'' Applicants must also provide references.
There are ways, though, to visit cities around the world and to get the flavor of pricier conferences without emptying your bank account. TED, for instance, has spawned TEDx, conferences organized by local communities in Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas that are free or have a nominal charge (a map and list of events is at Ted.com/tedx/events). And some invitation-only conferences -- like the DLD (Digital-Life-Design) conference about digitization, science and culture in Munich -- allow people to apply for a spot.
Many conferences don't require invitations, though. And while they may not be as slick as those that do, they're intimate, diverse and are often held in the same cities as mainstream forums.
Take BIL -- the everyman's TED. It's been referred to as an ''unconference'' (it's more like a gathering of interesting people than a program of speakers), and as its organizers explain on the Web site, it's a ''play off of the formal and elite approach that TED employed to share ideas.'' BIL, which like TED took place in Long Beach, Calif., this year, doesn't technically stand for anything, though it's a wink at ''Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.'' Tickets were $20 for those registered early.
Niche conferences are another option. One of the largest, New York Comic Con, is in a major tourist destination: Manhattan. The city can be intimidating for first-timers, but if you want to come, and come solo, a conference can be a good anchor. Why rub elbows with venture capitalists when you can hang out with the illustrators of Wonder Woman and Batman (Oct. 10 through 13; $85 for a four-days)? Last year, more than 116,000 people attended.
If comics, games, science fiction and fantasy are your bailiwick but you prefer sand and sun to bagels and Broadway, you might want to visit the West Coast for Comic-Con International: San Diego and Comikaze Expo in Los Angeles, the official convention of Stan Lee, comic book writer and a former Marvel Comics executive.
Longing for Paris or London? Consider LeWeb, one of the largest Internet and innovation conferences in Europe, taking place in London on June 5 and 6 (£990 until April 17; £1,590 thereafter, about $1,470 and $2,360 at $1.48 to the pound) and in Paris Dec. 10 through 12 (2,390 euros, about $2,998 at $1.24 to the euro). Past speakers have included Sean Parker, the first president of Facebook and a founder of Napster and Plaxo; Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google; and Kevin Systrom, the chief executive of Instagram. Last year, there were some 5,000 people from more than 80 countries at the London and Paris sessions combined. (For an idea of what LeWeb is like, you can check out video footage from last year's conferences at Paris12.leweb.co.)
Anywhere you attend a conference as a solo traveler you're bound to discover a city in ways you might not have expected, and to meet some wild, interesting people while you're at it. That is, if you follow this advice: look up from your cellphone.
''Nobody's fooled,'' said Ms. Nox, the dating coach. ''We all know you're not getting an important work e-mail. It looks more confident to stand there and be open to an interaction. It's amazing how receptive people are to meeting someone new.''
CONFERENCE CALLS
There's no shortage of compelling cities and conferences, but how to find the best ones for you? Word of mouth is invaluable. And if you register for one conference, your fellow attendees will be able to recommend others in the same vein. On the Web, you can browse Lanyrd.com, which is essentially a social networking site that enables users to discover conferences (by topic or date) and to see which ones their friends plan to attend. Another site, Eventbrite.com, is typically used to register for or to sell tickets to events, but it can also be used to search for conferences (just click on the ''find events'' link and then search for ''conference'').
It's impossible to provide a complete list here, but to help you get started, here's a sampling of conferences large and small, near and far, not discussed in depth in the article.
Do Lectures Have a great idea that you want to turn into a business? This conference in Fforest, West Wales, aims to help participants do just that with talks from entrepreneurs during the day and camping under the stars at night. Information: dolectures.com/the-event.
EG (Entertainment Gathering) This media, technology, entertainment and education confab in Monterey, Calif. is limited to 300 people and this year will include speakers with job titles like cyber illusionist, wood carver, geneticist and wildlife photographer. Information: the-eg.com.

National Conference on LGBT Equality: Creating Change An annual meeting of activists and leaders that includes workshops, film screenings and caucuses (next year's conference will be in Houston). Information: creatingchange.org.
99U Conference Like the popular Web site with which it's associated (99U.com), this New York conference focuses on how to go from an idea to the execution of an idea with classes and talks by authors and entrepreneurs like Seth Godin, and designers like Stefan Sagmeister, who has worked with clients as varied as Rolling Stones and the Guggenheim Museum. Information: 99u.com/conference.
The Story A one-day conference in London about (what else?) the art of storytelling. Information: thestory.org.uk.

HEADLINE: Hybrid Drivers Wanted

BYLINE: By BRADLEY BERMAN

 BODY:
BERKELEY, Calif. -- Every major car company has its own DNA, a set of qualities that make it clear to drivers that they are behind the wheel of a Chevy, a Toyota or a BMW. And just like a healthy human's genetic code, automotive DNA should be an immutable thing, regardless of the technology powering the wheels.
That posed a challenge for Volkswagen as it belatedly developed its first gas-electric hybrid passenger car, the 2013 Jetta Hybrid: how to preserve VW's DNA while introducing technology that shuts off, at least occasionally, its prized internal combustion engines.
True, this new Jetta is not VW's first hybrid vehicle; the Touareg Hybrid has been on sale since 2010. But given that the minuscule production of that S.U.V. in hybrid form, it was more of a pilot project than a mainstream product. 
The Jetta Hybrid, on the other hand, is the real deal: an affordable, fuel-efficient Volkswagen aimed at the large market of family-car buyers.
At its fuel-efficient best, hybrid technology allows the gas engine to be taken over by a silent electric motor. Yet one could argue that VW's identity is fundamentally characterized by the rumble of an efficient internal-combustion engine -- often, of the diesel variety -- springing to life when the accelerator is pressed. The engine flipping on and off could cause angst for VW and for drivers accustomed to its ways.
But VW's engineers are clever, and based on my week with the Jetta Hybrid, it seems they managed to turn the tables, redefining hybrid-ness in a Volkswagen context. The car represents a mix of efficiency, precise handling and high-speed confidence not previously offered in a hybrid.
First, the engineers made the Jetta Hybrid feel more like a VW in how its gears shift. VW avoids the continuously variable transmissions found in hybrids from Toyota, Ford and Honda. Because variable transmissions usually operate at optimal gear ratios, they allow for efficient switching between gas and electric power sources. But with their delayed response to the accelerator, hybrids with C.V.T.'s provide about as much excitement as watching an entire golf tournament on television.
Instead, VW employs its automated 7-speed direct-shift gearbox, in which you feel the gears lock, unlock, pause and re-engage at tighter ratios as the car's speed increases. The manual paddle shifters behind the steering wheel give you the option of controlling those gears. Think of the vroom sound children make when they play with toy cars. That's what Volkswagen engineers were apparently seeking, and it is present in the Jetta Hybrid, though it's missing in many hybrids (notably in the Toyota Prius with its eerie quiet at low speeds and strained high-pitched whine with rapid acceleration).
The Prius's efficiency strategy is to nullify the gas engine with electricity, to defy its existence almost as if in embarrassment of how it's fouling the air. Just the opposite for VW, which embraces the engine.
As a longtime hybrid driver, I had to adjust to this Jetta's idiosyncrasies. In my first days with the car, I tried to drive it like other hybrids, with a very light touch on the accelerator to keep the car in electric mode, preventing the gas engine from waking up. But the Jetta balked at such gentle treatment. From start-up, the engine came on and stayed on, asking to be used. Lifting my foot off the brakes at a stoplight, the car surged forward disconcertingly.
But when I confidently stepped on the accelerator, the Jetta Hybrid came to life, handling switchbacks with dexterity and passing confidently on the highway.
Unfortunately, when the Jetta was driven as it wants to be driven, its mileage suffered. Over 122 miles of mixed city-highway driving, I averaged fuel economy of 35 m.p.g., well below the Environmental Protection Agency's combined city-highway estimate of 45 m.p.g. (The Jetta Hybrid's city rating is 42 m.p.g., and the highway estimate is 48.)
Yet, I easily managed 44 and 45 m.p.g., respectively, on two 60-mile highway jaunts. But such thrift required restraint, certainly not an autobahn driving style.
Volkswagen says the car can be driven up to 44 m.p.h. in pure electric mode, though this is not easily achieved.
The styling of the Jetta, inside and out, is clean, solid and functional, even if some of the flourishes, like the points on the front fascia, seem unresolved. The seating is generous and comfortable. Other hybrids dazzle drivers with large dashboard energy-flow diagrams and eco-motifs like leaves or butterflies, but the Jetta Hybrid's designers remained content to simply let drivers drive. It's all very VW.
There are signs that this Jetta is a rookie hybrid effort. The regenerative braking system feels a bit jerky. The transitions between gas and electric power are not as seamless as Ford's. And the awkward packaging of the hybrid batteries under the hatch reduces cargo space to 11.3 cubic feet, from 15.5.
That loss of space may be enough to sway pragmatic buyers away from the 170-horsepower Hybrid, which has a 1.4-liter gas engine and a base price of $24,995, to the TDI diesel, which starts at $23,055. The diesel, with a 140-horsepower 2-liter engine, has a highway rating of 41 m.p.g.
Volkswagen's identity issues are about to get more challenging as the company adds plug-in electric vehicles to its portfolio. In January, Rudolf Krebs, VW's group chief officer for electric traction, told me, ''We want to become the leader in electrification.'' In this light, hybrids are a steppingstone for the company.
While VW has a global electrification plan that includes seven plug-in hybrids and two pure battery-electric cars by the end of next year, this Jetta is the only conventional no-plug gas-electric hybrid that the company has announced.
The first VW electric car headed to the United States, the e-Golf, goes into production in early 2014. I spent an afternoon driving a prototype version of that car in a loop around San Francisco Bay. Because the e-Golf is powered purely by an electric motor, guided by a single-speed transmission -- and governed to a sober top speed of about 80 m.p.h. -- VW's engineers had to be creative on the matter of adhering to brand guidelines.
''It's obviously an electric vehicle, but it feels like a gas-powered Volkswagen,'' said Darryll Harrison, the spokesman who accompanied me on my e-Golf drive. ''That was the goal.''
One example of how engineers tried to convey the feel of a gasoline-powered car was to use the paddle shifters to control the regenerative braking rather than the transmission. Tugging one of the paddles makes the car stop faster, feeding more energy to the battery pack. If you flick the other side, the car will coast longer. This is a great feature that will be appreciated by ardent E.V. fans.
But then VW went a step too far. Instead of allowing the e-Golf's inherently quiet cabin to be a desirable evolution of VW's brand character in the electric car era, the company embedded a speaker in the e-Golf's dash that emits an artificial engine sound that gets louder as the car accelerates at low speeds. At about 20 m.p.h., the speaker is silenced and the actual sound of the road takes over.
This auditory contrivance reveals the steps that VW is willing to take to make sure its electric-drive vehicles, starting with the Jetta Hybrid, remain steeped in internal combustion aesthetics, even while the fuel that propels the wheels shifts from dirty hydrocarbons to clean electrons.

HEADLINE: Big Thoughts, Early On

BYLINE: By CLARA SHIH. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I WAS born in Hong Kong and immigrated to the United States with my family when I was 4. I spent most of my childhood in Chicago. My elementary school had no program in English as a second language, so I was placed in a class for students with speech impediments. It worked out well because we had to pronounce sounds over and over, and I'm told that I don't have an accent today.
My father, a math professor in Hong Kong, worked as an electrical engineer here. My mother was an art teacher, but once we came to the United States, she went back to school and became certified as a special-education teacher. 
The immigrant experience had a profound effect on me. It taught me the importance of hard work and the value of being entrepreneurial. I saw what a hard time my parents had upon arriving in this country. It takes time to understand a new system and the tacit rules of a new culture.
My high school, the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, showed me that anything is possible and that you're never too young to think big. At 15, I worked as a computer programmer at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, or Fermilab. After graduating, I attended Stanford for a degree in economics and computer science.
While there, I was an intern at Microsoft and developed the RSS news aggregator for Outlook, the company's e-mail offering. I also volunteered in East Palo Alto, Calif., teaching and encouraging low-income elementary students to become interested in math, science and technology.
Based on that experience, I founded the Camp Amelia Technology Literacy Group, a nonprofit, in 2003. It provided free computer training and software for urban youth. Camp Amelia has since merged with another technology education nonprofit, SearchLit.org.
In my senior year, I was a Mayfield Fellow; the program essentially provided a crash course in starting a company. I was the Phi Beta Kappa class speaker at my 2005 commencement and then stayed at Stanford to get a master's in computer science. Next, I studied at the University of Oxford on a Marshall Scholarship and received a second master's, in Internet studies. While in England, I also worked on the corporate strategy team at Google's offices there.
In 2006, I got a call from a recruiter for Salesforce.com and decided to join the company as a product director. In 2007, I became intrigued by Facebook's developer platform and decided to create an application within Salesforce.com called Faceconnector, which enabled Salesforce customers to view select Facebook profile information as permitted by each Facebook member. I allowed people to use it free, and word spread quickly. Shortly after that, Prentice Hall contacted me with a book deal. I spent 2008 writing ''The Facebook Era: Tapping Online Social Networks to Build Better Products, Reach New Audiences and Sell More Stuff.''
I realized that social media would be transformational for businesses and decided to start a software company that would help Fortune 500 companies manage their marketing efforts using social media. Steve Garrity, who had been a computer lab partner of mine at Stanford, left his job at Microsoft to start that company, Hearsay Social, with me in 2009.
I'm passionate about encouraging women and girls to pursue math, science and engineering. At times, it was intimidating for me to be the only woman in an advanced-level engineering class, and it's still intimidating at C.E.O. events. But just by showing up, my female colleagues and I are making it easier for those who come after us.

HEADLINE: In History Class, Capitalism Sees Its Stock Soar

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
A specter is haunting university history departments: the specter of capitalism.
After decades of ''history from below,'' focusing on women, minorities and other marginalized people seizing their destiny, a new generation of scholars is increasingly turning to what, strangely, risked becoming the most marginalized group of all: the bosses, bankers and brokers who run the economy.
Even before the financial crisis, courses in ''the history of capitalism'' -- as the new discipline bills itself -- began proliferating on campuses, along with dissertations on once deeply unsexy topics like insurance, banking and regulation. The events of 2008 and their long aftermath have given urgency to the scholarly realization that it really is the economy, stupid.
The financial meltdown also created a serious market opportunity. Columbia University Press recently introduced a new ''Studies in the History of U.S. Capitalism'' book series (''This is not your father's business history,'' the proposal promised), and other top university presses have been snapping up dissertations on 19th-century insurance and early-20th-century stock speculation, with trade publishers and op-ed editors following close behind. 
The dominant question in American politics today, scholars say, is the relationship between democracy and the capitalist economy. ''And to understand capitalism,'' said Jonathan Levy, an assistant professor of history at Princeton University and the author of ''Freaks of Fortune: The Emerging World of Capitalism and Risk in America,'' ''you've got to understand capitalists.''
That doesn't mean just looking in the executive suite and ledger books, scholars are quick to emphasize. The new work marries hardheaded economic analysis with the insights of social and cultural history, integrating the bosses'-eye view with that of the office drones -- and consumers -- who power the system.
''I like to call it 'history from below, all the way to the top,' '' said Louis Hyman, an assistant professor of labor relations, law and history at Cornell and the author of ''Debtor Nation: The History of America in Red Ink.''
The new history of capitalism is less a movement than what proponents call a ''cohort'': a loosely linked group of scholars who came of age after the end of the cold war cleared some ideological ground, inspired by work that came before but unbeholden to the questions -- like, why didn't socialism take root in America? -- that animated previous generations of labor historians.
Instead of searching for working-class radicalism, they looked at office clerks and entrepreneurs.
''Earlier, a lot of these topics would've been greeted with a yawn,'' said Stephen Mihm, an associate professor of history at the University of Georgia and the author of ''A Nation of Counterfeiters: Capitalists, Con Men and the Making of the United States.'' ''But then the crisis hit, and people started asking, 'Oh my God, what has Wall Street been doing for the last 100 years?' ''
In 1996, when the Harvard historian Sven Beckert proposed an undergraduate seminar called the History of American Capitalism -- the first of its kind, he believes -- colleagues were skeptical. ''They thought no one would be interested,'' he said.
But the seminar drew nearly 100 applicants for 15 spots and grew into one of the biggest lecture courses at Harvard, which in 2008 created a full-fledged Program on the Study of U.S. Capitalism. That initiative led to similar ones on other campuses, as courses and programs at Princeton, Brown, Georgia, the New School, the University of Wisconsin and elsewhere also began drawing crowds -- sometimes with the help of canny brand management.
After Seth Rockman, an associate professor of history at Brown, changed the name of his course from Capitalism, Slavery and the Economy of Early America to simply Capitalism, students concentrating in economics and international relations started showing up alongside the student labor activists and development studies people.
''It's become a space where you can bring together segments of the university that are not always in conversation,'' Dr. Rockman said. (Next fall the course will become Brown's introductory American history survey.)
While most scholars in the field reject the purely oppositional stance of earlier Marxist history, they also take a distinctly critical view of neoclassical economics, with its tidy mathematical models and crisp axioms about rational actors.
Markets and financial institutions ''were created by people making particular choices at particular historical moments,'' said Julia Ott, an assistant professor in the history of capitalism at the New School (the first person, several scholars said, to be hired under such a title).
To dramatize that point, Dr. Ott has students in her course Whose Street? Wall Street! dress up in 19th-century costume and re-enact a primal scene in financial history: the early days of the Chicago Board of Trade.
Some of her colleagues take a similarly playful approach. To promote a two-week history of capitalism ''boot camp'' to be inaugurated this summer at Cornell, Dr. Hyman (a former consultant at McKinsey & Company) designed ''history of capitalism'' T-shirts.
The camp, he explained, is aimed at getting relatively innumerate historians up to speed on the kinds of financial data and documents found in business archives. Understanding capitalism, Dr. Hyman said, requires ''both Foucault and regressions.''
It also, scholars insist, requires keeping race and gender in the picture.
As examples, they point to books like Nathan Connolly's ''World More Concrete: Real Estate and the Remaking of Jim Crow South Florida,'' coming next year, and Bethany Moreton's ''To Serve God and Wal-Mart: The Making of Christian Free Enterprise'' (Harvard, 2009), winner of multiple prizes, which examines the role of evangelical Christian values in mobilizing the company's largely female work force.
The history of capitalism has also benefited from a surge of new, economically minded scholarship on slavery, with scholars increasingly arguing that Northern factories and Southern plantations were not opposing economic systems, as the old narrative has it, but deeply entwined.
And that entwining, some argue, involved people far beyond the plantations and factories themselves, thanks to financial shenanigans that resonate in our own time.
In a paper called ''Toxic Debt, Liar Loans and Securitized Human Beings: The Panic of 1837 and the Fate of Slavery,'' Edward Baptist, a historian at Cornell, looked at the way small investors across America and Europe snapped up exotic financial instruments based on slave holdings, much as people over the past decade went wild for mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations -- with a similarly disastrous outcome.
Other scholars track companies and commodities across national borders. Dr. Beckert's ''Empire of Cotton,'' to be published by Alfred A. Knopf, traces the rise of global capitalism over the past 350 years through one crop. Nan Enstad's book in progress, ''The Jim Crow Cigarette: Following Tobacco Road From North Carolina to China and Back,'' examines how Southern tobacco workers, and Southern racial ideology, helped build the Chinese cigarette industry in the early 20th century.
Whether scrutiny of the history of capitalism represents a genuine paradigm shift or a case of scholarly tulip mania, one thing is clear.
''The worse things are for the economy,'' Dr. Beckert said wryly, ''the better they are for the discipline.''

HEADLINE: Can We Get Hillary Without the Foolery?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
PLEASE don't ask me this anymore.
It's such a silly question. Of course Hillary is running. I've never met a man who was told he could be president who didn't want to be president. So naturally, a woman who's told she can be the first commandress in chief wants to be.
''Running for president is like sex,'' James Carville told me. ''No one ever did it once and forgot about it.''
Joe Biden wants the job. He's human (very). But he's a realist. He knows the Democratic Party has a messianic urge to finish what it started so spectacularly with the election of Barack Obama -- busting up the world's most exclusive white-bread old-boys' club. And he knows that women, both Democratic and Republican, want to see one of their own in the White House and became even more militant while listening to the G.O.P.'s retrogressive talk about contraception and vaginal probes last year. 
Also, Joe genuinely likes Hillary. These two have no appetite for tearing each other apart.
As long as there are no more health scares -- the thick glasses are gone -- Hillary's age won't stop her. The Clinton scandals and dysfunction are in the rearview mirror at the moment, and the sluggish economy casts a halcyon glow on the Clinton era. Hillary is a symbol and a survivor, running on sainthood. Ronald Reagan, elected at 69, was seen as an ''ancient king'' gliding through life, as an aide put it. Hillary, who would be elected at 69, would be seen as an ancient queen striding through life.
She was supposed to go off to a spa, rest and get back in shape after her grueling laps around the world. But instead she's a tornado of activity, speaking at global women's conferences in D.C. and New York; starting to buck-rake on the speaking circuit; putting out a video flipping her position to support gay marriage; and signing a lucrative deal for a memoir on world affairs -- all as PACs spring up around her, Bill Clinton and Carville begin to foment, and Chelsea lands on the cover of this week's Parade, talking about how ''unapologetically and unabashedly'' biased she is about her mother's future.
''I can't see her taking it easy and sitting on the couch eating a bowl of popcorn,'' said Randall Johnston, a 25-year-old New York University Law School student who helped pass out ''Ready for Hillary'' signs on Friday outside Lincoln Center, while her icon was inside enthralling the crowd at Tina Brown's ''Women in the World'' conference.
Hillary jokes that people regard her hair as totemic, and just so, her new haircut sends a signal of shimmering intention: she has ditched the skinned-back bun that gave her the air of a K.G.B. villainess in a Bond movie and has a sleek new layered cut that looks modern and glamorous.
In a hot pink jacket and black slacks, she leaned in for a 2016 manifesto, telling the blissed-out crowd of women that America cannot truly lead in the world until women here at home are full partners with equal pay and benefits, careers in math and science, and ''no limit'' on how big girls can dream.
''This truly is the unfinished business of the 21st century,'' she said. But everyone knew the truly ''unfinished business'' Hillary was referring to: herself.
''She's gone to hell and back trying to be president,'' Carville said. ''She's paid her dues, to say the least. The old cliché is that Democrats fall in love and Republicans fall in line. But now Republicans want a lot of people to run and they want to fall in love. And Democrats don't want to fight; they just want to get behind Hillary and go on from there.''
The real question is not whether but whither. Does Hillary have learning software? Did she learn, from her debacle with health care, to be more transparent and less my-way-or-the-highway? Did she learn, after voting to support W.'s nonsensical invasion of Iraq without even reading the intelligence estimate, that she doesn't need to overcompensate to show she's tough? (No one, even Fox News, thinks she's a Wellesley hippie anymore.)
Did she learn, from her viper's nest and money pit of a campaign in 2008, how to manage an enterprise rather than be swamped by rampant dysfunction? Did she learn, when she wrapped herself in an off-putting and opaque mantle of entitlement in the primary, that she's perfectly capable of charming reporters and voters if she wants to, without the obnoxious undertone of ''I'm owed this''?
Even top Democrats who plan to support Hillary worry about her two sides. One side is the idealistic public servant who wants to make the world a better place. The other side is darker, stemming from old insecurities; this is the side that causes her to make decisions from a place of fear and to second-guess herself. It dulls her sense of ethics and leads to ends-justify-the-means wayward ways. This is the side that compels her to do anything to win, like hiring the scummy strategists Dick Morris and Mark Penn, and greedily grab for what she feels she deserves.
If Obama is the kid who studies only on the night before and gets an A, Hillary is the kid who studies all the time, stays up all night and does extra credit work to get the A. She doesn't know how not to drive herself into the ground.
As Carl Bernstein wrote in his Hillary biography, ''A Woman in Charge,'' her insecurities grew from her herculean effort to win paternal praise: ''When Hillary came home with all A's except for one B on her report card, her father suggested that perhaps her school was too easy, and wondered half-seriously why she hadn't gotten straight A's. Hillary tried mightily to extract some unequivocal declaration of approval from her father, but he had tremendous difficulty in expressing pride or affection.''
Hillary was an indefatigable secretary of state -- she logged 956,733 diplomatic frequent-flier miles -- and a star ambassador, especially on women's issues. But many experts feel, as John Cassidy wrote in The New Yorker, that, compared with the work of more geopolitical secretaries, her ''signature achievements look like small beer.''
Still, the job allowed her to get out of her husband's codependent shadow and develop a more authentic aura of inevitability. President Obama allowed his former rival to take Hillaryland into the State Department and then build it out, burnishing her own feminist brand around the world.
The idea of Hillary is winning, a grand historical gender bender: first lady upgrading to president. But is the reality winning? The Clintons have a rare talent for finding puddles to step in. Out of public life, can she adapt and make the leaps needed, in a world changing at a dizzying tempo, to keep herself on top?
Her challenge is to get into the future and stay there, adding fresh people and perspectives and leaving the Clinton mishegoss and cheesiness in the past.
The real question about Hillary is this: When people take a new look at her in the coming years, will they see the past or the future -- Mrs. Clinton or Madam President?

HEADLINE: Lose Some Now, Avoid The Heat Later

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
It may sound ridiculous to declare six better than four or five, but when it comes to playoff seedings in the Eastern Conference, you could certainly make the argument that it would be better to be worse.
The imbalance of power between the East and the stronger West in the N.B.A., other than at the top, is still a major factor. But in the East's field of one favorite, the Miami Heat, the playoff seedings present a chance for teams to make LeBron James and his Heat someone else's problem. For some teams, including the Nets, that may make losing a few games as the regular season winds down seem awfully appealing.
The way the playoff structure works, the Heat, as the conference's No. 1 seed, will face the No. 8 seed in the first round; that will almost certainly be the Milwaukee Bucks. Major upsets have happened, and the Bucks are certainly an entertaining team, with Monta Ellis and Brandon Jennings providing highlights on offense while Larry Sanders, potentially the league's defensive player of the year, clogs up the middle. But provided the ailing Heat get back to health in time, they should be able to roll past the Bucks. 
Should Miami win, its second-round opponent would be the winner of the first-round matchup between the Nos. 4 and 5 seeds, currently the Nets and the Chicago Bulls, though the Atlanta Hawks, now sixth, remain a possibility. If Atlanta became the fourth or fifth seed, the team that fell to No. 6 would be able to avoid the Heat until the conference finals.
For the Nets, falling to No. 6 would seemingly be their best chance to reach the conference finals, the expectation set by their owner, Mikhail Prokhorov, for their first season in Brooklyn.
In the West, there is no team as intimidating as the Heat, regardless of the sterling records of the San Antonio Spurs and the Oklahoma City Thunder. But the most interesting development in the West has more to do with how none of the teams contending for the No. 8 spot seem all that determined to take it.
The Los Angeles Lakers are a half-game ahead of the Utah Jazz, with the Dallas Mavericks three gamesback. While the regular season is winding down, there is still enough time for any of those three teams to go on a run and take the final playoff spot. But all three went 6-4 in their last 10 games, delaying a chance to lock up the last playoff spot and become the eventual first-round opponent of either the Spurs or the Thunder.
The eventual No. 8 will have a difficult time advancing. It will be forced to play the No. 1 seed without the home-court advantage, which is a major issue for all three. The Lakers and the Mavericks are both 15-24 on the road, and the Jazz (11-27) are even worse.
Field-Goal Title
A season after he obliterated the competition for the N.B.A.'s field-goal percentage title, the Knicks' Tyson Chandler is unlikely to repeat the feat, despite being close to this season's leader, DeAndre Jordan of the Los Angeles Clippers.
Last season, Chandler's .679 percentage was a whopping .106 ahead of Dwight Howard, who finished second. This season Chandler has slumped to .637, which has him just behind Jordan for the highest mark among players with more than 150 attempts. But the threshold to qualify is 300 field goals made. Chandler would need 51 over the Knicks' seven remaining games, or an average of 7.3. The economical Chandler averages only 3.8, so unless he embraces his inner Carmelo Anthony, he will not be in the running.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Lawrence Fuchs, 86, Expert on Immigration

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Lawrence H. Fuchs, a scholar of American ethnicity who as a federal government adviser helped lay the groundwork for the last major overhaul of American immigration law, in 1986, died on March 17 at his home in Canton, Mass. He was 86.
The cause was Parkinson's disease, his daughter Naomi Fuchs said. 
Dr. Fuchs, who founded Brandeis University's American studies department in 1970, wrote books and articles on ethnic groups in the United States and their political activities. In particular, he scrutinized American Jews and the multiethnic culture of Hawaii. His analysis of how ethnicity contributed to American society in the 1990 book ''The American Kaleidoscope: Race, Ethnicity and the Civic Culture'' became standard in university social science courses.
Dr. Fuchs ventured beyond the classroom to advise John F. Kennedy on ethnic politics when Mr. Kennedy was a senator from Massachusetts preparing to run for president. They focused on the electoral proclivities of Roman Catholics and Jews. He wrote several speeches for Mr. Kennedy and later the 1967 book ''John F. Kennedy and American Catholicism.''
Twice Dr. Fuchs jumped into the unending fray over American immigration policy to lead far-reaching evaluations of the issue for the federal government.
Since the enactment of the Naturalization Act of 1790, which restricted immigration to ''free white persons,'' the United States has struggled with regulating immigration. Ideals of openness to newcomers have clashed with economic protectionism and nativist prejudice.
In 1977, President Jimmy Carter proposed legislation to raise the immigration quota for Mexicans and set up a process to legalize immigrants already living in the country illegally. Congress did not move on the proposal, but it worked with the president to set up the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy. Dr. Fuchs was named executive director.
The commission recommended tighter border security, penalties for employers who hired illegal immigrants, and a one-time amnesty for most illegal immigrants. It delivered its report to the newly inaugurated President Ronald Reagan in January 1981.
After five years of lobbying by Dr. Fuchs, Congress passed a bill, and Mr. Reagan signed it, calling it ''the most comprehensive reform of our immigration laws since 1953,'' when racial distinctions were removed from the law.
But illegal immigration continued to surge, and in 1990 Congress mandated a new advisory panel, the United States Commission on Immigration Reform. Dr. Fuchs was named vice chairman.
In 1997, the panel called for stronger policing of employers who hire illegal immigrants and urged that skilled workers and immediate family members be given priority. The proposals continue to be debated fiercely.
''What are our priorities for legal immigration?'' he asked in testimony before a House Judiciary Committee panel. ''It is our view as a commission that those priorities should dictate the numbers to a considerable extent.''
Lawrence Howard Fuchs was born on Jan. 29, 1927, in the Bronx. At 19, he enlisted in the Navy and served as a medic. After his discharge he earned a bachelor's degree in political science from New York University and a Ph.D. from Harvard.
Dr. Fuchs's first marriage, to Natalie Rogers, ended in divorce. His wife of 42 years, the former Betty Corcoran Hooven, died last year. Besides his daughter Naomi, he is survived by three other daughters, Janet and Frances Fuchs and Carole Hooven Byrne; his sons, Michael Hooven, Fred Hooven and John Hooven; nine grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
Dr. Fuchs taught at Brandeis from 1952 until his retirement in 2002, and he was chairman of its American studies department for 25 years. Some of the courses he taught were so oversubscribed that he required students to write a letter explaining why they should be admitted. None were more popular than a seminar on American politics that he taught in 1959 and 1960 alongside a visiting professor, Eleanor Roosevelt, the former first lady.

HEADLINE: A Low-Growth World Can Also Mean High Profits

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
ECONOMIC growth has been subdued for so long that conditions that used to seem like busts are starting to look like booms.
The economy barely budged in the fourth quarter of 2012, expanding at an annual rate of 0.4 percent, and then only after the initial reading was revised upward. Unemployment was 7.6 percent in March , and home prices, though off their lows, were about where they were a decade ago.
As mediocre as those numbers are, they were achieved with huge Federal Reserve assistance and government spending. Another sobering consideration is that the situation is not so great elsewhere, either. Europe, which is getting central bank help of its own, has sunk into another recession. And while Asia is expanding much faster than the West, it is doing so-so or worse by the standards of its own recent history.
While the first quarter of this year was expected to be better than the fourth quarter of last year, at least in the United States, many economists and investment advisers find themselves resigned to living in a world with persistently low growth. Populations are aging in the developed world, economists point out, while resources are scarcer, and the huge debts run up to finance government stimulus will have to be repaid eventually, diverting money from other uses. 
''Hopefully it won't be slow forever, but over the short to medium term it's something you need to prepare yourself for, for sure,'' said Russell Croft, a co-manager of the Croft Value fund.
The Congressional Budget Office, in a report on the domestic economy issued in February, forecast ''real potential gross domestic product'' growth of 1.8 percent to 2.5 percent a year through 2023.
Farther afield, the International Monetary Fund expects global growth of 3.8 percent this year and 4 percent in 2014. That is a modest upturn from its estimate of 3.2 percent for 2012, but according to United Nations data, lower than in 9 of the 10 years before the financial crisis.
As somber as the outlook is, slow growth has not been much of a hindrance to stock and bond markets in the last four years, when corporate profit margins reached record highs. That is proof that investment portfolios need not suffer along with the economy, something that hardly surprises Jeremy Grantham, chief investment strategist of the fund management company GMO.
In a recent letter to shareholders, Mr. Grantham said he found little connection between strong profits and strong economic growth. If anything, rapid expansion can hurt bottom lines, he said, because companies tend to pay too high a price trying to exploit it.
''The problem with growth companies and growth countries is that they so often outrun the capital with which to grow and must raise more capital,'' diluting earnings per share, he said.
That doesn't make it safe to ignore the economic environment. Those who foresee continued lethargy point out that investors have already had several years to adjust to slow growth and have put their money to work accordingly. That means that they can expect returns to be lower, and to come from fewer market niches, and not necessarily the ones that conventional wisdom suggests would do better.
''The attitude is that slow growth equals a bad investment environment, so you want to buy bonds,'' said Nathan J. Rowader, director of investments at the Forward Funds. ''But interest rates are very depressed, so you can't get decent returns in bonds. You need to think about it from a secular standpoint. Low growth and low rates is a good environment for stocks.''
Mr. Rowader favors businesses that return cash to shareholders rather than investing it in a heroic effort to wring growth out of an economy that has little of it.
''It's important in this scenario to buy dividend-paying stocks, because the ways that companies can grow earnings are limited,'' he said. ''It means something to show that they can pay dividends and grow them over time instead of hoping that the economy gets better.''
Suitable companies tend to have strong balance sheets and credit ratings, Mr. Rowader said. They do not have much debt, but can borrow cheaply anytime they choose. He prefers European examples over American ones because they have similar business mixes, but are often cheaper.
''They can grow their dividends over time, but they're being punished because they're European,'' he said. ''You can also get a bump up when that undervaluation starts to correct itself.''
Three such companies in Forward's portfolios are Lottomatica, an Italian provider of gambling technology; Danone, the French food giant; and Ensco, a British enterprise engaged in deepwater oil drilling.
CHUCK AKRE, manager of the Akre Focus fund, says he likes to look for stocks of companies that can expand despite the poor economy.
''We continue to be focused on trying to find compounders,'' Mr. Akre said, meaning companies that generate comparatively high returns on capital and have a record of plowing earnings back into their businesses in wise, profitable ways. The sorts of returns that they can produce are lower in a sluggish economy, he added, but their valuations are lower, too, so shareholders can still do well.
Two of his holdings are MasterCard and Visa. Even though ''in a slower-growth economy people spend a little less on cards,'' he said, these companies can still flourish from the broad global trend toward increasing card use and less reliance on cash and checks.
Mr. Akre also owns shares of American Tower, which rents space on cellphone towers through contracts that call for annual price increases. ''It's a great business model regardless of the environment,'' he said. ''It's vertical real estate.''
Mr. Croft shares Mr. Rowader's appreciation of big dividend payouts, but Mr. Croft prefers to obtain them from American companies that do business in places with ''pockets of growth that are faster than the U.S.,'' he said.
His selections include Mondelez International, a snack food manufacturer spun off from Kraft that derives 45 percent of sales from emerging markets; the tobacco producer Philip Morris International and ''solid blue-chip companies that may not be as expensive as they used to be,'' like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer.
Mr. Croft also likes companies that are improving productivity or resolving issues that have limited profits, including three makers of big-ticket items of various sorts, Whirlpool, Ford Motor and Honeywell. The idea is to own businesses that are fixing themselves when the economy is struggling to manage the same feat.
''Everyone talks about how margins are at their peaks, and they wonder how long it can keep going,'' he said. ''You've got to find companies that are hitting new peaks and are going to keep getting better.''

HEADLINE: Health Policy Is in Flux, and So Are Funds

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
THE Affordable Care Act, a k a Obamacare, isn't the only upheaval in the health care sector lately. Health care mutual funds have experienced tumult, too.
The two largest such funds, Vanguard Health Care and T. Rowe Price Health Sciences, recently lost their longtime managers. Edward P. Owens, who ran the Vanguard fund for nearly 30 years, retired in December, and Kris H. Jenner quit T. Rowe Price in February. Two analysts who worked with Dr. Jenner, who is a physician, left, too; the three are pursuing a new investment venture.
For investors, the departures offer a chance to assess whether these funds can continue to put up good returns and whether they -- or any other health care funds -- have a place in an equity portfolio. Health care has long been considered a defensive investment because the sector accounts for about one-sixth of gross domestic product, and demand for it is fairly stable. People fall ill in good economic times and bad, and the United States population, like those throughout the developed world, is aging.
But an investor with a diversified portfolio -- anchored, say, by a Standard & Poor's 500 index fund, probably has enough health care investments already, said Campbell R. Harvey, a professor of international business at Duke University. 
''It is hard to make the case for an individual investor overweighting the health care sector,'' Professor Harvey said. If anything, health care growth may slow as the United States tries to bring its higher-than-average spending into line with that of other developed countries. ''The health care industry will be under enormous pressure over the next few years to reduce costs,'' he said.
The Vanguard and T. Rowe Price funds loom large within this niche. Vanguard's fund holds about $25 billion in assets, and T. Rowe Price's fund about $6 billion. Combined, they control more than the sum of the assets in all the other health funds tracked by Morningstar. Over the 15 years through March, they also outperformed many peers: Vanguard's fund returned 11.2 percent, annualized, while the comparable figure for T. Rowe Price's fund, which Dr. Jenner took over in 2000, is 11.8 percent. That compares with 8.3 percent for the average health fund and 4.3 percent for the S.& P. 500 over the same period.
The two managers ran their funds differently. Mr. Owens hunted for bargains and hung on to holdings for years; his turnover ratio was typically about 10 percent. Dr. Jenner was more of a highflier. He sleuthed among early-stage innovators, especially biotech companies, and shied away from the big drug makers that are the bedrock of many health portfolios. Thus, the T. Rowe Price fund did not have Johnson & Johnson, Merck or Pfizer among its recent top 10 holdings, though these tend to be stalwarts in competing funds. Vanguard's fund, for example, owned Merck, its top holding, and Pfizer. The two funds' only common top-10 holdings were the UnitedHealth Group and McKesson.
Both Mr. Owens and Dr. Jenner were replaced by colleagues. Wellington Management in Boston, which oversees investments for the Vanguard fund, promoted Jean M. Hynes. She had been associate manager since 2008 and an analyst on the fund for two decades. She declined to be interviewed for this article.
T. Rowe Price named Taymour R. Tamaddon to replace Dr. Jenner. Mr. Tamaddon, an analyst on the fund for nine years, predicted no change in strategy.
''My investment process has been driven by my experiences of working with Kris,'' he said. ''We focus the fund on innovation and therapies that can satisfy unmet medical needs.''
An example is Pharmacyclics, a recent top holding. It is developing a cancer drug, ibrutinib, that hasn't shown the toxicity of other chemotherapies. ''It's unbelievably safe, which means duration of use will be longer,'' Mr. Tamaddon said. ''In cancer, a drug's market size stems from how many cancers it works with and how long patients can be on it.''
Todd L. Rosenbluth, director of exchange-traded and mutual fund research at S&P Capital IQ, said investors typically should hold off buying into a fund during a managerial transition. Waiting gives time to observe strategy changes like, say, a reshuffling of a portfolio. But continuity seems likely at the Vanguard and T. Rowe Price funds, he said.
Even so, both current and prospective investors will want to monitor performance, he said. If they notice a sustained dip, they should check their fund's numbers against those of competitors. ''Does the fund lag for reasons that are hard to explain?'' he asked. ''If pharma does well and a fund lags, then you'd want to look more closely.''
AS for the larger question of whether anyone needs a health care fund, Mr. Rosenbluth said S&P Capital IQ favors the sector. ''If you're going to increase your bet toward defensive sectors, health care is the one we like the most,'' he said, because of its stability and growth. If you're considering such a move, first determine how much health care you have among your existing investments. If you are already in a fund like the Vanguard 500 Index fund, he said, ''you're getting 12 percent exposure, and you're getting Merck, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson in heavy weightings.''
Managers of other well-known health care funds say that while domestic economic numbers matter, they aren't what determine the health sector's promise for investors. Trends abroad, especially in emerging markets, are creating new opportunities.
''The emerging middle classes are starting to want more health care,'' said Eddie Yoon, manager of the Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio. ''That's a stable demand driver. In some of the emerging countries, there's policy that they want health care spending to grow -- they want to take it from X percent of G.D.P. to Y percent. China has said it wants to build 5,000 hospitals.''
American companies should benefit, as they are seen worldwide as leaders and innovators. ''Health care is a big export industry for U.S. companies,'' Mr. Yoon said. ''About half their sales are generated outside of the United States.''
Samuel D. Isaly, manager of the Eaton Vance Worldwide Health Sciences fund, also pointed to growth abroad as a reason to overweight health care. He has wagered his investors' money on that view, putting about a third of his fund's assets in foreign companies.
''You're too localized when you talk about health care just in terms of the S.& P. 500,'' Mr. Isaly said. The index's health weighting may seem high, but that's not the sort of number that matters most to him. What matters, he said, is 2 percent -- the percentage of G.D.P. that China spends on health care, even as its population, too, has begun to age.
''You could come to the conclusion that health care has to go up,'' he said, ''and you want to invest in something that's going up.''

HEADLINE: Nuclear Talks With Iran End Without Accord or Plans for Another Round

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Jodi Rudoren contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

 BODY:
ALMATY, Kazakhstan -- Negotiations over Iran's disputed nuclear program broke off Saturday with scant signs of progress, much less an agreement on tighter controls demanded by six world powers in exchange for some easing of sanctions that have a stranglehold on the Iranian economy.
The failure to reach any accord was a stark but not surprising setback in a tortuous, decade-long standoff over Iran's nuclear ambitions. While the talks have been complicated by the Iranian presidential election just 10 weeks away, officials said the sides remained divided by fundamental disagreements, none of which are new.
Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief, who led the talks for the six powers, said that after two days of ''long and intense discussions,'' the sides ''remain far apart on the substance.''
No future negotiations were announced, and Ms. Ashton said she would be ''in touch very soon'' with the top Iranian negotiator, Saeed Jalili, ''in order to see how to go forward.'' 
Mr. Jalili offered a sharply different summary, saying at a briefing that the next move was up to the big powers, and that they needed more time to digest a new proposal from Iran. He said the proposal was largely based on a plan first put forward in Moscow in June and aimed at addressing some of the international community's concerns.
But he also adopted a strident tone in reiterating Iran's view that it has a right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes.
''Of course, there is some distance in the position of the two sides,'' Mr. Jalili said. But he said Iran's proposals, which required recognizing ''our right to enrich and ending behaviors which have every indication of enmity toward the Iranian people,'' were designed ''to help us move toward a constructive road.''
A senior American official called Iran's demands unreasonable and ''disproportionate.''
''It is fair to say that Iran is prepared to take very minimal steps in regards to its nuclear program,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, which has become the State Department's standard practice at the talks.
The official insisted that the Obama administration was still committed to achieving a diplomatic solution, but warned of additional sanctions should Iran fail to voluntarily curb its nuclear program. ''International pressure continues and will only increase if Iran is not responsive,'' the official said.
Britain also warned of tougher sanctions. ''Iran's current position falls far short of what is needed to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough,'' Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. He added, ''We look to Iran to consider carefully whether it wants to continue on its current course, and face increasing pressure and isolation from the international community.''
Officials struggled to give a realistic assessment of the talks' failure, while also offering a hint of optimism.
''There may not have been a breakthrough, but there also was not a breakdown,'' the American official said.
Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's lead negotiator, said, ''We're still on the threshold,'' according to the Interfax news service.
The futility of the talks was certain to arouse renewed alarm, particularly from Israel, which had tempered its repeated threats of a military strike against Iranian nuclear sites in deference to the diplomatic efforts.
''This failure was predictable,'' Yuval Steinitz, Israel's minister of strategic affairs, said in a statement. ''Israel has already warned that the Iranians are exploiting the talks in order to play for time while making additional progress in enriching uranium for an atomic bomb.'' He added, ''The time has come for the world to take a more assertive stand and make it unequivocally clear to the Iranians that the negotiations games have run their course.''
The conclusion of the talks without agreement on even a modest confidence-building measure or the clear prospect of future talks was striking, given that all sides seemed to have incentives to keep the conversation going, and to avoid talk of military intervention.
The United States has focused increasingly in recent weeks on an intensifying threat from North Korea, which, unlike Iran, already possesses nuclear weapons. Iran, meanwhile, is preoccupied by an internal power struggle over the presidential election.
Western countries fear that Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons, while Iran has insisted that its program is for peaceful purposes, including atomic energy and medical research, to which it claims a right as a signer of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
Iran has accused the big powers, particularly the United States, of hypocrisy for maintaining their own nuclear arsenals. But at the same time, Iran has refused to comply with United Nations Security Council demands that it suspend its uranium enrichment program, expand access for inspectors and answer questions about its intentions.
The talks here in Kazakhstan were the fifth round over the past year between Iran and the so-called P5-plus-1. The group consists of the five permanent members of the Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- plus Germany.
The negotiations have settled into a familiar routine: the big powers demand concrete steps from Iran and a firm commitment to comply with United Nations and other international mandates, only to be faced with delays or complicated counterproposals, including one on Friday that one Western diplomat said had left officials ''puzzled.''
Western officials had arrived here with guarded optimism that Iran would give a concrete response to a February proposal that would provide a modest easing of sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Iran's supply of enriched uranium. Enriched to high levels, the uranium could be used in nuclear weapons.
The proposal called for Iran to accept broad oversight for all of its nuclear activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, but the big powers dropped a demand that Iran shut its enrichment plant at Fordo, built deep below a mountain. Instead, Iran would only have to suspend enrichment there, and take other steps that would make it difficult to resume quick production of nuclear fuel.
In another apparent softening, the six powers had said Iran could keep a small amount of uranium enriched to 20 percent purity, which can be converted relatively quickly to weapons grade, for use in a reactor to produce medical isotopes.
After the first morning of discussions on Friday, the Iranians said they had offered a new ''comprehensive'' proposal aimed at building cooperation. The statement baffled the six powers, who said they had not heard anything that sounded like a new plan. The Iranian side later clarified that it had presented a ''scaled down'' version of a package first proposed in Moscow in June, which was quickly rejected.
Mr. Jalili said Saturday that Iran's plan incorporated the proposal put forward in February, and said the next move was up to the six powers. ''Good negotiations took place, and in consideration of our new proposals, it is now up to the P5-plus-1 to demonstrate its willingness and sincerity to take appropriate confidence-building steps in the future,'' he said.
Ms. Ashton and Mr. Ryabkov agreed that there had been somewhat more productive give-and-take than in previous meetings.
''The Iranians' position was quite open and quite constructive,'' Mr. Ryabkov said. Still, both diplomats said that ultimately the sides were too far apart on the substantive issues.

HEADLINE: Tensions Over North Korea Rattle the South's Economy And Its Foreign Investors

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- Threats by North Korea and displays of military resolve by South Korea and the United States have begun to unsettle foreign investors' confidence in the South, creating a secondary layer of worries for Seoul and Washington.
South Korea's main stock index began slipping Monday and closed Friday at its lowest point since November. On Thursday, General Motors said that it was making contingency plans for employee safety at its South Korean plants and that further increases in tensions would prompt it to consider moving production elsewhere. 
The Philippines and Thailand, which have thousands of citizens living in South Korea, said they were drawing up evacuation plans in case the situation worsened.
''In the past, North Korea-related events had little impact, or the markets recovered quickly,'' the South Korean vice finance minister, Choo Kyung-ho, said at a meeting of top finance officials on Friday. ''But recent threats from North Korea are stronger, and the impact may therefore not disappear quickly.''
Financial jitters could worsen if the North continues to block South Korean workers and supplies from entering a joint industrial park in the North Korean town of Kaesong. The blockade, which entered its fourth day on Saturday -- the longest that South Koreans have been shut out of the complex -- was fast drying up materials for 123 South Korean factories there, forcing four of them to stop production.
The park, where the South Korean factories employ low-cost North Korean workers, has been a major source of hard currency for the North. But until last week, it had also been the last major symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, one that South Koreans cited to calm investors.
Its survival despite years of political tensions, South Koreans said, indicated that North Korea's bellicose language was not always matched by its actions. A total closing of the complex would further damage investors' confidence and increase political pressure on the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye.
The developments come as South Korea and the United States were engaged a delicate diplomatic balancing act. On one hand, they were trying to show the North's youthful leader, Kim Jong-un, that they would not be blackmailed by his bluster, breaking with a history in which the North threatens and the allies offer negotiations or aid to calm tensions. But at the same time, the allies do not want to escalate the tensions so much that they lead to military hostilities or damage South Korea's economy.
Although many South Koreans have grown inured to decades of periodic threats from North Korea, they worry that in any prolonged confrontation their globalized economy would have more to lose than the one in the North, which is battered and isolated and hurt by international sanctions.
''The North Koreans are now using the propaganda in an extreme form to try to damage foreign direct investments into South Korea,'' said Thomas L. Coyner, a member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea and the author of ''Doing Business in Korea.'' ''They are, in a sense at this point, winning in an asymmetrical psychological warfare, attacking the economic strength of South Korea.''
John Delury, an American who teaches at Yonsei University in Seoul, said that the economic impact of the conflict posed a ''serious challenge'' to President Park, who was elected on promises to bolster the economy and build trust with the North.
''The relentless show of force on a daily basis by not just North Korea but also the U.S. and South Korea as part of their annual military exercises has captured the attention of the world, and made the Korean Peninsula a place associated not with 'Gangnam Style' but with nuclear weapons and stealth bombers,'' Mr. Delury said.
And even though many analysts and diplomats believe the North will not follow through on its most dangerous threats -- pre-emptive strikes against the United States and South Korea -- he noted that the continuing alarm could still cause problems.
''Markets hate risk, even if it is the perception rather than reality of risk,'' Mr. Delury added.
South Korea's economy has suffered far worse disruptions, most recently during a global financial meltdown in 2008, and proved resilient. But the conflict is an additional drag on the economy at an inopportune time.
The once-supercharged economy took a blow in 2011, during the global financial downturn, when the growth rate dropped to 3.6 percent from 6.2 percent in 2010. It has since slowed further, in part because of China's increasing power as an exporter and, more recently, as the weakened Japanese yen allowed Japan's exports to better compete with South Korea's. The government revised its growth forecast for this year to 2.3 percent from 3 percent.
In a report on Friday, Citi Research said that ''barring an outbreak of wide-scale military conflict, we think North Korean brinkmanship will not impact the South Korean economic fundamentals.'' Thomas J. Byrne and Steffen Dyck at Moody's Investors Service expressed similar views last week, but also warned of ''a heightened risk of military adventurism or miscalculation by the 30-something Kim Jong-un.''
Han Beom-ho, an analyst at Shinhan Investment, said that markets had traditionally tended to dismiss North Korean threats.
But this time, ''the targets of North Korean threat have expanded and the international community has become more sensitive,'' he said, referring to the North's growing nuclear and missile capabilities and American plans to deploy more interceptor missiles to the region. ''At the same time, there is doubt over the abilities of those who are supposed to deter North Korea, especially China.''
South Korean officials and analysts suspect that North Korea, no longer able to fight a conventional war or even start a major skirmish with the South without suffering a devastating counterstrike, is increasingly resorting to other forms of warfare, like hacking the computer networks of South Korean banks and broadcasters.
''Most people say they are used to a lot of blustering and posturing by North Korea and we should not take it too seriously -- but it needs to be taken seriously in the sense that it is already proving to be effective,'' said Mr. Coyner of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea. ''It's a very interesting, sophisticated economic attack on South Korea.''
