HEADLINE: AT THE MOVIES 

BYLINE:  By Dave Kehr 

 BODY:
Social Realism (In Los Angeles)
 At 65, Ken Loach continues to fight the good fight as Britain's most stubbornly dedicated social-realist filmmaker. The creator of 32 films, from classics like "Kes" (1969) to "My Name Is Joe" (1998), he remains dedicated to a politically engaged cinema set in a recognizable world, an ideal at odds with the film industries of the United States and Britain. 
 Mr. Loach's new film, "Bread and Roses," opens in New York today (review, Page 14). Based on the janitors' strike in Los Angeles 11 years ago, this is the director's first film set in the United States. 
"I've been working with the writer Paul Laverty for some time, and he spent a year in Los Angeles and got involved with the janitors," Mr. Loach said by phone from his London office. "We talked about it, and he was very enthusiastic about the story. We finally managed to get the money together three years ago." 
Why does it take a British filmmaker to tell this American story? "I guess the Hollywood people are too busy driving through these areas to look out the windows to see what's happening. Being an outsider, what strikes you is that Los Angeles is obviously two worlds living side by side and not really knowing each other."
The film is set in the Hispanic section of Los Angeles, a world he captures with his customary eye for detail. "We spent most of our time hanging out with the janitors and their friends, and just getting to know people, really," he said. "There's quite a few people in the film who knew the situation at first hand. There was always somebody there who said 'This is how we did it' or 'This is how it should be.' Filmmaking is a question of listening -- of listening rather than telling."
For him, the success of British imports like "The Full Monty" is no cause for celebration.
"For as long as I can remember, the British film industry has tailored what it does to hit the jackpot in the States," he said. "The economic logic dictates a certain pattern, which is that we behave like people who are colonized. We consciously present a picture of who we are that the tourists will like. It's kind of ironic for a people who had their own empire that we're turning ourselves into comic characters in a make-believe land to sell across the Atlantic. There's something really daft about it, and demeaning."

Those Ears! And Eyes!
In France, the season's phenomenon is a wide-eyed gamine named Amelie Poulain, who, as played by the newcomer Audrey Tautou, connives to make life better for her friends and neighbors in a working-class corner of Montmartre. She is the central character in "Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain" ("The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain"), a poetic fantasy that recalls the warmth and whimsy of Jacques Prevert, and the French have taken it to their heart. The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet ("Delicatessen"), will be known simply as "Amelie" when Miramax releases it in the United States this fall.
"Two and a half million people in two weeks -- for France, that's a lot!" Mr. Jeunet said in Cannes. "French people like it because, I think, they're happy to have a positive experience. I don't know why, but people return to see it several times. A lot of people have sent me e-mail and letters. Some say it has really changed their lives."
Mr. Jeunet's story finds Amelie, a shy survivor of an unhappy childhood, waiting on tables in a tiny cafe where she hatches ingenious plans to bring together the lonely, dispirited people she encounters in her daily life -- while she falls in love with a young artist (Mathieu Kassovitz).
"It's the Paris I discovered when I first arrived," said Mr. Jeunet, a native of Nancy. "I arrived and it was a Paris of dreams, you know?" To rediscover that Paris required much work, both during production -- "We changed the posters, we erased the graffiti, we took away the cars, so it looks like photos from the 40's" -- and in post-production, when Mr. Jeunet used digital technology to intensify colors and retouch the skyline. 
The film's most special effect, however, is Ms. Tautou, who has reminded more than one critic of her namesake, Audrey Hepburn. "I saw her the first time just on the poster of 'Venus Beauty Institute,' " Mr. Jeunet said of the film in which she made her debut. "I thought, maybe she is interesting for me. So I did some tests. She was just so good. At the beginning of the shooting, I said: 'I don't have to direct you. I'll do my job but you are perfect. I'll tell you if you change.' "
"It was the big eyes," Mr. Jeunet rhapsodized. "She's like an elf in a fairy tale, big ears and big eyes. She's special."

Ex-Con in Love
"There are two kinds of pleasures that come along," said Victor Nunez, speaking from the set of his new film, "Coastlines," on the Gulf Coast of Florida.
"Sometimes when you shoot a scene, it's exactly as you envisioned it when you wrote it six months ago or six years ago," he said. "And there's another kind of pleasure when an actor comes and does something much more, much deeper than what you expected, and you get to be there when that happens. We've had a fair number of both kinds of occurrences, so in the midst of the exhaustion we're having a good time." 
If anyone deserves the title of independent filmmaker, it is Mr. Nunez, who has never worked for anyone but himself and who directs, writes, edits and operates the camera on his films, including "Ulee's Gold" (1997) and "Ruby in Paradise" (1993).
"Coastlines," which is about halfway through its six-week shooting schedule, represents a departure for Mr. Nunez because its story -- an ex-con (Timothy Olyphant) returns to his hometown and becomes involved in a romantic triangle with his best friend (Josh Brolin) and his friend's wife (Sarah Wynter) -- is darker and more violent than is his custom. 
"If we pull it off, it will be something like a really good country ballad," he said. "I tell everybody that it's a story about human errors made through an excess of life and energy, rather than a lack of them."
"Coastlines" is based on a story Mr. Nunez wrote 16 years ago, a year after he filmed the John D. MacDonald thriller "A Flash of Green." 
"What was interesting for me is that it was conceived almost a generation ago, and then polished and put into a structure at this point in my life," he said. "It has a double perspective that one hopes will give it a deeper resonance. But when you're in the middle of something, you're almost afraid to say anything about it."
If all goes well, "Coastlines" may be ready for the Sundance Film Festival in January. "We'll know at the end of July, when we've done our first assembly," Mr. Nunez said. "We'll make it as fast as we can."

HEADLINE: Creating a Market for Vaccines 

BYLINE:  By Michael Kremer and Rachel Glennerster; Michael Kremer is professor of economics at Harvard and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Rachel Glennerster, an economist, is adjunct lecturer in public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School.

 BODY:
While pharmaceutical companies' agreement to lower the prices of some anti-AIDS drugs is good news, it promises little relief to the vast majority of Africans with AIDS, who live in countries with governments unable to buy these drugs even at the reduced prices. And even if the price were zero, weak health infrastructure and low levels of education would make widespread effective use of the anti-AIDS drugs difficult, as they require complicated regimens of dosage and control.
 The best long-run solution for AIDS and the other infectious diseases devastating poor countries is vaccines: they would be relatively easy to deliver and could be used by large numbers of people at low cost. But little money has been committed to developing such vaccines. Last month, a task force established by Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, proposed a plan that might make new vaccines a reality. 
 The need for vaccines is most urgent for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, which newly infected more than five million people last year (70 percent of them in Africa); tuberculosis, which kills 1.7 million people a year and is spreading in drug-resistant forms; and malaria, which kills one million a year -- mainly infants, toddlers and pregnant women.
Because drug companies see little chance of recouping their costs, they undertake very little research on diseases that primarily affect poor countries. Of the 1,223 drugs licensed between 1975 and 1987, only 13 were for tropical diseases. Two of these were modifications of existing medicines, two were produced for the United States military and five came from veterinary research. Only four were developed by commercial pharmaceutical firms specifically for tropical diseases in humans.
The British task force has proposed that the industrialized nations stimulate research by committing to purchase effective vaccines, when they are developed, for malaria, tuberculosis and H.I.V. If other nations take up this challenge, not only will the incentive be in place for vaccine development, but price will not be a barrier to people using the vaccines.
If a commitment to purchase new vaccines fails to induce their development, it will have cost nothing; if it succeeds, it will save millions of lives at a few dollars each. For example, if the donor countries agreed to purchase a malaria vaccine at $5 a dose, the vaccine could protect the 50 million newborns and pregnant women at highest risk from the disease for $250 million a year. Markets of this size have proved sufficient to stimulate vaccine research in the past. And the government sponsors would not have to choose between competing research proposals -- something much better left to the private sector.
The more quickly action is taken, the sooner the world will have more of the weapons it needs against disease.

HEADLINE: Europe Central Bank Declines To Support the Falling Euro 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The euro fell to a six-month low against the dollar yesterday after comments by Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, dashed expectations that the central bank would buy the currency to support it anytime soon.
 "The exchange rate of the euro is not a target for us," Mr. Duisenberg said at a news conference in Vienna. "It is only important if it would no longer support our inflation aim. That is not the case." 
 In New York, the euro settled at 84.62 cents, down from 85.70 cents on Wednesday. It touched 84.46 cents, its weakest since Nov. 27, and only about 2.2 cents above the record intraday low of 82.30, set on Oct. 26. 
Mr. Duisenberg's comments have set the stage for a move back to 82 cents a euro, said Brian Taylor, head trader at the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company in Buffalo. "Traders have the mind-set to test that" level, given the reduced likelihood of action by the European Central Bank.
Since the start of the year, the euro has shed 10 percent against the dollar amid signs of slowing growth in Europe. Reports last week showed first-quarter growth slowed more than expected in France and Germany, Europe's two largest economies.
There have been four cases of central bank intervention to bolster the euro. First came a coordinated round of buying by major central banks on Sept. 22, starting at about 87.50 cents. That was followed by solo intervention by the European Central Bank on three separate days in November, at levels between 85 and 87 cents.
Klaus Liebscher, a council member of the European Central Bank, also touched off selling when he told reporters that "circumstances are now different" from when the central bank intervened last year at similar levels. Analysts took that to mean the bank sees the recent decline as more orderly than last year's.
A falling currency can start a sell-off of bonds and stocks by foreign investors out of concern the investments will generate losses.

HEADLINE: Contributing to the Old Country 

 BODY:
Recent immigrants from Latin America play an increasingly decisive role in two economies at once -- in this nation's and in the one back home. Their impact here is likely to drive the coming debate on immigration reform, as Mexico and the United States discuss the possibility of legalizing the status of millions of undocumented workers and creating new guest-worker programs. But the economic significance of immigrants' remittances back home should be considered as well. 
 Not long ago capital flight from Latin America presented one of the region's most pressing economic problems. It remains a concern in Venezuela and Colombia, but over all, foreign direct investment and individuals' remittances sent back home have reversed the flow of capital. Last year emigrants sent an estimated $20 billion back to relatives in Latin America and the Caribbean region, typically in installments of a few hundred dollars a month. This amount, expected to total $300 billion over the next decade, vastly exceeds official development assistance, and benefits some of the poorest communities. 
 In countries like Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic, emigrants' remittances add up to more than 10 percent of the gross domestic product. In the case of Mexico, the inflow of roughly $8 billion in annual remittances ranks with tourism receipts and oil exports as a major source of revenue. 
The Bush administration recognized the economic importance of remittances earlier in the year when it allowed Salvadorans living illegally in the United States to apply for 18-month work permits so that the money they sent home could help their country recover from two devastating earthquakes. Likewise, the joint declaration issued by hemispheric leaders at the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in April also highlighted the significance of remittances as a source of development capital, and called on governments to lower their transaction costs and seek ways to channel some of this money into productive investments.
In addition to individuals sending money to their families, Salvadorans and Mexicans are increasingly coming together in American cities to send back funds for public infrastructure works, usually through a hometown association. President Vicente Fox of Mexico has started some innovative matching programs for such funds, and the Inter-American Development Bank is looking to do the same elsewhere in the region. Other experimental programs are aimed at helping migrants finance businesses they could return to, in an attempt to address the absence of economic opportunity that drives emigration in the first place. 
America's immigration policy cannot be dictated primarily by a desire to help finance development in Latin America. There are certainly more self-interested reasons for Americans to support healthy levels of immigration. But whatever the course of that debate, both legal and illegal immigrants will continue to send capital south of the Rio Grande for the foreseeable future. Maximizing its impact as a vehicle for development is a laudable goal.

HEADLINE: 120 Groups Join to Push $10 Billion Housing Plan 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Business and community leaders are calling on the mayoral candidates to confront New York City's housing shortage with a $10 billion plan to build 100,000 homes and renovate 85,700 others in the next decade.
 Housing First! is both the name and the goal of the group, which has raised $500,000 to push housing to the forefront of this year's campaigns for city offices. 
 About 100 leaders, including bankers, builders, clergymen and unionists, filled the front steps of City Hall yesterday to push the effort. The coalition has already met with the candidates privately, shuttled them around the boroughs to visit model programs and planned a public forum. The candidates have discussed the issue at public meetings and are forming their own platforms. 
The city is in one of its worst housing shortages in decades, with high prices, overcrowding and homelessness. Surging population has driven up demand, and the supply has failed to keep pace.
The plan calls for building 33,000 one- to four-unit family-owned homes; 21,000 apartments for people with special needs, like the elderly; and 46,000 rental and cooperative apartments, as well as the renovation of 85,700 apartments. It also proposes revised building and zoning codes and the cleanup of polluted sites that could be developed for housing.
Among the 120 groups endorsing the plan so far are the Real Estate Board of New York, Citibank/Citicorp Foundation, Catholic Charities of Brooklyn and Queens, the Communications Workers of America, the Regional Plan Association, Acorn, the New York Community Trust, the New York Urban League, J. P. Morgan Chase, the Coalition for the Homeless and the United Way of New York.
"This is a coalition that has never come together before in these kinds of numbers," said Naomi Bayer, the coalition's coordinating chairwoman and director of the New York office of Fannie Mae, the federally chartered home-financing corporation.
Unlike past proposals focusing on poor people, the coalition plan also covers middle-class needs. Ms. Bayer referred to the "housing problems you hear every day in the elevators and hallways."
The group has a Web site, www.housingfirst.net, where the plan may be examined. The plan would be financed by the city's capital budget, Battery Park City profits, World Trade Center taxes, federal money, sales of city property, tax liens and other sources. 
"It's a moral issue," said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts, senior pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, speaking for an interfaith delegation. He said that housing fulfills the promise of the "glorious lady in the harbor" who welcomes the homeless.
Other speakers stressed the importance to business, which needs housing that workers can afford. Bruce Ratner, a developer, said, "There is probably not a single more important issue to the economic development of the city."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended his record on the housing front, saying, "We have built a great deal of housing."
But he added, "New York City is always going to need housing, and there is always more to be done."

HEADLINE: California City Pins Hopes On a Big Natural Gas Field 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: DELANO, Calif. 

 BODY:
This small city's fate has always been tied to the land. Now Delano is pinning its hopes on what lies beneath the land.
 Notable for grapes and once the home of Cesar Chavez, the founder of the United Farm Workers union, Delano is in one of the richest agricultural areas in the United States. Yet the city has long struggled with high unemployment and deep poverty, particularly among its large Hispanic and immigrant population. 
 In recent years, city officials have relied on a prison and a fruit packing and distribution center to keep the economy afloat. But this spring the city's sights have turned back to the land, to a natural gas field that a local wildcatter speculates may be the second largest ever found in the West, after the giant Rio Vista field, also in California.
Though state officials and other experts express skepticism about the gas field, Delano officials sense opportunity in even the slim chance that the speculation will prove true. After all, natural gas is gold these days in a state that needs the fuel for plants generating electricity.
"It's brought a whole different outlook," Mayor Arthur B. Armendariz said. "Now I'm looking to become a generator of electricity."
The city owns and holds the mineral rights to some 400 acres in an area of 10 square miles that F. Lynn Blystone, president of a large Central Valley oil drilling operation, says has rich gas deposits.
Mr. Blystone estimates that the field may contain more than three trillion cubic feet of natural gas, but the amount has not been verified. And he acknowledged that he reported finding a natural gas deposit of 300 billion cubic feet in 1998 that never materialized.
In any case, the gas around Delano -- trapped in tightly packed sand that resembles concrete -- may be hard to extract. So Delano's dreams of fortune could evaporate like the vineyard dew.
"All of their optimism is based upon the drilling of one well," Don Drysdale, a spokesman for the California Department of Conservation, said. "We don't think that gives us enough information to go on."
But Mr. Blystone, who is president of the Tri-Valley Corporation, whose subsidiary, Tri-Valley Oil and Gas, is trying to raise $10 million to drill four wells to verify the find, said he was "very confident."
Tri-Valley, he said, has weathered bankruptcy protection, hostile takeover attempts and two decades of low gas prices in the last 38 years.
With all this in mind, residents with mineral rights, an elite group because the original property owners tended to keep those rights when they sold the land, are not getting their hopes up.
"If it pans out, it will be nice," Phyllis Kraft, assistant to the city manager, said. "But those of us who have mineral rights are not counting our chickens until our eggs are hatched." Ms. Kraft's family kept the mineral rights on a farm it sold decades ago.
Mayor Armendariz said word of the natural gas field set his phone ringing, as residents called to see whether they had mineral rights. Royalties typically range from 12.5 percent to 25 percent of gross production, Mr. Blystone said.
City officials said that even a little windfall could have a big impact on Delano's 38,000 residents. In recent years the city -- where 68 percent of the residents are Hispanic, 20 percent are Filipino and 5 percent are African-American -- has been losing its middle class to Bakersfield, 30 miles south. The downtown area has declined steadily. The unemployment rate is about 30 percent.
Although Delano recently landed a Sears distribution center and a citrus processing and packing plant, and plans are in the works for another prison, the ability to generate electricity would increase the city's attractiveness to industry, Mr. Armendariz said.
"This will enable us to control our own destiny," he said.
John James Thorton, who has lived in Delano since 1939, but owns no mineral rights said: "It would be a nice thing for the area. We wouldn't have to build any more prisons to find jobs."

Shares Up Slightly in Rebound From Technology Sell-Off

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stock prices rose modestly yesterday as investors, fresh from a sharp sell-off of technology stocks on Wednesday, spent the day hunting for bargains.
 "The market just oversold itself, and now it's bouncing back," said Al Mirman, a market strategist at vFinance, a financial services and brokerage company. 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 39.30 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,911.94. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index climbed 25.99 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,110.49, for its first gain in four days. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.74 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,255.82. 
Analysts described the day's trading as unremarkable and choppy. They offered few explanations for the rebound.
"Maybe the selling cooled off from yesterday," said Richard McCabe, chief market analyst for Merrill Lynch. "It's just a part of the noise that doesn't have a real reason for happening."
Technology stocks provided much of the gains yesterday, one day after the sector was punished because of weak profit forecasts from Sun Microsystems, Alcatel and RadioShack. Those three stocks edged higher yesterday, with Sun gaining 22 cents, to $16.47; Alcatel rising 28 cents, to $25.27, and RadioShack advancing 30 cents, to $27.23. 
Among the stocks leading the Nasdaq higher, Oracle rose 79 cents, to $15.30; Cisco Systems picked up 26 cents, to $19.26; Intel gained 41 cents, to $27.01; and Juniper Networks jumped $2.32, to $42.53.
Shares of Barr Laboratories surged $3.57, to $71.27, after an appeals court panel cleared the way for the company to sell a generic version of Prozac by late summer. The court upheld an earlier decision that said Eli Lilly's patent on the drug was invalid. 
Shares of Polaroid fell 69 cents, to $4.78, after its executives said the company faced stagnant growth for the next two to three years. The company attributed its weak forecast to competition from one-hour film developers and a heavy debt load.
Today, the government will report its employment statistics for May, but analysts said investors showed little reaction to a report yesterday that showed initial filings for unemployment insurance rose unexpectedly. 
Yesterday's tentative trading may signal an underlying apprehension surrounding the sustainable strength of the American economy. Investors are expecting more forecasts of weak corporate earnings in the coming weeks. And today's unemployment report is expected to show more job losses, indicating continued weakness in the sluggish economy. 
Some analysts expect further bad news will give the Federal Reserve more reason to cut interest rates for the sixth time this year when it meets later this month.
"It's really a case of bad news is good news," said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen. "The unemployment numbers continue to make it seem like the Fed is going to ease again."

Treasury Prices Rise
By Bloomberg News
Bond prices rose yesterday on expectations that the economy shed jobs for the third consecutive month in May, bolstering optimism that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates for the sixth time this year.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 30/32, to 97 7/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.37 percent from 5.50 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 17/32, to 94 23/32. Its yield fell to 5.75 percent from 5.84 percent on Wednesday.

Xerox Says Its Auditors Found No Signs of Fraud
Xerox, whose auditors had refused to sign off on its annual report until they had rechecked the numbers, said that the auditors, KPMG, found some accounting discrepancies but uncovered no signs of fraud.
 KPMG did say the company had run afoul of generally accepted accounting principles, and Xerox adjusted its consolidated financial statements for the last three years. Shares of Xerox rose 88 cents, to $9.91. Page C2. 

New York Faces Power Woes, Too
In New York, a host of critics, from former staff members of the State Public Service Commission to business lobbyists to consumer advocates, say that electricity deregulation has gone awry. But few voices are calling for a return to the old system, in which the state oversaw plant construction and told utilities what they could charge for power. A1.

Aimster Up Next in Music Battle
The Recording Industry Association of America contends Aimster, its latest legal nemesis in the fight over online music, is essentially a Napster clone. But outside legal experts say it is unclear whether the recording industry could prevail over Aimster as easily as it did over Napster, given what they say may be crucial differences between the two.

HEADLINE: Politics Thickens the Molasses in Albany's Budget Process 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 31 

 BODY:
The state budget is late again for the 17th year in a row. 
 For the last two decades, New York's budget system has not worked very well, but this year it does not seem to be working at all. The Senate Republican leader calls it dysfunctional. Today, two months after the budget deadline, Gov. George E. Pataki warned that there might be no budget at all. 
 Flaws in state law are partly to blame for New York's chronically late budgets. New York is the only state, for instance, that has a fiscal year beginning April 1, two weeks before income taxes are due and revenue forecasts become clearer. It also has one of the shortest periods for considering a budget, just two and a half months, a span that budget makers in both parties say is too short. 
But this year there are also political forces contributing to the impasse. The debate is taking place as the national economy skids downward a little more than a year before the election of a governor. Mr. Pataki, a Republican expected to run again next year, has argued that the state should save as much money as possible to hedge against an economic downturn. 
"We are better off, clearly, having a budget, but having said that, no budget is better than a budget that is billions of dollars beyond what the state can afford and sustain," the governor said at a news conference.
Mr. Pataki said both the Senate and the Assembly proposals, which would add to his $83.6 billion spending plan, were unrealistic given the weakened state of the national economy. He raised the specter of 1990, when the Cuomo administration overestimated revenues during a recession and ended up cutting school aid and laying off workers.
The governor's threat today to operate the government indefinitely on emergency spending measures underscored how far apart Democrats and Republicans remain over this year's budget. Impasses are nothing new. In 1997 and 1999, negotiations went on until early August, long past the April 1 deadline. In recent history, no other state has come close to New York's record. Still, many lawmakers believe this year could be the worst.
"The budget system in New York State doesn't work," said the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican. "It's dysfunctional. It's broken."
The Democrats who control the Assembly contend that the governor is using the downturn as an excuse to stash away money in reserves that he can spend in an election year. Even with the slowing economy, the Democrats predict that revenues will grow enough -- by about $2 billion -- to forestall cuts to nursing homes and to pay for a $1.7 billion increase for school programs, like statewide preschool.
"The issues facing us are, do you close the schoolhouse door to 4-year-olds because the governor is running for re-election next year and wants to build up a surplus of funds that he can spend in an election year?" the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said. "Do we deny health care coverage to senior citizens in nursing homes because the governor is running for re-election next year and wants to be able to cut ribbons and dole out dollars around the state? There are no other issues in this budget."
The governor has countered that the Democrats are proposing irresponsible spending increases while the sluggish national economy is forcing states like California and Michigan to tighten their budgets. Already, he said, there are signs of lower tax revenues for April and May. 
"There is certainly at the best a great deal of uncertainty about the economy," Mr. Pataki said. "To go on a spending binge would be the height of irresponsibility, and I'm not going to let that happen."
In January, the governor opened the bidding with a proposed $83.6 billion budget, a 5.3 percent increase over last year's, though the part of the budget that is financed with state taxes would grow only 3.2 percent. In recent years, the governor's proposal has set the floor for debate, and the negotiations have focused on how much the Legislature will add to it. But this year, Mr. Pataki has said the economy is so soft that he cannot support any increases.
The Assembly has proposed spending $2.3 billion more than the governor, with about half of that increase going to schools. The Republicans who control the Senate have proposed about $1.2 billion more in spending, placing an emphasis on school aid and tax cuts to spur biotechnology research and other businesses.
Much is at stake for the governor in next year's election, political analysts say. If the economy slips into recession, as some economists fear, voters may well blame him for it. That perception will worsen if he is forced to make painful cutbacks just six months before voters troop to the polls.
The Democrats have accused the governor of failing to fulfill his traditional role in negotiating the budget with legislative leaders. They have criticized him for traveling the state and the country to preside over ribbon-cuttings and political events instead of staying in Albany and working out a budget agreement with the Assembly and the Senate.
"The governor is just absent and not providing the leadership," said the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor. "Traditionally that's been the governor's role in New York, and this governor hasn't wanted to play that role."
Mr. McCall and other Democrats suggest that a delay benefits the governor. The longer it takes to pass a new budget, the longer the state continues to spend at last year's levels and the more money there will be available in next year's surplus.
Mr. Pataki dismissed as ridiculous the idea that he should be doing more to broker a budget agreement. He said that he has fulfilled his constitutional obligation to submit a budget to the Legislature and that it is now up to the two houses to make changes to those budget bills and pass them. 
As a practical matter, however, New York governors have always played an active role in brokering an agreement with lawmakers on how much the Legislature can add to the budget. Before 1998, those agreements were made in private horse-trading sessions with legislative leaders, a process that was derisively called "three men in a room."
In 1998, the governor and the Legislature tried to establish a more open procedure. The Assembly and the Senate passed their own versions of the budget, then worked out differences in a general conference committee. The governor had little involvement.
But the idea backfired on Democrats. Mr. Pataki vetoed more than 1,000 appropriations, the majority of them Democratic projects. Since then, Mr. Silver has insisted on reaching a three-way agreement with the Senate majority leader and the governor on the size of the budget before the conference committee meets to work out details. In essence, he has demanded assurances in advance that the governor will not resort to widespread vetoes if spending remains under a certain level. He got those assurances in 1999 and 2000. 
But this year, Mr. Pataki has refused to negotiate with Mr. Silver, much as he declined to do so for several months in 1999. He has insisted that the Legislature work out a budget in public committee meetings without his help and has refused to put restraints on his right to veto spending he disagrees with.
"I do not intend to go back to three people behind closed doors negotiating a budget," he said. 
Never in recent memory has the state failed to pass a budget. Over the years, however, the governor and the Legislature have perfected temporary spending bills that keep the government humming along at the previous year's levels. Indeed, delays in enacting a budget have few noticeable consequences until August, when school districts must send out their tax bills. Mr. Pataki said the government could be kept running with stopgap bills, though schools would have a harder time predicting aid.
Because the temporary spending bills shield the public from a government shutdown, politicians have discovered that they stand to lose less by passing late budgets than they can gain by holding out for programs important to their constituents, political scientists and lawmakers say. 
"No member of the government, either the legislators or the governor, seems to think they will suffer at the polls because of the late budget," Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Manhattan Democrat, said. "If there is no price to pay, there is no pressure to get it done on time."

PERSON: Jaime Benitez Rexach 

HEADLINE: Jaime Benitez, 92, Educator And Puerto Rican Politician 

BYLINE:  By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Jaime Benitez Rexach, a former chancellor and president of the University of Puerto Rico who from 1972 to 1976 was the island's nonvoting representative in Congress, died on Wednesday in a hospital in San Juan. He was 92.
 Under Mr. Benitez, who became chancellor in 1942, the University of Puerto Rico increased significantly in size and quality, becoming one of the finest institutions of higher education in the Spanish-speaking world. 
 An overhaul of the university's statutes in the year Mr. Benitez took over laid the basis for the changes by sharply reducing political interference in university affairs.
The student body grew from about 5,000 to more than 40,000 by the time Mr. Benitez stepped down. The schools of medicine, dentistry and architecture were added and regional campuses established.
As chancellor, Mr. Benitez also attracted many distinguished scholars and artists who had left Spain in its civil war, including the philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset and the Nobel Prize-winning poet Juan Ramon Jimenez. 
A close associate of the political leader Luis Munoz Marin, who became Puerto Rico's first elected governor in 1949 and helped achieve commonwealth status for it in 1952, Mr. Benitez drafted the Bill of Human Rights included in the new Constitution, which recognized citizens' social and economic rights as well as their human rights.
The two men fell out in 1957, however, when Mr. Munoz declared his "loss of confidence" in Mr. Benitez and accused him of using his university position to build a rival political movement to his own Popular Democratic Party, or P.P.D. They were publicly reconciled before the 1960 elections.
In 1966, the university statutes were changed again to permit greater political activity on the campus and Mr. Benitez was effectively kicked upstairs to the new and less powerful post of university president, which he gave up in 1971.
The next year he was elected on the P.P.D. ticket to a four-year term as Puerto Rico's resident commissioner in Washington, effectively representing it in the House of Representatives, where he sat as a Democrat though without a vote. His 1976 re-election bid was unsuccessful.
Born on the island of Vieques on Oct. 29, 1908, Mr. Benitez studied law at Georgetown University and political science at the University of Chicago. He joined the University of Puerto Rico faculty as an associate professor of social and political science in 1931.
He is survived by his wife, the former Lulu Martinez; two daughters, Clotilde and Margarita, of Washington, and a son, Jaime, of Albany.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Power: Worth the Risk? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Hard Questions on Nuclear Power" (editorial, May 29) concludes that the case has not yet been made for large-scale expansion of this power source, citing the "risks" associated with it. But there are risks associated with every human endeavor and with every fuel source for generating electricity: coal mines collapse, valleys flood, oil spills and gas pipelines rupture. 
Fifty years of safe power production from commercial plants proves that nuclear energy is no riskier than the alternatives. And waste disposal is primarily a political, not a scientific, issue. 
 Nuclear power can help diversify our energy sources and reduce our dependence on imported oil and increasingly expensive natural gas.

HEADLINE: Pressure in Jakarta Builds So Far in Orderly Fashion 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, May 31 

 BODY:
Indonesia is on course to oust its third leader in three years. But unlike previous political upheavals, which were chaotic and violent, this one is unfolding with remarkable order.
 Parliament said today that it would convene a special session of the People's Consultative Assembly on Aug. 1 to consider removing President Abdurrahman Wahid from office. The decision was made a day after the legislators had overwhelmingly voted to begin impeachment proceedings against the president. 
 The timing scrupulously follows the Constitution, which stipulates that Parliament allow 60 days to prepare for a meeting of the assembly, the highest legislative body.
About 1,000 supporters of Mr. Wahid rallied in front of his palace today, demanding that he impose martial law and dissolve Parliament. But that option looked less and less tenable as the security minister and top military generals publicly opposed a state of emergency.
"Issuing a decree in a situation like this is not appropriate, and we hope this decision will not be taken," Security Minister Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said after meeting military officers.
As the likelihood of a drastic response by Mr. Wahid waned, his supporters began dispersing, boarding trains for the president's home province, East Java. The anger has also largely petered out in East Java, where police officers and soldiers have clashed with Mr. Wahid's loyalists for three days.
"The legislators were very concerned about provoking violence, so they must be feeling quite relieved," said Harold Crouch, an Indonesia expert at the Australian National University who lives here. "But the final stage will be the most difficult, if they decide to sack him."
Mr. Crouch noted that the lengthy impeachment process had been devised by Indonesia's longtime ruler, Suharto, as a way of fending off challenges to his rule. Although some lawmakers are eager to accelerate the process, nobody is advocating that Indonesia follow the recent example of the Philippines.
There, the Senate convened an impeachment trial against the former president, Joseph Estrada, only to suspend it after the prosecutors suffered a setback. Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets, and Mr. Estrada was forced from office in what experts describe as a soft coup. 
But in Indonesia, "neither side seems willing to short-circuit the process, which is good," James W. Castle, an American consultant, said. "One would hope that the dismal economy will pressure them to find a reasonable solution."
Few people see much chance for compromise between the president and the implacably hostile Parliament. Mr. Wahid, who once referred to the legislators as a crowd of kindergartners, ostensibly believes that they have overreached their authority. He has not even responded to Parliament's vote, brushing aside questions about it at a summit meeting of developing nations.
Still, Mr. Wahid is allowing the process to grind on, which gives people here hope that Indonesia will manage this transition more peacefully than it did the fall of Mr. Suharto, which occurred after a popular uprising and bloody riots. Mr. Suharto's successor, B. J. Habibie, quit the presidential race in 1999 after he oversaw the convulsive withdrawal from East Timor.
"If the people's assembly handles this with dignity, it will be a good precedent for succession in Indonesia," said Juwono Sudarsono, who was a cabinet minister under all three presidents.
Mr. Sudarsono noted that the military was walking a particularly careful line in the dispute. The army, which holds 38 seats in Parliament, abstained from the vote on Wednesday, but did not try to stop it.
The stately pace of the impeachment process has robbed the scene of much of its drama, which may not be bad in view of the unrest that bubbles just under the surface. Aside from Mr. Wahid's loyalists, few ordinary people are angry, or even particularly interested, in his plight.
If he is removed, he will be replaced by Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri, a taciturn former homemaker best known for being the daughter of Indonesia's founding leader, Sukarno. Because Mrs. Megawati says so little, most people profess not to know how she would differ from Mr. Wahid.
"At first, we worried every time we heard he was in trouble," Lim Ka Giok, an ethnic Chinese merchant, said. "But it's gone on so long that we're just tired of it. We say, 'Go ahead and fight among yourselves.' "

HEADLINE: El Paso's Share of California Gas Market Is Questioned 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31 

 BODY:
The El Paso Corporation's share of the Southern California natural gas market may be smaller than an energy agency study showed because the survey did not include in-state production, storage or competing pipelines, the study's author said today during a hearing at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
 Curtis L. Wagner Jr., the chief administrative law judge at the commission, is hearing testimony on whether El Paso artificially inflated natural gas prices in California, adding perhaps as much as $3.7 billion to the cost of the state's energy crisis. 
 El Paso had a 45 percent share of Southern California's market, the study said. The share would be less if the other supplies were included, said Jonathan Ogur, an economist at the commission. 
El Paso's pipeline unit, El Paso Natural Gas, is accused of selling about one billion cubic feet of pipeline capacity into California to its merchant energy subsidiary, which then withheld gas shipments to drive up prices. That contract ends at midnight tonight, and 30 suppliers will share the capacity on Friday.
"If gas production and storage were available, then they would reduce El Paso's share of the market," Mr. Ogur said during cross-examination.
El Paso, based in Houston, argues that in-state storage of 800 million cubic feet a day and production totaling 1.03 billion cubic feet a day provided competing options for the state's largest utilities to buy gas.
Storage and production were excluded from analysis of El Paso's share of the market because those supplies are typically sold under long-term contracts and are not available to gas buyers looking for lower prices, Mr. Ogur said.
The study considers Southern California as a separate market from the rest of the state when pipelines are full because gas does not move well within California and prices typically rise higher in the south, Mr. Ogur said. If the state were looked at as one market, El Paso's share of pipeline capacity would be 27 percent, he said.
El Paso estimates that it held 17 percent of the capacity to California under the contract, said Norma Dunn, a spokeswoman. California operates as a single market so that supplies from Canada compete with supplies from Texas and New Mexico, she said.
The California Public Utility Commission, Pacific Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison accused El Paso of manipulating the market after the average price of gas in California surged above levels in other markets.
Judge Wagner extended the hearings through next Friday and would give lawyers until July 9 to write and respond to evidence gathered during the last three weeks. The deadline for final briefs was extended to July 24 from June 6, and a final recommendation to the commission will be made "within weeks" after that, the judge said after today's session.

HEADLINE: Late Credit Card Payments Rose in April 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The number of Americans late in making their credit card payments jumped sharply in April from a year earlier, and card issuers wrote off substantially more bad loans, the debt rating company Moody's Investors Service said yesterday.
 Both the bad loan write-off rate and the late-payment rate rose more than 13 percent from their levels a year earlier, Moody's said. 
Neither rate had risen that sharply since the last negative credit cycle in 1995 to 1997, Moody's said. 
 "The recent rise in the unemployment rate and rising debt service burden on U.S. borrowers are among the factors leading to more delinquencies in credit card monthly payments," Christophe Germain, a Moody's analyst, said in a statement. 
Moody's said two other key measures of consumer credit quality, the yield and the repayment rate, were relatively stable. 
In part, Moody's attributed an increase in bankruptcy filings in the first three months of the year to the rise in the charge-off rate in April. For most credit card issuers, bankruptcy filings are written off as uncollectable within 60 days to comply with regulatory guidelines.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Claims in U.S. Are Reported at 7 1/2-Year High 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31 

 BODY:
More Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits last week, and continuing claims reached their highest in seven and a half years, the government said today, while another report said the risks of a recession had risen.
 In one of several gloomy reports, the Labor Department said first-time unemployment claims had risen for the third consecutive week, to 419,000 in the week ended May 26, up from 411,000 in the previous week and the highest level in a month. 
 About 2.85 million people continued to collect unemployment benefits last week, the largest number since November 1993 and an increase from 2.76 million in the previous week. Analysts said the report -- which came a day ahead of May payroll data -- was a sign that the labor market was deteriorating, a potentially dangerous development for the economy. 
The National Association of Purchasing Management in Chicago reported that its index of regional manufacturing fell in May, to a seasonally adjusted 38.7 from 38.9 in the previous month. An index below 50 signals a contracting manufacturing sector, while a reading above 50 suggests expansion.
In yet another grim report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said that although it remained unlikely that the economy had slid into a recession, chances of such a contraction rose last month.
The national activity index slid to minus 1.09 in April from minus 0.87 in March. The figure was the weakest since the economy began slowing in July and represented the 10th consecutive month the index remained below zero, an indication of below-trend growth. The three-month moving average index, which irons out month-to-month fluctuations, also fell, reaching minus 0.96 in April, down slightly from minus 0.94 in the previous month. The three-month index has dropped below minus 0.70 during only six periods since 1967, the start of the Chicago Fed's data, and only one of those times did the economy skirt recession, commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction.
While the Chicago Fed said the April reading continued to be above levels hit during the five recessions the United States suffered in the last four decades, it said the three-month average indicated a growing recession risk.
The reports were released a day before the government is set to issue its snapshot of the employment situation for May. Analysts are looking for the report to provide important clues about the labor market. It is also expected to be a crucial factor at the Fed's next meeting at the end of June.
Economists estimate payroll employment fell 17,000 in May. Analysts also forecast that the unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent in May, up from 4.5 percent in April.
But economists said the labor picture was not all bad. According to the claims report, the four-week moving average of initial claims actually fell for a second consecutive week, to 402,500 from 404,000.

HEADLINE: The Zero-Sum Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By David Brooks; David Brooks, a senior editor at The Weekly Standard, is the author of "Bobos in Paradise."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As I'm sure you do all the time, I recently spent an evening browsing through some old essays from the tax-cut debates of the 1980's. What was striking about those debates, especially compared to the arguments that now surround the Bush tax cuts, was how epic they were. The supply-siders considered themselves Reagan revolutionaries. They wrote tracts with grand names like "Wealth and Poverty" and "The Way the World Works." They believed they were leading a moral and cultural reformation, not just boosting the gross domestic product.
 Their central argument was that taxes must be cut in ways that encouraged risk-taking. "The primary and essential character of wealth is metaphysical, not physical," wrote Warren T. Brookes, a Washington Times columnist, "and is the direct result of the creativity of mind, not the availability of raw materials." 
 Marginal rate cuts were designed to unleash the creative juices in America's most daring individuals. The hero and moral exemplar in the supply-side world view was not the passive consumer, but the entrepreneur, who drives the economy and the country. 
The grandiose rhetoric drove the critics of supply-side economics crazy. But the themes, translated into Reagan speeches, hammered home the point that tax cuts were intended to revive the national spirit. They overwhelmed Democratic arguments that the top income quintile was benefiting the most. At their best, the supply-siders also reinforced a core value of the Republican Party. The early Republican leaders believed in the sanctity of work and ambition. "I hold the value of life is to improve one's condition," Lincoln declared. Through policies ranging from the Homestead Act to support for the transcontinental railroad, the Republicans encouraged and lionized industry and productivity. Following the model of Alexander Hamilton, they believed that one of government's primary tasks was to incite vigor in the populace. 
Under the Bush administration, the tone has dramatically changed. President Bush lionizes the nurturer, not the producer. He celebrates the teacher, the faith-based volunteer. The nation's greatness, Mr. Bush has declared, will be preserved through "small, unnumbered acts of caring and courage and self-denial," with the emphasis on small. These are not the values of the daring entrepreneur, but of the middle-class parent. 
In a country plagued by divorce, this family-oriented compassionate conservatism has a lot going for it. But it doesn't offer much in the way of guiding principles for reforming a major national institution like the tax code. Mr. Bush's main argument for the cut was that the surplus is "the people's money," not the government's money. Unlike the supply-side argument, this is a straight zero-sum proposition. There's a pot of money and we should have it, not the folks in Washington. No wonder the polls show only moderate support for a tax cut. "I want that money" is not exactly an inspiring rallying cry or a coherent organizing principle for tax reform. 
Substantively, the original Bush plan was ambitious, but it was chewed up in Congress by Republicans and Democrats alike. The bill that has emerged is a hodgepodge of slow-motion phase-ins and phase-outs, exemptions, deductions, and entitlements. Most of the cuts don't take effect for several years, and the whole bill becomes void in 2010. Meanwhile there are so many little goodies that reporters are still combing through and finding them. As a few economists have noted, rarely has such a big tax cut had so little social effect. Meanwhile, a once-in-a-decade chance at serious tax reform has been blown.
The grubbiest part of the tax cut was foisted on Mr. Bush by the Democrats -- the checks that will go out to taxpayers later in the year, at $300 for singles and $600 for married couples. This bit of pump-priming is exactly the sort of thing Reagan Republicans always fought. Instead of rearranging incentives to encourage innovation and production, it encourages more shopping. It treats wealth as a purely material thing: We've got some money. We're going to give it to you. We hope you'll vote for us. 
You may have loved supply-siders, or you may have thought they were ideologues and buffoons, but at least they had a theory of how to use fiscal policy for the common good. Every proposal was designed to produce entrepreneurial vigor and creativity. Now what we may be getting in divided Washington is not ideological gridlock but a mishmash of small-scale ideas and freely distributed goodies. In this way the surplus, and the remarkable opportunity it represents, are frittered away.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's Idea of Leadership 

 BODY:
President Bush has now occupied the White House for a little over four months. There is much to be said for the discipline and steadiness he has brought to the job. But at this point it is also fair to raise questions about Mr. Bush's vision of the office, his ideas about the exercise of executive power and his definition of the scope of presidential leadership and responsibility. The actions and inactions of these first months contain some troubling signs. He sometimes projects an air of detachment bordering on indifference even on issues of major concern. 
 His California trip this week provides a case study. On Monday he met with Gov. Gray Davis on the state's energy crisis, and on Wednesday did a photo op in Sequoia National Park. Twice he offered comforting words and minimalist policies out of keeping with his inaugural promise to be the president of Americans in every state, whether or not they voted for him. Californians have reason to wonder if they are being punished. Environmentalists, for their part, could be forgiven for feeling that the president thinks they do not know the difference between style and substance. 
 California has 34 million people. As a stand-alone country, it would be the world's sixth-largest economy. It preferred Al Gore by 12 percentage points in the last election, and its shrunken Republican Congressional delegation will be under severe pressures in 2002. What nearly every Californian wants is protection from the industrial shutdowns and air-conditioning failures that face them this summer. Any reasonable definition of presidential leadership would include concern for the health, safety and economic vitality of the nation's largest state. Mr. Bush was content to list the inadequate steps his administration has already taken, while flatly rejecting Governor Davis's pleas for short-term price relief. He was rather testy about it, too.
He was no more forthcoming on environmental questions when he appeared in Sequoia National Park two days later. The environment is an issue on which Mr. Bush has already discomfited a constituency that is even larger than California's ratepayers. These are the millions of Republican-voting suburbanites who worry that Mr. Bush's drill-and-burn energy strategy poses an unacceptable threat to clean air and wilderness areas. The White House is worried about losing them. Yet the best Mr. Bush could offer voters who were nervous about his plans to build hundreds of new power plants and open up sensitive public lands for oil and gas exploration was to repeat his campaign pledge to spend $4.9 billion on repairing roads and buildings in the national parks.
Even this commendable promise cannot stand close analysis. Since the days of Ulysses S. Grant, protection of the national parks has been a solemn presidential duty. But guarding what is already saved does not constitute a national environmental policy. And in this case, the economic aid is exaggerated. As the National Parks Conservation Association pointed out, there is only $61 million in new money in the maintenance program for this year. 
Infrastructure repair to the parks and cutting energy use in federal buildings are both reasonable steps that a president would routinely take. But they do not add up to visionary presidential leadership or serious intellectual engagement with the problems of citizens looking for a balanced approach to energy and the environment, or Californians facing a summer of crisis.

HEADLINE: From Germany's East to West, Conservative Tries to Span Gulf 

BYLINE:  By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: TEMPLIN, Germany 

 BODY:
In this quaint eastern town surrounded by lakes begins the story of the divided life of Angela Merkel, the politician who next year could become the first woman to lead modern Germany.
 It is a story with its share of German zigzags, one that has taken a member of the former East German Communist youth movement to the leadership of that bastion of conservatism, the Christian Democratic Party. "Nobody else from the east has ever made it this far," Volker Ruhe, a leading Christian Democrat, said simply. 
 In recent months, Ms. Merkel has toured America, chatting with Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. She has seen her party, hit by a financial scandal last year, consolidate its position in regional polls. And she has made clear that immigration will be a central plank of her campaign to be chancellor. 
"East Germans were used to a strong state," Ms. Merkel, 46, said. "And now they see this weak state apparently unable to punish abuses -- the Vietnamese spreading drugs, the Albanians stealing cars, the high crime rate among illegal immigrants, and the police doing nothing about it. This is how easterners think."
It is hard to escape the impression that this is also -- in some measure -- how Angela Merkel thinks. As elsewhere in Europe, immigration is an explosive issue here. Germany's lingering doubts about its identity after Nazism, then division, tend to complicate questions of who is German and who is not.
In theory, Ms. Merkel should be well placed to ease tensions. She understands the enduring cultural gulf between the east and west of the country. She is aware that a united Germany is still a work in progress. "We need a common understanding of what being in Germany means," she says.
But the fact is Ms. Merkel, like 17 million other former East Germans, was raised in a country almost devoid of foreigners, except for a large Soviet occupation force and a few thousand Vietnamese, who lived largely sequestered from Germans.
Now, the idea of a united Germany as a multicultural society of almost 80 million people with more than 7 million foreign-born inhabitants appears to trouble her. No other nation in Europe has as many foreigners.
"About 75 percent of the Turks in the world who live outside Turkey are in Germany," Ms. Merkel said. "We don't say that they should not be Muslims. But we do say that we are a country with a Christian background, and Turks must understand this."
Muslims are now the largest religious minority here, a status the Jews had in prewar Germany. Ms. Merkel said the situations were not comparable. "The Jews were Germans," she argued. "They spoke the German language. But this is often not the case with Turks."
She speaks calmly, with measured conviction. She is beguiling. She has a wide smile and a tendency to blush that led Helmut Kohl, the former chancellor, to call her "das Madchen" ("the girl"). But there is also a steeliness to her that belies the smile and a cool awareness of her unique position at the still troubled meeting point of two societies. 
In the last decade, former East Germans have tended to see heroes demolished rather than stars rising: they have learned that their gold medal-winning athletes were doped, their leaders liars, their friends spies. 
So the success of Ms. Merkel in a western party long dominated by men is seen by many easterners as a vindication of sorts. They respond to her plain-spoken manner, her unadorned style, her pleas for a new German patriotism.
Ms. Merkel, who was recently married, has also been through what an old friend from the east, Michael Schindhelm, now a theater director in Basel, Switzerland, called "this strange loss of roots, of identity, of context -- this experience of a cut that forces you to define yourself anew." It is an experience that almost all Germans from the east share.
But as she prepares for a likely battle next year with the Social Democratic chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, for the leadership of Europe's most powerful nation, the definition of the new Ms. Merkel still appears to be a work in progress.
Can she convince western skeptics that she is capable of running "Germany Inc."? Is she a woman of convictions or just an adaptable woman? Is she a new sort of German nationalist, one raised without the burden of shame carried by many western Germans? 
"It must be normal to sing the national anthem, to feel pride, to have a flag," Ms. Merkel said vehemently. "It must be normal at last." Yet there is little or nothing that fits the description "normal" in this woman's life.

Christian Family Goes East
Angela Merkel was a few months old when she was whisked from her birthplace, the elegant western city of Hamburg, to the backwater of Communist Templin, where her father, Horst Kasner, had accepted a job as a Lutheran pastor.
"It's straightforward why we came: we were needed here," said Herlind Kasner, Ms. Merkel's mother, a woman of startling blue eyes and directness. "We came as Christians helping other Christians. Some go to Africa. So why could we not go to the other part of our own country?"
But it was not easy as a religious family in the officially atheist east. Mrs. Kasner, a trained English teacher, was barred from working; her husband was kept on the margins of society; the three children absorbed official doctrine at school.
Still, little Angela thrived. She was a star student, entering nationwide competitions in Russian and math. "She was outstanding," said Hans-Ulrich Beeskow, a former teacher. "A friendly, open girl."
It was this friendliness, this desire for social contact that, as Ms. Merkel explains it, led her into the Pioneer Communist youth movement. She was communicative; she did not want to be an outsider.
"This was not a political decision," she said. "It was a decision to be among all the other people." She smiled, as if to say it was all as plain and simple as her trademark bangs.
But her decision -- a first taste of the compromise she has needed often since 1989 -- was not simple to accept for her devoutly Christian parents, who saw their daughter blend in beneath the atheistic banners of Communism. "Our approach is hard to explain in the west," Mrs. Kasner suggested. "But quite simply the children had a nice time together in these groups." 
Ulrich Schoneich, now the mayor of Templin, also grew up the child of a pastor in East Germany. His parents, resolutely opposed to the Communist state, stopped him from joining any of the youth movements -- and he suffered for it. "I think my father was right," said Mr. Schoneich. "But each family must decide for itself."
Ms. Merkel's view of East German society today is marked by the ambivalence of somebody who adjusted to survive. Yes, it was oppressive, she says. But there were family, friends, nature. "The system was evil," she said. "But not everything was evil. Even in a system like that, Christmas Eve can be nice."
Capitalism can also look less than nice. Unemployment in Templin, as in many towns in the east, is now 24 percent. The old furniture and textile industries have collapsed. Employment in the agricultural sector has plummeted.
"The world is not black and white," Mrs. Kasner said. "I went to America in 1986 with my association of churches and saw blacks with crutches lying on the church steps. Then I came back here and saw doctors living in the same apartments as workers. As a Christian, you may start to ask which system is better. It is not easy."
Still, the Kasner family opposed the Communist government. In 1989, as protests grew, their church was a center for peace prayers and discussion. Throughout the decades they lived there, Pastor Kasner would defiantly ring the church bell next to his house to usher in the New Year.

Adjusting Rapidly in East
What Lothar de Maiziere, the last leader of East Germany before unification, first noticed in Angela Merkel was her succinctness. Her press summaries, he recalled, "said twice as much in 20 minutes as my other spokesperson said in 40."
She had emerged from a job as a researcher at the East German Academy of Sciences in 1989, joining a short-lived movement called Democratic Awakening, and later the Christian Democrats under Mr. de Maiziere. He made her responsible for the media.
It was a heady time. "We had seen heaven on TV in the Deutsche mark," said Mr. de Maiziere, who is now a lawyer. "We thought we could have that and justice. But all we got is the rule of law."
Unlike many East Germans, Ms. Merkel adjusted rapidly. She was diligent, pragmatic, quick -- and she soon caught Mr. Kohl's eye. Asked why, she replied with crisp precision:
"I was from the east, a woman and young. As such, I represented three minorities within the party. That was hard to resist. And so I became a protege of Kohl as he sought to establish the party in the east."
She moved rapidly through a couple of minor ministerial jobs under Mr. Kohl. Then, when Mr. Kohl was dislodged by Mr. Schroder in 1998 and a year later became embroiled in a party financial scandal, she had the courage to confront her mentor directly.
It was that stand that ultimately projected her to the leadership of the party. "I came out and criticized Kohl because I really thought the Christian Democratic Party was in danger," she said. "That is no longer the case. Christian Democracy is stable."
It is true that German Christian Democracy, unlike Italian Christian Democracy, has survived the end of the cold war, the discovery of corruption, the decline of the church, and the erosion of traditional conservative values in Europe. It has adopted new agendas -- including what British politicians call "the race card".
Ms. Merkel, who took over the chairmanship of the Christian Democrats last year, is widely credited with this revival, which has placed her party in opinion polls within range of the Social Democrats at about 35 percent of the vote, compared with the governing party's 40 percent. Her fresh image helped stabilize a crisis-ridden party.
But, naturally, she is also resented by the many party honchos, all of them men, who had been jostling beneath Mr. Kohl for more than a decade only to find themselves overtaken by an upstart woman from the east. Being young, female and eastern is no longer the triple trump card it once was.
Mr. Ruhe, a former defense minister under Mr. Kohl who is now close to Ms. Merkel, said it was natural that doubts persisted. "The potential sympathy for her in the country is enormous," he said. "But she has never been a state premier. The question is: Do Germans believe she can do the job of chancellor?"
In the east at least -- and the electorate there swung the last national poll to Mr. Schroder -- people do seem to believe in her. Mr. de Maiziere said the main reason was that she understood the frustrations of the area.
"We have enough trouble defining ourselves," he said. "Where am I in this new country? Where do I belong? And then a foreigner comes along and tells me how to live or makes money in front of my face. Frankfurt has a population that is almost 30 percent foreign. But an eastern town like Leipzig would explode in those conditions."
Even in Frankfurt, there are tensions. Under a banner saying "Control Immigration, Promote Integration," Ms. Merkel appears at a rally to promote her party's new policies. A little overweight, her nails bitten down, her face moon-like beneath the bangs, she is clearly a far cry from the modern political products of image merchants and spin doctors. But it is this I-am-who-I-am stubborn streak that appeals to many Germans.
She knows what she wants. When Wolfgang Bosbach, the deputy chairman of the Christian Democrats' parliamentary group, rises to declare that "we want a clear rejection of a multicultural society," she applauds enthusiastically.
Later the debate is opened to the crowd, and a blond woman who appears almost hysterical with a mixture of nervousness and anger rises. "I do not want Islam," she says. "There are lots of them around me. Wherever I go, women are in headscarves. I do not want Islamic immigrants on the job market and our social insurance rolls."
Ms. Merkel nods, her lips pursed. Unlike the case in the United States, in most European countries foreigners arriving are immediately entitled to a range of social benefits, including free medicine and schooling for their children.
This stokes resentment, and debates rage as to whether European countries are a "safe haven" or merely a "soft touch" for asylum-seekers.
A number of statistics have been marshaled by Ms. Merkel as she takes her immigration roadshow around Germany. In the 1970's, there were four million foreigners, and two million of them had jobs. Now there are seven million, but the number in jobs has stagnated. "Immigration is not going into our labor market but into our social security system," she says. "That is the problem."

Staying a Western Nation
Her party's answer is to try to curtail the foreign presence by, for instance, speeding up deportation procedures for illegals and tightening regulations for family members to join immigrants already in Germany. At the same time, the party wants to lure highly qualified foreigners to the country. "For real specialists," Ms. Merkel said, "We want to offer much better opportunities."
"We must be part of the war for talent in the world," Mr. Ruhe said. That foreign talent, however, should not undermine the Western, Christian identity of Germany.
Ms. Merkel is irritated by American calls to bring Turkey swiftly into the European Union. Membership confers the right to work freely within the Union. Millions more Turks could pour into Germany. "Imagine," she says, "taking away the border between Mexico and the United States. It is just not possible in the forseeable future."
She continues: "Inviting Turkey to become a candidate for European Union membership was a mistake. There are differences of values. We do not have the same understanding of human rights. Try opening a Christian church in Istanbul."
Her old friend from the east, Mr. Schindhelm, is dismayed by the views she now articulates on immigration and German national identity. He had thought of her as a liberal. When he left the East German Academy in 1986, she gave him a copy of Gogol's "Dead Souls" inscribed with the words, "Go into the open."
Now he works in Basel, an open city whose population is 40 percent foreign. "I think she knows in her heart that we need openness," Mr. Schindhelm said. "So either she does not have the strength to push that idea, or she has adapted herself to the prevailing forces." He paused before adding, "And yet, I trust her."

PERSON: Bobby Flay 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
A Duel of Wits and Crustaceans, Round 2

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIFNER 

 BODY:
THEY duel with lobsters.
 That's all we're going to tell you about the big "Iron Chef" grudge rematch between Bobby Flay and Masaharu Morimoto on the Food Network Sunday night. The secret ingredient is 60 Japanese lobsters, Ise-ebi, reputedly worth $10,000. We're not going to tell you who wins. More important, we're not going to tell you if Mr. Flay stands on his cutting board again. 
 "You really get into this -- it's like a battle to the death," Mr. Flay, who brings the bravado to cooking he once brought to schoolboy basketball, baseball and track, was saying the other evening as his popular Mesa Grill began filling up. "It's exhilarating." 
If memory serves, his last encounter with Mr. Morimoto ended bitterly. To reprise: "Iron Chef" is a Japanese program -- Julia Child meets the World Wrestling Federation -- with a cult following. The conceit revolves around one Chairman Kaga, a gazillionaire with feudal overtones, a red-draped Kitchen Stadium and four culinary gladiators -- the Iron Chefs -- masters of, respectively, Japanese, Chinese, French and Italian cuisine. He wears brocaded capes and sinister black gunfighter gloves and munches a yellow bell pepper. Each week, one of his Iron Chefs -- who rise majestically in clouds of smoke out of the floor, sternly clutching very big knives -- battles a challenger, usually winning.
The contest involves a secret ingredient, from which the chefs must make four or five dishes in 60 minutes. The action is covered like a sport with a floor reporter relaying excited snatches ("In the blender, Bobby Flay has coriander, spinach and chives. . . . Morimoto is tearing open that crab. . . .") to play-by-play commentators who deliver portentous analysis ("The crowd is starting to go wild. . . . We've never had a battle like this. . . ."). Except for Chairman Kaga, translated in subtitles, the whole thing is voiced-over in deadpan, slightly daffy English. It is a hoot.
In March of last year, the Chairman traveled here to match his man, Mr. Morimoto, who was the chef at Nobu, against Mr. Flay, the brash celebrity-chef owner of Mesa Grill and Bolo. Rock crab was the ingredient; it was a hard-fought loss for Mr. Flay. Early on, tense, he cut a thumb on the blade in his Cuisinart. Then he got a tremendous shock from an electric stove. But the most dramatic moment came when Mr. Flay, dishes finished, climbed atop his counter, pumping his fists in the air, shouting, "Raise the roof! Raise the roof!" as the crowd roared.
Mr. Morimoto was horrified. "He's not a chef," he told the floor reporter, looking stricken. "After finishing, he stood up on the cutting board. That's not right. He stood on the cutting board. Cutting boards and knives are sacred to us."
IT was like I killed his mother," said Mr. Flay, still stunned. "I was really upset. I had apparently disrespected Morimoto. That's the last thing I wanted. Nobu is one of my favorite restaurants.
"It was no big deal -- I do worse at a Knicks game."
Bobby Flay, 36, is one of those rare people who discover early what they love and make a huge success of it, with, so far, two restaurants, three cookbooks and two television shows. It was not always clear this would be so. A tough New York boy, he bounced through several high schools ("I was terrible"), finishing at a place, now closed, that he described as "the last-chance school."
His father, a scholarly lawyer, was a part owner in Joe Allen's, the theater district restaurant. When a busboy needed two weeks off for an emergency, he ordered his unemployed son to fill in. Soon he was helping the chef. He was 17 years old, and Joe Allen sent him back to school, paying for a six-month course at the French Culinary Institute in SoHo. Then Mr. Allen told him to move on, and he began cooking at places on the Upper East Side, ending up with Jonathan Waxman when he opened Jams, one of the first restaurants in the city spreading the gospel of the New American cuisine.
"It was crazy," said Mr. Flay, whose red-haired boyish good looks and macho style have helped make him a star. "For a young cook, rubbing shoulders with Wolfgang Puck, Larry Forgione."
But at 23, he was burned out. He skied six straight weeks at Aspen, then tried a job on the stock exchange. He went back to cooking at Miracle Grill, where he was discovered by Jerome Kretchmer, the restaurant impresario behind Gotham Bar and Grill. ("You're much better looking than me," Mr. Kretchmer said at the time. "This is never going to work.") They opened Mesa Grill, featuring Mr. Flay's distinctive, bold Southwestern food, 10 years ago, the day the Persian Gulf war began ("The first dish went out as we dropped the bombs on Iraq. Everybody went home to watch CNN.") to immediate success. Bolo, with the food of Spain, opened seven years ago. The two restaurants are very different.
"Squeeze bottles are our lives," he said in the kitchen of Mesa Grill, hefting the plastic vials used to apply squiggles of flavor, among them smoked red and yellow chilies, cilantro oil, red chili oil, lime glaze. A half dozen blocks away at Bolo, the squeeze bottles hold saffron, mustard oil, roasted garlic, green onion sauce.
"That's the palate here, the food of the Mediterranean, tons of garlic," Mr. Flay said in Bolo's smaller kitchen. "Here, no cilantro is allowed. At Mesa Grill, it's all about cilantro. I'm really big into flavor. Nobody will ever come to my restaurants and say the food is bland."

HEADLINE: Five Powers Delay Vote on Easing Iraq Trade 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 31 

 BODY:
The five major powers on the Security Council agreed today to postpone for 30 days a vote on a more generous trade policy for Iraq. 
 The extension is intended to give experts time to evaluate a detailed list of items that the United States wants to prevent Saddam Hussein's government from buying unless it obtains international approval. 
 A meeting on Wednesday in Budapest among Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and his counterparts from Britain, France and Russia appears to have resulted in a compromise to extend the existing "oil for food" program for Iraq for a much shorter period than Russia had been seeking. 
Britain and the United States wanted no extension, but aimed for a vote this week on a new plan that would lift restrictions on the sale of civilian goods to Iraq while trying to tighten controls on oil smuggling and military purchases.
The full Council may vote on Friday on temporararily extending the current program, which faces a renewal deadline of midnight Sunday.
Iraq immediately threatened again to cut off oil production if the extension is adopted. The program is usually renewed every six months.
"Iraq will not deal with it," Ambassador Mohammed Aldouri told reporters today as the Council met on the extension. "Consequently Iraq will not conclude any oil contract based on it, and this resolution will be for us just another dead resolution."
Diplomats and some United Nations officials say the Iraqi threat, if carried out, may not disrupt the oil market as much as Mr. Hussein may expect. This year, Iraq withheld oil from the market, and prices dropped, a diplomat said. 
A temporary extension of the "oil for food" program under which Iraq may sell unlimited quantities of oil to buy a wide range of goods, will give a divided Security Council some time for negotiations. Still, diplomats expect sharp debate over the American list of goods that Washington wants to monitor so that Iraq cannot reconstruct weapons by diverting material or equipment that also has civilian uses. The Russians and French have questioned some items. 
Secretary Powell acknowledged to reporters on the plane returning to Washington from Budapest that "the difficulty, of course, is in the details," adding that the list of items was "excruciatingly detailed."

HEADLINE: A Failed Energy Plan Catches Up to New York 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE and RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
To understand the troubled progress of electricity deregulation in New York, it helps to consider a cluster of gray prefabricated buildings at the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn.
 Inside are the components of a small power generator, one of 10 that the state is hurriedly installing in the city to avert blackouts and price spikes when temperatures rise this summer. 
 Things were not supposed to turn out this way. When Gov. George E. Pataki set out to deregulate New York's electricity business five years ago, he offered a simple promise: break up the old utility monopolies, and the free market will deliver new power plants and reduce the high rates that were driving employers out of the state. 
But private power companies have not yet built any plants. So to ensure the city's lights stay on, the state has stepped in, installing its small generators and encouraging hundreds of businesses to turn on sooty diesel generators when demand is high. 
Meanwhile, with supplies tight, Consolidated Edison's rates -- the highest in the continental United States before deregulation -- have risen significantly, up almost 40 percent from two years ago. Just yesterday, the managers of the state's power grid predicted that peak summer rates could rise an additional 22 percent by 2003.
Now, Con Ed, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- even the State Public Service Commission, which drafted New York's deregulation plan -- are calling for increased government control over the state's electricity market. And the energy plan that President Bush issued last month lumps New York with California among the states with the nation's most severe energy supply problems.
Unlike in California, there have been no utility bankruptcies or rolling blackouts here. And few voices are calling for a return to the old system, in which the state oversaw plant construction and told utilities what they could charge for power. Nevertheless, a host of critics, from former commission staffers to business lobbyists to consumer advocates, say that deregulation in New York has gone awry. 
Other states took a cautious approach to restructuring an industry that had been under tight government control for decades. But New York -- driven by an urgent desire to lower rates and an abiding faith in the free market -- opted for sudden, sweeping change. 
The Pataki administration ignored warnings that prices could rise under deregulation unless steps were taken to ensure adequate supplies of power. It cast aside expert findings that the utilities' plans to sell their power plants to just a few buyers might invite the new owners to engage in price gouging. 
And while virtually every other state took pains to shield ratepayers during the transition to free-market power, New York let its leading utilities pass their costs through to ratepayers -- big companies upstate, and all of Con Ed's customers downstate. 
Officials in Albany note that the sharp rise in rates, especially in New York City, has primarily been because of surging prices for the natural gas used to fire many power plants. They say those fuel costs would have been passed along to consumers even under the old, regulated system. For now, they counsel patience.
"We understand that deregulation is in a transition period right now," Governor Pataki said in an interview. "We don't have the wholesale markets the way they should be -- not just in New York, but across the nation -- so we have to take steps to make sure the consumer is protected, and we've been doing that."
But the experience of other states reveals that their consumers are better protected, and that the transition need not be so painful. 
For example, in Massachusetts -- a state dependent on a comparable mix of high-priced fossil fuels -- rates have gone up just half as much as in New York, and are expected to hold steady through 2001. Con Ed's rates could go still higher this summer, if demand squeezes supplies.
The contrast, critics say, reflects the history of New York's experiment in energy deregulation: a study in faulty assumptions, unheeded omens and unkept promises.
"They thought it was a classic win-win situation," said George M. Knapp, a partner at the Coudert Brothers law firm who represents power producers. "What could possibly go wrong -- except everything that did go wrong?"

Relying on an Unreliable Market
When the Pataki administration unveiled its deregulation plan in 1996, New York's utilities were producing more electricity than customers were using. The plan assumed that the surplus would last until 2005, if not longer, by which time market forces would have lured new power generating supplies to meet rising demand. 
But the governor's proposal ignored a warning that New York was on the verge of rapidly losing its surplus due to increasing demand. A team at the Public Service Commission had forecast -- accurately, it turned out -- that New York would need new power plants by 2000. 
"The feeling at the P.S.C. was, 'Yeah, that's true, but the market will respond,' " said Lawrence DeWitt, who headed the team predicting trouble. "It was consistent with the philosophy. It was the big leap."
Now, though the demand is real, major new power plants remain years away. Power suppliers have proposed 21 large and mid-sized plants around the state, of which two have been approved. They will begin operating in late 2003, at the earliest, and neither is intended to serve New York City, where the need is most acute. 
Other states years ago took steps to ensure extra supplies of power. Massachusetts, for example, streamlined the application process for building plants -- without softening environmental or other regulations; that is helping New England add enough plants this year to provide power to 2.6 million homes. Michigan, as part of its deregulation plan, has instructed utilities to find a way to increase transmission in the state by about 50 percent by June 2002. 
New York, though, decided that its new power markets would be largely free of the state's hand. On taking office in 1995, Governor Pataki eliminated the state energy office, a planning body that he had derided during his campaign as a waste of money. From 1988 to 1999, no state agency had the authority to issue environmental permits for new power plants.
"Essentially there was a lot of rhetoric that the market would do the planning," said Carl Pechman, a former Public Service Commission supervisor and now head of Power Economics, a consulting firm. "The feeling was, 'You don't need an agency to plan when you need a steel mill or new refinery, so you don't need an agency to plan when you need new power plants.' "
Meanwhile, to deliver quick dividends on deregulation, the administration eliminated a two percent surcharge on electricity bills that had supported conservation programs. Utilities had used the money to conduct "energy audits" showing consumers how to use less power, and to subsidize their purchases of more efficient appliances. But big power users complained that the surcharge, which cost them millions each year, gave them few benefits.
In the mid-1990's, the state scaled back its energy conservation program, once the country's most aggressive, by more than 70 percent, a process that began before Mr. Pataki took office but which he accelerated. There have been increases since then -- particularly this year, as the state looks to conservation as one way to avert an energy crisis. 
But New York still spends far less on conservation than it did a decade ago. Environmentalists say that if programs had been financed at the old levels, demand would be about 500 megawatts lower -- equivalent to the output of a medium-size power plant. That, in turn, would ease the tight electricity supplies that have helped drive up prices.

Focusing on a Quick Payoff
The very essence of power deregulation was the state's requirement that utilities sell their power plants. The idea was that the new owners -- lean companies unburdened by the heritage of monopoly -- would compete to sell power to Con Ed and other electricity retailers, thereby forcing prices down.
But here too, critics say, the state's determination to get a quick payoff from deregulation took priority. 
The deals that the state negotiated with the utilities counted on proceeds from the power plant sales to finance the governor's promise of an immediate reduction in ratepayers' bills. To maximize those proceeds, the Public Service Commission went along with the utilities' demands to sell their plants in bundles of bigger and smaller plants. 
That indeed drew higher bids; Con Ed, for example, received nearly double the book value of its plants in the city. But it sold them in 1999 to just three buyers: Orion Power Holdings Inc., then a private company backed by Goldman, Sachs and the Mitsubishi Corp.; NRG Energy Inc., a Minneapolis-based company; and KeySpan, the energy company in Brooklyn. 
Some politicians and economists warned that the concentration of ownership might backfire. Miles Bidwell, an economist and former consultant with the Independent Power Producers of New York, filed testimony in 1997 with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission stating that New York's plan would create a market susceptible to price manipulation.
Like other analysts, he believed that the plants drew high prices because the buyers expected high rates for their electricity. 
"The fact that people were willing to pay such huge amounts for the power plants doesn't in itself mean they're buying market power, but it raises a flag, and you expect people to examine the issue more carefully," Mr. Bidwell said. "I said the economic analysis was never done about the impact of the sales."
Now the impact is becoming clear. 
Statewide, suppliers manipulated prices on the wholesale markets about 10 times last year, according to the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid. Just one of those instances, it says, cost utilities about $100 million. In New York City, electricity prices on the real-time market -- where Con Ed purchases about 5 percent of its power -- have spiked repeatedly near the limit of $1,000 per megawatt hour allowed by the state, which is about 20 times the average price.
The Pataki administration, which long disdained the notion of government controls on energy markets, now wants the Independent System Operator to have the authority to order lower prices when power generators' bids are suspiciously high. It also wants the grid operator to have the authority to fine generators for price gouging.
But the Independent System Operator, which includes energy suppliers, has been reluctant to endorse a system of penalties, and both measures would require the approval of federal regulators, who to date have been hostile to such controls.
The power generators strongly deny any wrongdoing. "I don't believe there is a lot of gouging taking place," said Craig Mataczynski, chief executive of NRG. "Much of what is talked about is mythical in nature."
Other states, besides taking steps to assure power supplies were adequate before unleashing the forces of deregulation, laid plans to police their new wholesale markets more closely than New York. 
For example, the PJM Interconnection, the transmission system for all or part of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Washington, Virginia and Delaware, introduced its wholesale market in phases over three years. The idea was to monitor the behavior of power suppliers and iron out any problems.
PJM is not immune to price gouging. But it requires that suppliers report daily the actual cost of generating power at their plants, which makes it easier for the system's managers to spot price manipulation.
"PJM did things one step at a time," said Tim Mount, professor of applied economics and management at Cornell University and an expert on the electricity industry. "One only has to look at California to see how difficult it is to resolve problems on the fly."

Unheeded Warnings on Bill Shock
Experts had warned New York that energy deregulation, because it was complex and untested, could lead to higher prices, at least initially. As early as 1994, the Public Service Commission, under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, said that in any deregulation plan, "the commission should strive to minimize 'bill shock' for any class of customers."
Customers are shielded elsewhere. California, the most extreme case, let generators charge market prices for power, but froze the rates that the utilities could charge consumers. That led to bankruptcy for the state's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric.
Other states have so far struck a balance protecting both consumers and utilities. In Massachusetts, for example, utilities are required under the state's deregulation laws to enter into long-term contracts for power. Such agreements mean that customers pay a fixed rate for electricity, and the utilities buy only a small portion of their power on volatile wholesale markets. 
But the negotiators whom Governor Pataki charged with hammering out New York's new power markets were confident that prices would fall. And so, unlike utilities elsewhere, Con Ed was allowed to pass the price of power along to its customers.
Con Ed insisted on the pass-through in its deregulation talks with the state. Because the utility takes no mark-up on power it resells to consumers, it says that the arrangement is fair. "Based on what we've seen transpire in California, I think it was correct -- not just for us but our customers," said Michael Clendenin, a company spokesman. 
In retrospect, the state's critics say that the utility's insistence on a pass-through should have been a red flag that it foresaw rising prices. But the state's focus was on other issues.
"They took a very strong position that if they didn't get the pass-through, they would be at risk financially from buying power on the market," said John O'Mara, who as chairman of the Public Service Commission from 1996 to 1998 was the architect of New York's deregulation plan. "In return, they were willing to give us a better deal over all."
Again, the aim was a big cut in customers' bills. And over the last three years, the utilities have delivered -- on the portion of customers' bills that covers the cost of delivering power to homes and businesses. Con Ed, for example, has reduced those rates by 16.8 percent. 
But unexpectedly high fuel prices, accentuated by the market power exercised by generators, have eclipsed the savings. Over all, Con Ed bills were 38 percent higher in January than two years earlier.
Upstate, the state allowed the biggest utility, the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, to pass through power costs to industrial customers, but not to residents and smaller businesses. The logic was that in a competitive market, big businesses would have enough clout to find cheaper power themselves.
Instead, new suppliers have offered upstate companies electricity at prices as high as Niagara Mohawk's or higher, a situation that customers attribute to tight electricity supplies.
As a result, large manufacturers that once ardently supported deregulation now pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more a month for power than they had budgeted. Some are considering leaving the state. 
In a little more than a year, the nation's largest brass mill, Outokumpu American Brass, has gone from bustling to staggering, choking on its vast appetite for electricity. It pays $850,000 a month for power, over $200,000 more than it did in late 1999. The Finnish-owned company, based in Buffalo, is now considering layoffs for the first time in a decade. 
"It's killing us," said Earl Robinson, an Outokumpu vice president. "I want everyone to understand that this is a crisis."

Power Politics
Tight power supplies and pioneering deregulation plans make the Northeast a focal point of the nation's energy crisis. This is the second article of a series looking at the political and economic roots of deregulation and at efforts to address energy shortages in the region.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 2, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about energy deregulation in New York described the state's troubled progress in establishing a market-based system for generating and selling electricity.
Because of an editing error, the headline, "A Failed Energy Plan Catches Up to New York," exceeded the findings of the article. The reporting showed that officials had ignored warnings about the pitfalls of deregulation and that promises of lower electric rates had not been fulfilled. But the article also made it clear that the process was still in its early stages and that the state was taking steps to rectify some flaws in its plan. The headline should have reflected the calls for increased consumer protections pending an improvement in the system.
Charts with the article, explaining the components of a typical electric bill, were misattributed. The information was from the State Public Service Commission, not Consolidated Edison.

High Rates for Argentine Bonds

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, June 1 

 BODY:
Argentina is offering to pay interest rates approaching 16 percent to persuade investors to swap an expected $20 billion in government debt for new bonds.
 The debt swap, which is being closely watched in bond markets in the United States and Europe, is a major element in the government's effort to revive the moribund economy. 
 Argentina wants investors to exchange some of 46 existing bonds, most of which mature before 2006, for five longer-term bonds to stretch out financing costs. A three-year recession and a rising budget deficit have raised concerns that the country may not make payments on its $128 billion debt. Today, the government disclosed price and coupon details about the five new bonds, and the results of the swap will be announced on Monday. 
A global dollar bond due in 2008 was priced at $78.55 to yield 15.97 percent, J. P. Morgan Chase, one of the banks managing the swap, told investors. A 2008 bond in pesos will yield 15.99 percent, while global dollar bonds due in 2018 and 2031 were priced to yield 15.25 percent and 14.91 percent, respectively.
The rates are higher than the range of 14 to 15 percent that was expected by investors early this week, and may almost double the country's finance costs beginning in 2006, analysts said.
"It's certainly a high price to pay," said Robert Koenigsberger, who co-manages $100 million in emerging-market debt for Gramercy Advisors in Greenwich, Conn., and who is not swapping his Argentine bonds. "It does not bode well for economic growth and private-sector financing when the interest rate that the government is forced to pay is so high."
The government needs to offer a premium to attract investors to the swap, insuring an exchange worth as much as $20 billion. 
Local banks and pension funds, which hold about $39 billion of the $66.7 billion in bonds eligible for the swap, may account for 90 percent of the transaction, analysts said.

Rallies in Dow and Nasdaq Erase Some Losses for Week

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
After a cautious reading of reports on employment and manufacturing that offered conflicting messages about the strength of the American economy, investors embraced battered technology stocks yesterday and touched off a modest rally.
 The Nasdaq composite index gained 38.95 points, or 1.85 percent, to 2,149.44, but it still ended the week down 4.51 percent, its worst performance since the first week of April. 
 The Dow rose 78.47 points, or 0.72 percent, to 10,990.41, cutting its loss for the holiday-shortened week to 0.14 percent. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.85 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,260.67, off 1.35 percent for the week. 
Over all, investors seemed to interpret yesterday's economic data as "benign, roughly," said Jon Brorson, director of equities for Northern Trust, a money management concern. But it took investors a while to reach that conclusion.
The leading gauges opened on the positive side after the Labor Deportment reported an unexpected decline in the unemployment rate to 4.4 percent last month, from 4.5 percent in April. Businesses cut 19,000 jobs from their payrolls in May, a smaller decline than expected.
But prices came under pressure around 10 a.m. after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported a decrease in industrial activity for May, with its purchasing index falling to 42.1 in May from 43.2 a month earlier. That decline reinforced earlier signs of weakness in manufacturing, which lost 124,000 jobs in May.
By early afternoon, though, stocks edged higher, led by technology issues.
"The market just seemed to take every piece of information and extrapolate it into a trend" yesterday, Brett Gallagher, vice president of Julius Baer Investment Management, said.
Treasury prices rose in response to the weak manufacturing figures, as traders hoped the data would provide the Federal Reserve with more reason to cut interest rates later this month.
The 10-year Treasury note edged up 2/32, to 97 9/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.36 percent from 5.37 percent on Thursday. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 18/32, to 95 9/32, while its yield fell to 5.71 percent from 5.75 percent Thursday.
Stock trading volume was somewhat modest yesterday, with fewer than 1.2 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said this was a sign that investors remained cautious, bracing themselves as companies began forecasting their second-quarter earnings, many of which are expected to miss Wall Street's forecasts. Investors are also concerned about how aggressively the Fed will act on interest rates.
"The market is in kind of a quandary because on the one hand it shows that the Fed could ease, which should be good for the market," said Howard H. Mackey, vice president and head of the trading desk at M. R. Beal & Company, referring to the new economic reports. "But these numbers suggest that we're going to continue to see some negative earnings reports."
Among the stocks lifting the Dow, Boeing climbed $2.11, to $65, after it reached a tentative agreement with its machinists' union. Among the Dow's technology components, Intel gained $1.73, to $28.74; I.B.M. rose $1.09, to $112.89; and Microsoft rose $1.16, to $70.34.
The gains in Intel and other chip makers' stocks pushed the Philadelphia semiconductor index up 18.89 points, or 3.16 percent, to 617.60.
Computer software makers helped nudge the Nasdaq higher. Oracle rose 56 cents, to $15.86, while Veritas Software gained $2.88, to $68.79.
Among the Dow components outside the technology sector, Merck rose $1.21, to $74.20, and Johnson & Johnson rose $1.05, to $98.
Houghton Mifflin jumped $4.99, to $59.55, after it agreed to be acquired by Vivendi Universal for $60 a share in cash, or $1.7 billion.
In the spirit of the afternoon's optimism, investors granted DuPont shares a reprieve. They had fallen more than $1 after a company executive told analysts and investors that DuPont would continue to face challenges in the second quarter and that the operating environment in the last half of the year would be weaker than the corresponding period a year earlier. But by the end of the day, the stock was down only 33 cents, to $46.07.

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief Calls on U.S. Companies to Donate to AIDS Fund 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1 

 BODY:
The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, appealed to American corporations today to dig into their pockets and give to a planned multibillion-dollar global fund to fight AIDS in Africa and other developing regions.
 Mr. Annan, who until now has focused on governments as major donors to the fund, has received pledges so far from only three nations, including the United States. Today, he tried to convince corporations that it was in their economic self-interest to contribute to the fund and to set up their own programs in the workplace to protect employees. 
 But with comparatively little American trade and investment in Africa, and relatively few big companies active on the continent, Mr. Annan faced an uphill battle. So he offered other arguments, including combating the growing sentiment against globalization. 
"As AIDS creates more poverty and deepens inequalities, it fuels the growing public backlash against globalization," he told executives of major corporations at the United States Chamber of Commerce today. "This sentiment will only get stronger and more widespread if we do not show ourselves determined to mount a really serious response." 
Businesses, which he described as profiting most from globalization, "will come under more and more public pressure to provide leadership." 
Mr. Annan, who is from Ghana, and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell whose ancestry is African and Caribbean, have joined forces in an unusually high-profile and strikingly personal campaign to beam a spotlight on the tragedy of AIDS in Africa.
In seizing the issue, they have encouraged the seven leading industrial countries and Russia, which will hold their G-8 summit meeting in Genoa, Italy, next month, to put AIDS in Africa high on their agenda. 
The two men met in Secretary Powell's office at the State Department immediately after Mr. Annan's speech. Secretary Powell returned this week from a tour of Africa, where he looked at AIDS programs, held hands with children afflicted with the disease and encouraged people to "send in their nickels and dimes and dollars" for the trust fund. 
Mr. Annan did not ask for precise amounts from the corporate executives present today, and no pledges were forthcoming. In answer to a question afterward, he said he expected "big bucks" from corporations. 
But the White House has had little success in a less public approach to corporate leaders to give to the fund, officials familiar with the effort said today. When President Bush announced that the United States would give $200 million as an initial contribution to the global AIDS fund, the White House also wanted to be able to say that corporations were giving as well. 
Because the structure of the fund had not yet been determined, corporations said they were reluctant to come forward with donations, the officials said. The companies were particularly unwilling to give to a fund run by the United Nations, the officials said. 
But now that it has been decided that the fund will not be managed by the United Nations bureaucracy in New York, officials expect that both corporations and individual nations will be more forthcoming. Mr. Annan explained today that decisions on how the money would be spent would be left to experts in recipient countries. The World Bank, which is part of the United Nations system, will hold the money but not attach conditions to it. 
Mr. Annan has said that his goal for the fund is $7 billion to $10 billion, well above the money currently available to fight AIDS, which is now about $1 billion. 
Britain announced on Thursday that it would give $106.5 million, and France announced a donation of $125 million. 
Mr. Annan also pointed to two corporate programs to help employees as models for what can be accomplished.
Anglo American, the world's largest mining company, has begun distributing anti-retroviral drugs and giving palliative care to its 50,000 workers in Botswana, he said. That is a big step forward for Africa, where only about 10,000 people of the 26 million who are H.I.V. positive receive the drugs, AIDS experts said. 
Mr. Annan also praised Volkswagen for its H.I.V. prevention program in Brazil. The company also provides treatment, including anti-retroviral drugs, he said. By 1999, the company had seen a 90 percent reduction in hospitalization among H.I.V.-positive workers, he said. 
Also, after several years of internal debate on whether to have the brand associated with AIDS, the Coca-Cola Company is planning this month to announce a project of AIDS prevention and education for its workers in Africa. Coca-Cola, which was in the forefront of carrying polio vaccine in its refrigerated trucks in India, is the largest private employer in Africa, with more than 100,000 workers.

College Honors Man It Tried To Discredit

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Fifty years ago, at the height of the McCarthy era, Brooklyn College permanently shut down Vanguard, a student newspaper, and branded the paper's 19-year-old editor "a bad campus citizen."
 The student, William L. Taylor, went on to Yale Law School and was later nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson to be staff director of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, but college officials urged the government not to hire him. They told investigators with the Federal Bureau of Investigation of a "remarkable similarity" between editorials in the student paper and Communist literature. 
 And according to his F.B.I. file, which Mr. Taylor obtained a few years ago, they also condemned him for membership on the student council, which, one official said, had "espoused liberal causes such as the rights of the Negro in the South." 
But the Senate approved him anyway, and he played a major role in creating and monitoring federal civil rights legislation.
Yesterday, Brooklyn College, in a gesture that mixed contrition with pride, paid tribute to Mr. Taylor and his decades of civil rights work by giving him an honorary degree. Christoph M. Kimmich, the college's president, called Mr. Taylor "a person who represents what this institution is all about." 
Mr. Taylor, tall, with wavy white hair and a relaxed manner and robed in a long black academic gown, in turn praised Brooklyn College. He said it was there that he had learned the importance of engaging in the moral struggles of one's era, although, he allowed, it was a lesson that the college administration of the time had not intended.
"It was a character-building experience,"' Mr. Taylor, 69, said. "I learned that you could speak out for things you believed in and that nothing bad would happen to you. I have spent my life doing that."
He and some of his classmates recalled that the period after World War II was a tumultuous one for both the country and Brooklyn College, a public tuition-free institution that attracted highly motivated children of immigrants and other poor families. Some called the college, in Flatbush, the little red schoolhouse because of the number of faculty members and students believed to be Communist sympathizers.
The president of the college at the time, Harry D. Gideonse, an economist who had worked at the University of Chicago and Columbia, had been brought in to upgrade the college and repair its reputation. But he also banned anyone with ideas he considered radical from speaking or performing on campus.
"He was brought in to repaint the schoolhouse," said Alan M. Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor and a 1959 Brooklyn College graduate who also received an honorary degree yesterday. A third honorary degree was given to Melvin Edwards, a sculptor and printmaker, at the graduation for 2,500 students.
Speaking before the ceremony, Mr. Dershowitz said, "We all had fights with the president." He added that after he served as president of the student government, Dr. Gideonse did not recommend him for law school "because he thought I was too far left."
Dr. Gideonse had a running battle with Vanguard, which he saw as sympathetic to Communist interests and as far too independent. He shut the paper down in the spring of 1950, when it disobeyed his order not to print an article saying that he had refused to grant tenure to the chairman of the history department because of his political views. The college suspended some staff members and put others, including Mr. Taylor, a sports editor, on probation. 
In the fall, the college let the weekly newspaper reopen, and Mr. Taylor was chosen as editor. But after two issues it was shut down again, this time for good, after a student complained that his point of view had not been properly represented. 
The closing drew national attention, and Mr. Taylor was quoted in The New York Times as saying, "The dissolution of Vanguard can only be construed as an attempt by the college administration to gain control of the newspaper and squelch the expression of any student opinion which does not agree with that of the administration."
The day the article ran, Mr. Taylor recalled, Dr. Gideonse called him into his office and told him, "I hate to ruin anyone's career, but in your case I might make an exception."
Mr. Taylor and his fellow editors briefly ran an alternative newspaper, Campus News, off campus, until they ran out of money. Despite Dr. Gideonse's threat, he was allowed to graduate in 1952. He worked under Thurgood Marshall at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and later helped found the Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights, a bipartisan group that monitors federal civil rights policy and enforcement. He is currently the commission's vice chairman.
This summer Mr. Taylor is hoping to encourage other student leaders to continue the battle for civil rights. Along with two other organizations, the Leadership Conference Education Fund, of which he is president, is running a program called Civil Rights Summer for college students. The program received 1,300 applications for 20 places."That tells me," he said, "that there are a lot of young people out there who are interested in being activists."

HEADLINE: Economy Remained Weak in May As Employers Continued Job Cuts 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The economy remained weak in May as American employers continued to cut jobs, though at a slower pace than during the previous two months, the government reported yesterday.
 Manufacturers, both traditional and high technology, caused the decline, eliminating more jobs in May than they had during any other month in the current slowdown. 
 The unemployment rate fell, to 4.4 percent from 4.5 percent, mostly because the number of people looking for work decreased in May -- for reasons that are not clear -- compared with previous months. To be counted as officially unemployed, a person must be out of work and actively searching for a job. 
Analysts said the drop, the first in nine months, masked an economy and a labor market that were still worsening. Over all, employment fell by a seasonally adjusted 19,000 jobs, leaving it virtually unchanged since January, after having grown by an average of about 250,000 jobs a month in the late 1990's.
As was the case in the 1990-91 recession -- but in contrast to almost any other downturn -- many college-educated white-collar workers have been among the first to lose their jobs, according to the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by either one-quarter or one-half of a percentage point when it meets at the end of this month. The Fed has already cut its benchmark rate -- which affects the rates on many credit card, small-business and auto loans -- five times since January. 
"The change in the unemployment rate was statistically insignificant and a misleading sign of what is really going on," said Maury Harris, the chief United States economist at UBS Warburg. "It is not clear that the worst is over."
A survey of manufacturing executives that was released yesterday indicated that the number of orders they were receiving fell again in May. This suggests that the sector, hampered by high energy prices and sluggish business spending on new equipment, will be weak for the near future, economists said. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 10,990.41, up 78.47 points, and bond prices rose slightly as investors expected more rate cuts by the Fed.
In recent months, consumer spending on services, like transportation and day care, and on housing has remained mostly brisk, allowing these industries to add jobs and, so far at least, apparently keeping the economy out of recession. Employment in the vast service sector rose 70,000 in May, about half of its average increase over the last year and a half. Construction employment increased 31,000, well ahead of its pace of the last year and a half, partly because the interest rate cuts have encouraged people to buy a new home or remodel the one they live in.
The unemployment rate remained below 5 percent for the 47th consecutive month, the longest such streak since the 1960's.
Most analysts predict that economic activity will reach a nadir in the early summer, and then pick up in the second half of the year, as businesses finish unloading excess inventory and as consumers receive tax-rebate checks from the government. 
"I see no evidence in this report that we've reached a bottom," said Chris Varvares, the president of Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis. "We probably still have a few months of manufacturing-employment declines to go. But we think we're getting close to the bottom."
Mr. Varvares added that yesterday's report caused his firm to take a dimmer view of the second quarter, and it now expects about a 2 percent contraction in the economy. It still expects the economy to grow 3 percent in the second half of the year. 
In the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of this year, the economy grew less than 2 percent, its smallest six-month increase since 1995.
Typically, manufacturing companies struggle before service businesses during a slowdown, because people can more easily delay the purchase of cars and appliances than health care or education, for example. In the past, a rapid decline in manufacturing employment has usually been followed by a recession. Today, however, many analysts believe a serious downturn can be avoided because businesses and policy makers are using technology to react to the economy's shifts more quickly than in the past.
Manufacturing companies cut 124,000 jobs last month.
Another unusual aspect of the current downturn has been the swiftness with which large numbers of college graduates have lost their jobs.
The unemployment rate for college graduates last month was 2.1 percent, down from 2.3 percent in April but up from 1.6 percent in October. By contrast, the jobless rate of people without a high school diploma -- 6.5 percent last month -- has grown only one-tenth of a percentage point since October.
"Traditionally, in a recession in the United States, almost all of the pain was felt by blue-collar workers," said Lawrence F. Katz, an economist at Harvard University. "The recent slowdown is more egalitarian." 
Manufacturing jobs require more technical knowledge than they once did, and American industry has become more devoted to turning out high-technology goods. As a result more factory employees hold college degrees than in the past. Companies have also become more aggressive in cutting a broad range of costs -- like the salaries of managers and clerical workers -- in an effort to increase profits.
Analysts and investors had expected yesterday's jobs report to show a larger decline in jobs than it did and for the unemployment rate to rise slightly. And the decline of 19,000 jobs, compared with an average drop of 60,000 jobs in March and April, did indicate that corporate cost-cutting was not accelerating.
"The weakness in May, over all, is a little less than in April," said Thomas J. Nardone, the head of the government division that compiles the report. 
Still, Mr. Nardone cautioned against reading very much into the jobless rate's fall. He noted that the government calculates the unemployment rate from its survey of households, which is more volatile than its larger survey of businesses. The overall change in employment -- minus 19,000 in May -- comes from the business survey.
"You always have to be careful looking at one month's change in the household survey," Mr. Nardone said. 
In addition, the government conducted both of its May surveys a few days earlier than usual because of the way the calendar fell. Because employment traditionally grows throughout the spring and summer -- and the government's seasonal adjustments account for this growth -- the May survey might have overstated the labor market strength somewhat, economists said.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 6, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Saturday about the unemployment rate in May misstated a change in the second-quarter projections by Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis. Based on the jobless numbers, the firm now expects the number of hours worked by Americans to decline about 2 percent and the economy to grow about 1 percent. It does not expect the economy over all to contract 2 percent.

HEADLINE: At Baruch, Levy Urges Heeding to Altruism 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Harold O. Levy, a corporate lawyer who left a lucrative job at Citigroup last year to lead the New York City school system as chancellor, told graduates at Baruch College yesterday that financial success was hollow unless it was used "to heed the call of social responsibility."
 Mr. Levy urged the nearly 2,000 graduates at Baruch's commencement ceremony to contribute to the public good throughout their lives, no matter how wealthy they become. He said that Bernard Baruch, the financier for whom the college was named, was an icon in his family not only because he was a millionaire by age 30 but because he was an advisor to presidents and a dedicated philanthropist. 
 "Profit maximization does not preclude acting in a manner that is socially responsible," Mr. Levy said during the ceremony, at Madison Square Garden. "Acting on your better natures, trying to be what you can only be if you put your own self interest to the side, is what we crave most in society and ultimately what makes us proudest of ourselves."
Mr. Levy listed some of his own volunteer jobs, from arbitrating in small claims court to serving on the board of the University Settlement Society of New York and as a New York State Regent.
He also said that he had created the New York City Teaching Fellows, an alternative certification program for people from other professions who want to teach, to appeal to altruistic impulses in New Yorkers.
"To heed the call of social responsibility will make you a better person in your own eyes," Mr. Levy said. "That's why I started the Teaching Fellows program in the New York City public schools, and that's why I left my post to come here and lead the campaign for public education."
Mr. Levy, who made more than $500,000 a year at Citigroup and now earns $245,000 as chancellor, also warned the graduates not to be "ruthless rationalists" and urged them to instead take leaps of faith.
"Rational analysis fails to explain most of life's great decisions," he said.
Mr. Levy was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree by Baruch, part of the City University of New York. The college's highest honor, the President's Medal, was given to Abraham J. Briloff, a longtime economics professor. 

City College
The 2,500 graduates of the City College of New York yesterday heard an assortment of speakers talk about the importance of overcoming obstacles, taking risks and not giving up.
Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan accepted the college's President's Medal and said, "To see this group, you are indeed the gorgeous mosaic." Rita Moreno, an Academy Award-winning actress, was awarded an honorary doctor of fine arts degree.
The valedictorian, Olumuyiwa Ogunnika, 23, who received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, was born in Brooklyn of Nigerian parents. He is to attend a doctoral program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The salutatorian, Andrew Shearer, was one of 220 graduates receiving bachelor's degrees from the Center for Worker Education at City College. Mr. Shearer, 42, who lived in England before moving to the United States in 1993, worked full time helping the mentally retarded at the Shield Institute while completing his City College degree. He has been accepted into the New York City Teaching Fellows Program and said he hoped to teach high school English.
"America's given me a great chance I don't feel that I would have ever quite got in England," he said.

HEADLINE: Royal Family of Nepal Is Shot Dead in Palace 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
In a wholesale killing of royalty not seen since the deaths of the last czar of Russia and his family in 1918, the crown prince of Nepal shot the king and queen and several relatives in their palace in Katmandu last night, then killed himself, Nepalese officials said.
 The prince, Dipendra, a 30-year-old graduate of Eton College in England killed, among others, his parents, King Birendra Bir Birkram Shah Dev, 55; Queen Aiswarya; a brother, Nirajan; and a sister, Shruti, the Associated Press reported. CNN reported that he entered a sitting room of the royal palace at 10:40 p.m., dressed in army fatigues, and opened fire with an automatic rifle. 
 "He first shot the others, then shot himself," Nepal's interior minister, Ram Chandra Poudel, told the news agency Reuters. He said up to 11 people had been killed in the rampage, but gave no further details other than to call the attack "a national disaster" for Nepal, a Hindu kingdom straddling the Himalayas. 
The British Broadcasting Corporation's correspondent for South Asia reported from Katmandu, the capital, that the crown prince had quarreled with his mother over his choice of a bride. Queen Aiswarya had long been associated in the minds of Nepal's democrats with a rigid, outdated penchant for absolute monarchy and social conservatism. Dipendra had made efforts to appear more open to the Nepalese people.
Nepal's privy council was expected to meet today to choose a successor to the throne. They were expected to pick the king's middle brother, Gyanendra, who was out of the capital, visiting a national park at Chitwan.
Nepal, a nation the size of Tennessee with 22 million inhabitants, is tormented by multiple crises, and over coming days any number of possible explanations for the tragedy may emerge. There is only speculation that some royal family members or servants in the palace may have survived to tell their stories.
Among the survivors, reports from Katmandu said, was another royal prince, Dhirendra, who was critically wounded. 
In Washington, the State Department said: "It is not clear who was responsible at this point. Both the State Department here and the embassy in Nepal will be monitoring the situation closely."
Nepal, the world's only Hindu kingdom, experienced a huge political upheaval in 1990, when a democracy movement threatened the future of the monarchy, but stopped short of forcing the abdication of the king, who was widely accepted by the Nepalese to be a reincarnation of the god Vishnu. Nepal then accepted King Birendra as a constitutional monarch. 
But there was always far less sympathy for the queen, and the king withdrew significantly from public life after that. 
More recently, as democratically elected governments of left and right run by a few upper-caste families with little grass-roots contact have stumbled, a powerful radical leftist movement, usually described as Maoist but not thought to be backed by China, has been on the march in the Nepalese countryside. The rebels gradually encircling Katmandu and severely damaging its economically important tourist industry.
Regions as far away as the approach to Mount Everest have begun to be affected by the rebellion. The army of Nepal, home to the much-feared Gurkha warriors, has been increasingly critical of the political leadership, saying it was not acting decisively enough to put down the insurrection. 
At the same time, international human rights groups were criticizing the government for being too tough.The killings throw Nepal's already shaky political prospects into complete uncertainty, said Ted Riccardi, a retired professor of Himalayan studies at Columbia University.
"There will be those who'll want to find a successor, to preserve the monarchy because they think it's so necessary for a country like Nepal," Mr. Riccardi said. "And there will be others" -- liberal democrats and the left -- "who'll say this is a golden opportunity to get rid of the monarchy altogether. The big question is what's the army going to do. That's always been the joker in Nepal. So far since 1990, they've played it quietly."
Underlying all the other tensions, the Nepalese continue to nurse a long-held fear that neighboring India may be behind the country's political problems. Leaders of Nepal's Congress Party, which was once banned but returned to political leadership a decade ago at the vanguard of the democracy movement, have acknowledged that they had considerable Indian support. 
India, which blockaded landlocked Nepal a decade ago to punish it for buying weapons from the Chinese, have again recently accused Nepal of growing too close to China and also of allowing Pakistani agents to operate from its territory. 
King Birendra, educated at Harvard, was heir to a royal family that had ruled Nepal, a country of 25 million people, off and on since the 1770's. 
The crown prince, Dipendra, was a karate black belt who trained some of his fellow students at Eton and had a reputation as a carouser. His duties have been largely honorific. For example, he met with Japanese dignitaries in April while touring the city of Kyoto and disaster management centers in Kobe. He attended the wedding of the king of Lesotho in February 2000. And in December 1998, he opened the World Buddhist Conference in the Nepalese village where Buddha was born. But the prince occasionally took on administrative roles. In June 2000, he served as chairman of a council that ran Nepal while his father went to London. for his annual medical checkup.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Off A Mere 1.2% Last Month 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 1 

 BODY:
The enduring strength of the auto market has surprised economists every month this year and did so again today, as auto sales fell only 1.2 percent from May of last year, while General Motors unexpectedly posted a small increase in sales.
 G.M.'s gain appeared to come mainly at the expense of Ford Motor, which suffered a sharp drop in sales, particularly for its Explorer and other sport utilities. George Pipas, Ford's manager of sales analysis, said that tire problems at Ford had not produced any clear effect on sales, and attributed the weakness partly to the generous rebates and other incentives being offered by Ford's rivals. 
 "They're high, they seem to be getting higher," Mr. Pipas said of the incentives. 
Economists and financial analysts at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere pay close attention to auto sales because they are one of the first economic indicators to come out each month, and because they tend to be highly cyclical and represent a significant portion of the nation's economic output.
Auto industry experts said that the slight drop in sales in May from a year earlier was particularly impressive because the economy was growing at an annual rate of 5 percent at this time last year, and it is estimated to be expanding at a rate of just 1.3 percent now.
Financial analysts had expected the auto market to be down 7 percent from last year, and were surprised that the drop was a small fraction of that. Ward's Auto Infobank, a data service in Southfield, Mich., calculated that the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales was 16.6 million vehicles in May. The industry seldom topped 15 million vehicles a year until 1999.
"Exceeding 16 million is a healthy rate of sales," said Mark M. Cornelius, president of Morgan & Company, an auto forecasting and consulting company in West Olive, Mich.
May 2000 was the month in which sales began to slip as the stock market weakened and the economy started to slow slightly. The end of 1999 and the beginning of 2000 experienced an extraordinary boom in sales that strained the capacity of factories, and the industry was still operating at full tilt in May of last year.
By contrast, Ford announced today that it would extend by a week a planned shutdown of its Ranger pickup truck factories in Edison, N.J., and St. Paul. Ford said it was doing so to make more replacement tires available for installation on Ford Explorers and other Ford vehicles currently equipped with Firestone Wilderness AT tires; the Ranger has, however, been selling slowly this spring.
General Motors took the opposite approach today, announcing that it would increase production by 17,000 vehicles by the end of the second quarter, although this would still leave the company 14 percent below its production in the second quarter of last year. With inventories of unsold cars and light trucks swiftly dwindling from their bloated levels last December, G.M. also said today that its production in the third quarter of this year would be down just 6.4 percent from the third quarter of last year, when many factories were running almost around the clock.
Automakers based in Detroit reported slumping sales and sharp drops in market share from January through April, as foreign manufacturers invaded the growing market for sport utility vehicles and used the weakness of the yen and the euro to charge low prices for their models. But General Motors broke that trend today, announcing that its sales had inched up 0.6 percent in May, compared with the company's middling performance a year ago.
In May, General Motors began offering discounts in Western states of up to $1,000 on most of its full-size sport utility vehicles that are based on pickup truck designs, like the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon. It was rewarded with a jump of nearly 30 percent in sales of these models, turning what would have been a drop in overall sales into a rare increase.
By contrast Ford and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. had declines of 11.1 percent and 8.3 percent.
European automakers did best last month, led by BMW with a 32 percent gain in sales from a year ago. Asian automakers had a mixed showing, from Hyundai, up 35 percent, to Nissan, down 7.2 percent.
Sales of Ford Explorers were down 16.5 percent from May of last year, which was the second-best month in the 11-year history of the sport utility vehicle. Still, Ford sold more Explorers in May than in any month since September. Sales of Explorers accelerated during each week of May, and it was hard to discern an effect from Ford's decision on May 22 to replace 13 million Firestone Wilderness AT tires, Mr. Pipas said.
Overall sales of pickup-based sport utilities fell 8.8 percent last month, as sales of midsize models like the Explorer withered while sales of big models like the Tahoe continued to grow, Mr. Cornelius said. Minivan sales slumped 11.7 percent last month.
Sales of so-called crossover utility vehicles -- models like the Ford Escape and Toyota Highlander that look like sport utilities but are made from small or midsize car designs -- soared 132 percent.

 Jobless Rate Falls Slightly As Economy Remains Weak
The economy remained weak in May as American employers continued to cut jobs, though at a slower pace than during the previous two months, the government reported. The unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent from 4.5 percent. Analysts said the drop, the first in nine months, masked an economy and a labor market that were worsening. Over all, employment fell by a seasonally adjusted 19,000 jobs, leaving it virtually unchanged since January. Page A1.

Nasdaq Ends the Week Down 4.5%
Investors embraced battered technology stocks, touching off a modest rally. The Nasdaq composite index gained 38.95 points, or 1.9 percent, to 2,149.44, but ended the week down 4.5 percent, its worst performance since the first week of April. The Dow rose 78.47 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,990.41, cutting its loss for the holiday-shortened week to 0.14 percent. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.85 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,260.67, off 1.4 percent for the week. C3.

Top Editor to Leave U.S. News

Ford Plans to Shuffle Management
Struggling to regain control of tire problems in Explorers that have tarnished the image of Ford Motor, the automaker plans to announce a reshuffling of the company's senior management, possibly as soon as next week, people close to Ford Motor's leaders said. C3.

When Bridgestone severed its relationship with Ford, and then asked for a United States investigation of the Explorer design, the company showed a combativeness that surprised analysts and cheered many Japanese. C2.

AT&T to Raise Base Phone Rates
AT&T said it would raise basic residential phone rates as much as 11 percent, beginning July 1. The company, facing a decline in consumer long-distance revenue this year, will increase basic weekday rates to 30 cents a minute from 29.5 cents; night-time rates to 25 cents a minute from 22.5 cents; and weekend rates to 16 cents from 14.5 cents.

Attendants Strike Aeromexico
A strike by flight attendants at Aeromexico, Mexico's largest airline, stranded thousands of passengers. Airport officials said as many as 30,000 passengers a day could be grounded in the first major labor dispute to confront the government of President Vicente Fox. The walkout began with little public warning at 12:01 a.m. More than 300 domestic and international Aeromexico flights, including 10 jointly operated with Delta Air Lines, were canceled. C2.

WALMART.COM TO OFFER NET ACCESS WITH AMERICA ONLINE

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 Walmart.com will finally roll out its own Internet service this fall with America Online, offering unlimited access for less than $10 a month. The details, along with Wal-Mart's plans to prosper in an economic downturn, were disclosed at the annual shareholders' meeting of Wal-Mart Stores in Fayetteville, Ark., yesterday. 
Wal-Mart's service, called Wal-Mart Connect, will be based on AOL's CompuServe platform. "Our aim is to bring more of our customers online to provide them with affordable accessibility," said Cynthia Lin, a company spokeswoman, in an interview after the meeting. Walmart.com had announced the alliance with AOL in December 1999, and originally planned to roll it out in the first part of 2000. Ms. Lin said that the site's redesign and a new technology platform had caused the delay.

HEADLINE: Leaving Small Businesses Behind 

BYLINE:  By Fred P. Hochberg; Fred P. Hochberg was deputy administrator and acting administrator of the Small Business Administration from 1998 to 2001.

 BODY:
Calvin Coolidge said, "The business of America is business." George W. Bush, the first president to have an M.B.A. degree, has issued a correction. If his first budget is any indication, the business of America today is big business. Small companies and individual entrepreneurs, it seems, are somebody else's business. 
 The administration's early approach to the environment, workplace safety and antitrust regulation has given the president's corporate supporters confidence that promoting big business is Mr. Bush's top priority. Regrettably, though, Mr. Bush's pro-business agenda does not include small business. His budget slashes funding for the Small Business Administration by 40 percent. Small start-up companies, full of energy and ideas, would lose crucial support. The budget would increase fees for borrowers and lenders, and the agency would have to start charging entrepreneurs for using small-business development centers -- regional offices where thousands of businesses have been able to receive free technical assistance and financial advice. 
 During the previous administration, the S.B.A. was considered an important vehicle for bolstering the initiative and drive of entrepreneurs. Over the past eight years, the S.B.A.'s guaranteed loan program nearly doubled. It was able to provide guarantees for more of the loans that banks are reluctant to make -- long-term loans to fledgling businesses, providing longer loan maturities and lower monthly payments. During that time the agency nearly quadrupled loans to minorities and tripled the number of loans it backed for businesses run by women. We also doubled the number of women's business centers across America -- increasing the flow of capital as well as the information that helps people succeed. Women are now launching businesses at twice the national rate.
Today, as growth begins to slow, President Bush is proposing to cut this economic engine. Even as big corporations have begun to make big layoffs, the Bush budget would cripple a small agency that can help pick up the slack. The nation's 25 million small businesses, which employ more than half of the private work force, have been responsible for more than three-quarters of the 22 million jobs created in America since 1992.
Budget cuts and higher fees would only worsen the credit crunch that the Federal Reserve Board warned about in a recent report -- making loans both tougher to get and harder to afford. The Fed estimates that 45 percent of banks have already tightened lending to small businesses.
Slashing the S.B.A.'s budget would exact a cost from our economy. I think of the story of a small technology company that in 1969 secured a loan of $300,000 that was backed by an S.B.A. initiative called the Small Business Investment Company Program. It was a small but critical investment in that company's future -- and, as it turned out, in the new economy. That company was Intel.
Today, Intel pays in income taxes about twice what it takes to fund the S.B.A. for a year. Returns on a minimal investment can be huge indeed. Big businesses like America Online, Apple Computer, Staples, Outback Steakhouse and Callaway Golf started out as small ventures and needed a helping hand along the way. How are we going to develop the big businesses of this century if we don't nurture small businesses today? President Bush has said that he understands small business growth. Now he needs to show that he meant it.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Ads To Announce Mayoral Bid 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
Michael R. Bloomberg, the Republican billionaire, plans to announce his candidacy for mayor on Tuesday in a television commercial in which he introduces himself to voters and says the city cannot go back to the way it once was.
 "It's 'Hi, I'm Mike and I'm running for mayor,' " said Bill Cunningham, Mr. Bloomberg's political consultant, explaining the gist of the 60-second commercial. It is to be broadcast on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in the New York metropolitan region on Channels 2, 4, 5 and 7. As an explanation of why the political neophyte is running for mayor, Mr. Cunningham said, Mr. Bloomberg will tell viewers that "this city cannot afford to go back to the clubhouse." 
 Mr. Cunningham would say little else about any positions Mr. Bloomberg might have on education, criminal justice, housing, public health or economic development. But he did say that "we want people to know that we are going to build on the successes of the Giuliani administration" and that Mr. Bloomberg would play up his role as the only successful businessman among the mayoral candidates.
"If they want to talk about experience going into an uncertain economic time, we'll be happy to compare notes," Mr. Cunningham said, in a conference room at the sleek new "Bloomberg for Mayor" campaign headquarters on East 56th Street, where cookies, potato chips, candy and drinks are provided free to the staff. "He's the only one who in the last 35 years was working in varying economies and who in the last 20 years built a very strong company." That company, Bloomberg L.P., is to be run by subordinates during the campaign, although Mr. Bloomberg will retain ownership. 
Mr. Bloomberg did not return numerous telephone calls over the past two days for comment, making him unique among the major mayoral candidates -- four Democrats and one other Republican -- who at this point in the race are avidly seeking, rather than avoiding, media attention. 
But in a brief telephone interview last month, Mr. Bloomberg said: "I've got to learn the issues. It's a whole new education for me. I am working very hard." He also said that he had not meant to announce his candidacy last month to a gossip columnist. His "I'm running" comment, uttered at a dinner, was subsequently plastered all over the front page of The New York Post.
"I'm not going to use Liz Smith as a vehicle for an announcement, rest assured," Mr. Bloomberg said.
Now Mr. Bloomberg will use the television airwaves at an opening cost of $350,000 for the three days of broadcasting, to be supplemented by another commercial that is to go on the air over next weekend. "There will be none of that traditional balloons and bunting kind of stuff," Mr. Cunningham said. "He will speak directly to the voters."
Mr. Bloomberg's opening-day television commercial on June 5 coincides with the first day that mayoral candidates can begin circulating petitions to collect the tens of thousands of signatures necessary to get on the ballot. It is also the same day that Mr. Bloomberg's eldest daughter, Emma, is to graduate from Princeton University, meaning that he will be out of New York that day.
But Mr. Cunningham said that Mr. Bloomberg would return on Wednesday for a full day of campaign events and interviews, beginning with a gospel breakfast for the Abyssinian Development Corporation to be held at City College, part of the City University of New York. The university is chaired by Herman Badillo, the other Republican who plans to announce his candidacy for mayor next week.
"If Bloomberg announces Wednesday, I'll probably announce Thursday," Mr. Badillo said. He added that he would definitely stay in the race, even under intense pressure from Republican Party leaders and aides to Gov. George E. Pataki to clear the way for Mr. Bloomberg, who is spending millions of his $4 billion fortune on the campaign. "There were people who want me out of the race, but I am not listening," Mr. Badillo said. 
Mr. Badillo dismissed Mr. Bloomberg's television commercial as nothing more than a financial bonanza for his media consultants. "That will make sure David Garth makes a lot of money," said Mr. Badillo, referring to one of Mr. Bloomberg's political consultants who is part of the team that made the commercials.
Hank Morris, the political consultant to City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, a Democratic candidate for mayor, called Mr. Bloomberg's coming television announcement "very weird." He added, "when he talks to live people, you don't get to have 30 takes."
So far Mr. Bloomberg has not had an entirely smooth entry into the free-for-all world of New York City politics, which he acknowledged in the recent telephone interview. "The thing that has disturbed me the most is that in this business, the press questions people in politics in a different way than the business press questions people," he said. Mr. Bloomberg cited no specifics, although he has said in the past that he was hugely irritated by a reporter who asked if he was delivering meals last December to a homebound elderly couple in East Harlem as a campaign event.
"You know, you look at these people up there, this is the highlight of their day to get a meal," he said at the time.
Mr. Cunningham acknowledged that Mr. Bloomberg could have chosen his words better. "I think Mike kind of looked at it when he saw it in print and said, 'Oh, that doesn't read well,' " he said. "If some day he gets out of his car and says Bushwick instead of Williamsburg, that can blow up."
Mr. Bloomberg's plans for the weekend included having dinner in Astoria, Queens, and waiting to hear whether he would get a crucial endorsement from the Liberal Party, to be announced today. His advisers were worried that Mr. Hevesi was the favorite.

Heroes, Unarmed And Unsung

BYLINE:  By Clyde Haberman 

 BODY:
WE are hip-deep in books and movies about the glories of serving the country, with the emphasis decidedly on the Muhammad Ali of generations, the one now known as "the greatest." We have been reliving epic moments like D-Day, the flag-raising on Iwo Jima and Japan's foolish decision to declare war on Ben Affleck.
 Lost in all the honoring of military sacrifice is the fact that other forms of national service exist, also deserving of recognition but rarely getting it. For a few hours on Thursday night, this attention deficit was reduced a bit in a hall near the United Nations complex. At Unicef House, on East 44th Street, 140 people gathered to celebrate the very un-John Wayne notion that there are ways to save a foreign village other than to destroy it. 
 They were former Peace Corps volunteers and their relatives, a group capable of tossing around words like idealism and commitment without getting unduly embarrassed about being out of sync with these me-first times.
You may not have realized it, but the Peace Corps, that emblem of youthful adventure, has reached middle age. It is 40 years since President John F. Kennedy, urging dedication to "the advancement of the interests of people everywhere," sent off the first batch of volunteers to Ghana and Tanganyika, as Tanzania was known in 1961.
Since then, 162,000 Americans have worked in 135 countries as teachers, health experts, farming specialists and small-business advisers. About 4,000 of them, by official tally, have come from New York City. And some showed up the other night to tell inevitable war stories but also to get a sense of how the Peace Corps is evolving these days when America seems inwardly focused.
Not all the reminiscences came from former volunteers. One speaker was Kofi A. Boateng, born in Ghana and president of the National Puerto Rican Forum, a job-training agency in the city. (How does a Ghanaian wind up heading a Latino organization in New York? "Through circumstance," Mr. Boateng said.)
His first contact with these Americans was in 1964. "We saw some funny-looking people walking around," he said. "They were wearing loafers, shorts and some sort of bandanna."
That got a laugh. But there were serious points, too, including the corps' changing nature.
The 7,300 volunteers now working in 78 countries are older on average than their predecessors. In the 1960's, only 4 percent of volunteers were 30 and up. The figure climbed in the 1990's to 23 percent.
Increasingly, volunteers are not just well-meaning generalists with liberal-arts degrees (and bandannas) but also specialists in setting up small businesses. They have particular appeal for formerly Communist countries that welcomed the Peace Corps after the Soviet Union's collapse a decade ago. And with so many American dot-coms becoming dot-gones, officials anticipate a rise in applications from unemployed Silicon Alley types.
Forty years ago, said Charles R. Baquet 3d, the corps' acting director, the emphasis was on bricks-and-mortar projects: building factories, roads and the like. Today, he said, "the new building materials for development" are computers, access to information and a knowledge of English.
FOREIGN officials, Mr. Baquet said, are constantly telling him, "We need more English so that we can access the computers." That is so, agreed Mongolia's ambassador to the United Nations, Jargalsaikhany Enkhsaikhan. Perhaps Mongolians have a keener sense of the importance of English for success in the modern world than some American educators engaged in endless quarrels over bilingual programs.
Do volunteers get more than they give? Do they, in truth, learn a lot more from their foreign hosts than they teach? Those questions have been a source of running arguments since the corps' earliest days, when some 60's-era volunteers began viewing themselves as "the velvet glove of American imperialism."
"You do wonder what your impact is," acknowledged Dina Siber, who served in Albania in the early 90's and is president of a group of former volunteers living in New York. But she said: "Everything is so intense. It's all about learning, and the people you meet are also learning from you. It goes both ways."
Who knows? Maybe one day Hollywood will figure out that there is a movie to be spun from this intensity. It could even star Ben Affleck, though when you consider that 61 percent of today's volunteers are women, Kate Beckinsale might be a better bet.

Suicide Bombing in Tel Aviv Kills 17 and Injures Scores
A powerful bomb exploded near a crowded beachside club in Tel Aviv, killing at least 17 people and injuring scores, Israeli officials said. The nighttime blast was the most deadly terror attack since the eruption of Israeli-Palestinian violence last fall. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon scheduled a meeting for this morning with senior government ministers, who could lift a limited unilateral cease-fire against retaliatory attacks. A1

After more than a week of shuttle diplomacy by the new American emissary to the Mideast, William J. Burns, there is little belief in Washington that talking to Israeli and Palestinian leaders at this point will help lessen the violence. A6

McCain Playing Host To Democrats' Leader
Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican expected to be a critical power broker with the Senate under Democratic control, is spending the weekend at his vacation home with the leader of the opposition, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota. Mr. McCain's senior aides continued to say he had no plans to change parties or become an independent, but a close working relationship between Mr. McCain and Mr. Daschle could pose problems for President Bush. A1

Military Discharges of Gays Up
The number of gays discharged from the military rose by 17 percent in 2000, to 1,212, the most since the Clinton administration's "don't ask, don't tell" policy began in 1994. Advocates for those discharged said the increase reflected the Pentagon's failure to admit or crack down on the mistreatment of gays. A9

Networks Keep Vote System
The major television news organizations have decided to retain their associations with Voter News Service, the polling consortium that they blamed for supplying bad data on election night last year, but changes in procedures will be made. A8

Test Didn't Include Right Rifle
A simulation that helped lead an independent inquiry to conclude that F.B.I. agents did not fire their guns in their siege of the Branch Davidian compound eight years ago never tested the type of rifle that the agents had there, an official said. A14

Youth Leaves Barricaded Home
One of the youths holed up in their Idaho house was taken into protective custody by the authorities after he went to a neighbor's house, officials said. The authorities said they hoped that the 15-year-old boy, Benjamin McGuckin, would help persuade his five siblings to come out. A8

American employers, especially manufacturers, continued to cut jobs in May, though at a slower pace than in the previous two months.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Andy Borowitz ("I Am Set for Life," Op-Ed, May 31) ridicules the $600 tax rebate that the average American family will receive this year. 
To many families, this is a real boon; but for everyone this is $600 more that they themselves can decide what to do with. Excessive taxation causes inflation, as the government spends this "easy money" on programs and contracts that are all too willing to soak up the funds. 
 Ronald Reagan asserted that taxes should hurt. America has been hurt by the Clinton tax increases, and President Bush and Congress are on target in reducing that burden.

HEADLINE: The Contradictions of Bush's China Policy 

BYLINE:  By John W. Lewis; John W. Lewis is professor emeritus at the Stanford Center for International Security and Cooperation.

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif. 

 BODY:
In reorienting American foreign and defense policy, the Bush administration is in danger of replacing a workable China policy with an unstable and unworkable one. Partly as an unintended consequence, but mostly by design, the administration's actions have appeared to cast Beijing as America's enemy. The expanded arms sales to Taiwan, rhetoric that enlarges the commitment to defend the island, the thinly disguised decision to make Chinese missiles a target of revised missile defense plans, the proposed shift in defense strategy from Europe to the Pacific and the call for new long-range weapons to counter China's military power have come in stunning procession. President Bush's support for trade with China cannot by itself neutralize the antagonism that Beijing leaders clearly sense.
 Mr. Bush's strategic policy is based on a serious internal contradiction. One premise maintains that China is a rising power whose interests and objectives conflict with our own and whose ambitions require immediate and long-term containment. Yet the policy also presumes that China is unable to meet a forceful American challenge. The first premise exaggerates the political weight of the hard-liners; the second miscalculates the range of Beijing's options and the importance of national pride. Both premises ignore the positive and impressive changes in China over the past two decades. 
 Beijing, it should be said, has made it easy for the administration to be tougher in its China policy. The growing and dreary list of Americans and others currently detained by China, its deployment of greater numbers of missiles opposite Taiwan, and the vitriolic rhetoric of some of its officials and media against American "global designs" have conveniently made Mr. Bush's policy shift seem more tenable.
The administration's policy plays into the hands of Beijing's hard-liners just as China's political succession begins. The hard-liners denounce "any further appeasement" of Washington. They oppose military-to-military exchanges as a plot to expose China's secrets and to intimidate by comparison. Their resistance to reduced military budgets and influence is legendary, and their demands for a slowdown in economic restructuring have intensified. Most of all, they have assailed a basic plank in China's reform platform: improved and stable relations with America. The Bush administration, by abandoning a difficult but workable approach that has balanced discord and agreement, now risks stumbling into a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
The consequences of increased hostility between China and the United States are not hard to imagine. Beijing is likely to work to enhance its authority with governments that are concerned about American high-handedness. It will act more aggressively to thwart American influence in the United Nations and to blunt our efforts to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons. Current arenas of Sino-American cooperation -- counterterrorism and work to fight drug trafficking and crime -- could wither. And hopes for promoting regional stability and peace on the Korean Peninsula would fade.
None of this need happen. The vast majority of Americans and Chinese do not regard each other as enemies, and most Americans embrace a future in which the two nations respect each other and, where it counts, cooperate. The Bush administration's caution in moving too quickly toward a "strategic partnership" is sensible. There will always be some degree of competition between our two countries, given the differences in our political systems and living standards. Moreover, we will continue to disagree over resolution of the Taiwan issue. Yet wise leaders can manage those disagreements. Power and wisdom are not adversaries.
China is already engaged in an accelerating process of change, and only a renewed cold war could threaten that progress. The revolution in communications and the globalization of ideas have reshaped many nations, and the impact on China has been profound. The hard-liners there know that the Chinese people, not they, will chart the nation's course, though they can distort it. The realists in China also know this. They would work with an American government that pursued a China policy based on an informed understanding of the historic transformations now under way -- and on whose tide we ride together.

HEADLINE: Ford May Reshuffle Management in Wake of Tire Problems 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 1 

 BODY:
Struggling to regain control of tire problems in Ford Explorers that have tarnished the image of the Ford Motor Company, the company plans to announce a reshuffling of senior management, possibly as soon as next week, people close to Ford Motor's leaders said today.
 The reshuffle will be done with several goals, these people said. Ford's board wants Jacques Nasser, the chief executive, to share some of his responsibilities with other executives, instead of having nearly two dozen executives report to him directly as he tries to play a role in many of their decisions. William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman of the company, wants to have some of the executives now reporting to Mr. Nasser also report to him, so as to increase Mr. Ford's knowledge of what is going on in the company. 
 Finally, Mr. Ford and the board want Mr. Nasser and the rest of Ford's management to pay more attention to quality. Mr. Nasser and many of his top lieutenants held a lengthy meeting today to discuss quality with Ron Gettelfinger, the vice president for Ford issues at the United Automobile Workers union, people close to the company said.
A report two weeks ago by J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive consulting firm, concluded that the average quality of Ford vehicles had fallen behind that of General Motors and DaimlerChrysler vehicles last year, and well behind the quality of Toyota Motor vehicles.
Jason Vines, a Ford spokesman, declined to comment on the company's plans.
In a separate development, the outside directors of Ford's board have been pursuing an independent review of the company's handling of the tire problems with the help of a Washington law firm, people close to the company said. The directors initially retained the law firm last autumn to review whether they had any liability in shareholder lawsuits filed against Ford and its directors last autumn, but the inquiry is now focusing more on management's decisions.
There were also signs today that Ford's plan to spend $3 billion to replace 13 million Firestone Wilderness AT tires on Explorers and other Ford sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks could become even more expensive.
Mr. Gettelfinger plans to ask Ford to exclude the $3 billion charge when the company calculates profit-sharing payments to workers at the end of this year, although Mr. Gettelfinger did not raise the subject during today's meeting on quality, two people close to the union said today. The U.A.W.'s contract with Ford calls for the exclusion of "extraordinary" costs in the calculation of profit-sharing checks, which averaged $6,700 a worker in 2000.
If Ford were to agree to such a request by the U.A.W., it would probably cost the company several hundred million dollars under the complicated profit-sharing formula. Mr. Nasser said last week that the company had not yet calculated the precise cost.
Mr. Gettelfinger declined to comment today on his plans, while Nick Sharkey, a Ford spokesman, said that the company had not yet been contacted.

HEADLINE: Pipeline Fees In California Are Discussed 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1 

 BODY:
The El Paso Corporation's pipeline system might have delivered more gas to California in the last year if it had charged less for capacity on the line, a company executive said at a public hearing today.
 Owners of interstate pipeline companies like El Paso charge shippers a fee for moving gas on their lines. In previous years, El Paso had discounted fees for temporary space on its pipelines to California, allowing shippers to take advantage of short-term differences in gas prices between regions. But capacity prices were not discounted last year, which may be why the pipeline was not full, even as demand surged. 
 The El Paso executive, John Somerhalder, president of the pipeline unit, testified at a hearing of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission held in Washington.
A Federal Energy Regulatory judge is examining accusations that the pipeline unit, El Paso Natural Gas, sold more than one billion cubic feet of pipeline capacity into California to its merchant energy subsidiary, which then is said to have withheld gas shipments to drive up prices.
The California Public Utilities Commission, PG&E's Pacific Gas and Electric, and Edison International's Southern California Edison brought charges of market manipulation against El Paso after the average price of gas in California surged above levels in other markets.
"I don't know what level of discounting would have increased flow," Mr. Somerhalder said during cross-examination. "We had made the decision not to discount it."
El Paso was negotiating to sell capacity under long-term contracts at the time and did not want short-term agreements to interfere with sales of higher-priced long-term contracts, he said.
California regulators argue that El Paso typically would have discounted the price for capacity to make additional revenue when its pipelines to the state were not full. 
"If El Paso discounted transmission, it would have made economic sense to ship" more gas to California, said Harvey Morris, a lawyer for the California Public Utility Commission.

 Fast-Talking Dames
By Maria DiBattista.
Illustrated. 365 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $27.95.
 The screwball comedy of the 1930's has been lucky in its interpreters. Stanley Cavell, Elizabeth Kendall, James Harvey have written illuminating books about it; Pauline Kael, Parker Tyler, Manny Farber, James Agee have shed light. Is it really surprising that this most verbal of film genres should have compelled the interest of our most sophisticated film critics? Besides, these movies are so much fun to think about, to write about -- to watch! 
The iconic movies of the genre -- It Happened One Night," "The Awful Truth," "The Lady Eve," "His Girl Friday," "Bringing Up Baby," "My Man Godfrey," "The Thin Man," "Ninotchka" among them -- form a particularly loved and admired pantheon. But what do they have in common? No two of them star the same actress -- they feature Claudette Colbert, Irene Dunne, Barbara Stanwyck, Rosalind Russell, Katharine Hepburn, Carole Lombard, Myrna Loy and Greta Garbo -- and only Howard Hawks directed more than one of them. True, three of the heroines are heiresses (the Depression was big on heiresses), but one is an adventuress, two are already married, one is a reporter, one a Communist apparatchik. 
What these films have in common, of course, is satisfied romance -- the right woman ends up with the right man. But that's true, too, of other forms of comedy, as well as of weepers and musicals, even westerns. The thesis of Maria DiBattista's "Fast-Talking Dames" is that the special invention of 30's comedy is the verbal sass of its female characters. In other words, it's the wit, the speed, the freedom peculiar to the way these women talk that set them apart from the vamps and victims and hoydens of the silent period, that reflect the new economic and social realities of the era, and that -- most important of all -- lead to generous and happy unions within marriage. Good talk, in other words, leads to good sex -- in fact, is a requisite for it. (This is a lesson we've already been taught by Shakespeare's romantic comedies. It is his Rosalind and Viola and Beatrice -- as well as Congreve's Millamant, and Austen's Elizabeth Bennet -- who are the original fast-talking dames.) 
Indeed, DiBattista cleverly suggests: "We can confirm the Shakespearean lineage of the fast-talking dame's rhetorical virtuosity by remarking her skill in the 'seven degrees' of dramatic reply cataloged by Touchstone in 'As You Like It.' . . . Retort courteous -- Myrna Loy; quip modest, Irene Dunne and Claudette Colbert; reply churlish, Ginger Rogers, who also scores with reply valiant; counterattack quarrelsome, Katharine Hepburn . . . lie circumstantial, Carole Lombard . . . and lie direct, the specialty of the great female con artist, Barbara Stanwyck." The strongest sections of "Fast-Talking Dames" are those that anatomize these beautiful and charming -- and voluble -- women, and their equals in looks and spirit, Jean Harlow and Jean Arthur.
It's particularly gratifying to see justice done to Harlow, "so explosive yet disarming in her sexual candor that the only way to restrain her is to yoke her to a sentimental myth that she is at heart a one-woman man whose greatest desire is to get married and stay married. . . . Wisecracks are her sexual armor, but they are open to counterattack." And to follow the subtle comparisons to Lombard, whose "comic response to her predicaments is more rambunctious than raffish." Lombard herself is "the great pretender," whose characters "flourish in that most hilarious but difficult of dramatic forms perfected by Wilde -- the trivial comedy for serious people." Ginger Rogers? Her "purity is less sexual than existential. It's her independence, hard-won, more than her chastity, easily defended after all, that she fights ardently to preserve." Myrna Loy? "The most companionable of modern women -- witty, unaffectedly but unmistakably intelligent and reliably good-humored." Jean Arthur, mentor to both Mr. Deeds and Mr. Smith? "With her proletarian savvy and wry, throaty humor," she "makes a sympathetic heroine for comedies with class politics on their mind." Brief quotation can do only partial justice to the loving acuity with which DiBattista considers this band of admirable women, who give as good as they get, if not a great deal more. 
It is the triumph of confident articulation that sets these comedies and their heroines apart and turns them into a genre. And this is true even of an anomalous movie like "Stage Door," which has no Mr. Right (and therefore no Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper or William Powell) to engage with its two heroines. "Stage Door" is in essence a female buddy film, whose resolution gives us Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers falling not in love but into friendship -- after a class war (and a war of words) as sharp as that in any of the more conventional comedies about heiresses being taught basic values by working men, or rich guys falling for working girls, or rocky marriages straightening themselves out. You could say that Hepburn gives Rogers class and Rogers gives Hepburn heart, but neither of them has to learn how to give lip. In one of our own day's most successful romantic comedies, "Pretty Woman," Richard Gere gives Julia Roberts all that money can buy and she teaches him how to feel, but does either of them say anything you can remember? 
Maria DiBattista is a professor of English and comparative literature at Princeton, and heads its film studies committee. Her literary background enriches her view of film, with its apt references to Tocqueville, Calvino, James, Kundera, Baudelaire, Congreve, Barthes, et al., and on the whole she can be congratulated on avoiding academic-speak. She's also persuasive in her contention -- not, I'm relieved to say, presented polemically -- that "when film found its human voice, it simultaneously gave to the American woman, as performer and heroine, a chance to speak her mind, to have a real, not just a presumptive, say in her own destiny." But when her book veers from its announced topic, the dame herself, into extended analysis of certain key films, one can't help hearing the voice of the professor. Are these later chapters -- on "Bringing Up Baby," "The Awful Truth," "Ninotchka," "His Girl Friday" and "The Lady Eve" -- reworked lectures or a reworked Ph.D. thesis? It wouldn't be a crime if they were, but there's a noticeable change of tone. The earlier sections of the book are written in a voice far closer to the voices in "Baby," "Friday" and "Eve" than the one that tells us: " 'The Awful Truth' gives one last glimpse of sexual desire in which the aroused human being, through a process of comic displacement and diminishment, is reduced to a clockwork mechanism, disappearing into the entrails of time. Henri Bergson's philosophical view of comedy as one response to the spectacle of human automatism has never been so vividly 'demonstrated.' " The focus changes too: the discussion of "Bringing Up Baby," for instance, is centered on Hawks, the director, and Grant, the hero, far more than on fast-talking Hepburn, who is hardly characterized here.
As for "Ninotchka," DiBattista is well aware of the incongruity of placing Garbo -- There was nothing hurried in her speech," which is putting it mildly -- among the fast-talking dames. Yet the clever analysis of the film justifies her inclusion. And remember: her delayed debut in sound, "Anna Christie," was brilliantly promoted with the phrase "Garbo talks"; from the beginning, the question of Garbo's speech was crucial. In the course of "Ninotchka," her speech, at first flat and dry, subtly modulates, warms, sexualizes. She may never talk fast, but it is through her talk, as much as by her iconic face, that we discover her. And then, famously, "Garbo laughs." Most 30's heroines have to learn what, or whom, they really want, and the back and forth of conversation helps them learn it. But Ninotchka has to learn who she really is, and it's laughter, more basic even than speech, that reveals her to herself and to us. 
"Fast-Talking Dames," handsomely produced though carelessly copy-edited and proofread, is filled with insights into films and actors, although in its eagerness to elaborate its thesis it overrates such films as the limp "It's a Wonderful World" (Colbert and James Stewart) and the ghastly "The Bride Came C.O.D." (James Cagney and Bette Davis; you can't get a whole lot less funny than that!) It is also valuable as an example of the kind of professional criticism we can now begin to take for granted as distinguished members of the academy address movies with a seriousness previously reserved for literature. 
But this raises the question of just how much seriousness these movies can support. Can "Bringing Up Baby" sustain the weight of attention we bring to "Middlemarch," say, or to "The Winter's Tale"? Occasionally, DiBattista slides into over-interpretation -- you sense that there's less here than meets her eye. Yet movies have become our basic cultural coin -- the one subject everyone can talk to everyone else about, regardless of age or circumstance. Fifty years ago, conversational chasms could be bridged by the question -- it became a cliche -- Read any good books lately?" Today's "Seen any good movies lately?" is the no-fail equivalent: everyone either has or hasn't, and is happy to tell you about it. We shouldn't be surprised, then, that movies have found their way into the curriculum, just as fiction did during the last century. And we shouldn't be surprised when professors of literature choose to anatomize a "Bringing Up Baby." They may at times overthink, but at least they're thinking hard, and -- as critics are meant to do -- they're showing us things we didn't see for ourselves.

 ROLAND PENROSE
The Friendly Surrealist: A Memoir.
By Antony Penrose.
Illustrated. 192 pp. New York:
Prestel/National Galleries of Scotland. $35.
 Artists are too busy to keep art in motion. Someone else has to organize exhibitions, pay for them and write the criticism. Someone else has to give the parties at which artists mingle. Someone else has to lure the poets to painters' favorite cafes and to rent the seaside houses where the best work gets done. Someone else has to seduce beautiful women so painters can use them as models, and someone else has to manage the press.
For Britain in the 20th century, that someone else was Sir Roland Penrose, the counterpart to the Americans Gertrude Stein, Peggy Guggenheim, Elsa Maxwell and Alfred Barr. Penrose was an artist of some accomplishment, but his art is less significant than his life. He was the first Briton to champion Picasso; he was one of Picasso's early collectors; and he became the author of the first biography of Picasso. He and a partner bought the London Gallery and in it organized the first Surrealist exhibit in Britain. He supported Max Ernst and Man Ray before they were anyone and wrote a classic biography of Miro. He and Herbert Read established the Institute of Contemporary Arts and Penrose dipped endlessly into his bottomless pockets to pull it out of perennial financial crisis. He put together one of the world's great private art collections. During World War II, as Captain Penrose of the Eastern Command Camouflage School, he recruited a battalion of artists -- including the painter John Lake and the designer Oliver Messel -- to work on disguise.
He had four gifts: money, enthusiasm, eccentricity and an excellent eye; and he was generous with all of them. He was constantly getting everyone else going -- serving as the engine behind the work of others. Eccentricity, a form of originality, may be valuable to any artist, but it was particularly valuable to someone who defined himself as a Surrealist and took instruction from Andre Breton. As for his eye: he knew at a glance which artists were great and wasted little time on those who were not.
"Roland Penrose: The Friendly Surrealist," is a curious and pleasing memoir by Roland's son Antony. It is perhaps most fascinating in its account of how Roland, who was brought up a Quaker in a strict, even puritanical, household, banished social convention from his own life. As a student at Cambridge, he had an extravagant amorous relationship with another man. For the rest of his life, he was perpetually entangled with beautiful women. His first wife, Valentine, was a bizarre lesbian poet who suffered from "some undefined mental disorder" and had a painfully undersized vagina that prevented penetrative intercourse. His second wife, the American model and photojournalist Lee Miller, posed for many Picasso portraits, including several versions of "L'Arlesienne." Between and during marriages, Penrose shared his bed with the wives of several friends, as well as with a dazzling array of exotic women, including a trapeze artist and bear trainer from a local circus, to whom he proposed several times.
He remained on good terms with old lovers and was fond of the lovers he encouraged his wives to take. By the time his son was growing up, he included in his household his first and second wives, sometimes his second wife's primary lover, sometimes her first husband -- and always with visitors for the sake of variety in an unusually elaborate menage. Roland and Lee, though capable of jealousy, could also express tenderness by choosing lovers for each other (they did it often). As they went separate ways during a 1938 European rail trip, for instance, Lee passionately kissed Roland goodbye and "pointed out a pretty French girl on the train whom she felt should console Roland. As the train rolled through the night, the girl, who had been much aroused by the sight of the amorous farewell, turned Roland's journey to Munich into an erotic encounter." Later, Roland lived contentedly with Lee and her lover David Scherman, whose pajamas he was just mildly annoyed to find under his pillow. In fact he once wrote to Lee. "Darling, I'm so glad Dave's home again, hang on to him as long as you can."
In spite of all this, Penrose picked up many accessories of normality by aristocratic default. While championing and helping out his friends, he ended up with a major art collection; seeking calm isolation, he established a bohemian but desirable country seat. And, of course, the primary relic of his normality is the son he had with Lee Miller, Antony, to whom we owe this oddly detached book. 
Roland "shunned emotional involvement" and chose "to redefine love as an intellectual exercise." Nowhere is this more true than in his relationship with his son. About himself and his mother, Antony says, "Being born a baby was inevitable and risky, as Lee was an avowed child-hater." She was an alcoholic through most of Antony's life, and she was also so involved in whatever she was doing that she consumed whoever was near her; indeed one of her lovers said that "being part of her creative process was like feeding his brain through a meat grinder." As she grew older and drunker, she became, for all her glamour and brilliance, violent, nasty, abusive and often cruel; for many years her son deplored her. Roland Penrose also found Lee impossible and made every attempt to flee the house, his wife and his son, manifesting thus a cowardice for which his son resented him.
Antony Penrose writes like someone telling stories at a party, sometimes rambling on rather tiresomely with irrelevant details but often telling wonderful stories whose charm may be quite independent of their relevance. He also has a capacity for ripe writing, as when he describes Valentine: "She had an arcane connection to the primordial elements of female creativity: she understood the secrets of the stars, the ways of animals and the intimate lives of plants. Astrological charts were her street maps, and her Tarot cards gave her insights into the future." His metaphors go mad; Surrealism is "the movement that unknown to him was incubating somewhere across town like a clutch of reptile's eggs buried in the fertile decaying matter of the Dada movement."
About his father's sexual proclivities he is disarmingly straightforward; Valentine found it exciting when Roland tied her to a pine tree, he says, but was very annoyed when she had trouble removing the resin from her skin. Later he describes a gift Roland gave Lee, "a pair of real handcuffs made from gold, signed Cartier. Lee was ecstatic. . . . She wore both the handcuffs on the same wrist as a chic bracelet by day, always ready to gratify Roland's desire by snapping one on the other wrist."
Antony Penrose evokes a very high life with that synthetic lightness that can be achieved only by those who are completely at ease in such a life. His book is frequently hilarious, as when it tells of Salvador Dali giving a lecture in a diving suit, sealed to protect him as he plumbed the depths of his subconscious. When the helmet was tightly closed it created an air lock; Dali began to suffocate and would have died if Roland and a friend had not been able to pry it open with a billiard cue. The effect of Antony Penrose's style is to make you feel that you knew Roland Penrose, that you were part of his charmed circle. His book is not so much a biography as a social introduction.
Part of what is interesting about the writing is that it is of a piece with Roland Penrose's art. It is not breathtaking and it is not really very original, but if one doesn't make huge demands on it, its eccentricity can be very winning. It never achieves the brilliance of its influences; it is never at the level of Picasso, Dali, de Chirico, Magritte, Miro, Tanguy -- but it is a manifestation of character, evidence of a mind forever active, deeply striving and ultimately unconventional. Roland Penrose was not as intelligent or as gifted as his friends, but very few people are as intelligent or as gifted as his friends were. What he did have is a certain freedom that most of the people around him lacked; that freedom seems in retrospect to have been a species of integrity. It is most attractive, and Antony Penrose has captured it well. He quotes the sculptor Kenneth Armitage, who wrote: "You know the vulgarity of a lot of the art world? Well, Roland was never going to exploit me or use me. He stands out as one of the best people I've met."

HEADLINE: Royal Splendor in the Deep South 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER MOSES; JENNIFER MOSES, who lives in Baton Rouge, La., writes frequently about the South.

 BODY:
THOUGH Jackson, Miss., might not be everybody's idea of a highbrow kind of town, the city has drawn some 825,000 visitors over the past six years to two blockbuster art exhibitions and is currently playing host to a third, "The Majesty of Spain: Royal Collections from the Museo del Prado and Patrimonio Nacional." The idea of bringing 18th-century royal treasures to pokey old Jackson may seem, on first glance, to be a bit of a stretch; after all, most people (at least those who live north of the Mason-Dixon line), when they think of Jackson at all, think more along the lines of Eudora Welty or the state's recent vote to keep the Confederate battle symbol on its flag than of Goya tapestries. 
 "The Majesty of Spain," running through Sept. 3 at the Mississippi Arts Pavilion in downtown Jackson, is billing itself as "the largest array of Spanish royal treasures ever exhibited in North America." A total of $9.8 million, including state, city, corporate and private funds, and a whole lot of international shmoozing, Southern style, went into the launching of this exhibition. It features more than 600 royal objects, including 60 paintings from the Prado in Madrid, many of which have never been exhibited outside Spain, and re-creations of five royal rooms, including a $780,000 replica of the Porcelain Room at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez. 
 Not surprisingly, "The Majesty of Spain" is the centerpiece -- if not the alpha and omega -- of the Jackson Convention and Visitors Bureau's current promotional efforts, "The Enlightenment Series 2001." Evidence can be seen just about everywhere you look, from the street banners and Spanish flags that flutter throughout downtown Jackson, to the table tents with information about the exhibition at area restaurants. Not to mention the bureau's redesigned Web site (www.visitjackson.com), where visitors can virtually browse through some of the highlights on display in the pavilion.
But "Majesty" isn't the only Spanish attraction in town; indeed, Spain (or at least Spanish culture) seems to have reconquered whole swaths of Jackson. Other "Enlightenment Series" offerings with Spanish themes include "Mississippi: Outpost of Majestic Spain," an exhibition at the Old Capitol Museum of Mississippi History tracing Spanish influence in the region from before Hernando De Soto's explorations in the 1540's through Spain's imperial rule in the late 1700's. "Islamic Moorish Spain: Its Legacy to Europe and the West," is running through Oct. 31 at the International Museum of Muslim Cultures, and the Mississippi Museum of Art is exhibiting paintings and bronze sculptures by Salvador Dali through Sept. 2.
"The entire town has been energized by 'The Majesty of Spain' exhibit," said Dee Gardner, communications coordinator for the visitors bureau. By the middle of last month, "The Majesty of Spain" had drawn 200,000 visitors to Jackson -- primarily within a 500-mile radius -- and hopes are high that with the peak summer travel season attendance will climb even higher.
Exhibitions like the one on royal Spain are largely the brainchild of Jack Kyle, the charming, talkative and somewhat iconoclastic executive director of the nonprofit Mississippi Commission for International Cultural Exchange created in 1994 specifically to organize international fine arts exhibitions.
The 1996 show "Palaces of St. Petersburg: Russian Imperial Style" brought 554,000 people through Jackson and had an economic impact of more than $61 million. "Splendors of Versailles," in 1998, which ran for five rather than six months, brought in only 271,000 people but still generated around $41 million for the state.
As one example of the spinoff, Donna Dye, director of the Old Capitol Museum, said that during the St. Petersburg exhibition, attendance at the museum increased almost 90 percent. And Dan Blumenthal, chef and co-owner of Bravo! Restaurant, said that by early April this year, the restaurant (which has added several Spanish dishes in honor of the exhibition) had already fed entire busloads of people, mostly retirees, who had come to town to ogle the art of Bourbon Spain.
Even on opening day in March, before the buses filled with elderly visitors began to roll in, the city's tourism efforts seemed to have paid off. Outside the pavilion, a temporary court house refitted to serve as exhibition space, television news vans lined the block. Inside, Spanish-speaking TV reporters solemnly intoned into the cameras against a backdrop of paintings of long-dead Bourbon kings, while around the corner, Mississippi school groups from as far away as Natchez to the west and Columbus to the east awaited entry. They were attended to by a swarm of volunteers (some 1,100 in all, who work on a rotating basis).
All Mississippi public school teachers have been given a 94-page teacher's guide to the exhibition, and discounted tickets are available to school groups. As William Stevens, founder and chairman of the cultural exchange commission, put it: "We don't just want to bring people to Jackson, although we certainly want to do that, too. We also want to educate our own citizens."
IF the exhibition's combination of room re-creations with displays of royally owned objects and fine art might strike more sophisticated museumgoers as being a tad hokey -- as if Walt Disney had gone on a shopping trip with Dali -- it seems practically guaranteed to elicit oohs and aahs from those of us who haven't recently visited the Prado or, for that matter, the Metropolitan Museum in New York. And if you think you can't recreate the ornate neo-Classical Sculpture Gallery of the Casita del Labrador at Aranjuez (the one with the Roman busts, marble floor and vaulted ceilings that was designed for King Carlos IV) in a building that seems organized around the design concept of lowered ceilings, you're wrong.
"People just love to see stuff -- furnishings, clocks, decorative objects, candelabra -- and the Spain exhibit, like the St. Petersburg one, is just filled with it," Ms. Gardner of the visitors bureau explained. "The Versailles exhibit had more paintings, but we're expecting the Spanish exhibit to be as popular as the St. Petersburg exhibit, maybe more."
Thus -- as if in response to America's love of bric-a-brac -- there are also 17 royal clocks, a fantastic, gilded 17th-century gondola (which was restored at a cost of $100,000), King Fernando VII's 1832 bronze and jewel-encrusted carriage, portraits of four Bourbon kings and their wives, letters from George Washington to King Carlos III, and a banquet hall set for a royal dinner party. Not to mention the recreated Porcelain Room, with its walls and ceiling depicting Chinese figures, flowering vines, birds, monkeys, fruits and dragons -- the handiwork of more than 50 Spanish artisans working for more than a year, who duplicated the original room in Spain and then shipped it, in pieces, to Jackson, where it was reassembled.
"That room alone required 11,000 screws," Mr. Kyle said, adding, "The Spanish themselves have told us that some of these objects look better here than they ever did in Spain." There's also an astounding collection of Goya tapestries displayed alongside the painted "cartoons" that served as their models.
According to Alvaro Fernandez-Villaverde, the Duke of San Carlos, who, as president of the Patrimonio Nacional, described himself as "the housekeeper to the royal family," Mr. Kyle happened to be at the right place with the right idea at the right time: the Prado was renovating one of its wings, and much of its collection was not being shown.
"It's not an original idea," the duke said. "Other museums have come to us, but they didn't come with as generous an offer or with a reason for the government to support the project. But what Jack offered was not only a historical connection between Spain and Mississippi, but also money to restore things."
The question remains: why Jackson? Why this particular somewhat sleepy city of no more than 250,000, in a state better known as the birthplace of the blues? After all, although Jackson is safe, clean and charming -- its downtown filled with architecturally distinguished buildings and more churches than you can count -- and its citizens are almost unfailingly courteous, the city is hardly a world capital. However, as the duke pointed out, there is a historical connection: Mississippi was once part of Spanish territory.
The real story, though, goes back to the early 1990's, when the first lady of Mississippi at the time, Pat Fordice, met members of a Russian choir from St. Petersburg that was touring the United States and invited one of them to sing on the steps of the State Capitol on the National Day of Prayer. She learned that the city of St. Petersburg was in dire need of medical supplies of all sorts, and "it just nagged at me," Mrs. Fordice said during a telephone interview. "So I called up my friend Buck Stevens -- he was then the chairman of the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy -- and Buck just took the ball and ran with it."
Some months later, largely through the efforts of Mr. Stevens (who had enlisted other prominent citizens), the people of Jackson had rounded up millions of dollars worth of medical supplies, including a CAT scan donated by G.E., organized an airlift, and sent representatives to St. Petersburg.
In turn, the people of St. Petersburg wanted to do something for Jackson, leading to the creation of the cultural exchange commission, with Mr. Stevens as chairman. Shortly thereafter, in the spring of 1994, Mr. Kyle -- then working for the Wonders International Cultural Series in Memphis -- was recruited to act as executive director. He went to St. Petersburg, looked around, and asked if he might import a few of its choicest treasures -- more than 600 of them, including portraits of czars, czarinas, grand dukes and duchesses, Peter the Great, and the 1797 throne of Czar Paul I -- so that the folks back home could get a good look at them.
That the 50-year-old Mr. Kyle, an affable and hugely energetic man, does not in fact have a typical museum director's resume may partly account for his success in importing what he called "scholarly cohesiveness coupled with broad appeal." Indeed, Mr. Kyle is a home-grown boy from Minter City, Miss., with a degree in music from Delta State University, and his background at the Wonder Series was largely in public relations, which seems reasonable, given how articulate, charming and persuasive he is -- like an old-time Southern politician whom you intend not to like but wind up voting for anyway.
"You know," he said, "the Spanish gave me nearly everything I asked for." This sentiment was echoed by the Duke of San Carlos, who said: "Every time Jack walked into my office the project got bigger."
What next? The last time I spoke to him, Mr. Kyle confided that King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain had visited during the last weekend of March. Jackson still doesn't have a Ritz Carlton or a Four Seasons to accommodate such distinguished visitors, but ever since "Palaces of St. Petersburg" drew half a million visitors, almost 2,000 of its hotel rooms have been renovated to the tune of approximately $35 million, and some 1,000 rooms have been added, bringing the total to 5,700.
At the 24-suite Old Capitol Inn, which offers a package that includes two tickets to both the "The Majesty of Spain" and the Museum of Art, the Spanish exhibition, like the previous ones, has been a boon for business -- with guests from as far away as California and Maine. "I'd have to say business is up 75 percent over last spring," said Sue Moffat, the manager. "And people are calling us from all over the country."
You can even smell the changes in downtown Jackson, where thousands of flowers in the royal colors of red and yellow have been planted in and around public buildings, in parks, and along walkways. Chances are that other royal colors will succeed these -- for the next exhibition, coming, perhaps, from England, or Scandinavia, or Germany. Who knows? The whole world's a treasure chest.
"The Majesty of Spain" exhibition runs through Sept. 3 at the Mississippi Arts Pavilion, Lamar at Court Streets, Jackson, (601)-960-9900;www.majestyofspain.com. Hours are 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, with the last tour at 8. Timed tickets, $15 for general admission, are available through Ticketmaster, (877) 709-2639, which adds a service charge of $3.25 a ticket plus a handling fee of $3 for each order. General information about Jackson is available from the Jackson Convention and Visitors Bureau at (800) 354-7695 or www.visitjackson.com.

HEADLINE: The Wizard of Odds 

BYLINE:  By William Grimes; William Grimes is the chief restaurant critic of The Times.

 BODY:
Like many people, Ernie Dahlman shows up at the office around 8:45, switches on his computer and spends the rest of the day making telephone calls. His office is nondescript, and so is he: blandly handsome, of average height, with an open, friendly expression and rimless glasses that give him a mildly intellectual look. He could be a travel agent, or a stockbroker, or perhaps a real-estate agent.
 Actually he is one of the biggest horseplayers in the United States. Just how big is anyone's guess. In a busy year, Dahlman might bet as much as $18 million. Mostly he's concerned with races at tracks in New York and California, and he doesn't shy away from the big races. (He took a bath at the Kentucky Derby when Point Given failed, but he figures the horse, which rebounded to win the Preakness, looks good for the Belmont.) Dahlman bets so much money, in fact, that he has to avoid smaller tracks and certain kinds of bets because, in essence, he would be betting against himself. 
 The Suncoast Hotel and Casino, on the outskirts of Las Vegas, provides Dahlman with an office, and at this moment that's where he is, bearing down hard on the fifth race at Aqueduct. A bank of four television monitors show the action from both coasts, and his desktop computer flashes the probable payoffs on exacta bets, Dahlman's bread and butter. To cash, he must pick the first- and second-place horses in the race, in the exact order (hence the name). It's a high-risk, high-reward bet compared with win-place-or-show wagering. It pays for Dahlman's silver Corvette and his big house with a swimming pool in a gated community near the casino.
"I'm going to put a big box on the five, and do a little bit on the four, because it's a claim by Scott Lake," he says, quickly adding a column of figures with a pencil. The five is Top Bunk, a horse in sharp form that is stepping up in class from slightly softer competition and is the main threat to the horse Dahlman is keen on, Borntoberegal, which, as it happens, he owns a piece of.
A box is a kind of hedge. It's two bets in one (and twice as expensive as a straight exacta), and it lets Dahlman have things both ways. If his horse gets beat by Top Bunk, he still wins, although his net profit will be much less, of course, than if he took the risk of putting all his money on Borntoberegal in the win spot.
And Dahlman is not through. Scott Lake, a very successful trainer from Maryland, has been running horses in New York, at this point without much success. Hemisphere Dancer, which he recently "claimed," or bought out of a claiming race, in which all the horses are for sale, does not look like much. But horses in Lake's hands have been known to experience a religious conversion, and Dahlman does not want to get burned when Lake's horses start firing. (Sure enough, Lake's horses have been winning at a phenomenal rate in recent months.) After placing a $2,400 exacta, Borntoberegal on top of Top Bunk, and a $2,000 exacta the other way around, he constructs a series of defensive bets: a $600 exacta, Borntoberegal over the four horse, Hemisphere Dancer; a $600 exacta, Top Bunk over Hemisphere Dancer; and two $200 exactas, Hemisphere Dancer over those two.
Then he watches the race. Borntoberegal breaks alertly from the gate, sets reasonable fractions and pours it on in the stretch. Top Bunk chases in second. Hemisphere Dancer flattens out in the stretch and finishes sixth. The exacta pays $12, and Dahlman collects $14,000 on a $6,000 bet. It nets him roughly $8,000.
If Dahlman does not look like a gambler, he does not bet like a gambler either. At least not like any gambler I've seen in action, most of them, admittedly, losers. In the two days I watched him bet, he never put serious money on a horse with long odds. Not once did I get the vicarious thrill of seeing him hit a 20-to-1 shot or collect on a $500, $200 or even $50 exacta. He is a plodder. And he talks like one too.
"Winter is is my favorite time of year," he said cheerfully. "It's more predictable. The horses tend to be older, and you know what they're going to do. And out in Northern California it rains, and you get a lot of grass races switched to the main track, resulting in complete mismatches."
Most horseplayers love a contentious 12-horse race with the promise of three-figure exactas and monster trifectas. Not Dahlman. "Anyone who knows anything about gambling will tell you I'm not a great gambler," he says. "What I'm good at is arithmetic. I can add and subtract."
That's the truth, although not the whole truth. Dalhman is in the business of spotting opportunities and minimizing risk. He resembles nothing so much as an arbitrager or commodities trader, only his market is the racetrack and his commodity is Thoroughbreds. His workday is a series of 20-minute market analyses punctuated by 90-second races that yield, when the penciled calculations and racing luck harmonize, a steady profit.
At this point in his career -- he's 58 and has been betting seriously since his teens -- he has amassed the kind of bankroll that allows him to bet very conservatively and still live very well. He compares himself to the early and late Muhammad Ali. In his younger days, Dahlman spent 20 hours a day studying and playing the races, shooting for the moon and hitting phenomenal payoffs. Now, he says, he favors the rope-a-dope approach.
Every horseplayer can tell tales of woe. Some of them make you laugh. Read the comment lines in The Daily Racing Form next to the running line for a horse's past races, and you'll get an idea of the strange things that can happen when animals with a brain the size of a prune run at 40 miles per hour around an oval track. My favorites include "stomped duffel bag near line," "savaged foe" and "scattered geese on backstretch." I've seen horses round the far turn and head straight for a parking lot. I held a ticket on a 60-to-1 horse at Belmont that was ahead by seven lengths in midstretch when suddenly, for no reason, it ran right into the rail and sent its jockey sailing into the infield.
The point is, there's no such thing as a sure thing. Favorites win only a third of the time, an immutable racing statistic. Even successful bettors tear up more tickets than they cash. The trick is to cash enough tickets, at the right odds, to offset the losses and turn a profit. That's where addition and subtraction come in.
Of course, the addition and subtraction mean nothing without good information and a refined ability to size up a race and assign probabilities to various outcomes -- the arcane exercise known as handicapping. Dahlman thrives on information. He excels at analyzing a race based on that information, enriched by a lifetime of watching races. It's an art with just enough science to it to make it possible for a very tiny percentage of bettors to take money away from the herd of less intelligent, or less disciplined, bettors.
"I call him the logic doctor," says Chip Taylor, a buddy of Dahlman's and a songwriter whose credits include "Wild Thing" and "Angel of the Morning." Taylor dropped out of the music scene for years to bet on the horses, often with Dahlman. "I was good at analyzing pace and bias" -- the tendency of a racetrack to develop fast or slow areas -- but Ernie picked up on all sorts of things, like when a horse changed from one trainer to another, whether that was a plus or minus, and the answer was not always what you might think."
Dahlman puts it a little differently. "I'm a MOTO player," he says. "Master of the Obvious. It's just that more things are obvious to me than to most people."
Like many other professional horseplayers, Dahlman relies in part on the work of others. The Daily Racing Form gives him a compressed description of the last dozen races run by each horse entered in a race. That merits a quick glance. The more serious numbers come from "the sheets."
Published by a professional horseplayer and Marxist named Len Ragozin, they go a long way toward solving an age-old handicapping problem. By analyzing and quantifying a variety of factors, ranging from track resiliency to wind direction to the distance actually traveled by each horse, they assign a speed rating to a horse's performance.
The Ragozin sheets are shipped to Dahlman every day, overnight, and one of his rare visits to the casino floor is his daily walk past the sports-betting operation on the main floor to a little office that holds his packet of sheets. The raw speed numbers Dahlman accepts as highly accurate. Other assumptions in the sheets he rejects, like Ragozin's opinions about which horses are likely to regress, or bounce, after turning in a stellar performance. 
Dahlman also pays close attention to pace, or the time for each quarter mile of a race, which he jots down in one of two fat, spiral-bound notebooks. The other is devoted to his overriding preoccupation, horseshoes. Years ago, Dahlman began noticing something funny about horses equipped with mud calks, cleats that some trainers use for extra traction when rain turns dirt into mud. Dahlman noted that even when rain failed to materialize, a lot of horses seemed to improve several lengths when wearing mud calks for the first time.
He began keeping detailed records, and he now considers it his biggest edge. It's the reason he loves Golden Gate Fields, near San Francisco. It rains a lot there, so plenty of mediocre-seeming horses are switching to mud calks for the first time and then sneaking into exactas at good prices. A second reason for loving Golden Gate is that the track posts very detailed shoe information before each race. Not all mud shoes are created equal, in Dahlman's view. Mud nails, which turn shoes into a kind of hobnailed boot, make no difference, in his opinion. But jar calks, which have a kind of high heel, do. The New York tracks do not provide detailed shoe information, so 10 minutes before every race, the phone in Dahlman's office rings. It's a man named Gene (Dahlman professes not to know his last name), a sharp-eyed informant in New York who stands by the paddock with a pair of binoculars and relays shoe information to Dahlman.
"No one," says Chip Taylor, "has made as much money off shoes as Ernie has."
So why doesn't everyone do the same thing? Because in the handicapping game, not everyone believes the same things. Len Ragozin swears by the bounce. Many handicappers look feverishly for signs of a developing bias. Steven Crist, the editor and publisher of The Daily Racing Form and a big bettor, says that biases are greatly overrated. And so on and so on. Every successful horseplayer has his idiosyncrasies. Dahlman's is horseshoes. And if he's beating the game, who's going to tell him he's wrong?
Dahlman grew up in Patchogue, Long Island, where his father, Ernest Sr., owned a delicatessen and spent his free nights betting the trotters at Roosevelt Raceway. Ernest Jr. tagged along. In time he became fascinated by the challenge of finding patterns in the seemingly random circulation of horses around the track. Poring over old programs in his basement, he set about cracking the code.
By the end of high school, Dahlman was hooked. He made a halfhearted attempt at college, enrolling in Alfred University with the object of becoming a ceramics engineer. "It wasn't until I was 40 that I finally found out what a ceramics engineer actually is," he says. He shambled along, then transferred to Wagner College on Staten Island. He dropped out of the economics program when he realized he would eventually have to write a term paper.
His education at the harness tracks was going great, however. In 1964, the summer after he dropped out of Wagner, Dahlman created a stir when he hit a complicated bet at Yonkers Raceway called the twin double -- two linked daily doubles, or four races -- and earned a record payout for the track of $171,084.60. The local press went wild over the whiz kid with the glasses.
Dahlman went right back to the racetrack and hit the twin double the next night. "Twin Double Winner Does It Again!" shrieked the headline in The Daily News. This time, the national press jumped on the story. Time magazine featured Dahlman in its college-life section, headlining the story "Success on the Oval Campus." The New York Post hired him as its harness handicapper for $50 a week. The world lost a ceramics engineer.
"I didn't want to be a horseplayer," Dahlman says. "I know my mother was upset. But I kept making money at it. It's a ridiculous choice of occupation that's worked -- so far."
In the early 1980's, with harness racing in steep decline, Dahlman shifted his action to the Thoroughbred tracks, where he had to learn a brand-new game, one with many more variables. "It's the difference between checkers and chess," he says. Sometimes he won, sometimes he lost. But mostly he won. Even more surprisingly, in a profession populated by misfits, losers and borderline sociopaths, he managed to live a normal suburban life. He married twice and reared six children, none of them gamblers. 
He also diversified his portfolio, so to speak. Dahlman and Eugene Hauman, a childhood friend, started buying and running trotters in the 1960's and 1970's. In the early 1990's, they turned to Thoroughbreds, and in 1993 the two men became the leading owners on the New York Racing Association circuit, winning 55 races. Today, the two men own dozens of horses in partnership with Barry K. Schwartz, the chairman and chief executive officer of Calvin Klein Inc. Dahlman's daughter Jennifer Gurney manages Schwartz's 800-acre horse farm in Westchester. He pays taxes like any self-employed businessman, declaring income (winning bets) and writing off losses (losing bets). He bets somewhere between $10 million and $18 million a year. His actual income depends on racing luck. He has had losing years. But on average, he says, he earns 3 or 4 percent on his investment. In a good year, that would give him a pretax income of about $700,000. That does not include income from the horses he owns. 
Dahlman lived on Long Island until the mid-90's, when New York State racing authorities dealt him (and other big horseplayers) a stunning blow. They raised the takeout on exacta bets from 17 percent to 20 percent. Takeout is the amount that a track skims off the top of a betting pool to finance its operations. It's the hurdle that bettors must clear before they can earn a profit. The 3 percent increase represented at least $300,000 a year to Dahlman, who did his betting at a teletheater in Happauge. Dahlman did a little adding and subtracting, then took his money and moved to Las Vegas, where the casinos were famous for striking agreeable deals with big bettors. 
Dahlman settled in at the Sands. After the Sands was demolished, he switched to the Suncoast, a casino that caters to locals. His arrival was, to put it mildly, unheralded. One day, when the casino was offering free pastries to customers who signed up for a handicapping contest, Dahlman drifted over and asked if he might have a doughnut, even though he wasn't interested in the contest. No dice. Ernie Dahlman, as high a roller as walks into the casino, could not score a 50-cent freebie.
As it happens, Dahlman was mired in a slump during the two days I spent with him at the Suncoast. Consequently, he was betting light, about $40,000 a day. He lost about $7,000 the first day I watched him, and the second was no better.
There were some tough beats. Rocking Ruby, in the ninth at Aqueduct the second day, got stuck behind tiring horses, had to switch paths and by less than a length missed cracking the exacta at odds of 5 to 1. Another of Dahlman's picks was disqualified from a winning exacta after bumping a rival just steps from the finish line.
Most bettors would be chewing the carpet or throwing heavy objects at the television screen. Dahlman reacts to victory and defeat with Spock-like equanimity. Occasionally he will worry out loud. "I'd like to see the five horse closer up," he might say. Or, "Uh-oh, I'm gonna get beat." After the disqualification, he clenched a fist, glared at the screen and said softly, "Gosh DARN it." Then it was on to the next race.
"If I keep my losses at $7,000, I can sleep easily," Dahlman says. "I can get that back in one race."
The playing field is constantly changing, though. An unidentified man betting through an off-track location in North Dakota uses a computer program that searches betting pools for anomalies, then places hundreds of bets on as many as seven horses in a race in a matter of seconds. The "professor," as Dahlman calls him, places huge bets -- including $215,000 on Monarchos to win the Florida Derby -- and as far as anyone can tell, makes money (as he did on that race with Monarchos). "This guy is good," Dahlman says. "Fortunately he does not seem to bet at the same tracks I do."
A few days after leaving Las Vegas, I called Dahlman to see if he was faring any better. "I'm on fire," he said. He sounded almost apologetic about hitting the Pick Six at Aqueduct, a bet in which players must call the winners of six consecutive races. Dahlman put together a $1,000 ticket and, because the pot had swollen after no one hit the jackpot two days in a row, earned $26,000. More important, his day-in, day-out exactas were coming in. Life was back to normal.
His life, anyway. After watching Dahlman in action, I decided to apply his methods. Like many small-time bettors, I sneer at short prices, scoff at exactas paying less than $50 and never bet on a favorite. But I've been having doubts. Why not try to do it the Ernie way?
I plunked down $35 at the one Manhattan newsstand that sells the Ragozin sheets and set about deciphering the numbers for Aqueduct. The next day, I showed up at the Winner's Circle, a teletheater in Manhattan's garment district, carrying the astronomical sum of $1,000 provided by my naive employers, five times the maximum I would bet with my own money. Just carrying the cash made me nervous.
What followed was a date that will live in infamy. To test the waters, 
I organized a bet in the second race focusing on a horse, Supernal, that had scored a good sheets number in its last race, when it had raced very wide and rallied mildly for third place. I bet a $50 box using Supernal and Romantic Novel, a horse that had finished second in its last three races. As a defensive measure, I bet a $20 exacta of Miss Mickey, a horse recently transferred to the trainer James Jerkens -- and, I failed to note, wearing mud calks for the first time -- over Supernal. I also did a $10 box, Miss Mickey and Romantic Novel. Miss Mickey, the favorite at 6 to 5, broke quickly and never looked back. Supernal, at odds of about 5 to 1, closed with painful slowness to get the place spot, and Romantic Novel, as the chart for the race put it, "posed no threat." The exacta paid $18. My $20 saver gave me $180, a $30 profit on a bet of $150. I could live with that.
It was downhill from there. Near misses, wild long shots and strange tactical decisions by a few jockeys played havoc with my conservative betting strategy. Wicklow Warrior, which looked as if it could crush the competition in the fifth race, was rushed to the front and contested a hot pace, for no reason that I could see. It tired and finished next to last, taking my $220 with it. I picked a nice-priced winner in the next race, Worthy Crane, but failed to match it up with the right horse in the No. 2 slot. The exacta paid $89 for a $2 bet. I collected zilch on $250 in bets.
I discovered several things very quickly. First, adding and subtracting two minutes before a race is no small skill. I could not do it fast enough to construct a logical hedge. Second, big bets rattle me. When several hundred dollars go down the drain, I start flailing and stabbing, desperate to pull even. By the ninth and final race, I was down to about $10. The money had disappeared faster than butter hitting a hot frying pan. Third, the Dahlman method is not a method, like counting cards at blackjack. It's a lifetime of racing knowledge. And I'm too old to learn.
There was some consolation. I called Dahlman to describe the debacle. He cheerfully told me that he had lost $30,000 the same day. He could afford to laugh. He's well ahead for the year. "The first two races today," he said, "I lost $12,500, and I thought: What am I doing? Nothing is going right; why am I here?" 
Then he hit a $213 exacta at Keeneland in Kentucky that erased the deficit in the blink of an eye. "The winner was 18 to 1," he said. "When that happened, I said to myself: 'Yeah, I'm in the right place. I belong here."'

Getting New Offices by Remodeling Old Buildings

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
INSTEAD of erecting new structures, real estate investment trusts and developers in Westchester County are converting abandoned office buildings that once housed Fortune 500 companies into more marketable space.
 "Developers are getting great deals on these older office buildings and redesigning them for small and mid-sized tenants," said Salvatore Carrera, Westchester's director of economic development and real estate. "The new breed of landlord understands that to wait for the return of the large corporations of the 1980's is obsolete thinking." 
 Take, for example, the Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust based in Melville, N.Y., that overhauled a vacant hulk of a building formerly occupied by I.B.M. The building, which is at 360 Hamilton Avenue in downtown White Plains, was acquired by Reckson for $12 a square foot -- what Salvatore Campofranco, managing director of the company's Westchester division, called "a great price, off the radar screen."
Now, $50 million later, the 382,000-square-foot building is 98 percent occupied with new tenants like Merrill Lynch and Heineken USA. Annual rents are in the low $30's per square foot, far lower than Class A commercial real estate in New York City (which goes for $80 a square foot and more) or Fairfield County (from $32 to $60 a square foot, according to William V. Cuddy, managing director for Insignia/ESG in Stamford). 
Similarly, the former General Foods headquarters, located on a sprawling 39-acre campus on the outskirts of downtown White Plains, also stood empty, providing yet another example of what happened to commercial real estate during the recession of the early 1990's when the corporate giants downsized, merged and otherwise changed the economic landscape. 
The General Foods Corporation was acquired in 1985 by the Philip Morris Companies, which merged it into Kraft Foods, and the complex at North Street and Westchester Avenue had been empty since July 1997.
The Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation of Manhattan recently paid $25 million for the property, including the 600,000-square-foot office building. The company (which serves as owner, developer and leasing agent) is spending $90 million to market the complex as four distinct buildings, each entered through a towering conical marquee designed by the architect Philip Johnson. Each marquee is a different color, with the window trim on the building matching. 
In the first building, which is now 90 percent leased, the office space is being divided for tenants who need as little as 2,500 square feet, with annual rents per square foot of $27 to $30. The three other sections are still under construction.
THE developer, Charles S. Cohen, said the repositioning of the old complex for the small and midsize companies that dominate the market now "has been a right-on decision for us."
In recent months, a second generation of developers has followed suit, inspired by the success of the initial office space makeovers several years ago. "As one of the first to do this, we sent out a signal to our peer group," Mr. Campofranco said. The Reckson Metro Center, as 360 Hamilton is now known, opened late in 1999.
Another factor that continues to fuel the trend to recycle existing real estate is the county's persistently high commercial vacancy rate. Albeit down from the highs of the late 1990's (30 percent in White Plains at one point), the rate was still 13 percent countywide and 17 percent in White Plains in the first quarter of this year. What is more, the trend to remake old buildings is likely to continue for some time, Mr. Carrera observed. Texaco's 500,000-square-foot headquarters in White Plains is being marketed in anticipation of the company's takeover by Chevron. 
Unfazed by the current slowdown in the economy, the new landlords say they are hedging their bets by leasing to different types of tenants -- financial services, technology and consumer products companies, for example -- so they will not be hurt if one sector of the economy weakens.
Frank M. Boccanfuso, the managing partner of FMB Real Estate Services, which spent $9.75 million for the 122,800-square-foot RiverView at Purchase, is among the newest generation of landlords. Mr. Boccanfuso recently spent $6 million to renovate the building, located at 287 Bowman Avenue, which went into foreclosure after a major tenant moved out. The company took over the 15-year-old building, which was designed by Emery Roth, from New York Life last year. 
FMB -- which leases, manages and constructs buildings -- overhauled the structure, giving it what Mr. Boccanfuso called "a fresher, more-modern whimsical look." The company redesigned the lobby, elevator cabs, parking deck and landscaping; added a cafe, a coffee bar, a fitness center and contemporary art throughout; rewired the building; and reconfigured the existing office space.
The goal, Mr. Boccanfuso said, was to reposition the building to appeal to small- and medium-sized companies that are often owned and managed nowadays by baby boomers who want offices that have a hip, stylish look. 
RiverView at Purchase is now 80 percent leased, with clients like Ameritrade, which is taking 40,000 square feet, and Fano Securities, which is moving into 9,000 square feet. Annual rents are $28.50 per square foot. Each floor can accommodate a company that needs as much as 40,000 square feet or as little as only 3,000. 
In Rye, Brickman Associates of Manhattan similarly purchased a building that the former owner had given up on. In this case, 900 King Street had been empty since the early 1990's, when I.B.M. vacated it. Unable to find new tenants for the building, the owner returned the deed in lieu of a foreclosure. Brickman would not say how much it paid for the three-story, 201,460-square-foot structure and the 17-acre campus. 
The new owner has spent $5 million so far to remodel and renovate the structure which features a three-story atrium in the lobby. Hiring Insignia/ESG of Stamford to serve as the leasing agent, Brickman Associates is offering office space in the vacant building at $27 a square foot. The building can accommodate tenants that require as much as 97,500 square feet on a floor to those seeking only 10,000 square feet.
LIKE other remodeled buildings, 900 King Street features a sleek new lobby, updated wiring throughout, cafes for the lunch crowd and other amenities. "Building designs can get tired," explained Robert Burling, a principal with the architectural firm of Jeter, Cook & Jepson in Hartford, which is redesigning 900 King Street. "Elevators, lobbies and atriums were different in the 1980's than they are now. Buildings need to be brought up to date."
In White Plains, near the Greenburgh border, Alfred Weissman Real Estate is placing its hopes on 287 Corporate Plaza, an unfinished building that was abandoned in the early phase of construction during the recession of the early 1990's. The Yonkers-based company renovated the former Saks Distribution Center on Tuckahoe Road in Yonkers, which is now occupied by Qwest.
The completion of 287 Corporate Plaza is the only construction of new office space taking place now in the whole county, said Carl Austin, the owner of Austin Corporate Properties, a Rye Brook company that is leasing the property.
Rents in the three-story, 135,000-square-foot building on 10 acres will be in the high $20's per square foot. Mr. Austin said the likely tenants would be telecommunications, financial service, computer and insurance companies -- "your staple bread and butter firms."

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
Where Music's Mission Is to Help Heal

BYLINE:  By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI 

 BODY:
COME spring, in this city of rich musical traditions, the thoughts of many turn to the venerable May Festival, the granddaddy of American choral celebrations, now 128 years old. It is a retreat into aesthetics and history, often seeming to have little to do with the concerns of the workaday world, and that is probably how most classical-music lovers want it these days.
 But Cincinnati has been otherwise occupied this spring, since the fatal shooting of an unarmed 19-year-old black man, Timothy Thomas, by a policeman, Officer Steven Roach, on April 7 and the ensuing riots. Even before the shooting, the American Civil Liberties Union had joined black civil rights groups in filing suit in a federal court in Cleveland, pointing to a longtime pattern of racial profiling by Cincinnati police officers. From 1995 to 2000, the suit pointed out, Cincinnati officers had killed 13 suspects, all of them black. 
 Officer Roach has been charged with two misdemeanors: negligent homicide and obstructing official business. The parties in the suit have hired a mediator: a music lover, it turns out, who named his conflict-resolution company Aria. A federal investigation of the police department has begun. And Mayor Charlie Luken has established panels to recommend reforms in all areas of civic life. Such commission reports -- no fewer than six in recent decades -- have a history of being ignored in Cincinnati. 
"If we haven't come up with something concrete in four months," Mayor Lukin said recently in his office, "we'll disband."
However much music lovers might like to escape such matters, the May Festival and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, which administers it and plays in it, have no choice but to face them. Unlike, say, the Cleveland Orchestra, which lives in splendid isolation in remote University Circle, these organizations lie in the heart of the city. Both the orchestra, which was founded in 1895, and the May Festival perform in Music Hall, which was built for the festival in 1877 in a central city area then predominantly German, called Over-the-Rhine.
Now predominantly black, Over-the-Rhine has been the focus of the recent unrest. The Thomas shooting took place a block and a half from the hall. Washington Park, in which protesters gathered in the following days, lies between, across a cobblestone street from it. The police station on which the protesters descended is directly behind the hall.
Although the building, which is owned by the city, was not touched, orchestra and festival offices were closed for three days during the period of turmoil and curfews. The players were on a week's vacation, before Easter, so no performances were affected. Still, here is a classic case of an arts institution that can no longer take anything for granted and must put stock in music's vaunted power to heal the spirit, individual and communal.
Cliched to begin with, that notion took a beating here in another context. The simmering tension that underlay the start of the festival in mid-May boiled anew at its close, last weekend, when Taste of Cincinnati took center stage a few blocks away. Taste of Cincinnati, 22 years old, is a three-day open-air festival of food and pop music, sponsored by the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce and others. An earlier festival, Jammin' on Main, had already been scuttled because of the unrest, and a coalition of clergymen now called for a boycott of this one. The Rev. Damon Lynch III, a noted activist and one of three people appointed by the mayor to oversee the work of his reform panels, spearheaded the boycott.
Two rhythm-and-blues groups scheduled to appear at Taste of Cincinnati, Midnight Star and the Isley Brothers, withdrew in advance. But Mayor Luken intervened to salvage the situation, persuading James Brown to step in at the opening, on May 26.
Thus came one of the most volatile moments of recent weeks. Mr. Brown failed to arrive for 40 minutes, leaving a large audience, mostly white, to contemplate an empty stage with a banner -- "Justice, Peace, Healing, Community" -- and grow restive. Through it all, demonstrators, mostly black, chanted and brandished posters nearby, and a few shoved their way into the audience.
When Mr. Brown finally appeared, he stayed less than five minutes, delivering a few disconnected remarks above the uproar, and a couple of choruses of "Killing Is Out, School Is In." "I'm not here for the man," he said. "I'm here for the kids." The protesters, some carrying signs calling Mr. Brown the "Godfather of Sold," seemed unconvinced. Mr. Brown received $15,000 as expenses for his appearance.
"I don't know who got played on that one," Mr. Lynch said from his pulpit at the New Prospect Baptist Church in Over-the-Rhine last Sunday. "James got paid, and somebody got played. Only in Cincinnati!" The congregation applauded lustily.
"This is our Rosa Parks moment," Mr. Lynch said later, referring to the woman who famously refused to surrender her seat to a white man in a Montgomery, Ala., bus in 1955. " 'I ain't getting up this time. I got up every other time, but this time I don't move.' Not everybody is at that point, but many are."
Still, if the point was, as many said, that this was no time to celebrate in Cincinnati, no time for Cincinnati to pat itself on the back, to carry on business as usual, then why was so much attention devoted to Taste of Cincinnati and so little to the Cincinnati May Festival? One hesitated to ask, not wanting to plant an idea where it may not have existed and not wanting, either, to hear that classical music has become merely marginal to the culture at large. (Though why should any of that come as a surprise after so many years of escapism and aesthetic detachment?)
And sure enough: "The May Festival is not on the radar screen in terms of impact," Mr. Lynch said after the service. "The city drew a line in the sand on Taste of Cincinnati. The economic impact is much greater."
There may be other, more positive factors as well. "Music Hall looks like a big cathedral," said Magistrate Judge Jack Sherman Jr. of the federal court, a member of the orchestra's board. "It has that aspect, and that could be one reason it's never been touched. Not a brick was scratched."
The church remains a strong force in black neighborhoods in Cincinnati, Magistrate Sherman said. He sings in the choir of his own church, St. John's Unitarian in Clifton, which has moved about a mile from its former home in Over-the-Rhine.
If any single building can be taken to summarize the history of Over-the-Rhine, it may that vacated church, a stately but compact red brick, neo-Gothic structure, a smaller partner to Music Hall, which looms a block and a half away. A black cyclone fence and a white sign for the Apostolic Brethren Temple Church, attached to a corner, seem the most recent additions to the facade. But the name St. John's Unitarian Church remains artfully embedded in the partly shattered stained glass over the entry. And high above, chiseled in stone, is "Deutsche Protestantische St. Johanniskirche, Erbauet A.D. 1867" -- built, that is, 10 years before Music Hall.
Over-the-Rhine is accorded 15 minutes of dubious fame in the drug-drenched movie "Traffic," where it is put forward as the ultimate in urban squalor. But Anthony McGill, a brilliant young clarinetist and one of the orchestra's two black players, cautions against a monolithic view.
"I know what it's like to come from a general area that people think of as a bad neighborhood but that has many different characteristics, including middle-class people," said Mr. McGill, who grew up on the south side of Chicago and now lives a few blocks from Music Hall.
Indeed, Paavo Jarvi, the Estonian-born American maestro who becomes the orchestra's music director in September, says he plans to live in Over-the-Rhine.
Music Hall and its occupants may also have gained a certain respect and immunity in the area by being good neighbors, as by most accounts they are. The building is used by local groups for nonmusical as well as musical purposes.
"The orchestra is reaching out all the time," said Mayor Luken, who professed to no particular interest in classical music or knowledge of it, "as most of Cincinnati suddenly is."
Steven Monder, the president of the orchestra and the executive director of the festival, proclaimed: "The most significant thing we do is that we stay. We haven't abandoned the neighborhood. That's our statement: we are here, and we want to be here."
The May Festival has made concerted efforts to attract blacks and Hispanics into its chorus, which is made up of amateurs. Carole T. Rigaud, who is taking over as the first black chairman of the festival's board, described extensive outreach efforts, concentrated on drawing people from church choirs.
"The problem is that people are completely involved in their own choirs," she explained. Magistrate Sherman is an example, having just returned from an extensive tour of Europe with his choir. And although the May Festival runs only two weeks of the year, the chorus maintains a full schedule of activities year-round. As a result, even after all those efforts, only 6 of its 138 members are black.
The orchestra, like other major American ensembles, uses blind auditions but retains an almost completely white face. This may be the most intractable problem of all, for it can be solved only in the long run, through education. Professional musicians on this level must usually be built from the ground up, with training beginning in early childhood.
The orchestra, through its energetic community relations manager, Kathy Jorgensen-Finley, has begun working with Aaron P. Dworkin, the executive director of the Sphinx Competition in Dearborn, Mich., a program geared to developing young black and Hispanic string players. Chiefly through the efforts of Erich Kunzel, the conductor of the Cincinnati Pops, the orchestra is also involved in the establishment of a new public school for the creative and performing arts next to Music Hall.
Ms. Jorgensen-Finley has developed other programs to attract neighborhood youngsters, and several orchestra players mentor young aspirants. "I feel strongly about encouraging people to do that in all careers," said Norman Johns, a veteran black cellist in the orchestra, who practices what he calls "aggressive mentoring."
Even all of that is not enough, Mr. Jarvi acknowledges. "It's even more important to educate the parents," he said. "If they grew up in a family with Ph.D.'s and went to the best universities but have never been to a symphony concert, there's really no hope for the kids."
In any case, the festival came to a peaceful end, particularly edifying in a fresh and stirring account of the Mahler's all-encompassing Third Symphony on the final Friday, conducted by James Conlon, the festival's music director. (This symphony, which is about as minimally choral as music gets at the May Festival, nevertheless had its American premiere there in 1914.) In such exalted post-Romanticism, Mr. Conlon seems to be reaping benefits from his extensive work on the lesser figures around Mahler, like Zemlinsky, whom he edged only slightly awkwardly into a program of Russian music the next night.
With all the talk of long-term education and the need for patience at a time when patience may be running out, Mr. Conlon is one who holds out some quick fixes.
"I want to find some program ideas immediately to give things a jump start next year," he said. "It may mean some gospel. It may mean some works by African-American composers." The festival already has one such work in the bank, Alvin Singleton's "Praisemaker," commissioned for its 125th anniversary, in 1998.
Mr. Conlon also looks ahead to the opening of the the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center on the riverfront in 2004 as an opportunity for joint programming. Edwin J. Rigaud, the president of the center and the husband of Ms. Rigaud, the festival chairman, spoke enthusiastically of the prospect of collaborations with all of the city's cultural institutions.
But the words of Mr. Monder, the orchestra's president, continue to ring loudest and longest. "We're not going anywhere," he reiterated. "Life goes on. I refrain from saying things go back to normal, because obviously normal wasn't good enough."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION/RADIO; 
A Los Angeles Station Tries to Be a Player for PBS

BYLINE:  By ALAN JAMES FRUTKIN; Alan James Frutkin writes about television for Mediaweek magazine.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
IN late April "PBS Hollywood Presents," a new series produced by the public television station KCET, made its debut. It was a proud moment for the Los Angeles station, but the long road to "Hollywood Presents" -- the first dramatic program KCET had produced for PBS since 1994 -- was also a reminder of past and present embarrassments.
 Sitting in the nation's film and television production capital, not to mention its second-largest TV market, KCET contributes relatively little original programming to PBS's national schedule. Its 45 hours in fiscal 1999 were approximately one-fifth of what PBS's top producer, WNET in New York, provided. 
 The numbers underscore KCET's long-standing struggle to establish ties with Hollywood's creative community. They also reflect PBS's own lack of success in reaching out to stations beyond core contributors like WNET, WGBH in Boston and WETA in Washington. And they point to the problems KCET continues to face nearly 20 years after it went through a crippling financial crisis. 
The first installment of "Hollywood Presents," "The Old Settler," adapted from the play by John Henry Redwood, began filming at KCET's Hollywood studios in February, five years after the station named the former NBC executive Al Jerome as its president. One of Mr. Jerome's initial goals was to create a national dramatic anthology series, and now three more installments of "Hollywood Presents," which adapts plays by American writers, are planned for broadcast over the next two years. The next will be Donald Margulies's 1996 play "Collected Stories."
"It took too long," Mr. Jerome said of the program's launch, adding that almost every aspect of development delayed the project, from securing PBS's approval to -- perhaps most frustrating of all -- raising the money to make the first four dramas. (Only $4 million of the $6 million needed has been raised.) The $1.5 million budget per drama is similar to that of many independent feature films. But where a movie like "The Blair Witch Project" made millionaires of its investors, "Hollywood Presents" offers sponsors a very different revenue model. More precisely, it avoids offering them a revenue model at all. And with advertising possibilities slim on public television, attracting backers can be difficult.
"Fund-raising from our vantage point is more of a philanthropic endeavor," said Mare Mazur, KCET's senior vice president of programming and production. "It's challenging to generate that level of philanthropy on public broadcasting right now."
Signing actors, writers and directors to projects has proved as elusive as landing underwriters, and for many of the same reasons. Brad Grey, an executive producer of HBO's "Sopranos" and a member of KCET's board since 1996, said the station's not-for-profit status remains a major hurdle in establishing ties with Los Angeles's top artists, no matter how charitably they might regard public television.
"When you're dealing with talent agencies and the studios and the creative community in Hollywood, after you've talked about what you're trying to accomplish, the conversation always turns to the budget and how much money can be made," Mr. Grey said. "Once you get into that discussion, you limit the number of creators and actors who would be interested."
Making matters worse for KCET is the competition it now faces from pay cable services like HBO and Showtime, which offer Hollywood talent a chance to spread its wings and still make money. "It only makes it more difficult," Mr. Grey said.
Despite such obstacles, Mr. Jerome says, the competition KCET faces from within the PBS system is more troubling than any threat from outside.
Two-thirds of PBS's regular series -- including "American Masters," "Frontline," "Great Performances" and "Nova" -- originate at two stations, WNET and WGBH. To maintain those series, PBS allots a large share of its production budget to programming from those stations -- approximately 45 percent in 1999.
Mr. Jerome said that although there is a need to preserve and strengthen those series, PBS's traditional focus on them may hurt potential projects from other stations. He suggested that KCET's low output may be partly the result of PBS's neglect. "If there really isn't an appetite for the development of new series, then there's limited opportunity to develop them," he said.
Conversely, the success of PBS's flagship series attracts underwriting from corporations like ExxonMobil and Salomon Smith Barney. Even supporters of KCET say that when PBS develops new series, it may be easier to get financing through established channels rather than hunting for new ones.
"This is a business of momentum," said Grant Tinker, the former NBC chairman, who, like Mr. Grey, joined KCET's board in 1996 at Mr. Jerome's urging. "I think there's an open wire both to WNET and WGBH because they've been running out front for so long, and they've found a clearer track to getting going and getting supported."
PBS, whose headquarters are in Alexandria, Va., continues to weather accusations of favoritism. "There's this feeling that everything is too East Coast," said Pat Mitchell, the president and chief executive of PBS since March, who responded to those accusations by placing regional programming executives in Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami.
Mr. Jerome says little will change unless PBS expands its national schedule. In 1995, PBS instituted so-called common carriage guidelines, to encourage member stations nationwide to broadcast the same prime-time schedule. The guidelines were intended to give PBS programs more national promotion and to guarantee national exposure for corporate underwriters.
Although many regional PBS stations prefer local programming, both Mr. Jerome and Ms. Mitchell say the current guidelines -- which cover about 350 hours a year, Sunday through Thursday nights -- are insufficient. "I would like a policy of common carriage that is based not on hours but on a full prime-time schedule," said Ms. Mitchell, who will present her proposal to member stations this month. "They may say it's too much common carriage, but I'm hoping they'll see this as a way to target some growth and to increase our value at a community level."
If any station could use a boost at the community level, it's KCET. In March, after falling short of its viewer fund-raising goals for both December and January, the station laid off 15 employees and eliminated 11 vacant positions, cutting the staff to 170, about 70 percent of its size in 1996 and less than 60 percent of its 1990 size.
Although Mr. Jerome says the cutbacks will not affect "Hollywood Presents," he acknowledges that they may reinforce lingering perceptions that the station has failed to escape its troubled past. 
"These layoffs in no way reflect that the company is not healthy," said Mr. Jerome, who oversaw another round of cutbacks in 1998, when 15 positions were eliminated. "It's all been occasioned by the same thing -- hitting an air pocket in the membership. It's the way KCET's business has been, and I'm certainly very committed to trying to change that."
MR. JEROME attributes last year's disappointing membership drive both to the national economic downturn and to the uncertainty surrounding the presidential election. Although he discounts dissatisfied viewers as a cause, he does suggest that people in Los Angeles may take KCET -- and public television -- for granted. "At the end of the day, we want people to start thinking about us as a regular part of what they pay for entertainment, in the same way that they pay for cable," he said.
To that end, Mr. Jerome and his staff are in the early stages of developing what he calls a "new membership transaction." Through the Internet, he said, he hopes to establish direct lines of communication with individual viewers that may someday lead to their credit cards. A small amount of money on a monthly basis, he added, will "let us know if we're doing something right."
But until he can rely on such transactions, he said, maintaining the station's fiscal health will require continual adjustments, as shown by the layoffs.
KCET's finances first came under scrutiny after the station produced the popular 1980 series "Cosmos." The 13-hour program, narrated and co-produced by the astronomer Carl Sagan, cost $6 million to $8 million, said Barbara Goen, a KCET spokeswoman. Combined with the fiscal mismanagement of a previous administration, it almost shut down KCET. The station cut its work force by a third in 1982, halted production on most national programming and brought in the longtime public television executive William H. Kobin to run things.
The strategy worked. By the end of Mr. Kobin's 13-year tenure, KCET's budget had tripled, to $45 million, and membership increased to 325,000 from 200,000. For the fiscal year that ends this month, KCET's budget is approximately $50 million, while subscriptions have dipped to 313,000.
Mr. Kobin also helped put KCET back into the PBS schedule. It was one of four presenting stations for the now-defunct "American Playhouse" series. It produced several children's series for PBS, as well as a number of limited documentary series, including "The Astronomers" in 1991. It also began production of what remains its signature local public-affairs show, "Life and Times."
After Mr. Kobin retired in 1995, Mr. Jerome transformed "Life and Times" from a taped program to a live broadcast five nights a week, renaming it "Life and Times Tonight." (The program is now shown live twice a week.) In 1997, the documentary series "The Great War and the Shaping of the 20th Century" -- which Mr. Jerome inherited from Mr. Kobin -- won an Emmy, a Peabody and an Alfred I. Dupont/Columbia award.
Although Mr. Jerome has kept much of the momentum achieved during Mr. Kobin's tenure, critics say he has yet to build on those gains in creating a strong national presence. With "Hollywood Presents," and with the recent announcement that KCET will produce PBS's Latino drama series "An American Family," the station finds itself once again cast as a phoenix.
Ms. Mitchell said the series represent "the re-launch of KCET as a major public television producing station." And Mr. Jerome remains hopeful that the station can live up to those expectations.
"We're anxious to do more," he said. "If we can just get that stone up the hill, then we can let it go."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION/RADIO; 
Bringing in Public Radio, and Bringing People Together

BYLINE:  By VALERIE GLADSTONE; Valerie Gladstone's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about the Dance Africa festival.

 BODY:
BROADCASTING wasn't something Jay Allison planned on as a young man. He was more interested in acting and riding around on his motorcycle. "I was sort of a ne'er do well," Mr. Allison said. But in 1977 a friend who worked at National Public Radio in Washington talked him into coming by. Intrigued, he began to stop in at night, more to hang out than to work, until his friend loaned him a tape recorder.
 "Public radio was just inventing itself," Mr. Allison said, and in a sense so was he. He taught himself to record, edit and mix, and "insinuated" himself onto the air. In this unlikely fashion, Mr. Allison, 49, began an impressive career in radio and television. He has co-produced prize-winning documentaries like "Breaking the Cycle: How Do We Stop Child Abuse" (1989) and "Beyond Affliction: The Disability History Project" (1999), and cultural programs like "The Miles Davis Radio Project" (1991 and 2001) and "Lost and Found Sound" (1999-2001). In 1996, he won public radio's highest honor, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's Edward R. Murrow Award. His series "The Life Stories Collection: First-Person Portraits" will be broadcast this summer. 
 Susan Stamberg, the NPR producer and host, remembers the "tall, blond and gorgeous" Mr. Allison arriving at the studios in the late 70's. "Jay came from a theater background," she said, "and suggested how to give stories a dramatic sound and add more sizzle. He's still the living embodiment of what public radio was at the beginning, with the same initial values and passion -- and he's done everything as a freelancer by piecing funds together."
Now Mr. Allison has pulled off his biggest coup: bringing public radio to his home base of Cape Cod. Last year, under the umbrella of Boston's WGBH, he launched two stations serving Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. They are the only public radio stations to go on the air since 1999.
After living in the Catskills, Boston and New York, Mr. Allison and his wife and fellow producer, Christina Egloff, moved to Woods Hole, Mass., on Cape Cod in 1985. "I got the idea for the stations for partly selfish reasons," he said in a recent telephone interview. "The signals from WGBH in Boston would drift in and out and I couldn't hear my own shows. I also thought the region would benefit from sharing a forum."
Mr. Allison's audience, spread across two islands and a 70-mile-long peninsula, is more fragmented than most. Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod have strong senses of identity and history, with each community feeling itself to be more special than the others. "Yet the radio signal extends across them all, disrespecting boundaries," Mr. Allison said. "Our stories tend, almost miraculously, to break those boundaries and defuse age-old feuds and jealousies."
In 1992, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting identified the region as underserved, lacking a full-power, local public radio service. The same year, at a barbecue, Mr. Allison said, "A bunch of us got to wondering what it would take to have our own radio station." 
It took a year to establish a nonprofit community organization, Cape and Islands Community Radio Inc. (now named Atlantic Public Media), made up of local residents and public radio veterans. In 1997, the group managed to get Federal Communications Commission licenses and a $173,000 grant from the National Telecommunications Information Agency to build stations in Nantucket and Woods Hole, using the last available noncommercial FM frequencies in the area. WNAN (91.1 FM) would serve Nantucket and WCAI (90.1 FM) would cover Martha's Vineyard and the upper and mid-Cape. (Streaming audio is available at www.cainan .org.) Nonetheless, the delays and red tape continued. "I dreaded walking around town," Mr. Allison said, "because I was becoming known as the guy who was forever starting up a new public radio station that you couldn't hear."
Hoping to speed things up, the nonprofit group voted to seek a regional partner and found that WGBH, the distinguished public television and radio station known for its cultural and news programming, was amenable. It agreed to build and operate the stations, contributing about $1 million in start-up money and assuming the $1 million annual operating expenses. John Voci, operations director at WGBH, said, "We could provide them with shows, such as 'All Things Considered,' 'This American Life' and 'Fresh Air,' but the region also needed its own local service and that's what we wanted to encourage."
After three more years of zoning hearings, tower problems and transmitter site changes, WNAN went on the air in March 2000, followed by WCAI in September, both 24 hours a day. "We've all spent a lot of time," Mr. Allison said, "developing a template for how a big station can adopt a little one, keeping local character alive while achieving economies of scale through shared infrastructure." The independent radio producer and consultant Steve Rathe said, "Jay's significant achievement is taking independent radio-making the next step -- institutionalizing the process."
Despite a limited budget and a full-time staff of three plus a few stringers, producing local programming has been a breeze. For years, Mr. Allison has been fascinated with how people function; here was another chance to explore humanity and at the same time possibly unite communities. "When you sit with people, finally what they're talking about is their inner lives," he said, "and I try to express that on the radio."
ONE way he does it is with "Sonic ID's," which are brief anecdotes, essays, poems and soundscapes created by local people that are interspersed with local news throughout the broadcast day. A woman recalls how her elderly cousin survived the hurricane of 1938 by digging himself into a sand dune; another woman describes how to put wash on the line on a windy day; a teenager new to Martha's Vineyard from New York City compares his old and new schools, and a little boy imitates the sound of a lawnmower. 
Mr. Allison also installed a "listener line" that lets people tell their stories on voice mail. "We pick the good ones," he said. And, trying to get all listeners into the act, the stations also loan out portable tape recorders to whoever promises to use them. "The process teaches quite a bit about the power and technique of radio," Mr. Allison said.
On Sunday nights, he does his own show, "Arts and Ideas." To involve kids, he encouraged the establishment of a radio club at the Martha's Vineyard Regional High School. His goal is transparent. "You know Martha's Vineyard people think they're infinitely superior to Nantucket people and so on," he said. "Well, now that they hear each other on the air, it's tougher for them to maintain those old prejudices. A fisherman from Martha's Vineyard tells a funny story about his work and a Nantucket fisherman can't help but laugh and say, 'Hey, I like this fella.' "

HEADLINE: IN PERSON; 
From the Knee of Her Bubbe

BYLINE:  By DEBRA GALANT 

DATELINE: NEW MILFORD 

 BODY:
IT wasn't the usual kind of graduation.
 Children belted out that old standard "Gott bentsh Amerika" by the Jewish-American songwriter Israel Balin. 
 That's "God Bless America" by Irving Berlin to most Americans.
Yes, many Jewish children go to Hebrew school, though few of them go to school to study Yiddish. But the children who belong to the Workmen's Circle Jewish School of Bergen County learn both. 
Roberta Starr Schiff, 61, is the educational director and resident muse of this unusual school which, in keeping with Yiddish, calls itself a schule (pronounced SHOOL-uh).
Workmen's Circle is a 101-year-old movement started by immigrants in the labor movement as a fraternal organization. It now functions largely as a substitute for Jews who are disenchanted by more traditional forms of Judaism, but who want to transmit a Jewish heritage to their children.
Then, as now, Workmen's Circle has always been more interested in Jewish culture -- or Yiddishkeit -- than in Judaism as a religion. There is another branch in New Brunswick, and branches in about a dozen major American and Canadian cities -- with a total of about 25,000 members.
Faithful to its labor roots, Workmen's Circle still emphasizes leftist politics, placing the pursuit of "social and economic justice" high in its mission statement.
Mrs. Schiff who is, among other things, a trained opera singer, seems an unlikely person to lead a Workmen's Circle schule. She was raised in an Orthodox household and was the first women accepted by the cantorial music division of the Herzliah Hebrew Institute in New York.
But Mrs. Schiff's initial disaffection with synagogue-based Judaism actually occurred as a result of breaking the cantorial gender barrier. After a newspaper article appeared, the former Ms. Starr began to receive hate mail ("Roberta Starr thought she could spit on the Torah" was a typical comment).
She became further alienated as a mother trying to find a meaningful Jewish education for her three children, who are now grown. First, she tried an Orthodox synagogue, where her children spent most of their time "decoding Hebrew" and "never got to learn about Herzl and Dreyfus." (Theodor Herzl was the founder of Zionism, Alfred Dreyfus a French Jew falsely and famously accused of treason in 1894.)
When she switched to a Reform synagogue, Mrs. Schiff found the Jewish education broad but shallow, or as she put it: "A mile long and an inch wide."
"It's true," she said recently. "I was very critical. I was the parent from hell."
Finally, she found her home at the Bergen County Workmen's Circle group 15 years ago, then headed by a Jewish ventriloquist named Jonathan Geffner. Mrs. Schiff became the group's education director in 1987.
As it turns out, her Yiddish education was every bit as formative as her advanced Hebrew training, or even her musical preparation. It came at the knee of her bubbe from the shtetl (Eastern European small-town grandmother), who lived with her family, first in Brooklyn and then Queens.
Mrs. Schiff's bubbe greeted her when she arrived home from school. "It was the most wonderful, warm welcome," Mrs. Schiff recalled. " 'Mine susse sheine medele. ('My sweet pretty girl.') What did you learn today? I hope you respected the teacher.' "
"The question always is, 'Why Yiddish?' " Mrs. Schiff said during an interview in the living room of her split-level home here. She paraphrased Golda Meier, the late prime minister of Israel, who also taught in a Workmen's Circle schule:
"Hebrew is the language of the Bible and the modern state of Israel," she said. "But Yiddish was the warm, wonderful language of the Jewish home and the street that united a scattered population for 20 years."
She added: "I love the Yiddish language. There are songs that can only be sung in Yiddish, stories whose charm and secrets, sadness and nostalgia can be conveyed in Yiddish alone."
Yiddish, a dialect of mingled German and Hebrew, was spoken by almost all of the Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe in the early 20th century, a generation that Mrs. Schiff thinks deserves the title of "greatest generation." As those immigrants' children assimilated, however, the language has become almost extinct.
"Times have changed," said Paul Esterowitz, a computer programmer in Leonia, who was raised in a Workmen's Circle home in Brooklyn and sends his children to the Bergen schule. "The only people who speak Yiddish today are Orthodox Jews."
Of course, Yiddish also gets liberally sprinkled into the English language, like vinegar on bland food, especially in Hollywood, whose early moguls were mostly Eastern European Jews. 
"You can't open the newspaper without seeing maven," Mrs. Schiff said. (Maven, of course, means expert.) Nosh (snack) and chutzpah (nerve) have also become familiar, she pointed out.
Mrs. Schiff said she started the school's youngest students with Yiddish because it was easier to learn than Hebrew. Although Yiddish and Hebrew share an alphabet, Yiddish shares many more cognates with English, like hant for hand, or schule for school. Yiddish is usually taught at the schule through folk tales and plays.
Yiddish is also imparted through a special Passover Haggadah, which includes the traditional Four Questions in English, Hebrew and Yiddish, as well as the Yiddish song "Zog Nit Keyn Mol," or "Song of the Partisans," which celebrates the uprising of Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943. "It's not your father's Maxwell House Haggadah," Mrs. Schiff joked.
Hebrew and biblical study are also woven into the schule's curriculum. At the recent graduation ceremony, students put on two skits about the Jewish scholar Hillel. Appropriately, Hillel advocated an interpretation of Torah that was liberal for his time. He died in A.D. 10. "We even do blessings too," Mrs. Schiff said. "We're not militantly secular." She also trains students, privately, for bar and bat mitzvahs, although that is not a requirement of the program.
The inclusion of palpably religious content, however, is heretical to some members. One of those people is the Workmen's Circle-weaned Mr. Esterowitz. 
"Bible study? I was kind of aghast," Mr. Esterowitz said. "Workman's Circle was born of the labor movement and they were Socialists. These people were not religious. They were free thinkers."
Were there bar mitzvahs when he was growing up?
"Absolutely not," he said. Nevertheless, Mr. Esterowitz's wife, Gail Noble Esterowitz, would like to see their daughter Maxx Anne, 9, have a bat mitzvah with Mrs. Schiff when she turns 13.
"I say we're an interfaith marriage," she explained. "He's an atheist and I'm agnostic." Of course, when it comes to Workmen's Circle, Mr. Esterowitz is a devout hard-liner -- just as Orthodox Jews are about traditional Judaism.
But at the Bergen schule, a third-generation Workmen's Circle member like Mr. Esterowitz is the exception. More typically, families there are fleeing a synagogue experience they found oppressive.
"You know the old joke about how you get mice out of a synagogue?" one member said before the graduation ceremony last month. "Bar mitzvah them."
Mrs. Schiff explained: "They remember what it was like for them, and how they hated it."
A preponderance of members, as it happens, are psychotherapists. "And I don't think that's a coincidence," she said.

HEADLINE: For Art and Profit, On With the Shows 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
FOR the nearly 20 years that David Sekac was a machine operator in a metal works factory in Clinton, he dreamed of finding a job he loved so that he would not dread getting up every morning to go to work.
 Then two years ago after returning from a vacation in England, Mr. Sekac, 46, found a way to make that dream real. It happened when he went to a local shop to arrange for the framing of some photographs. 
 Two other customers noticed his work sitting on the counter and struck up a conversation. They told him the scene seemed to burst off the surface with dazzling color, and urged him to enter a photo contest. 
Though skeptical, Mr. Sekac agreed to enter the competition. When someone bought a photo of a small, tranquil English garden in Cotswell for his asking price of $195, Mr. Sekac was stunned. He started attending adult education courses in photography and reading everything about the field he could get his hands on.
Last year he quit his factory job and has joined the more than 2,000 artists, artisans and crafts exhibitors in Connecticut who sell their work at crafts shows, fairs and festivals throughout the spring, summer and fall.
Some are like Mr. Sekac, trying to make a living at their craft or hobby after becoming bored with jobs or losing them. Others have jobs during the week and venture into the world of exhibitions on weekends to supplement their incomes. Still others are retirees who decide to turn longtime hobbies into part-time post-retirement careers.
"For a long time I had a secure, steady income in a job where creativity, independent thinking and freedom were not only discouraged, they were considered serious drawbacks and scoffed at by management," said Mr. Sekac, who operates Brookside photography from a studio in his Madison home. 
"Now I love what I do and I always feel excited the night before a show. But I never know if I'm going to make money, lose money or break even because the competition is brutal and sometimes people like your work, but just don't buy it. It's hard work and a lot tougher life than most people think."
Recently Mr. Sekac was among 15 photographers and more than 200 exhibitors selected to display their work at the 39th Annual Meet the Artists and Artisans Spring Show on the Green in Milford. He will be in Milford again for a weekend show on the green Friday and Saturday.
Linda Neely, a Killingworth artist, has been making and selling her colorful clay etchings at arts and crafts shows since 1980. She said that it took time to learn which shows to attend to make the best profit, and how to develop a rapport with potential customers that is relaxed enough not to scare them off, but friendly enough to keep them interested.
"It's a fine line to find a balance between the two extremes," Ms. Neely said. "It takes time and experience to learn that."
Along with her husband, Bill Neely, who handles all of the business details and helps with the more technical aspects of the craft, she appears at about 10 shows a year in Connecticut. In May she was at the four-day Dogwood Festival in Fairfield that is held every Mother's Day weekend.
"The first 10 years I did this alone, and it was very difficult being on the road away from my children and husband every weekend," Ms. Neely said. "But during the past 10 years we have done this together and it's been a lot more fun -- and a lot less lonely."
Bill Neely said that the world of arts and crafts shows was less idyllic than it might initially appear with profit margins dependent on factors beyond anyone's control -- such as the weather, the economy and whether other shows are taking place the same weekend.
"There is a great deal of freedom and independence in this kind of business, but it's also extremely risky and insecure and you really can't budget the way you can when you have a regular job with a steady income," he said.
David Anderson, a Newtown photographer who specializes in colorful outdoor New England scenes, particularly of Litchfield County, knows all about the frustrations of trying to make a living at the shows.
While his work dazzled more than a few customers at the recent Dogwood Festival, Mr. Anderson said it had become tougher to make a living at crafts shows because "it seems as though everyone is trying to do it."
Mr. Anderson, 54, said he had been selling his work at shows and fairs in Connecticut for 11 years and still enjoyed talking to potential customers and to other vendors. But he said he was getting tired of having to spend more and more time selling and promoting and less time doing what he loves most: taking pictures.
"I always loved going to crafts shows myself and always wondered if I could do something at them to earn a living," said Mr. Anderson, a former carpenter who still does handyman work to supplement his photography business, New England Impressions. "Now I'm doing about 25 shows a year, but finding less time to be outdoors and take pictures, which is why I started doing this in the first place."
Denise morris Curt, director of the recent Milford show on the green and of another one there in the fall, said most exhibitors had regular jobs and sold their art work and crafts products at weekend shows like the ones she has run for nearly 40 years.
"It's a very exciting lifestyle for a modern-day gypsy, but you have to have talent and be a certain kind of person who doesn't mind the unpredictability of it all," she said. 
Ms. Curt said the shows had become far more competitive over the years, with more than 450 applicants turned away from the recent Milford show, compared with the 200 who exhibited there.
Joseph Mehan, director of the nonprofit Connecticut Guild of Craftsmen and editor of The Craft Digest, a monthly newsletter magazine with show listings and articles about crafts people, said there were between 200 and 300 members of the guild when he started out in 1976. Now, there are more than 2,000.
"A lot of people laid off in the late 1980's and early 90's decided to try and replace or supplement their incomes by turning hobbies into part-time businesses where they could make money from things they made for fun in their leisure time," Mr. Mehan said. "But the advice I give most people is this: don't give up your day job. Trying to make a living selling at crafts shows is a long, hard grind that requires a lot of hours and many people don't last long."
A recent study conducted by the national Craft Organization Directors Association in New York found that the making and selling of fine crafts such as pottery, hand-blown glass, metalwork, wood and jewelry in the United States contributes $13.8 billion annually to the economy, which suggests there is money to be made in the field, said Mr. Mehan, "particularly when someone can come up with a product that is well made that people need."
That is what happened 17 years ago to George Abatiello, of Warwick, R.I., who discovered he was good at carving wooden decoys, wildlife heads, canes and walking sticks. At age 46 he began a second career carving wood after losing his longtime sales and food broker's job for a major food company. As owner of Eastern Waterfowl Ltd., Mr. Abatiello said he has never regretted his decision to enter the arts and crafts field.
"My wife has a real job; I do this," said. Mr. Abatiello, now 62. "I don't make a lot of money, but I do make a living. There was a time I sold somebody else's products, now I sell something that I create and it's the most satisfying feeling in the world."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Dylan Hotel; 
A New Boutique Hotel With Medieval Touches

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE ceiling of the room is a series of half round vaults, connected by raised ribs that rest on pillars partially emerged from the vertical walls. The window is of stained glass with illustrations suggesting strange, pseudoscientific rituals. The effect is one of a Gothic chamber in a medieval castle.
 Which is exactly what the designers and restorers wanted. The room is the Alchemy Suite of the Dylan Hotel at 52 East 41st Street between Madison and Park Avenues. It is a legacy of the time when the building housed the Chemists' Club, whose name is still carved into the stonework over the entrance. 
 Alchemy, which was intended to find a way to covert base metals like lead into gold, is considered a forerunner of modern chemistry. Although alchemists never succeeded in their objective, some of what they learned and their techniques were incorporated into modern chemistry, which began developing several hundred years ago. 
The Alchemy Suite is just one of the distinguishing components of the hotel, which is one of the pricey boutique hotels that have been opening in Manhattan in recent years. Most have highly designed public spaces and guest rooms. They emphasize in-room amenities like high speed Internet access as well as bathrobes and slippers and a staff trained to remember the names and requirements of repeat guests. Fitness centers with workout machines and business centers are usually musts as well.
This pampering comes at a cost, of course. Most boutique hotels have room rates well over $300 a night. The rates at Dylan are $435 to $535 a night.
Morris Moinian, the developer of Dylan, said the former club building provided a better base for the hotel than some of the office buildings that have been converted in recent years. In addition to the Alchemy Suite, the building included an expansive ballroom with a six-foot-wide working fireplace, a mezzanine looking over the ballroom and a marble and brass staircase connecting the first three floors.
The staircase is there mostly as a dramatic architectural statement, of course. As part of the renovation, new elevators were installed.
"You don't have spaces like this in office building conversions," said the 40-year-old Mr. Moinian. The Dylan, which opened late last year, is his first hotel in Manhattan, although he is an owner of the Wyndham Sugar Bay Hotel in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. He said he had acquired another property on 28th Street in the Chelsea section of Manhattan for conversion into another boutique hotel, which will have 122 rooms.
The Chemists' Club sold the building and moved out in the late 1980's, and the building stood vacant, although it had several owners, until Mr. Moinian purchased it in June 1997. (The Chemists' Club still exists; it is at 40 West 45th Street these days.)
Mr. Moinian said other developers had advanced proposals to convert the 10-story turn-of-the-last-century building to housing or offices. For himself, he said: "I was thinking hotel before I even walked through the door. What had been a glorious private club could be turned into a glorious hotel."
TO improve the economics of the project, Mr. Moinian added four stories to the top of the building, an addition that yielded a total of 108 guest rooms. Although he said the addition was as-of-right under zoning laws, there were certain practical limitations.
"My engineers came to me with a good-news, bad-news story," he said. "The good news was that they could add the four floors; the bad news was that they wanted to put two columns in the middle of the ballroom." Since the old ballroom was to be the site of a restaurant, adding columns to the space with an intricately carved, 34-foot-high ceiling was clearly unacceptable. The solution was to expose all the columns in the old building, remove the protective brickwork, and reinforce them so that they could handle the loads of the extra floors.
Saved from the columns, the room now houses the restaurant Virot, named for its chef and owner, Didier Virot. Because of the limitations of the building, Mr. Virot does his cooking in the basement, just under where his customers are eating. The room is decorated with two huge mirrors on the side walls and a metal sculpture of birds going up the wall over the fireplace, where a gas fire is to be operated in colder months.
The interior redesign by Jeffrey Beers moved the bar from the main floor to the balcony, which was widened to accommodate two rows of tables and chairs for light snacks to accompany drinks.
Mr. Beers's lobby has the front desk to one side and a seating area to the other with sight lines into the restaurant and a new walnut parquet floor tying it all together. The desk itself is wrapped in leather with a marble slab on top. The area behind the desk is decorated by a clear resin panel embedded with translucent, round shapes.
On the opposite side of the lobby, to the right as a guest walks in, the walls are lined with sand-blasted glass to give depth to a relatively small space. Farther in, the staircase goes off to the left and is a practical way to get to the bar on the second floor without waiting for an elevator. 
There had been water damage to the room housing the Alchemy Suite during the time the building was vacant, and finding a contractor willing to undertake restoring the room to the condition it was in as the Chemists' Club library and exhibit room in the 1930's was difficult, Mr. Moinian said.
"People did not know how much it would cost, so it was hard to get bidders," he said. "Finally, we found a group of Italians who did it all by hand."
Adding modern amenities, like heat and air-conditioning to what is supposed to evoke a medieval space, was a challenge as well. After all, it would not do to have air-conditioning ducts hanging from the vaulted ceiling or grillwork cut into the walls.
The answer was to install the equipment in a vertical chamber next to the closet and trim it with the same wood as the closet to make it as inconspicuous as possible.
Unlike the rest of the room, the stained glass window was in good shape when he purchased the building, Mr. Moinian said. The window features two round, multicolored panels surrounded by rectangular and hexagonal panes of translucent glass.
Both are based on ideas drawn from alchemy. One of the round panels depicts a long-necked flask resting above a flame, presumable converting base metal into gold. The other shows a shining Sun face, beaming its rays through a magnifying glass into a beaker, similarly intended to create a chemical reaction.
During the reconstruction, the Sun face panel was neatly clipped out of the wondow. "When I called the police, they said there was a guy going around the city stealing stained glass," Mr. Moinian said.
The stolen window was not recovered, so a replacement was ordered. "Fortunately, we had a picture from the preopening brochure, so we knew what it looked like," Mr. Moinian said. From across the room, the replacement panel appears to match the remaining original, but on close observation the colors, particularly the deep blues, are clearly different.
The room originally had a small mezzanine office connected to it, reached by a spiral staircase. That space is now a limestone lined bathroom with a 14-foot ceiling.
As a club, the building had about 30 guest rooms, with one bathroom per floor -- this at a time in the 1960's when the rate was $20 a night, according to club officials. Each of the guest rooms, which have 11-foot ceilings, now has an attached bath with granite floors and marble sheathed walls.

As the Economy Falters, the Hotel Market Cools

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A LACK of capital, corporate budget tightening, a dip in business travel and a slower national economy have all combined to take some of the sizzle out of the hotel market in New Jersey as well as nationally. 
 While revenues for the state's hotels grew 7.8 percent last year from 1999, this year they are expected to rise 4 to 4.5 percent, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm. And in the 12 months that ended in March, the occupancy rate in the state's hotels slid modestly to 67.6 percent from 68.1 percent. 
 While the supply of rooms grew by 2.1 percent, demand rose by just 1.3 percent, according to Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn. The national occupancy rate for the same period was 63.7 percent, up slightly from 63.2 percent a year earlier. 
New Jersey's hotels, particularly first-class lodgings, "suffered a bit in the first quarter because of the falloff in commercial travel and the decrease in overflow from Manhattan," said Sean Hennessey, director of the New York office of the hospitality and leisure practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers. "Still. the market is softening, not weakening."
John A. Fox, a senior vice president at PKF, a hotel and real estate consulting concern in New York, added that New Jersey's 67.6 percent occupancy rate was above the break-even mark for the industry, which is 55 to 60 percent. In addition, average daily room rates rose to $104 from $97 from last year.
And Joseph Simonetta, executive vice president of the New Jersey Hotel and Motel Association in Trenton, added, "Everyone is still building and not talking about an oversupply." 
A spate of hotel projects are under way or will begin by the fall, ranging from a Hampton Inn on Route 1 and 9 in Linden to a Hyatt atop a pier in Jersey City. There are also conversions, like the planned transformation of a historic mansion in Morristown into a boutique hotel, as well as major renovations, including the proposed refurbishing of a Travelodge in Livingston as part of its shift to a Sheraton. 
But reflecting the financing pinch as well as rising construction costs. the number of projects added this year in the nation, as in New Jersey, will be fewer than in 2000, and a similar situation will happen next year, said Bruce Ford. Mr. Ford is director of sales and marketing at Lodging Econometrics, a division of National Hotel Realty in Portsmouth, N.H.
Mr. Ford said lenders had tightened their financing recently because they found that they had more than enough hotels in their investment portfolios. He added that in the last 18 months these lenders had not been able to resell their hotel loans.
Most analysts say the softness, barring any economic tailspin, will be short, with a rebound in occupancy and room rates beginning this year's second half or early next year. Still, hotel operators are taking "a wait-and-see attitude, trying to understand the magnitude and duration," said Donna Quadri, a vice president of sales and marketing at Hotel RevMAX, a Manhattan-based company that tracks the lodging industry for hotel companies around the world. "Clients are ardently watching occupancy and room rates to determine what discount, if any, is required to keep customers."
In New Jersey, Mr. Hennessey said the summer "looks good, given the state's tourism base." But in the fall, he added, while the number of conventions and meetings "should hold," there will be "fewer people attending them." 
Among the major new hotel projects rising or planned in the state is the first new casino-hotel in Atlantic City in a dozen years. Mirage Hotel and the Boyd Gaming Corporation of Las Vegas are building the 2,010-room Borgata, designed in the style of a Tuscan village.
Other new hotels will also be near transportation hubs like Newark International Airport, which will be expanded and increase its passengers by 10 million, to 44 million a year, by 2010, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. There are plans for seven hotels, with 2,000 rooms, in the airport area, of which two, each with 200 rooms, are under way by Marriott International, the Washington-based chain. They are among the more than 20 hotels the chain has under way in the state. Despite the current economic backdrop, Marriott said it fully expected to meet its projected dates for completion. 
Among the few new full-service hotels is one planned in downtown Morristown. In September, the Applied Development Company of Hoboken will start work on a $24 million conversion of the former Vail mansion into a 101-room hotel. The mansion was built in 1918 by Theodore Vail, the first president of AT&T, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
THE Florentine-style mansion, last used as the municipal hall, will be renovated and a U-shaped addition will wrap around it. The addition will be clad in stucco to complement the granite and marble facade of the mansion, said Michael Barry, a principal at Applied. He added that when completed by the fall of 2002, the hotel would also have meeting rooms and a restaurant. Average daily room rates are expected to be $200. 
"This is an underserved market for upscale hotels," Mr. Barry said, noting that the building is close to the town's train station and accessible to local as well as area businesses. 
Similarly, developers plan to strip to its shell a three-story, 202-room Travelodge on Route 10 in Livingston and rebuild it as a 194-room Four Points Sheraton, that chain's low-rise brand. The new hotel will also include a catering hall and a restaurant. Daily room rates are expected to be $150 to $200.
The Kushner Companies of Florham Park will close on the purchase of the 5.8-acre-site in July. It will then develop the $20 million project with two partners in the next year, said Jeffrey Freireich, managing director at Kushner.
"This is a prime piece of real estate in a visible location, and there is a need for a quality hotel in the area," he said.
A 350-room Hyatt rising atop the pier at the Harborside Financial Center in Jersey City is the city's first full-service lodging on the riverfront. The hotel, with 20,000 square feet of meeting space, is to open by July 2002, said Dale Moulton, a senior vice president of development at Hyatt. His company is developing the hotel with the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust in Cranford that owns Harborside. 
Much of the new construction, both in the state and nationally, however, will be of limited-service hotels, which has been the trend for the last few years. Typically, they do not have the restaurants, shops and abundance of meeting rooms found in full-service hotels and are less costly to build. 
Mr. Fox, the analyst, said such hotels, which also have lower room rates than full-service lodgings, will do well "in down times, as business travelers tighten budgets."
In Linden, Inn America Hospitality Inc. of Iselin is to start construction this month on a 149-room Hampton Inn on Route 1 and 9. The $14 million hotel, expected to rise in the next 10 months, will take advantage "of the growth of major corporations in the greater Newark metropolitan area," said David DeCicco, the development company's executive vice president. That the hotel is also part of the 650,000-square-foot Aviation Plaza "ensures success," he added. The average daily room rate is expected to be $110. 
Aviation Plaza, now under way, is the redevelopment of 66 acres that were formerly part of the 188-acre Linden Municipal Airport site into up to 16 stores, including Home Depot and Target; restaurants; and a 14-screen movie theater. The hotel "will provide built-in business," said Louis Ceruzzi, president of Starwood Ceruzzi L.L.C. of Fairfield, Conn., which is developing the plaza with the Cappelli Development Company of Valhalla, N.Y. 
The Prime Hospitality Corporation of Fairfield has slowed its construction activity from around 30 properties in 1998 to five or six projects, said Douglas W. Vicari, the senior vice president and chief financial officer. "It's a game plan we have not felt needs to be adjusted today," he added.
In Mount Laurel, off Route 73, the company will open a 125-room, six-story AmeriSuites in September. And it is renovating and converting two former Howard Johnson lodgings to its Wellesley Inns and Suites brand. Each conversion costs $2 million to $3 million.
One Wellesley Inn with 149 rooms opened last month on Route 23 and Ratzer Road in Wayne. The other, with 100 rooms, is on Route 10 in Whippany and is to open in mid-August. The average daily room rate will be $65 to $70 at each. 
"There is some weakness in hotel demand," Mr. Vicari said, "but no one predicts the softness will last long, and we are setting up for that."

Pall Corp. Widens Plans for Layoffs
 Pall Corporation (NYSE: PLL) of East Hills has raised the number of jobs it will eliminate to 500, about 100 more jobs than it announced two weeks ago. The company will also take a fourth-quarter charge of under $10 million to cover the cost of the layoffs, which will affect about 5 percent of the global work force. 
 On Long Island, the company will reduce its work force by about 70 jobs, said Eric Krasnoff, chairman and chief executive. Jobs cut on Long Island will be across the board outside of sales and marketing positions, Mr. Krasnoff said.
Pall also warned it did not expect to meet analysts' consensus expectations for earnings. Pall released new earnings estimates for the fiscal year ending July 31 in the range of $1.08 and $1.13 a share. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thompson Financial projected earnings to reach $1.17 a share on average.
Pall also reported that third-quarter earnings dipped to $36.9 million, down from $41.8 million for the third quarter a year ago, on revenues that rose less than 1 percent to $321.1 million from $318.1 a year ago. Earnings were 30 cents a share, down from 34 cents a share in the third quarter last year.
The company manufactures filters that are used in the pharmaceutical, aerospace and semiconductor industries. Last year sales topped $1.2 billion.
Mr. Krasnoff said in a statement that foreign exchange rates, the semiconductor industry slowdown and the sluggish domestic economy affected third-quarter profitability.

Around the Island
Langer Biomechanics Group (Nasdaq: GAIT) of Deer Park reported a loss for its fiscal year of $1.51 million, on sales of $11.6 million. Last year, it reported a loss of $335,274, on sales of $11.1 million. Andrew H. Meyers, president and chief executive, said the company, which sells medical devices to doctors treating musculoskeletal disorders, expected to bring new products and services to market this summer. . . . NetSat Express of Hauppauge said it had signed a $3 million multiyear contract with SkyOnline, a McLean, Va., telecommunications company. . . . Long Island Commercial Bank (Nasdaq: LICB) of Islandia announced completion of a stock repurchase program initiated in April 1999. It has repurchased nearly 334,000 shares, or 19 percent of its outstanding shares of common stock, at an average price of $12.40.

HEADLINE: In Public, Making Them Look at Least Twice 

BYLINE:  By Valerie Cruice 

 BODY:
DID you know the tree of life is growing in Farmington? Or that in Bridgeport simple tools of the trade are breaking down walls stronger than brick? Were you aware that in Willimantic a 16-foot-high book is an open door, or that an aquatic core sample cascades down three stories just a few hundred feet from Long Island Sound in Groton? Did anybody ever point out the words of the 18th-century Scottish economist Adam Smith illuminating the way to greater understanding in New Britain? 
 These discoveries can be found in the specially commissioned art that adorns public buildings all over Connecticut. As a result of the Art in Public Spaces program, established by state law in 1978, more than 330 works of art have been installed at 60 sites in 30 towns and cities around the state. There are paintings, photographic works, sculptures, wall reliefs, fiber works, ceramic works, murals and environmental installations, according to the Connecticut Commission on the Arts, which manages the program for the state. (The program's Web site is www.ctarts.org/Artpub.htm.) 
 Linda Dente, program director of Art in Public Spaces, explained how the artists are found and matched to the site. There are three professional jurors who select the finalists from a slide bank that is kept at the Connecticut Commission on the Arts as a resource. The jury also meets with a representative from the site where the art will be installed, as well as the architect.
Lately, the Art in Public Spaces budget has been running about $1 million a year; the amount varies depending on the amount of bonds issued for construction. "This program is very much tied into the economy," Ms. Dente said. "When we're building a lot, we're doing a lot of commissions." By Valerie Cruice

HEADLINE: Is It a Grand Idea or Just a Pipe Dream? 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
FROM Oyster Bay to Rye in Westchester in a matter of minutes without seeing the light of day? Sounds like some sort of molecular transport system straight out of "Star Trek."
 But you could also do it by driving in a tunnel under Long Island Sound. And actually, it's hard to say which method is more improbable. Various transportation experts demur when asked where the money and political will to build such a tunnel would come from. 
 But they say a tunnel is a viable proposition from an engineering standpoint. The possibility of building an underground passage, including a roadway and rails, from Westchester to Long Island has been the subject of news conferences, forums and discussions with state transportation officials. 
As envisioned by its principal advocate, a Westchester County engineer named Alexander Saunders, the cross-Sound tunnel would be incorporated into a plan to replace the Tappan Zee Bridge. The Tappan Zee is nearing the end of its designed lifespan, and with maintenance costs mounting the state has begun seeking proposals for a new Hudson crossing.
Many advocates want a new bridge, or to fix the old one; Mr. Saunders not only wants a tunnel, but one that would extend far beyond the banks of the Hudson to Mahwah, N.J., on the border with New York, duplicating the New York Thruway west of the Hudson and Interstate 287 in Westchester, then diving under the Sound to pop up at the northern end of the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway in Syosset. Crossing parts of Rockland and Westchester counties, it would have several exits.
The entire 45-mile plan would create the longest transportation tunnel in the world. (The Seikan railway tunnel under the Tsuguru Straits in Japan is currently the longest, at 33.5 miles.)
Mr. Saunders conceded that if his grand tunnel idea were treated piecemeal, the tunnels under the waterways make the best sense from both economic and transportation perspectives.
But he insisted that tunnelling far into Rockland and across Westchester makes sense, and that extending the tube well into Nassau County would tie in to the Island's existing road network and would burrow under some of the North Shore nimbys who spearheaded the rejection of Robert Moses's proposal, three decades ago, for a bridge from Rye to Bayville.
Mr. Saunders insists that it is inappropriate to compare his project to the 6.5-mile Moses bridge.
"That was opposed because it was so intrusive at both ends and such a presence in the Sound, which is such a great area for sailing and other recreation," he said. "Obviously this would not be intrusive that way. I think the main issue to deal with is that it would make Long Island easier to get to and increase traffic there."
Mr. Saunders, a 62-year-old resident of Garrison, led the campaign to persuade the state Thruway Authority to consider the option of building a Tappan Tunnel as part of its three-year study to determine whether to replace or rehabilitate the Tappan Zee Bridge. It made no such commitment to the extended project, including the Sound tunnel.
But over the past few months, he has unveiled his grand scheme in public meetings and met with local elected officials and transportation officials, including John R. Platt, the Thruway Authority's executive director. Mr. Saunders has also met with representatives of major tunnel-boring companies.
"Lots of groups have taken a great interest, or at least been very polite," said Mr. Saunders, who runs his family's foundry supply company in Putnam County and pursues the tunnel idea as something between a hobby and a Quixotic obsession.
Mr. Saunders envisions a tube sunk 100 feet below the sand and gravel bottom of the Sound. It would contain roadways on an upper level and train tracks on the lower level for freight or passengers.
The job would require at least one, but probably several, huge tunneling machines. A machine made by a German company, Herrenknecht, simultaneously digs and lines a tunnel at about 30 to 40 feet per day. It is the diameter of a small Ferris wheel, weighs about 1,300 tons and would cost more than $50 million.
Mr. Saunders estimates that a tunnel under the Sound would cost about $8 billion, based on costs for similar tunnels in Europe.
Transportation officials say it would cost several times Mr. Saunders's estimate. The 31-mile Channel Tunnel connecting England to France cost about $15 billion, but it is a rail tunnel only, and narrower than Mr. Saunders's proposed tube.
He says that whatever the cost, a cross-Sound tunnel would more than pay for itself in terms of convenience and in toll revenue. He also argues that a tunnel would:
*Ultimately cost less than roadways and bridges, to build and maintain.
*Replace Interstate 287 and restore the land there for parks or development.
*Reduce congestion by containing more traffic lanes than existing surface roadways and eliminate the hazards of sun glare, snow and rain.
*Last some 50 years longer than the typical bridge and road projects.
*Eliminate the visual intrusion of bridge and highways.
*Allow for an inter-county rail system.
*Fight pollution by installing devices to "scrub" automobile emissions vented from the tunnel.
Few public figures on the Island will acknowledge being intrigued by the proposal. One of them is Neal M. Lewis, executive director of the Long Island Neighborhood Network, an environmental and civic advocacy group based in Massapequa.
"The idea of a Sound crossing has been around for a long time, and has always raised a lot of local concerns, but as a tunnel, it deserves a fresh look," he said, but added, "Obviously, it's a long shot."
Mr. Lewis was speaking by cell phone and said he had just battled his way through Memorial Day traffic on his way upstate.
"It's always a mess having to go through the city in order to get north of the city, so it would be more convenient," he said of a tunnel. "But also, knowing that you can drive onto Long Island and hang a left and go up to Connecticut could also make through traffic worse. And wherever such a tunnel would terminate, there would be a huge traffic impact."
Many transportation people call the project a true pipe dream, saying that while constructing it is feasible, getting it approved -- or even considered -- is not.
Jon Orcutt, associate director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a nonprofit advocacy group, said a cross-Sound tunnel project would certainly take a back seat to other transportation projects with much more support in the metropolitan area. They include a Long Island Rail Road link to Grand Central Terminal, a Second Avenue subway in Manhattan, a rail freight tunnel under New York Harbor from New Jersey to Brooklyn and an expanded commuter rail line to New Jersey and Rockland County.
Brian Muellers, the Nassau County legislator who represents parts of Syosset and several communities northward, said he would fight such a project tooth and nail.
"It will never happen as long as I'm a legislator and have any say whatsoever, whether that's six months or 10 years," said Mr. Muellers, chairman of the Legislature's public works committee.
"If they can get this tunnel to the end of the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway without moving one single tree, it's one thing," he said. "But if one tree has to be moved or one space invaded, then it should not happen. It only means building more roads and clogging our downtown streets and smaller arteries, and it encourages more people to get in their cars, get on the road and drive, instead of staying local and enjoying their communities and shopping there."
Mr. Saunders said that during construction, a large site would be needed as a staging area for equipment, and possibly after completion for train parking.
He proposed using the Cerro Wire site, a disused factory near South Oyster Bay Road and the Long Island Expressway. It happens that there are well-organized community groups in that area that have been fighting a proposal to build a shopping mall on the site.
Judith Jacobs, the presiding officer of the Nassau County Legislature, said the community would surely oppose making the Cerro Wire site a tunnel depot or busy staging area.
"Certainly no one would look agreeably on having some kind of depot there," she said. "It would bring traffic and oversaturation in the area, and that was the very reason we opposed the shopping mall."
In recent years, transportation groups considered a bridge from Suffolk to Connecticut, but a state study found that a bridge would cost $20 to $25 billion, depending on its location, and would never pay for itself.
Eileen Peters, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Transportation in Hauppauge, said that the state recently considered two proposals for a Suffolk-to-Connecticut tunnel. One would connect the Sagtikos Parkway to Westport, and another would run from the William Floyd Parkway to New Haven. Both plans were deemed too costly and ineffective in relieving congestion.
"They were not viable recommendations," Ms. Peters said. "It didn't make sense from a congestion point of view. As many cars would come on the Island as would go off, so it would not relieve our traffic whatsoever."
Lee E. Koppelman, who has been executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board since 1965, said that although a tunnel would draw less local opposition than a bridge, "in my opinion, it would never happen. But it does make a good conversation piece every few years."
Mr. Koppelman pointed out that the Throgs Neck and Whitestone bridges are not far from the Queens-Nassau border.
"The added convenience doesn't make it worth the problems," he said. "Rye is not that much farther up than the Bronx."
Mr. Koppelman compared the tunnel idea to a proposal to dam the Sound and make it a freshwater lake that would supply water to Long Island. A bridge to Connecticut would be built on the dam.

HEADLINE: RESTAURANTS; 
Hold the Airs

BYLINE:  By DAVID CORCORAN 

DATELINE: NUTLEY 

 BODY:
AN AMERICAN BISTRO is the sort of restaurant that defiantly refuses to put on airs. It is what it is. Even its name is a kind of dare: more Italian-American than American, more trattoria than bistro, it was christened when the chef and owner, a homegrown Nutley guy named Ken Mahon, heard a friend say that a place with such a nondescript name could never succeed.
 It inhabits a worn stretch of Washington Avenue where Nutley's well-ordered residential blocks fade into a low-slung industrial miscellany -- railroad tracks, auto body shops, a sanitation truck garage. It's small, with just 17 tables and a long bar, its three television sets usually tuned to sports. The main dining room is pink and unadorned, its blinds drawn against the dreary streetscape. 
 But in six years, Mr. Mahon has overcome all handicaps of name, location and size, and methodically built his little bistro into a walloping success. In my two visits, one on a Saturday and one on a weeknight, no table stayed empty for long. Servers bustled purposefully through the narrow room, balancing enormous trays of food on one shoulder. 
The success is easy to understand. The reasons are apparent in the unforced good cheer of the voice at the other end of the reservation line, in the easy welcome of the hostesses, in the giveaway antipasto platter on your table. Without pandering to some suburban common denominator, Mr. Mahon -- a bluff, compact man of 42 with more than a trace of eastern Essex County in his attitude and accent -- is making a mission out of keeping customers happy.
He likes to come out of the kitchen and chat with regulars, he says, but only to a point. "If I'm not in there cooking and people see me out front," he told me, "they're going to say, 'Where's my freakin' food?' " He disdains chefs who cover up second-rate ingredients with fancy sauces: "People say, 'That's great chicken -- what do you do to it?' What I do is, I buy good chicken." 
That antipasto platter gives a hint of what lies in wait for the rest of the meal. There's nothing on it that you couldn't find in your local deli, if that deli makes its own mozzarella and buys only the best semolina bread, roasted peppers, black olives and the dense, savory sausage called soppressata (here pronounced "spressat' ").
The menu takes a long path through Little Italy staples (fried calamari, zuppa di clams, the usual pastas with the usual sauces) and trattoria basics (osso buco, wild mushroom ravioli) to what might actually qualify as American bistro fare (blackened swordfish, potato-crusted sole). You might think that with so few seats and so many regulars, there wouldn't be much call for some of these dishes, but An American Bistro has it down to a science. Service is well timed and efficient, and you can march briskly through your meal or linger over it.
Appetizers on a "bistro specials" menu include a terrific scungilli salad in the spirit of that free antipasto: plain and simple, but also gorgeous in its integration of flavor and texture, with the chewy, faintly briny scungilli playing off against silken roasted pepper and tangy, crunchy arugula. Another salad incorporates many large shrimp, a pile of perfectly cooked broccoli rape, more of those roasted peppers, and enough garlic to lift the gross domestic product of Gilroy, Calif., the Garlic Capital of the World. 
An entree-size appetizer of mussels and Manila clams Fra Diavolo incorporates dozens of flawless mollusks in a homemade tomato sauce that glows with the heat of red pepper. The children at our table were pleased by unsauced fried food like calamari and rock shrimp; adults were spotted sneaking samples.
"Please Save Room for Dessert!" the menu advises. This sound advice is hard to follow. Main courses come on platters the size of a small college campus, and they follow the same successful formula as the appetizers -- basic, carefully chosen ingredients, accurately cooked. Pecan-crusted rainbow trout with sauteed grapes is about as adventurous as Mr. Mahon gets, and it works just fine, the grapes giving off little explosions of juice and sweetness that play off against the mild fish and a tart lemon-butter sauce.
I was underwhelmed by both of the meat entrees we tried, lamb osso buco and filet mignon with scampi sauce. But we had great luck with seafood. A spicy, salty Cajun coating was just restrained enough to complement a fine piece of tuna rather than overwhelm it. Seafood marechiara offers an extravagance of shrimp, mussels, clams and calamari over a great bed of garlic-scented linguini. My favorite entree, by several lengths, was a glorious, exuberant plate of batter-fried soft-shell crabs over smashed potatoes and lemon butter, topped with onion rings. Save room for dessert, indeed.
But when your cheerful server arrives, bearing a platter so packed with sweets that they seem to gasp for breath, what can you do but give in? Some are made in house, some ordered in, but given Mr. Mahon's high standards I'm not sure it matters. His cannoli are far too sweet for my taste, but I couldn't get enough of his tiramisu, a striking, deeply caloric confection in which the ladyfingers are not merely a layer of the dish but protrude like the fingers of a baseball glove. 
Mr. Mahon is not a wine connoisseur, he says bluntly, with an audible curl of the lip at the fancy French word. For his long and fairly priced wine list, complete with vintage dates and useful classifications (lighter and richer for both reds and whites), he listens to his suppliers and his regular customers, and he buys what they recommend. He has good suppliers and good customers. He's earned them.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION; 
The Ivy Walls Are Climbing

BYLINE:  By ANNE RUDERMAN 

DATELINE: PRINCETON 

 BODY:
Matthew Harrigan did not need an alarm clock last semester. A construction crew working on the Genomics Institute -- with its 7 a.m. start time -- would wake him on mornings he had class as well as on mornings he did not.
 The workers outside Mr. Harrigan's dormitory were among the several hundred who pour into Princeton each day in one of the university's biggest building booms. 
 "I don't think I've ever seen a time when there was more construction of both the new and the refurbishing kind going on," said the writer John McPhee, who not only grew up here as the son of a university doctor but who now teaches a writing seminar here himself. "I guess it's just a matter of making hay while the sun shines with the kinds of funds that the university has acquired." 
What seems like a building boom has been a decade-long spurt of red brick and precast concrete, which at a cost of $540 million has contributed 22 new buildings to the campus as well as major renovations of many of the older ones. The kind of money that has driven this vast expansion has come from a combination of the university's five-year 250th anniversary campaign -- which has so far raised $1.14 billion -- and an unusually high return during the 90's on the university's endowment.
The person behind the boom and the funds that fueled it is Harold T. Shapiro, who will step down as Princeton's president on June 15. Early in Mr. Shapiro's tenure, he drew up a master plan for campus development, something the university had been without for more than 30 years.
"We knew that we would be planning some capital campaigns in the future, and we decided that rather than do construction on an ad hoc basis and make decisions that weren't carefully thought out, we would really hire someone who could help us produce a master plan," Mr. Shapiro said.
Not that the building boom has been greeted with open arms by everyone. At the Princeton Forrestal Center, the university's 2,200-acre research and development site three miles from campus, a proposal to construct 220 apartments on 488 acres of land that the university bought from Princeton Nurseries in 1986 has disturbed environmentalists and nearby residents. 
Charlie Dieterich, co-chairman of the Friends of Princeton Nursery Lands, worries less about the housing development than the changes in the infrastructure and the office buildings that will follow.
"There are many things that the university is pressing the region on, both incredible traffic growth and what we consider to be destruction of historic resources," Mr. Dietrich said.
David H. Knights, director of marketing at the Princeton Forrestal Center, grimaced as he acknowledged that the project had become a "lightening rod" for sprawl issues.
To be sure, the growth pains being experienced by Princeton are not unique among the country's top-ranked universities, which are enjoying the fruits of a decade-long run-up in the stock market.
At M.I.T., the campus is in the middle of a $1.5 billion campaign to increase the square footage of campus buildings by 10 percent over the next 10 years. And Harvard is putting a chunk of its recently completed $2 billion fund-raising campaign into creating new facilities. The university is looking at a period of unprecedented growth, said Mary Power, senior director of community relations at Harvard. 
At Princeton, the Carl C. Icahn Laboratory of the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics -- a $20 million gift of the Icahn Family Foundation -- which provided Mr. Harrigan with his wake-up call each morning, is a prime example of what Princeton's building boom is all about.
The building itself -- a $35 million gift from Peter Lewis, who graduated in 1955 -- forms one third of an elliptical arch, which provides a firm edge to what one university vice president, Thomas Wright, calls the confused growth of the southern dormitories. Built in the 1960's, the dorms lack clear sight lines and ample open space.
Inside the 90,000-square-foot building -- designed by the architect Rafael Vinoly, who was also responsible for the stadium that opened in 1998 -- laboratories will be divided with moveable walls and equipped with modular, Lego-like, benches, both of which can be removed to allow for reconfigurations between physics, chemistry and biology laboratory space. 
"It had to be flexible because it is not possible to predict the kind of science that will be done in the building during its lifetime," said Shirley M. Tilghman, the former director of the Lewis-Sigler Genomics Institute and future president of the university.
The university has also built or is currently building an all-glass engineering library, a $48 million campus center, two parking garages and two dormitories. In addition, a dorm renovation project has been begun.
As robust as the economy had been, providing money for the many projects, Mr. Shapiro himself has an impressive record as far as cornerstones go. Kathy Marquis, a reference historian at the University of Michigan, said the Ann Arbor campus grew tremendously under Mr. Shapiro despite hard times. During his eight years at the university, the campus grew by 31 buildings, including a $295 million renovation and construction project at its hospitals and a $60 million chemistry building.
While Mr. Shapiro brought his knack for groundbreaking with him, Mr. Wright said that the past decade at Princeton had been only the second busiest in the last 50 years. Surpassing it were the 1960's -- the decade of the space race -- when the government poured money into higher education to develop science and engineering facilities.
Before that, an early-20th-century building boom, lasting from 1897 until the Depression, gave the campus its now characteristic Gothic look. Under the direction of Ralph Adams Cram, much of what is now referred to as the historic campus took shape. Mr. Cram, who was a great believer in formal unity, built a stretch of dormitories along the university's western edge as well as the graduate college in 1913 and the university chapel in 1925.
The current plan, designed by Machado & Silvetti Associates of Boston, conceives of the campus in terms of chronology and the types of material used rather than zoning and function, said Roldolfo Machado.
"You cannot treat the campus like it's the same campus all throughout because its not," said Mr. Machado. "It has been evolving over 200 years, and it reflects the different conditions."
Yet many people here -- from campus architects to the students living in the them -- suggest that 1960's-style dormitories were an architectural mistake.
"Most people feel that the 60's were a sad time for architectural design for the most part," said Mr. Wright, "and unfortunately, a very great deal of building was done at Princeton in the 60's."
At one time, Princeton was the most daring and creative of university campuses in terms of hiring the best architects and asking them to do the right project.
"That mantle in a sense has been past," said Ralph Lerner, dean of the architecture school.
Undergraduates who are majoring in architecture, generally the harshest of architectural critics, tend to agree.
"Princeton won't hire an architect with really strong style or design ideas," said Steven Caputo, a senior. "They're not going to hire someone who'll take this opportunity to really build a piece that's important for his own career."
But architectural innovation may not be the only criterion when it comes to campus development -- despite the impressive price tag. Jon D. Hlafter, director of physical planning, said Princeton did not hire architects to design buildings with too personal a stamp, but rather ones with an eye toward future use.
"Meeting the needs of the user, we'd like to believe, is more important than what architect is selected to do the work," said Mr. Hlafter (pronounced LAF-ter). 
He said campus building today must have a combination of functionality and efficiency altogether different from when the elegant stonework of Blair Hall set the architectural standard for a half century.
Moreover, the speed with which blueprints now become reality is due to the materials used. Unlike the handmade masonry structures, Princeton's buildings come practically prefabricated, reducing overhead and requiring little skill. Most of the masons who built the traditional Princeton campus, Mr. Hlafter said, came from the Italian town of Petronello, Princeton's sister city, early in the century. They and their descendants have since died or moved on.
"There are very few who really have more experience with complicated stonework," said Mr. Hlafter.
Masonry may soon be more than a hypothetical, though. Princeton recently made a commitment to increase its undergraduate enrollment by 500 and is designing a new dormitory cluster in the center of the campus.
Mr. Wright said that there was strong sentiment among the trustees to make the new buildings look as much as possible likethe older buildings, though not everyone agrees. Students like Darren Joe, a junior who made it a priority to live in a Gothic dormitory next year -- was skeptical of a new design.
"As much as I'd like them to build more Gothic buildings, it's not the time period," said Mr. Joe. "You just don't build those kind of buildings now. It seems kind of fake."
Where some see a hodgepodge, Mr. McPhee sees something else. "I think one of the wonders of the Princeton campus is that its architecture is so eclectic and that it reflects things about the various times in which the buildings were built," he said. "There's building of all kinds of styles, and I would like to see that roll on thorough time."

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS; 
Alexandra Yurchyshyn, Rajesh Anantharaman

 BODY:
Alexandra Elan Yurchyshyn and Rajesh Anantharaman were married yesterday by the Rev. Andrea Maier, an Episcopal priest, at St. Bartholomew's Church in New York. A Hindu ceremony will be held today at the Akbar restaurant in Edison, N.J., led by Poojari Krishna Bhattar, a Hindu priest. On Friday night, there was a Mehndi ceremony, in the courtyard of the couple's co-op building in Manhattan, where the bride's hands were painted with henna in order to celebrate her marriage and bring her good luck. 
 The couple will be known as Mr. and Mrs. Ananth. 
 The bride, 28, is a research associate at Appleseed, an economic consulting firm in New York. She graduated from Smith College and received a master's degree in urban planning earlier this month from New York University. Her mother, Anita Yurchyshyn of Boston, designs, administers and teaches special English programs for foreign employees. The bride's father, the late George Yurchyshyn, was a senior vice president of Bank Boston and later the director general of Ukraine Fund, an investment company in Kiev, whose focus is on Ukrainian companies. 
The bridegroom, 29, is a manager in New York of the strategic business unit for Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, a management consulting company. He graduated from Columbia and received an M.B.A. from Yale. He is the son of Chitra and A. Anantharaman of Englewood, N.J. His mother is a chairwoman of the subcommittee on community outreach for the New Jersey, New York and Connecticut branch of the Sai Baba Devotee Group, a Hindu religious organization, in Englewood. His father is the chief executive of Graphtex, a holding company in Lodi, N.J., for a number of manufacturing companies.
The couple, who are being married in both the Christian and the Hindu traditions, met five years ago in the basement of a synagogue.
"It was a New Year's Eve party, and I was ready to call it a night, when a friend of mine ordered me to dance with Raj so that she could continue dancing with one of his friends," Ms. Yurchyshyn recalled recently. 
When he was leaving, Mr. Anantharaman asked one of Ms. Yurchyshyn's friends for her number, which she wrote on a matchbox. Or so he thought. A few days later when he called, he was greeted with the recording, "This phone is not in service."
"The fact that a friend gave me the number made me think it was an honest mistake," Mr. Anantharaman said. The friend had been more careful with the spelling of Ms. Yurchyshyn's name, and Mr. Anantharaman was able get her number by calling directory assistance. 
He invited her out the following weekend, but when the day arrived, she said she had the flu and asked for a rain check. Instead, Mr. Anantharaman brought her a bottle of aspirin and took her out for chicken soup at a deli around the corner.
"I thought that was the sweetest thing in the world," Ms. Yurchyshyn said. "I thought, anyone willing to bring me aspirin and take me out for chicken soup when I am sick is certainly worth going out with a few more times."

A Second Chance for a Landmark That Lost Its Luster, Bulb by Bulb

BYLINE:  By E. E. LIPPINCOTT 

 BODY:
It has been called tacky and ill conceived, and likened, derogatorily, to Coney Island. But fans of the Sunnyside Arch have succeeded in obtaining money so that the structure, with its hundreds of tiny light bulbs, can once again light up the night sky.
 Built on the southern side of Queens Boulevard at 46th Street in 1983 by a community group that is now defunct, the cream-colored two-story arch had an embarrassingly short heyday. It seems no one took into account how hard it would be to replace the tiny bulbs, so, after shining brightly for a few years, the arch fell into disuse. 
 The arch was intended to revitalize a sagging commercial strip. Now, covered with peeling paint, graffiti, old posters and fliers, it seems to mirror the area's decline. At night, derelicts sit on the benches beneath the arch, which reads, "Sunnyside." The commercial corridor consists of 99-cent stores, discount liquor shops and Chinese takeout restaurants.
"It was an overly grand gesture in that it was not matched with reality," Walter L. McCaffrey, the local City Council member, said of the arch. 
But people like Luke Adams, director of the Sunnyside Chamber of Commerce, think repairing the arch can still help revive the area. He, along with some local residents, Mr. McCaffrey and Community Board 2, got Borough President Claire Shulman to agree to designate $75,000 from her 2002 discretionary fund for the arch.
Ms. Shulman had offered money for the arch a few years ago, but it was unclear if the money was going to be used to refurbish the structure or tear it down. So she withdrew the offer. Now, however, things are back on track. The arch will once again illuminate the corridor and, it is hoped, attract new and better businesses. 
But some people are unlikely to love the refurbished arch. Mary Scarlos, who has lived in Sunnyside since 1942, said, 'I've hated it from the day they put it up." E. E. LIPPINCOTT

From Ocean to Pond, With More Room to Swim

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS 

 BODY:
 LAST spring, Martha A. Tacy, then a marketing director at the Lotus Development Corporation, was in a business meeting when she had an epiphany of sorts. "All of a sudden," she recalled, "I looked around and thought, 'What the heck am I doing here?' " 
 Ms. Tacy was at a three-day, bimonthly conference with about 20 employees from Lotus's parent, I.B.M, one of many meetings she was required to attend during her 11 years at the company. As she sat at the boardroom table, she recalled, she realized that not much business was being accomplished. "That's when I decided I no longer wanted to work for a corporate bureaucracy," she said.
A few months later, she left Lotus to become a vice president at Collaborative Communications, a public relations company in Cambridge, Mass., that had fewer than 40 employees. "Now, when I have an idea, I get to act on it immediately instead of sitting around arguing about it in a meeting all day," said Ms. Tacy, who is 38. "I feel like I've discovered a whole new world." 
Just a few years ago, such a move from a big-name corporation to a much smaller company might have been considered a risk, not to mention a loss in prestige, and plenty of people may still view it that way. But more professionals in all kinds of industries are now making similar moves, career experts say, especially as big businesses continue to eliminate jobs in response to the economic downturn. 
Of the more than 570,000 American workers who were laid off this year through April, two-thirds were at large corporations, said John A. Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a job placement firm in Northbrook, Ill., that tracks hiring trends. 
"Of course, small businesses are just as vulnerable to job losses as big companies," Mr. Challenger said. "But what is different about them is that there are always new job creations that occur in this economy. That primarily comes from the small-business community."
And some small companies have been reluctant to cut their payrolls, he noted, because many of them struggled to find and retain good workers when the economy was stronger and the job market tighter. At the end of April, 26 percent of the companies surveyed by the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 500,000 small-business owners, said their No. 1 problem was still a scarcity of skilled workers. That was unchanged from March, although down from the 33 percent average last year.
"Smaller firms don't have any extra fat," said Jeffrey Schneider, president of Schneider Legal Search Inc., a recruiting company in Manhattan. He said the job market for lawyers alone was still hot, especially at smaller firms. "It's the larger firms that are doing all the cutting," he said.
WORKERS who voluntarily leave larger companies for small ones usually do not do so for job security or money. Most are looking to play broader roles in their companies.
"At a larger company, you rise up a very narrow ladder," said Frederick W. Ball, a career consultant in Manhattan and co-author of "Impact Hiring: The Secrets of Hiring a Superstar" (Prentice Hall Press). "If you're a finance person, you're in finance and that's it. You may never be able to leave that area."
Colman O'Murchu, 36, said he felt stifled before leaving GlaxoSmithKline, the drug maker, early this year, shortly after it was created by the merger of SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome. Mr. O'Murchu had worked at SmithKline Beecham for 13 years, and as a project manager for its worldwide supply division, he said, his career had hit a roadblock.
He said he had yearned to gain experience in marketing and business development. He even earned a master's degree in public administration during his tenure, but he said executives at SmithKline were unreceptive to any career changes. "They basically told me to keep focusing on my current job," he said.
In January, Mr. O'Murchu left the company and joined Tangerine Technologies, a 12-person software company based in Philadelphia, as director of business development. Now he spends his work days hunkered down with Tangerine's chief operating officer, contemplating the company's next strategic moves. He is also involved in all hiring decisions and recently rewrote the business plan. "I'm doing stuff I never would have been allowed to do at my old company," Mr. O'Murchu said. "It's tremendously fulfilling."
Ms. Tacy, too, said her new job gave her the opportunity to gain experience she never would have obtained at her previous one. As a vice president at Collaborative Communications, she must figure out a company sales strategy and has even gone out on sales calls.
"Until I started this job, I didn't think I'd ever have the confidence to make a sales call," Ms. Tacy said. "Now I'm doing it all the time, and it's really built up my self-esteem -- and my resume."
Workers at smaller companies can move quickly up the corporate ladder. When Tina Bell left her job as an audit manager at Ernst & Young last August to join WizardWorld Inc., a pop-culture collectibles company based in Manhattan, she not only received a loftier title -- vice president for finance and administration -- but also a substantially bigger paycheck, she said.
Her main responsibility at WizardWorld, which has 29 employees, is to develop a financial plan and to make sure that the company reaches its quarterly financial goals. "There's no one above me except for the C.E.O.," said Ms. Bell, 35, who said she was "a small fish in a big pond" at Ernst & Young. 
"Now, I get to be a pretty big fish," she added. 
OF course, people who leave large companies may also forfeit many benefits and perks, like in-house gyms and child-care centers, not to mention more flexible hours. A study conducted last year by William M. Mercer Inc., the benefits consulting firm based in New York, found that while large and small companies alike typically offered basic health care, profit-sharing and 401(k) plans, the larger companies were more likely to offer lifestyle benefits like job sharing, flexible hours and telecommuting. Thirty-six percent of the larger companies, for example, offered job sharing as an option to employees, compared with 17 percent of smaller companies.
Big organizations also tend to offer the latest in high technology, as well as extensive training opportunities, secretarial help and other support. "Every department at my old job had its own server, so Internet access was much quicker," said Hunter Blankenbaker, 27, who in September left Computer Associates, the software company in Islandia, N.Y., that has more than 22,000 employees. Mr. Blankenbaker joined G. S. Schwartz & Company, a 40-person investor relations business in Manhattan. 
He said he missed the free breakfasts at his old company -- and the gym, which he used every day at lunchtime. "I love my new job, but I hated to leave that gym," he said, adding that he now pays $120 month to belong to a fitness club.
Others who have made the jump from big to small have also had to say goodbye to the chance to travel overseas. At Lotus, Ms. Tacy lived in London for a year and traveled to India and China. "I saw more of the world in 11 years at Lotus than most people see in their entire life," she said.
Having both large- and small-business experience may be the best mix. Some executives from large companies say they are wary of hiring candidates with mainly small-business experience. "The ideal candidate is going to have some big-world experience," said J. Thomas Van Berkem, senior vice president for human resources at WellPoint, a health care services company in Thousand Oaks, Calif. One problem with candidates from small companies, Mr. Van Berkem said, is that they do not necessarily know how to navigate bureaucratic obstacles. "The sheer number of steps they have to go through to order stationery might become overwhelming," he said.
But many people who have made the move say they are not sorry. Mr. Blankenbaker said the little sacrifices he made to adapt to a smaller company were well worth it. "I used to be a low man on the totem pole," he said. "Now I'm at a company where the C.E.O. walks by and pats me on the back and says, 'Let's go get a drink.' That makes me feel like I'm doing something that's really making a difference."
Mr. O'Murchu's boss, Todd Johnson, chief executive of Tangerine Technologies, saw value in having someone from a big-name company on his staff. "People who come out of a larger corporate environment are good catches for us because they typically already have built relationships with a lot of larger companies," he said. 
Mr. Johnson said that when Mr. O'Murchu came to Tangerine, he had a long list of business contacts. That list eventually turned into clients for Tangerine. "These relationships were crucial to the evolution of our business," he said.

HEADLINE: The World Gets Tough On Fixing Prices 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
MEETING clandestinely at an airport hotel outside London, top executives from the leading makers of a crucial raw material for forging steel reached an agreement to set up a global cartel.
 The material was graphite electrodes, rods used for heating scrap metal into steel. The industry producing the rods had recently consolidated, reducing supplies and removing a handful of smaller competitors. 
 By the time the meeting nine years ago was over, the executives -- from France, Germany, Japan and the United States -- had agreed on four things: that prices had to rise promptly, that smaller companies would quickly follow patterns of the leaders, that discounts would not be offered and that market shares would remain unchallenged.
Over the next five years, in a series of meetings and conference calls, the executives and lower-level managers put the plan in place. Using code names like BMW, Pinot and Wave, they exchanged secret agreements to carve up the market, driving up the price of graphite electrodes by more than 60 percent by 1997. 
But the cartel began to unravel that year, after a steel maker complained to federal investigators about the lack of competition and after one company, taking advantage of a controversial amnesty program started by the government in 1993, provided important leads in exchange for a commitment not to be prosecuted.
When the Mitsubishi Corporation was convicted last month of participating in a global price-fixing conspiracy, the case became the second largest involving price-fixing in Justice Department history, after one involving a vitamin cartel. Equally important, it typifies a push to uncover and prosecute price-fixing and global cartels that was begun early in the Clinton administration and that is expected to remain a high priority in the Bush administration even while other areas of antitrust policy undergo rethinking.
The antitrust division, once a small and sleepy backwater of the Justice Department, has become a power center against white-collar crime. It has filed some of the government's biggest criminal cases and shaken up a diverse range of industries as it reveals a seamy side of globalization -- international cartels. 
Although criminal defense lawyers have questioned the fairness of the amnesty program, no one doubts that the global price-fixing collusions already exposed have affected every American consumer. They have raised prices for gasoline, vitamins and soft drinks. They have made it more expensive for wealthy patrons and museums to buy paintings and sculptures at auctions. And they have fixed prices for the dynamite and the ammonium nitrate used in the coal and metal mining industries.
Investigators have uncovered a 17-year conspiracy among American, German and Japanese producers of sorbates, a food preservative used in products ranging from cheese to baked goods, that affected more than $1 billion in sales in the United States. 
They have also exposed a cartel involving major American, Belgian and Dutch marine construction companies, which build and move the huge offshore oil and gas drilling platforms in places like the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The conspirators fixed contracts in an industry with annual sales of $1 billion, and their increases ultimately contributed to higher prices at the pump.
Taking the lead from the United States, governments in Europe and Asia are beginning to take price-fixing more seriously. Britain recently adopted an amnesty program similar to the American one, which is intended to encourage companies to step forward and acknowledge their roles in such cartels. And more and more countries that historically have not been troubled by executives meeting to collude on prices and production are toughening their laws.
Last month, in the graphite electrode case, the United States government obtained the final corporate fine, $134 million from Mitsubishi. That brought total fines in the case to $437 million. During the investigation, Robert J. Koehler, chairman of SGL Carbon A.G., paid $10 million, the highest antitrust fine against an executive in American history. Two other executives, Robert Krass, chairman of UCAR International, and Robert J. Hart, the chief operating officer, pleaded guilty, paid large fines and received prison sentences.
ALL told, the antitrust division has won fines -- corporate and individual -- of more than $1.7 billion in the last four years. 
In the price-fixing case involving vitamins, investigators concluded that more than $5 billion in commerce was affected. The cartel, which included industry giants like F. Hoffmann-La Roche and BASF A.G., reached agreements on prices and production levels, directly victimizing corporate giants like General Mills, Kellogg, Coca-Cola, Tyson Foods and Procter & Gamble. Prosecutors say those companies, in turn, passed on billions of dollars in inflated costs to American consumers -- anyone who took a vitamin, drank a glass of milk or ate a bowl of cereal.
Over all, the roster of defendants in the United States alone reads like a criminal version of the United Nations. In recent years, executives from Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea and Switzerland have been convicted of cartel crimes. Earlier this year, a Japanese executive became the first from that country to plead guilty in the United States; he is awaiting sentencing.
The government's highest-profile case is now headed to trial in New York. Last month, a grand jury indicted A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of the auction house Sotheby's, and Sir Anthony Tennant, his counterpart at Christie's. Sir Anthony has vowed to remain in Britain, where he cannot be extradited, because its government does not impose criminal liability on an executive engaged in price-fixing. Mr. Taubman has said he will fight the indictment that the two men conspired to fix commission fees charged to more than 130,000 customers over six years. The trial could begin this fall.
THE roots of the current wave of prosecutions here go back more than a century. In 1890, a Republican senator from Ohio, John Sherman, sponsored legislation that made any agreement in restraint of trade a crime. The law, later toughened, imposed a maximum fine of $5,000 and a prison term of one year. President Theodore Roosevelt's administration made the first aggressive use of the act in combating major monopolies, and it was under President William Howard Taft that the law was used against Standard Oil and the American Tobacco Company.
As a weapon against price-fixing, the Sherman Antitrust Act was rarely used before 1938, when Thurman Arnold, one of the great antitrust prosecutors, joined the Justice Department. Over the next five years, 220 of the 330 cases he brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act included criminal charges.
The more recent takeoff in investigations and prosecutions is a result of both economic forces and changes in the way the Justice Department approaches such cases. Throughout the world, broad deregulation has begun to make many governments that cared little about price-fixing in the days before laissez-faire capitalism more sensitive to price and production manipulations that undermine free markets. Still, until recent years, few foreign countries imposed criminal liability on executives for price-fixing.
In the United States, though, investigations flourished because Congress gave the prosecutors a bigger stick to use against conspirators just as the prosecutors found a way to offer a fatter carrot to entice their cooperation.
In the 1970's and 1980's, Congress increased the potential penalties for executives convicted of antitrust violations. In 1974, violations once considered misdemeanors became felonies, and maximum prison terms rose to three years from one. Maximum fines grew from $50,000 in 1955 to a virtually unlimited amount by 1991. Corporate sentencing guidelines gave the Justice Department the authority to seek financial penalties as high as twice the gain from the crime or twice the amount of the victims' losses. 
At the antitrust division, meanwhile, a new corporate leniency program, granting significant incentives for early cooperation, was adopted in August 1993 -- one of the first initiatives of Anne K. Bingaman after President Bill Clinton appointed her to head the division. Under an older policy formulated in 1978, leniency was discretionary and not available after an investigation opened. 
The new policy made amnesty automatic if the company came in before an investigation began and permitted broad amnesty afterward to the first company to offer assistance. It also covered all executives from that company who cooperated, a significant inducement because violations of the Sherman Act carry a potential prison sentence of three years for every count, in addition to virtually limitless fines.
"The amnesty program is the division's most effective generator of large cases, and it is the department's most successful leniency program," said James M. Griffin, a deputy assistant attorney general in the antitrust division who heads its criminal enforcement office and plays the pivotal role of deciding which cases will be filed.
"The program is unique," he said. "No other U.S. voluntary disclosure program offers as great an opportunity or incentive for companies to self-report and cooperate."
Almost immediately, the change could be seen in the quantity and quality of tips coming to prosecutors. Before the rule, the division reported an average of one amnesty request a year. Since the change, it is one a month.
The program works, prosecutors say, because it is often the corporate lawyers or their counterparts at law firms who, responding to a customer complaint or subpoena, discover the potential criminal problems and who understand that their clients can reap huge benefits by going to the Justice Department early. 
In fact, the amnesty program has come to fruition at a time when prosecutors say it is not uncommon for executives involved in price-fixing to take heightened steps to deceive company lawyers, concealing meetings and using special codes, out of fear that the lawyers will turn in their clients. 
Mr. Griffin and his predecessor, Gary R. Spratling, routinely tell lawyers the story of one company's general counsel, who, suspecting problems, insisted on accompanying an executive every minute he was meeting a foreign counterpart, even when the executive went to the bathroom. The counsel was comforted when the two men exchanged business cards and engaged in the kind of small talk that indicated they had never met before. 
But it turned out that the entire incident was staged to deceive the lawyer. The two executives had known each other for years and had dined, played golf and worked together in an enormous global price-fixing conspiracy.
Aside from assisting prosecutors, the amnesty program has another benefit, officials say. It adds a level of uncertainty to any conspiracy, forcing executives engaged in price-fixing to be constantly second-guessing their partners in crime.
"If you're looking to deter cartel behavior, by increasing the fear of detection you can affect conduct," said John M. Nannes, acting head of the antitrust division. "Amnesty injects a risk into every conspiracy."
But defense lawyers say the program can skew justice, because amnesty is given not to the least culpable conspirator but rather to the first informer.
"You get a race to the courthouse, the downside of which is that companies can be so hasty that they report about things that aren't really criminal or shouldn't be treated as criminal but nonetheless prompt criminal investigations," said Alison Smith, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the antitrust division who is now a partner at Vinson & Elkins in Houston. She said she was concerned that such programs "offer inducements to testify" that can distort what executives say. "Whenever inducements are offered," she said, "it creates problems."
Prosecutors respond that the amnesty program is still the most effective way to get at price-fixing conspiracies and that jurors can evaluate the truth of testimony. Moreover, the companies that receive amnesty are still vulnerable to civil lawsuits filed by customers and other victims of the cartel.
FOR all its remarkable successes, the Justice Department has lost many battles in its war on cartels. While more than 90 percent of the cases wind up with plea agreements, the department has only a mixed record in cases that are tried.
Leslie W. Jacobs, a prominent defense lawyer who has beaten the Justice Department in two price-fixing cases, noted that of the antitrust indictments filed from 1992 to 1997 that went to trial, there were four convictions and 15 acquittals. Prosecutors say those numbers do not accurately reflect the division's longer-term record, which is comparable to the Justice Department's overall victory rate of about 60 percent in criminal trials of white-collar defendants.
Prosecutors and defense lawyers say there are several reasons for the government's mediocre trial record. Cases that get to trial often involve evidence that is more ambiguous than ones that are settled. Unlike other criminal cases, such as those involving narcotics or mob members, executives in price-fixing cases are often viewed as pillars of the community. Executives in most price-fixing cases are indemnified by their companies, and so can afford to hire the best criminal lawyers. And some jurors have trouble understanding why price-fixing should be a crime.
Defense lawyers also say the mixed record demonstrates that the government has overreached, a criticism rejected by leaders of the antitrust division.
The government's landmark drubbing came in 1994, when a federal judge in Columbus, Ohio, threw out the government's indictment of General Electric accusing it of conspiring with De Beers to rig the price of industrial diamonds. The prosecutors' evidence, the judge ruled, was too weak.
There have been many more recent and less heralded government setbacks. Three weeks after winning the verdict in the Mitsubishi graphite electrode case in Philadelphia -- a conclusion trumpeted with great fanfare by the Justice Department -- a federal court in Houston threw out the government's price-fixing case against a marine construction executive after other defendants pleaded guilty to antitrust violations. 
"The government just way overreached and tried to go after somebody on the uncorroborated testimony of a guy who was trying to get out of the trouble he was in," said Robert J. Sussman, a lawyer who represented the executive, Michael H. Lam, at his trial. "Mike Lam has been made absolutely miserable for three years. The government put a great deal of resources into this prosecution."
The division has also lost antitrust trials against the Nippon Paper Industries Company, which was accused of price-fixing in the thermal fax paper market, and against executives in the dynamite and concrete-pipe construction industries. 
In winning an acquittal for David True, a senior executive at the Austin Powder Company, Mr. Jacobs said he was able to take the leniency afforded other defendants-turned-witnesses and use it effectively against the government. Mr. Jacobs, a partner at Thompson Hine, a Cleveland law firm, called as a witness a former lawyer for the antitrust division who outlined to the jury the potential criminal exposure of the government's main witnesses, replete with charts showing the size of possible fines and prison terms, compared with the lenient treatment they were ultimately afforded.
"We essentially turned the division's program against them and succeeded," Mr. Jacobs recalled.
He said that the cases he won, as well as the other acquittals, demonstrated that the government had been overreaching.
"By my view the government is becoming like the old line that pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered," he said. "They are moving from the pig to the hog category."
But prosecutors said that the acquittals in these cases were the exceptions, and that an overwhelming majority of defendants wound up being convicted. And some independent experts say occasional government losses are signs that the antitrust division is doing its job.
"From a public point of view, you'd want them to lose a certain number, because otherwise they are not taking risks," said Albert A. Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a Washington research organization. "You want them to be aggressive and take risks. If they only brought the ones that they won, you'd know they were passing on the gray areas."
JUDGING from the relatively few words that President Bush has said in his political career about antitrust, it appears that he has little concern for anything other than price-fixing claims.
In February 2000, in the heat of the presidential primaries, Mr. Bush told a reporter from The Financial Times that he believed all antitrust law revolved around such investigations.
"My own personal view, just in general, is the application of antitrust laws needs to be applied where there are clear cases of price-fixing," he said. Asked if there is a role for antitrust enforcement in other cases -- like monopolies, predatory pricing, discriminatory pricing practices and merger challenges -- Mr. Bush responded with an answer that demonstrated little feeling for the field.
"Well no," he said. "Everything evolves into price-fixing over time. Price-fixing up and price-fixing down. Price-fixing down to eliminate competition; price-fixing up to accumulate profit."
The president's top appointments to the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have a more expansive understanding of antitrust, but one that is significantly less aggressive in many areas than those of their predecessors in the Clinton administration. 
Late last month, the Senate confirmed Timothy J. Muris to the Federal Trade Commission. Charles A. James, the administration's choice to head the Justice Department's antitrust section, has been approved by the Judiciary Committee, but his nomination has encountered some opposition from Democrats, who are now in control of the Senate.
Mr. James is expected to take a more limited view of many areas of antitrust enforcement than Ms. Bingaman or her successor, Joel I. Klein. But it was hardly surprising at his confirmation hearing that Mr. James began by discussing the role of the division in combating cartels, and experts predict that price-fixing cases, particularly those with an international scope, will continue to increase. 
For one thing, there are about 50 grand juries involved in global cartel investigations. For another, while Democrats and Republicans occasionally have different views in certain areas of antitrust, like merger reviews and predatory-pricing inquiries, the prosecution of price-fixing and cartels has become as accepted as combating terrorism and narcotics. 
"The one area that one can predict with 99 percent certainty that will not change is the aggressive prosecution of global cartels," said Robert E. Litan, a former Justice Department antitrust official who is now the director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "They will use the corporate amnesty policy because they view it as a godsend."

Here Come the Globe-Trotters

BYLINE:  By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach and arrival of retirement appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MANY people don't realize that around-the-world air fares are an astounding bargain, in some cases costing less than $1,000.
 But the idea of making a globe-circling journey is little more than a pipe dream for most working Americans. Even if you like jet lag and the smell of airports, such a trip is very difficult within the confines of the traditional two-week vacation. 
 But for retirees, it's a different story. The one thing they have in abundance is time. So as baby boomers start to swell the ranks of the retired, airline officials and travel agents expect more global travelers. 
Robin Taylor, 73, a retired entrepreneur in Corte Madera, Calif., took a two-month around-the-world trip two years ago, traveling part of the way with his daughter. Mr. Taylor first flew to China, then made his way west to various destinations, including stops in India and Europe, before flying to New York and then back to California. He paid about $1,500 for his coach-class ticket. 
"It was a great trip," he said, "and the ticket was amazingly cheap."
Just how cheap becomes clear when these prices are compared with fares to single destinations. Keep in mind, however, that in the crazy-quilt world of air fares, there are lots of variables and prices. And logic and common sense don't always apply. Airlines will sell you around-the-world tickets directly, but the best prices by far -- at least for coach seats -- are from travel agents, or "consolidators," who specialize in such fares and have special discount arrangements with airlines. These are the companies whose tiny ads are usually in the back of Sunday newspaper travel sections.
Air Brokers International in San Francisco (800 883-3273), for instance, offers an around-the-world ticket for $999 that takes you from New York to Hong Kong to Bangkok to New Delhi or Bombay to Paris or London and back to New York. I recently paid half that amount just for an advance-purchase ticket on American Airlines to fly from Newark to Albuquerque and back. (And I would have paid more than $2,000, or twice the around-the-world rate, for a full fare, or so-called walk-up ticket.)
If you want to go off the beaten track a bit, or travel through places like Australia, Africa or South America, a global ticket costs more -- probably in the range of $1,200 to $1,500. Tickets are usually good for a year, and you generally have to keep traveling in the same direction. You can change your itinerary along the way, but there may be charges, depending on the circumstances.
Some people prefer to buy their around-the-world tickets directly from major airlines, because consolidators have been known to suddenly go out of business -- leaving travelers holding the bag or stranded overseas. A ticket from an airline will probably cost more than $3,000, depending on the time of travel. On British Airways, for example, coach fares range from $3,300 to $3,700. 
But airlines occasionally have sales that match the consolidator prices. Singapore Airlines offers an around-the world fare in conjunction with Virgin Atlantic for $1,499, for departures from the United States between Aug. 15 and Nov. 15.
If you want to travel in business class or first class, you're probably better off going directly to the airlines. "We really can't compete on business and first class in most cases," said Eimerd Evertsen, owner of Air Brokers International. "But we win on economy class, because that's where the volume of seats are, and the airlines obviously want to fill their planes."
Depending on various factors, an around-the-world business-class ticket costs in the neighborhood of $6,000 to $7,000; first class is usually $7,500 to $8,500. That may seem high, but consider that a round-trip business-class ticket from New York to London on British Airways is $6,724; first class is $10,554. 
If you use a consolidator for cheap seats, Jens Jurgen, publisher of Travelcompanions.com, a Web site and newsletter that helps link single travelers, recommends paying with a credit card. "If something happens, you are likely to have an easier time getting your money back," Mr. Jurgen said.
He also advises against dealing with consolidators that will not send you a ticket until just before you plan to travel, even though you may have paid months in advance. "That's usually a sign there are cash-flow problems," he said.
EDWARD HASBROUCK, a travel consultant at AirTreks.com (800 350-0636), another San Francisco consolidator, says he thinks more retirees will embrace around-the-world journeys. "People are feeling more squeezed in terms of time, so they are retiring with a pent-up desire to travel," said Mr. Hasbrouck, who is also the author of "The Practical Nomad: How to Travel Around the World" (Avalon Travel). "And many of them want to do it all and see it all."
Roy J. Scott Sr., 67, a retired high school librarian from Sound Beach, N.Y., who has lived on the road in a motor home for much of the last 11 years, spent a year traveling around the world in the mid-1990's, after the death of his wife.
"I liked it and would do it again," he said. "But I recommend you travel with someone. The key is to share things."

Letting the World Plug Into Your PC, for Profit

BYLINE:  By DAVID LIPSCHULTZ 

 BODY:
ERIC VONDRAN of Calgary, Alberta, recently received a $150 check for doing no work. He didn't have to attend a focus group or sit through a sales presentation. All he did was permit a computer company, called United Devices, to plug into his PC, and he did not even notice when it happened. For him, the payout was not small potatoes. "It really came in handy," said Mr. Vondran, who is 23 and unemployed.
 He is among many people paid for letting companies like United Devices use the excess power of their PC's. These companies have members download software to turn their PC's into gateways, or peers, on networks of interconnected PC's. In some ways, the system is like Napster's; but instead of using the network to swap music files, these companies tap into dormant processing power. 
 By connecting thousands of PC's, they can harness more power than a supercomputer. These companies -- called distributed-computing, or "peer to peer," services -- then resell the power to other companies and research concerns that need the muscle of a supercomputer but do not want to pay supercomputer prices. 
Distributed-computing networks have more limited uses than a supercomputer, but they are becoming increasingly valuable substitutes. They have been used by biotechnology researchers running complex algorithms, looking for that gene in a haystack, and by economists playing out millions of possible combinations in measuring stock-market volatility. 
The researchers get the processing power at a fraction of the cost of buying a supercomputer, which can run up to $110 million, or even leasing one.
Businesses that want to test how fast their Web sites can be downloaded can also use the services, which can instantly link thousands of computers to a customer's site.
But what is particularly unusual about the distributed-computing model is that the average PC user is an essential part of the equation. "I think it's a first in the world of technology that companies are actually borrowing from the masses and reselling it to corporations," said Neal Goldman, an analyst at the Yankee Group, a research firm.
For PC users who join such services, the process is not intrusive. Because a PC, much like the human brain, has so much built-in excess capacity, the owner will not notice when the companies are tapping into the processing power of his or her computer. It is like having an Internet browser program running on the desktop while some other program, like a spreadsheet or a word processor, is also being used.
These networks, of course, provide yet another way for viruses to infect PC's, but the companies say their sophisticated encryption minimizes the threat.
ORIGINALLY, distributed-computing companies recruited members at no cost, assuring them that their PC power would be used for good causes. United Devices, for instance, made its network available for cancer research. "It was the primary reason I became a member," Mr. Vondran said.
But as the companies increasingly use the network for profit, PC owners who joined mainly to support, say, AIDS research, may balk at having their computers used for commercial gain.
That helps explain why United Devices, based in Austin, Tex., has resorted to tangible incentives. "We want to make sure there is some compensation as we get more commercial projects," said Edward Hubbard, the chief executive.
Mr. Hubbard said members would be allowed to opt out of any for-profit projects -- a choice that Mr. Vondran appreciates. "If they didn't let me offload, I would definitely feel betrayed," he said. 
Until recently, the company offered sweepstakes gifts to attract members. But to draw people who aren't enticed by prizes like mountain bikes, it has turned to something more persuasive: hard cash. 
United Devices has begun paying $5 to $1,000 a month to the 200 people who provide the most processing power. The company's Web site, at www.ud.com, posts winners' identification numbers and how much processing power they provided that month. The competition has started a buzz of sorts: some members are linking up friends and acquaintances under one ID to wring out the most power. But some may have an advantage.
"Even if I build a small team, it would be hard to compete with these people in I.T. departments who have access to hundreds of computers," Mr. Vondran said.
Still, he was able to collect a modest sum because he won a daily lottery, which is not based on processing heft.
After winning $100 in the same daily lottery, Theodore White decided to put his resources to work. An owner of a computer lab in Frederick, Md., he has 18 PC's on hand. He has put nine to use for United Devices in hopes of getting that coveted $1,000. "I'm shooting for the top earnings now," he said. 
Porivo Technologies, which focuses on Web testing and is based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., plans to make the relationship between the PC user and the company simpler. This month, it will start paying participants on a sliding scale -- even owners of minimally used computers will be compensated. "On average, we should be paying about $15 to $20 a month per person," said William Holmes, Porivo's founding chief executive and current vice president for strategic development.
At the top of the scale, $45 a month, that means about $500 a year. "I'd do it for that in a second," Mr. Goldman of Yankee Group said. "It almost pays for the computer."
Since Porivo (www.porivo.com) charges its customers up to $20,000 a month for its service, paying the people in its network makes sense. Still, because all participants will be paid a fee, a few business questions are raised: Is the company setting itself up to waste money on computers it might not use? And what happens if there are so many interested users that it has to pay out more than it takes in?
Porivo says the company isn't yet worried about too much supply. "Right now, we really do need a lot of people on the network," said Samuel Kirby, a co-founder and vice president for marketing. "When we have too many in one area, we'll have to start turning people down."
UNITED DEVICES, however, said it would avoid such a payment system because of the financial risks. "Dollars are scarce in today's market," Mr. Hubbard said. "Taking on such a huge variable cost is not a smart proposition for us." 
United Devices' main rival, Entropia, based in San Diego, has avoided cash and prizes. Entropia has used the processing power for cause-related purposes, like permitting the Scripps Institute in San Diego to use it for AIDS research. 
The originator of this type of distributed computing, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, based in Berkeley, Calif., began corralling members in May 1999, strictly for its cause. The combined power, which far surpasses that of the largest supercomputer, is used to decode feedback from waves sent to outer space in hopes of finding alien life. 
Entropia (www.entropia.com) said it would continue to refrain from offering monetary incentives even as it gains steam in the commercial marketplace. "I think a member will be happy enough to know that at least part of their processing goes to a cause," said Andrew Chien, Entropia's chief technical officer and co-founder.
Maybe, but as the market grows, attracting people to sign up will become increasingly important. As a result, providers of free Internet service, like Juno Online Services, may gain a breath of life.
Juno said in Feburary that it would make its four million users available for a distributed-computing project. "Juno has a means in place to download the software to connect users into a peer-to-peer network," Mr. Goldman said. For now, Juno is networking people on a volunteer basis, but the company has made clear that this could change. Any change could be written into Juno's service agreement with its users. 
With service providers looking for new revenue sources, such endeavors could become more common. In the meantime, distributed-computing companies must strike a delicate balance. By offering hard cash, companies like Porivo and United Devices have raised the bar. Will everyone have to follow? "It definitely changes the equation a bit," Mr. Goldman said.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Robert H. Lyon; 
ICAP Select Equity Portfolio

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
ATTENTION, investors: the free ride is finally over, according to Robert H. Lyon, who runs the $52 million ICAP Select Equity Portfolio.
 "We're entering a period of much lower equity returns that will persist for a long time," Mr. Lyon said from his office in Chicago. "We're looking for returns in the mid- to high single digits, not the 15 percent to 20 percent that people are used to. Valuations are still very high, and the outlook for corporate profits, even with the economic recovery, will be subdued." 
 Skills in picking stocks, as opposed to gauging broad economic trends, will now be more important, he contended. And stock by stock, his fund has built handsome returns. It gained 14.6 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, versus 5.4 percent for its peers in the large value group and 6.1 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500, according to Morningstar Inc. The fund rose 13.1 percent in the 12 months ended Thursday, versus 7.4 percent for its group and a loss of 10.7 percent for the S.& P. 
Mr. Lyon, 51, is president and chief investment officer of the Institutional Capital Corporation, the fund's adviser; it manages about $15 billion, primarily for institutions, that is invested in large-capitalization value stocks.
He calls risk management a crucial goal for the fund. "We tend to approach the market from a pretty conservative point of view," he said. "A lot of our success over the years is avoiding losers rather than always hitting home runs."
To uncover value, Mr. Lyon works with 14 analysts who contribute ideas on potential buys to a pool of about 450 companies. He starts by screening the pool for what he calls relative value, which takes into account the company's price-to-earnings multiple, his target P/E and consensus earnings estimates. He uses that information to eliminate all but about 100 companies whose stock prices he thinks can increase at least 15 percent over 12 months. 
Next, Mr. Lyon screens for earnings stability. He compares the most recent monthly change in consensus earnings estimates with the average monthly change over five years.
"When you put the two screens together," he said, "you get the intersection of companies with a minimum 15 percent upside, but maybe as high as 30 or 40 percent, and earnings that aren't falling apart. That's the sweet spot of the market for value stocks."
Additional research eliminates all but about 15 to 25 of the 75 stocks that pass both screens. A crucial factor is the presence of a catalyst -- like a new product or service, new management or corporate restructuring -- that can lift a stock price.
The largest chunk of the fund is in financial stocks, at 22 percent of assets. "We expect interest rates to decline somewhat further and stay at a relatively low level for at least another 12 months," he said. "That's a real positive for financial stocks."
Technology, by contrast, is now just 4 percent of the portfolio because of concern about valuations. That is down from 22 percent 12 months ago.
He considers selling when earnings estimates deteriorate, a catalyst becomes questionable or the stock reaches what he calls full value. Selling big positions in a concentrated portfolio creates a high turnover -- 400 percent last year -- but the fund tries to offset gains with losses in other areas to minimize taxes.
Financial stocks should benefit from restructuring efforts by individual companies as well as from additional rate cuts, Mr. Lyon said. A favorite is Citigroup, which he began buying in September 1999 at $32.50 a share. 
"The new Citi is better diversified and even more of a growth stock," he said. "We believe that the combination of growth and diversification will let its P/E expand up toward its competitors." Citigroup sells for 17.4 times 2001 earnings; he thinks that multiple can reach 20 in 12 months. He expects the stock price to reach $70 in that time; it is now at $51.80.
Mr. Lyon also likes MetLife, which he bought at $17.10 in May 2000, just after the initial offering. "It's a very old company," he said, "but it's a new stock." He said MetLife grew fat as a mutual insurance company and had room to reduce costs. "They're cutting costs now, and they'll continue to do so," he said. Management also has the opportunity to cross-sell insurance products to its group life and disability policy owners, he added. On Friday, the shares closed at $31.82; his 12-month target is $40.
Mr. Lyon began buying shares of the Loews Corporation, which owns or controls Bulova, Diamond Offshore Drilling and Loews Hotels, among other businesses, at $44 in October 2000. The catalyst is the company's new openness toward investors. "Before," he said, "it was a public company run like a private business." 
Its Lorillard Tobacco unit, he added, is gaining market share while tobacco litigation is turning less hostile. And the CNA unit, which sells commercial property, casualty and other insurance, is improving. 
"You have a collection of operating businesses that are all poised to do very well," Mr. Lyon said, "and they're selling at a very low multiple" of 10 times 2001 earnings.
He expects the stock to reach $100 in a year; it is now at $68.16.

Blacks, Whites and Blues

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
LT. PAUL BRENNAN, the commander of the 34th Precinct Detective Squad in Upper Manhattan, was recalling the day 18 years ago that he got off the train at 125th Street in Harlem and began his police career, a white man in a black world.
 "I was from Long Island," Lieutenant Brennan said. "I was afraid." 
 His fear was not a simple black-white thing. The Police Department culture was new to him, and the culture of Harlem was new, too. He did not want to be mislabeled a bad guy or a racist.
"You hear the stories about the crime," he said. "I wondered if people would respect me. I wondered if people would know I was new."
That was back in the early 80's, when the city was a far more violent place. The crime rate has dropped, but the often tentative and hostile relationship between police officers and many New Yorkers still blisters. Terms like racial profiling have entered the lexicon, and violence is known by the name of a victim -- Diallo, Louima, Dorismond -- or the location of an explosion, like Crown Heights or Howard Beach.
No one is naive enough to believe that a six-week course on policing in a multicultural city will transform officers into cultural anthropologists. But you begin at the beginning, as Lieutenant Brennan and hundreds of his fellow officers are doing at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. If any group could use an exploration of the underpinnings of the racism, sexism and other "isms" that pervade life in the city, police officers would seem high on the list.
Lieutenant Brennan is among 527 officers from around the city enrolled in "Police Supervision in a Multiracial and Multicultural City," a course that began 10 days ago and is being taught by two African studies professors from John Jay. In addition to reading books on criminal justice and race, and listening to a discussion of "white racial identity and privilege," students are also asked to write an autobiography.
"We're just peeling off these layers," said one of the professors, a retired police lieutenant, Rodney Jackson, who has made a career out of helping police officers negotiate the murky waters of cultural diversity. "We just want to open up their heads a little bit." 
It's hardly surprising that City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, who pushed for Council money to support the free program and who is running for mayor in a city in which half the residents are black or Hispanic, would back such an effort. One does wonder, however, what took the city so long.
Sitting in a bright, tidy classroom the other day were 35 officers of various races, most men and most wearing jeans. On the blackboard was a list of 10 "diversity definitions" -- words like "minority," "prejudice" and "culture shock" -- that were to be defined and discussed.
A black woman talked about being chided by male colleagues because she sobbed with and comforted a woman whose grandson had just died of AIDS. "I responded as a mother," the officer said, "but they wanted to know why I was crying on the job."
Later that afternoon, the officers watched a PBS documentary that recreated in graphic detail the city's 1863 draft riots, started by Irish workers who were enraged by the nation's first military draft, imposed during the Civil War. The rioters deeply resented the African-Americans whom they saw as the cause of the war, as well as the rich who could avoid conscription. The mob rampaged through the city, lynching blacks, beating wealthy men and burning down the Colored Orphans Asylum.
Was it class, race or economics that caused the riot, the students were asked? Could it happen again? As in most conversations on race, the answers were rambling and inchoate.
"I don't think there's that much racism still around," a young white male officer said. "It's class.
"That's just me," he added. 
"I disagree," a young black man said. He did not elaborate.
"In Crown Heights, they were targeting Koreans," another white man pointed out.
"The thing with race is, it gets carried over from generation to generation," a Hispanic woman said. "Your kids remember seeing people kill their father."
A black man added: "That's why people feel discrimination will never be wiped out. You can talk about it, you can study it, but people remember."
There was a pause. Well, said a black man, there they were. "Of all the money geared toward different programs in the city," he added, "none of it is just for us to say hello to each other."

Capital Leaps Forward in China

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
WANG WENJING, a mild-mannered 36-year-old computer programmer became one of the wealthiest men in China two weeks ago, worth more than half a billion dollars. The source of his sudden riches: China's still fledgling capital markets, which until recently were almost entirely off-limits to private entrepreneurs like him.
 Thanks to new rules, Mr. Wang's software company, UFSoft, was able to go public by selling 25 percent of its shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Hundreds of other private companies are lined up to do the same. 
 Like the proverbial butterfly's flutter that grows to a hurricane, the little-noticed change could lead to the most dramatic transformation in China's economy since Deng Xiaoping broke up the country's Maoist communes more than two decades ago. For the first time since the private sector began to reappear in the late 1970's, private businesses have access to public capital. And with capital, they will grow and should eventually eclipse the state-owned enterprises and government-controlled collectives that still dominate China's economy.
The shift is not entirely welcomed within the Communist Party, which is already struggling with how to handle the new moneyed class. President Jiang Zemin has called for increased party representation in the private sector, but party elders have turned away most of the businessmen who have asked to become party members.
But longer-term political ramifications are unavoidable. As the private sector grows, it will inevitably become a powerful political constituency. It may not necessarily agitate for change -- like business executives everywhere, those in China crave stability and may not push for democracy. But the interests of at least some are certain to eventually deviate from those of the party.
Why then are China's most senior leaders willing to unshackle private businesses? They recognize that a capital-backed private sector may be China's best hope for economic survival after the country joins the World Trade Organization, when global competition is expected to squeeze China's state-owned enterprises. If that spills millions of workers into the street, one of the most obvious ways to absorb the excess labor would be to allow private companies to grow. And in any event, private businesses can help keep China's economy from domination by foreign firms, which are expected to easily outmaneuver the country's cumbersome state enterprises.
"To the extent that private companies generate taxes and employment, they will help the party stay in power," said Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago.
For now, the movement remains but a flutter. Though many people cite figures that show China's economy is now mostly private, that data includes foreign-owned companies and collectively owned businesses, most of which are still controlled by some level of government. True private companies, majority-owned by individuals, still account for less than 20 percent of China's economic output and for only about 50 million jobs for its 1.4 billion people.
But that's changing fast. Collective enterprises, started under Mao to make use of excess labor in commune work brigades and sponsored by local governments after communes were disbanded in the 1970's, are restructuring to clarify property rights. Many enterprises are emerging under individual ownership, and they constitute the largest class of capital-hungry private enterprises in China today.
Meanwhile, a flood of money into Internet-related startups, networking companies, software companies and high-tech equipment manufacturers has created a smaller, more potent class of entrepreneurs like Mr. Wang. Their companies, based on brain power instead of labor, are inherently more independent of the government than those with a collective heritage.
Ironically, the new companies that have been sustained by foreign venture capital are the most constrained today, since foreign-invested firms don't yet have access to the country's capital markets. But the ones that are free of foreign ownership and have three years of profitability and at least 30 million yuan (about $3.6 million) in assets can now shop themselves to the country's underwriters in hopes of going public.
James Liu, who heads strategic planning at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, said the hundreds of private companies that have already secured underwriters make up about 10 percent of those hoping to be listed.
Until late last year, the state decided who could list stock on the country's two exchanges, and it rarely granted the privilege to private companies over state-owned firms. But that has changed, first in the so-called B share market, where stocks are denominated in foreign currency, and now in the much larger A share market, where Mr. Wang's UFSoft was the first private company to list under the new rules.
"The trend is encouraging," said Mr. Wang in his utilitarian office at UFSoft's headquarters in Beijing. "Private companies are growing and the environment for raising capital is getting better and better."
There's plenty of capital available. China's citizens have $800 million in bank savings accounts, and the sliver of that money that has been invested in publicly listed shares has already made China's stock markets the third largest in Asia.
The government still has the means to tilt the game in the state's favor. All underwriters remain state-owned and they can be pressed to cater to state-owned clients. But as China's courts gradually grow more independent and powerful, the state will face increasing pressure to follow the rule of law. In December, a private company won a lawsuit against the country's stock market regulator, which was ordered to reconsider its refusal to list the company on a mainland stock exchange. 
The country is also working to create a class of serious institutional investors -- mutual funds and pension funds, for example -- that would give the now volatile markets depth and a longer-term perspective. Those investors, though now state-owned, will eventually demand better governance of the companies they invest in, and fewer government limits on their growth.
It seems likely that the result will be a stronger, more flexible economy, though it will take time. And it will take even longer before private companies or their owners constitute a political force.
But as any Marxist will explain, political power comes with controlling the means of production, and the party's control will erode as the private sector grows.

Desperately Seeking a Silver Lining

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
A rally on Friday turned what had been a bad week on Wall Street into a not-so-bad week.
 Stocks tumbled early in the week as new profit warnings, most notably by Sun Microsystems, signaled that the economy was not likely to emerge from its doldrums any time soon. 
Some analysts saw the sell-off as a sobering reminder that the rally that began in April has been built mostly on optimism. 
 The unemployment report on Friday, showing sharp losses in manufacturing employment, coupled with a report on manufacturing activity, which declined for the 10th consecutive month, provided further evidence of economic weakness. Nevertheless, investors looked for the silver lining, believing that the news provided impetus for more interest rate cuts. 
 The major indexes all lost ground. The technology-heavy Nasdaq fared the worst, falling to 2,149.44, down 101.59 points, or 4.5 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended at 1,260.67, down 17.22, or 1.3 percent. The Dow industrials were off only slightly, finishing at 10,990.41, down 14.96, or 0.1 percent. 
 Bond investors concluded there could be more rate cuts. The yield on the 10-year note fell to 5.36 percent from 5.49 percent. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe Doctors Flee As AIDS Crisis Widens 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe 

 BODY:
Like the rest of the country's hospitals, Mpilo Central is sick.
 Mpilo, the biggest hospital here in Zimbabwe's second-biggest city, is losing its doctors, its nurses, its pharmacists and, slowly, its spirit. 
 Fleeing the deepening hardships in Zimbabwe and following the lure of opportunities unimaginable here, medical professionals are abandoning the country as never before. The health care system, as a result, is sinking into crisis, consuming the colleagues left behind.
Mpilo, for example, which handles many of the most difficult cases in the region, now has just one general surgeon instead of three to serve its 1,037 beds. 
"I am on call every day," the surgeon, Dr. Julio Feliu, said one afternoon after completing seven scheduled operations before heading off to teach a medical school class.
Over the last few years, as many as 100 doctors and hundreds -- if not thousands -- of nurses are estimated to have emigrated from this nation of 11 million people. While losing medical professionals is neither new nor unique to Zimbabwe, the scope appears unprecedented. With one of the world's worst AIDS epidemics and with its economy in turmoil, the country could hardly be more vulnerable.
Indeed, business executives, teachers, engineers and others are leaving too, costing Zimbabwe much of the enormously successful investment it made in education after blacks won majority rule 21 years ago. 
Their marketability is a testament to Zimbabwe's successes in improving education and nurturing a black professional class. But those achievements are in jeopardy as people flee.
Zimbabwe's economy, once one of Africa's most promising, is a wreck. A standoff over how white-owned farmland should be redistributed has roiled the country and harmed agriculture, the country's economic base. Exports and tourism are down, giving the country little of the foreign currency it needs for imports like fuel and drugs for its health care system.
Unhappy with the state's policies and priorities, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have cut Zimbabwe off, and President Robert Mugabe has refused to make concessions.
Inflation is at nearly 60 percent. Professionals like the doctors at Mpilo, who envisioned lives of at least modest prosperity for their families, instead find themselves struggling to cover their bills.
"It's money first and foremost," said Dr. Zulu Mahlangu, the acting medical superintendent of Mpilo, when asked what was luring away his staff.
Doctors in government service typically earn $550 to $1,100 a month and nurses $350 to $500, according to the Health Ministry and the nurses' union.
So when countries like Australia, Britain, Canada and the United States, all facing critical health care staffing shortages, have come calling, they have found legions of workers looking for something better.
"It was mostly junior doctors at first, but now even people who are in private practice, senior doctors, are leaving -- it's a lot more now," said a specialist in his 40's who works for a government hospital. "They are worrying about the education of their kids, their security, the general economic climate."
Opened in 1957, Mpilo Central would, in another time, seem a decent place to work. Set on 28 acres a couple of miles northwest of the city's central business district, it appears spare, but well kept. It is not cutting edge, but neither is it a medical wasteland. 
Such mundane charms apparently no longer suffice for many of Zimbabwe's medical professionals. Of the 600 posts for doctors in government hospitals, nearly 100 are vacant, as are 600 of the 5,000 positions for general nurses, said Davies G. Dhlakama, the Health Ministry's director of technical support.
Dr. Barton Matshe is one of three staff obstetricians at Mpilo -- which delivers 11,000 babies a year. The other two are on loan from Cuba, and go home for several weeks each year.
By Dr. Matshe's reckoning, Mpilo should have at least six obstetricians; by the hospital's, it should have at least five. No one expects more anytime soon.
Dr. Matshe came to Bulawayo, eager to go where his skills are "really needed." Now, however, there are days when he questions his judgment.
A 37-year-old father of three, he was born in Shurugwi, 125 miles northeast of here. After studying at the University of Zimbabwe Medical School in the capital, Harare, he fulfilled his required government service at the city's public hospitals. Then, like many other young doctors, he left the country to train in his chosen specialty. He spent six years in Cape Town, South Africa, and Johannesburg and six months ago he started work here.
"Part of me thinks I made the right decision, but there are times that I think from a personal point of view and from a professional point of view," he said, "that it wasn't quite the right decision." The fees each term for his two children in primary schools come to more than his monthly salary.
Bulawayo, with 800,000 people, is the business hub of southern Zimbabwe. In many ways it is better off than the rural areas in its ability to attract doctors and nurses.
But then those small rural hospitals are not asked to take on the most challenging cases, as Mpilo is. "We hardly ever see any low-risk patients," Dr. Matshe said.
And Bulawayo finds itself a second choice for many specialists, who prefer to be in Harare. The capital has not been spared, however. Even medical professionals who remain in Zimbabwe are devoting more time to private practice, which offers the only, albeit diminishing, hope of earning a good living.
The sort of specialized treatment that was once available only in the capital is increasingly not offered any more. For example, children with rheumatic heart disease now have little chance of ever having the surgery they need. "It's disheartening when the children keep coming back and saying, 'Why can't I be fixed,' and you have to say, 'Because the government has no money for operations,' " said Andrew Bowman, a cardiologist and secretary of the Zimbabwe Medical Association. "It's very sad."
Parirenyatwa, the only hospital in the country with the facilities to perform open heart surgery, no longer offers this surgery. The equipment is still there, but there is no money for essential supplies, said one of the country's few cardiac surgeons.
What that has meant, the surgeon said, is that the few patients with medical insurance and enough money travel to South Africa for the surgery. "Those who cannot afford it," the surgeon said, "are dying -- and there are a lot of them."
The day-to-day frustrations erode the faith of many doctors and nurses in what they are doing and give them another reason to leave, on top of the economic hardships.
The medical professionals who stay say they understand the thinking of the ones who don't. "It's very personal, and you can't interfere with that kind of decision," said Dr. Matshe, the obstetrician at Mpilo Central Hospital.
After all, the idea of leaving has occurred to almost all of them. "I suppose all of us have at some point or another thought about, but somebody has to hang around here," said Dr. Mahlangu, Mpilo's medical superintendent. "I was born here. I was brought up here. This is home."

5 Dogs, 3 People and One Immaculate Bedroom

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
There have been countless stories about the rich and their dogs: about doggie day care, doggie co-op interviews, Hermes dog carriers. This is a story about the animal passions of the economically average, or below average, the people who live in a one-bedroom or just one room, doubled or tripled up, on minimum wage or in the working class. These are the people for whom pets are a real luxury, both in dollars and in space, the people who could logically be expected to give up their pets when times grow tougher or apartments become even more cramped. 
 But logic has never been what governs the human relationship to animals, and so the Pet Store, also known as the Pet Warehouse, at Elton Avenue and 153rd Street in the Melrose section of the Bronx, was doing a busy trade last Sunday, as it almost always does. People came to buy kittens and baby chickens and fish and dogs. They came for food and collars and flea-control pills and coat-whitening shampoos. And they came for the company and conversation of fellow animal lovers. 
 Outside a window display of three puppies -- two scrappy cocker spaniels and a dachshund -- Jesus Ruiz, 35, who works in construction, was showing off his own baby, a Rottweiler named Diamond. He and his fiancee, Crystal Russell, 31 and unemployed, had to move to a one-room apartment recently, but they never thought of leaving Diamond -- whose full name is Diamond Russell Ruiz -- behind. They do not have a lot of money, he said, but they do not mind spending it on Diamond, whose coat glowed with good health. "If you love someone very much, you take care of them," he said. 
A woman passing by told of being in a homeless shelter when another resident's pet raccoon -- kept hidden for three years -- escaped. They commiserated over shelter rules that ban almost all pets. 
Inside the Pet Store, the manager, Charlie Alfaro, displayed his dogs' pictures in a plastic credit-card holder that some parents use to show off their children. There was the 30-pound pug, a male, and the 110-pound Rottweiler, a female. And then there was one of the "pugweilers" that their coupling had produced, and that Mr. Alfaro had sold for $100 apiece. 
Recognizing what passes for a home in New York, Mr. Alfaro's shop carries only small-breed dogs, like chihuahuas, dachshunds and little Yorkies. Cocker spaniels, selling at more than $600, are the most popular. "You get a 100-pound dog in a one-bedroom apartment, where you going to stick it?" he said. 
Ask Carlos Martinez, who has not one, but two, Rottweilers in a one-bedroom apartment. He had brought one, Napoleon, who has a killer's physique but a lover's temperament, to the store to hang out. Mr. Martinez, a veterinary technician, showed off Napoleon's training. "Charlie's not looking," he said of Mr. Alfaro. "Steal a cookie." 
Napoleon obliged. 
Lourdes Lopez, a 40-year-old home health aide, already has an iguana, finches and a parakeet, not to mention the cockatiel that flew away. She had come with her husband, Carlos, a factory pressman, to buy fantailed fish -- small creatures that incongruously combine enormous bulging eyes with genteel wafting tails. Pets relax her, Mrs. Lopez said. "I come from Puerto Rico, and I used to wake up to birds singing." Hearing them in her apartment, she feels close to the land. 
Then there was Elvin Ramos, 32, an auto mechanic, who had come in to buy a hot pink collar ("$6.99!" his wife exclaimed) for his miniature pinscher, Diana, purchased on layaway for $1,000. He also has four chihuahuas, and lives with all five dogs, snakes, hamsters, his wife and son in a one-bedroom apartment that he insisted was immaculate. He also had just seen a stray dog in the street that he was longing to take home, although his wife, Betsy, a telephone operator, had no such intentions. 
"We just get by," he said, but to him the pet expense is worth it. Six of their seven children are being raised by grandparents in Puerto Rico, so the dogs are a substitute. Diana is named for one of his daughters. 
In the back room, one family had come from church not to buy, but to look at the tanks full of fish with names like lines of poetry:
Colored Tinfoils
Pigeon Blood Discus
Sunset Gourami
Kissing Fish
Gold Mollies
And their shapes and colors prompted the family's 5-year-old boy to utter a little poem of his own: 
Ooooh 
My God 
Lookit Mama.

 CORRECTION:
The Melrose Journal article and a picture caption on Sunday, about a pet shop in a poor and working-class section of the Bronx, referred incorrectly in some copies to the breed of a dog owned by an auto mechanic. It was a miniature pinscher, not a miniature Doberman.

Rescuing Tom Thumb's House as Bridgeport's Children Struggle

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn. 

 BODY:
IT'S easy to zip past the dilapidated house on North Avenue -- not to mention Bridgeport itself -- and avert your eyes. Many people do.
 Even Guy Paniccia, who owns the house and uses its overgrown yard for parking for his auto shop across the street, saw it as just a dilapidated house. The developer buying the property saw it as a dilapidated house standing in the way of a new shopping center. It took Charles Brilvitch, a local historian, to point out that the ramshackle hulk was a piece of history, once home to that glorified child Tom Thumb. 
 Suddenly, in Bridgeport, where P. T. Barnum was once mayor and remains an icon, saving the house of his miniature performer is a cause. The developer is sensitive to the issue. The mayor wants it preserved. Local officials are devising a rescue plan.
Leave no circus act behind.
Bridgeport needs all the acts it can get. Most Connecticut cities are like brackish puddles that suburbanites step around or over, if they possibly can. Anything that might draw visitors is worth a bet. This city has the Barnum Museum and the requisite minor league baseball team, and a sports arena is rising off Route 95. Mayor Joseph P. Ganim envisions Bridgeport as "the best entertainment center in Connecticut," so perhaps it's even worth rescuing the long-forgotten home of Tom Thumb, Barnum's beloved 19th-century circus dwarf.
"A family from Ohio on their way to Cape Cod with a car full of howling kids would see this on a list of things to do and want to show their kids the Tom Thumb house," said Mr. Brilvitch, who added that moving and renovating the house could cost up to $500,000.
But it may be more educational to visit the corner of Newfield and Stratford Avenues -- the perfect setting if someone wanted to develop a theme park based on the challenges of the great economic divide.
On Thursday evening, some of Connecticut's less-glorified children and adults waited there for the Rescue Mission truck to arrive with free lentil stew and used clothing.
Talika Boyd, 29, a home health aide making $11 an hour, came looking for clothes for her three young children. Cynthia Henry, 40, a single mother of three picking up free baby food, said an illness in her family had recently forced her to trade an $8-an-hour fast-food job in the suburb of Trumbull for a $6.40-an-hour one close to her home in Bridgeport.
Sabrina Jackson, 45, who said she had been unable to work since her two sons were murdered, was looking for clothes with her granddaughter, Tarrena, 8, whom she raises. Ms. Jackson was worried about scraping together the $16 as well as lunch money Tarrena needs for an end-of-year school trip. "I do the best I can," she said.
JUST to review the balance sheet: Connecticut has the highest per capita income in the nation and its cities are among the poorest. From the late 1980's to the late 90's, average annual income for the poorest 20 percent of residents dropped 26 percent, to $17,615, two Washington research groups reported last year. It rose 18 percent to $174,149, for the wealthiest 20 percent. After the booming 90's, child poverty was higher than in the late 80's.
"It's America," said Janice Gruendel, co-director of Connecticut Voices for Children. "In Connecticut we just have it more extremely."
Nowhere is the divide deeper than here in Fairfield County, one of the nation's wealthiest counties. AiMee Sims, who attends a private high school on a scholarship, was one of two Bridgeport teenagers -- and the only black -- selected to travel to Europe last summer with 33 other students. She was surprised that the other students, many from Fairfield County suburbs, were afraid of Bridgeport.
"We were all traveling the world, not knowing what would happen next, and we're talking about how they're scared to come to Bridgeport," she said. 
Back at Newfield and Stratford, Simone Fulton, 9, was walking home with bags filled with pants, sweaters and shirts, and even a clip-on tie, which she planned to wear to school on Friday. "My teacher is going to Russia," she said. "It's her last day of school. I want to look good."
Her brother Julian, 11, got stew from the food truck and a second helping for his mother. "You just have to add a little salt," he said. Then he headed back into his home, where there was at least as much worth rescuing as in the Tom Thumb house.

HEADLINE: Sour About Their Choices, Peruvians Are to Vote Today 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, June 2 

 BODY:
With polls showing a tightening race and many voters disillusioned or undecided, Peru's presidential election on Sunday may yield no clear winner, but another difficult challenge for the country's young democracy, international observers say. 
 The election is the second for president in just 13 months after the collapse of President Alberto K. Fujimori's government and an intelligence network that throttled democracy through vote fraud, news media manipulation and torture. 
 In recent weeks, Alejandro Toledo, a former World Bank official who dropped out of a runoff against Mr. Fujimori last year after an election marred by cheating, has watched his lead in opinion polls wither, as he has been forced to deny allegations of drug use and sex with prostitutes. He has also been hurt by his refusal to take a DNA test to prove that he is not the father of a teenage girl who says he abandoned her. 
His opponent, Alan Garcia, a former president, has returned from a nine-year exile promising to burnish Peru's economy and human rights record, now that the terrorist bands that helped make his first presidency so disastrous have been vanquished. But his failed populist policies, which caused hyperinflation and lines for food a decade ago, as well as old charges of corruption, continue to rile voters. 
While there is no sign that the newly revamped election apparatus tilts toward either man, both sides already appear poised to charge fraud if they lose after a campaign that has so disgusted voters that as many as 20 percent say they may spoil their ballots in protest. 
Senior officials in the interim government are already preparing the security forces to control possible street protests. 
A potential crisis can be averted if either candidate wins by a substantial margin, say by 3 percent or more, observers say. But some pollsters see a far narrower finish in the making, one likely to produce a contested vote count and a winner with a thin and sullied mandate. 
No matter the outcome, opinion polls indicate that the people of this country of 26 million people, which has been a major ally in America's drug war, view both the potential presidents as deeply flawed. 
"Both parties could cry foul, and there is the potential for political instability," said Eduardo Stein, a former Guatemalan foreign minister who heads the Organization of American States observer team. "We are not anticipating a horror movie, but we have not ruled out that scenario either." 
Mr. Stein, who also led the O.A.S. team in last year's election, said he had urged both camps to remain calm and honor the results. 
But supporters of Mr. Garcia, who was president between 1985 and 1990, are predicting there will be many disputes over ballot tally sheets, leading some observers to believe that they are preparing to cry fraud. Congressman Jorge del Castillo, leader of Mr. Garcia's APRA party, has already complained that Interior and Defense Ministry officials are favoring Mr. Toledo, who is running on behalf of a centrist group, Peru Posible. 
International observers say, however, that they are satisfied with the independence and probity of election officials under the interim government and that the computer software to count the vote is efficient and fair. Where a breakdown could occur, they say, is at the local level. Hundreds of thousands of voters live in remote jungle and Andean villages, where Peruvian poll watchers are often not attentive to detail and may be open to corruption. 
Ballots are destroyed on the day of the election, according to Peruvian law, after tally sheets are sent to computer centers for tabulation. Any complaint about the validity of tally sheets will be up to 58 three-member juries to rule on. If the vote is close, some observers say, the officials on the juries will almost certainly come under intense pressure from the competing parties.
Aides to Mr. Toledo have privately warned that disciplined APRA cadres control several of the local electoral juries. 
In the first-round vote in April, 24,000 tally sheets representing more than a quarter of a million votes came under dispute, delaying the final official result for six weeks. 
Former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who is here leading an observer team from the Carter Center and National Democratic Institute, said she had confidence in interim President Valentin Paniagua and Prime Minister Javier Perez de Cuellar. She said she was encouraged by a conversation with the leaders of the competing parties in which both expressed "awareness of the possibility that they could lose." 
But referring to the charges of vast ballot irregularities in the past, she added: "These dangers exist. There were these manipulations before, and one cannot say flat out this won't happen." 
Mr. Toledo, long the favorite after leading the opposition against Mr. Fujimori, eked out just over a third of the vote in the first-round balloting. Pollsters say his lead has been dwindling the last several weeks. One national poll released today showed Mr. Toledo leading, with about 43 percent to Mr. Garcia's 38 percent. 
But even if a clear winner does emerge, the last several months of campaigning have left the electorate deeply skeptical that either candidate will serve the country well. The same poll showed 18 percent of voters choosing to leave their ballots blank or spoiling them as a protest. 
Other polls have shown that a majority believe that both candidates are dishonest and incapable of directing the economy out of recession. 
The days of hot debates over issues like land redistribution and bank nationalization have been replaced by nods by both candidates to a free-market economy, human rights and an independent judiciary. 
Despite much consensus between the two candidates, the public has become disenchanted with a campaign that has been dominated by mudslinging and charges of illicit sex, drug taking and money-laundering. Campaign rallies have been marred by a rain of tomatoes and stones, and both political camps have planted damaging reports in the news media questioning their opponents' financial dealings. 
The unappealing campaign contrasts sharply with the efforts by Mr. Paniagua and congressional leaders to clean up government corruption. 
In daily television broadcasts of scores of videotapes captured from the former intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, a parade of military officers, politicians, businessmen and television station owners have been shown taking bribes and doing favors for the old government, which collapsed in November.
The armed forces have been purged of scores of senior officials, and government prosecutors are putting together a case to extradite Mr. Fujimori from Japan on an assortment of human rights and corruption charges. Both candidates have promised to continue the efforts, but voters appear skeptical.
"The two of them are corrupt, but what can we do?" asked Mario Panca, a 45-year-old Uro Indian fisherman on Lake Titicaca deep in the Andes. "We need a government that can help the poor, but this election isn't going to help us."

No Jobless Pay For 'Fired' Legislator

BYLINE:  By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
Remember David Jaye, the Michigan state senator from the Detroit suburbs who was expelled by his colleagues a couple of weeks ago?
 They said he had to go because he had "a recurring pattern of personal misconduct." 
To wit: three drunken driving convictions and involvement in an incident in which he was accused of hitting a woman. 
 He denies doing anything worthy of expulsion. And, in any event, he says, he wasn't expelled, he was "fired."
So last Tuesday he applied for unemployment pay, contending that he was entitled to $300 a week because he had lost a $77,400-a-year job.
Unemployment office officials turned him down. Legislators who are out of a job, they said, are not eligible to collect unemployment.
Mr. Jaye tried again, arguing that he was not out of work because of an election loss.
Still no dice, the unemployment folks said.

These Cheerleaders Say, 'It's Better Here'

BYLINE:  By AILEEN CHO 

 BODY:
WHEN Denver and Dallas were competing recently with Chicago to woo the Boeing Company, which wanted to move its headquarters out of Seattle, they deployed superstar athletes to greet the company's executives. When Plano, Tex., and Jackson Hole, Wyo., sought to attract California companies disaffected by the energy shortage, they sent flashlights along with their marketing brochures.
 In the end, Boeing chose Chicago -- not for its athletes, but rather for basic reasons like big tax breaks and a central location. And while a number of California companies are thinking about moving out of state, there is no evidence that they are responding to the California-bashing approach taken by some cities that want them. 
 Nonetheless, the news from Boeing and California illustrates the frenzy that has accompanied the growth of economic development organizations -- cheerleader groups of corporate real estate brokers, bankers, economists and marketers that showcase their areas to entice new business.
"In the early 90's, there were only a couple dozen in California," Paul Saldana, president of the Economic Development Corporation in Tulare County of California, said of groups like his. "Today there are several hundred."
The International Development Research Council, a corporate real estate trade association based in Norcross, Ga., that includes many economic development groups, has tripled in size since 1990, to nearly 3,300 members. And while they all share the same goal, they are often hungry rivals. 
Many cities, for example, anticipate that various California companies, exasperated with rolling blackouts and uncertain power supplies, may leave the state -- or at least expand elsewhere. Just last week, Craig Barrett, chief executive of the Intel Corporation, the largest producer of computer chips and one of California's biggest employers, said that if the state did not have reliable power within five years, "it would not be on any possible expansion list" for new plants.
And while no big companies have left California since the power crisis, many smaller businesses are thinking about it. A poll conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business showed that 20 percent of employers with 10 or fewer workers might choose to move out.
ECONOMIC development groups are not waiting for such decisions. They are trying to make them happen, using the hot button of energy. Some groups in Michigan sent glow-in-the-dark mousepads to California companies. In North Carolina, the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce sent letters containing nine-volt batteries.
Others consider such efforts counterproductive. Development groups in Arizona and New Mexico, which have long tried to lure California businesses, have avoided playing the energy card.
"There's a huge backlash when you do that," said Rick L. Weddle, president and chief executive of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council. "We've suspended marketing to C.E.O.'s during the power crisis. It's respect."
Whatever happens in California, economic development officials say the sheer growth in their numbers means that the challenges of attracting new business have intensified.
"Come grow with us," Mr. Saldana recalled a former client, Kern County, Calif., saying in a proposed marketing pitch. "I showed them two other ads saying the same thing."
Mr. Weddle added: "Every Johnny said, 'Let's build a billboard.' Can you imagine a C.E.O. saying, 'We'll go to Community X because of a football player greeting us?' " 
The competition has spawned a subindustry of consultants who specialize in coaching regions on selling themselves. Development Counsellors International, for example, tries to help economic development groups find the right campaign and media audience. "Because these decisions are so complex, there's been a growth of our field," said Ted Levine, chairman of the firm, which is based in New York. "It's more empirical, less intuitive. They buy a lot less whiskey" for prospects, he added.
That means choosing targets and campaigns carefully. "We often tend to flood prospects with tons of data, half of which is not useful," Mr. Saldana said. Celebrity endorsements and statistics about a county's colleges, tax rates and weather are all well and good, but a company that depends on fast, efficient truck deliveries, for example, may be more interested in the highway system.
The Hampton Roads area of Virginia, which recently persuaded a small paper manufacturer from New Jersey to relocate, uses its deep and developing ports as a lure. Tulare County banks on its 19 percent unemployment rate appealing more to blue-collar businesses than white-shoe consulting concerns. Tacoma, Wash., concentrates on companies in nearby Seattle whose workers are tired of the traffic jams but not the region.
Mr. Levine said that for years, local politicians might have wooed company chief executives over golf, discussing the area's sports teams or opera company. Now, officials are more likely to pull out maps and talk about their city's planned light-rail line to the airport or its deep-water channels for large ships.
"In the 90's, it was often about lifestyle," said April Mason, an executive at Development Counsellors International. "Now it's back to the basics of power and transportation."
Boeing's chairman, Philip M. Condit, hinted as much at a corporate meeting in April, telling shareholders that clogged freeways were part of the reason for moving from Seattle. "Commuting is really tough," he said.
Taking a cue, nearby Tacoma is pumping $26 million into its share of a light-rail system that will eventually connect it with Seattle. Tacoma also promotes its $100 million high-speed fiber optic network. Juli Wilkerson, director of its economic development department, said: "We were dependent on Boeing. We had to diversify so that this is not a one- or two-industry town."
Jacksonville, Fla., is looking for ways to lessen its dependence on a different kind of commercial draw -- its National Football League franchise, the Jaguars. Although the Jaguars have helped raise the national profile of Jacksonville, which had experienced a decline in its paper-milling industry, the city is now pinning hopes on its sheltered seaport, rail connections and highways.
SOMETIMES, a region's effort to sell itself can strengthen morale and self-image, regardless of the outcome.
Mr. Weddle recalled that in his work for Tulsa, Okla., in the early 1980's, when the city was competing to lure a new Saturn automotive plant, there was widespread doubt that the effort would succeed. "But we made a papier-mache car 10 feet long and shipped it off to the city so that the mayor could unveil it" in front of the Saturn executives, Mr. Weddle said. "I'd be remiss if I didn't note that it did not work." 
Still, he said, it made the mayor happy.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
In Mexico, Stocks Rise As Growth Slows

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
WHEN America sneezes, the saying goes, Europe catches a cold. Using this logic, Mexico should be stricken with the flu.
 Equity prices in the United States and Europe are hurting, reflecting weaker economic conditions. The pace of growth is also slowing in Mexico. But stock prices there are soaring. So far this year, its Bolsa index is up more than 17 percent in local currency terms, and more than 22 percent in dollars. By contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500 is down 4.5 percent. 
 Jose Luis Gomez-Pimienta, who has managed the Mexico Fund since its inception in 1981, talked last week from Mexico City about the country's market surge. Following are excerpts from the conversation. 

Q. Why is the Mexican market holding up in the face of what is happening in the States?

A. We are seeing that this is not the end of the world.
Unless something traumatic happens, the Mexican economy will grow this year at around 2 percent to 3 percent, down from 7 percent in 2000. But inflation and interest rates are coming down. At the start of the year, short-term interest rates were 19 percent. Now they are around 11 percent. 
In addition, the high expectations that surrounded the election of President Vicente Fox last July are still in place. There are high hopes his policies will generate a positive impact on Mexicans, both in terms of income growth and employment. 
Finally, even with the rise we have seen in stock prices, in general valuations in the Mexican stock market are quite modest.

Q. Which sectors and companies have been doing well?

A. The banking sector, an important part of the stock exchange, has been a very good performer.
After the nationalization and the crisis in 1995, the banks were in a terrible situation. But over the past few years, they are reflective of a change in attitude in the country, a recognition that Mexico needs to open parts of the economy to attract systems, people, technologies and whatnot to improve the quality of life. 
There have been a number of purchases by foreign banks of Mexican banks in recent times, but the Citigroup/Banamex transaction stands apart. After this transaction closes, the majority of the Mexican banking system will be owned by non-Mexican investors.

Q. How many independent Mexican banks are left?

A. Three important ones, BanCrecer, Banorte and Bital.

Q. What about other sectors?

A. Retailing stocks have been doing well. Wal-Mex, the Mexican subsidiary of Wal-Mart, has been a market leader. Modelo, which makes Corona beer, has done well. Corona has replaced Heineken as the No. 1 beer import in the United States. And Femsa, which makes Coca-Cola, has also been doing well.
Cemex, the third-largest producer of cement in the world, has been a good market performer. So has Telefonos de Mexico.

Q. In the past, when one large Latin American economy or market moved, the others moved in tandem. This year, big markets like Brazil and Argentina are down. But Mexico is doing just fine. Why?

A. Mexico is much more a participant in North America than Latin America. We have much more in common with the United States than with other Latin American countries.
This is increasingly the case since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Q. The Mexico Fund, which is a closed-end fund and trades on the New York Stock Exchange, is up 26 percent so far this year and 40 percent over the last 52 weeks. What are your three largest holdings? How many stocks are usually in the fund?

A. Wal-Mex, Banamex and Telmex are our three biggest holdings.
There are 179 companies that are listed on the Mexican stock exchange. In the last couple of years, there have only been two initial public offerings. Today, we have about 27 names in the Mexico fund portfolio. That number has been as high as 35 or 38.

Q. Which United States-based companies are benefiting from what is happening in Mexico?

A. Big auto companies, like General Motors and Ford, used to be listed on the Mexican stock exchange. That is no longer the case. But some of the most efficient plants they operate have been built in Mexico.

Q. A number of Mexican stocks trade as American depository receipts. Could you name a few of the strongest companies?

A. Companies like Telmex, Cemex and Televisa, the largest Spanish-speaking production company for radio and television, trade as A.D.R.'s. So does Tubos de Acero de Mexico, which manufactures steel pipes and tubing for the oil and natural-gas industries.

HEADLINE: In Control, but Losing a Grip 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA FITZGERALD 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
DICK CODEY had reason to feel victorious as the state's leading politicians gathered at the Doral Forrestal Hotel Conference Center in Plainsboro one night in April. Mr. Codey's political strategy -- after a year of planning and calculating -- was falling into place.
 Democrats were close to winning a redistricting battle with Republicans that could tip the scales in their favor for the next 10 years. The 11th and deciding member of the redistricting commission -- a professor of political science at Princeton University, Larry Bartels -- had just told Mr. Codey, the Senate Democratic leader, that he would largely support the Democratic plan to carve out new voting districts in the state. 
 For Republicans, who have controlled the Assembly, the Senate and the governor's mansion for the last decade, the loss over redistricting was one more in a series of embarrassing events in recent months. It capped the growing turmoil within the party in a year in which New Jersey residents witnessed Republican leaders' titles change nearly as frequently as the spring weather. 
"I have not seen a year like this," said Roger Bodman, a prominent Republican lobbyist.
First Christie Whitman resigned as governor to head the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Then the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, who assumed the role of acting governor, announced he would run for a full term in November. But after several newspaper articles appeared that raised questions about Mr. DiFrancesco's business dealings and ethics, he hastily dropped out of the contest and was replaced by Bob Franks, the former Republican congressman from Berkeley Heights who narrowly failed to win a Senate seat last year.
But the party's disarray can be traced even further -- to 1999, when after the decks had been cleared for her candidacy, Mrs. Whitman abruptly announced she was no longer interested seeking the Senate seat being vacated by Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat. Republicans were left scrambling until they came up with Mr. Franks to run against Jon Corzine, a political neophyte with a $500 million bank balance.
Although Mr. Franks had the heart, he desperately lacked the finances to go up against Mr. Corzine, dubbed by some as "a human ATM machine." As the campaign wore on, it became painfully obvious why Mrs. Whitman chose not to go head to head with Mr. Corzine, a former head of the Goldman Sachs investment firm with pockets as deep as the Potomac.
Even the Republican presidential candidate, George W. Bush, largely wrote off the state as a political loss. His calculation proved correct, though Mr. Franks put up a better fight against Mr. Corzine than most politicians -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- had foreseen.
So when it came to the issue of redistricting, Republicans -- hoping to keep their majority status in Trenton and protect their incumbents -- just wanted to tinker with the existing map. But that was not appealing to Mr. Bartels. He saw the Democrats' plan, which diffused some of the minority votes in urban centers, as more equitable. Democrats had convinced Mr. Bartels that their party was getting more votes every year, but continually remained underrepresented in the Legislature. They were being robbed, the Democrats contended, because the current map, devised after the 1990 census, favored Republicans.
Democrats had good reason to believe Mr. Bartels might be sympathetic to their argument. Having read everything the Princeton professor had ever written, the Democrats were keenly aware that he supported a "doctrine of fairness," which basically stated that the party that won the most votes in the state should have the most seats in the Legislature. Republicans believed that Mr. Bartels should apply the fairness doctrine when looking at a statewide race, however, not individual legislative races where in some districts, like Essex, the Republicans never even fielded a candidate.
In the end, Mr. Bartels agreed with the Democrats.
Quite a feat, Mr. Codey understood, since Mr. Bartels was chosen for the commission by a Republican appointee, State Supreme Court Chief Justice Deborah Poritz.
The Democrats figured that going into the redistricting debate, required every 10 years when new census figures are released, they were better prepared, better focused and better financed. The Republicans seemed complacent, and acknowledge now that they did not fully understand the keenly organized forces Mr. Codey would unleash until it was too late.
While Democrats were winning the support of Mr. Bartels, Mr. Codey saw the Republican leaders -- many who had planned on retiring from public life -- as resigned and disengaged. At one point, according to a Republican observer, a leading player on the Republican team was using down time in the hotel room to play computer solitaire rather marshal the party's collective energy to plot a better strategy.
"Who was it that said, 'You don't know what you've got till it's gone?' " quipped one Republican who asked not to be identified.
The Democrats, out of power in Trenton for nearly a decade, were hungrier. They caught Republicans off stride and seized upon a moment when the Republicans were making the transition from the regime of Mrs. Whitman to a new set of leaders.
"Ten years of wandering in the wilderness and you do get hungry," said Tom Wilson, a spokesman for acting Gov. Donald DiFrancesco.
In retrospect, it seems that Mr. Corzine's candidacy was crucial to Democrats in two ways. First, it reversed a predominant financial equation that historically played against Democrats in New Jersey -- that they simply could not raise as much money as well-heeled Republicans.
Second, it infused the party with cash that pumped new energy into races at the local level. Democrats have been in operating in an energetic overdrive ever since, while Republicans are kicking themselves for not sending more money to Mr. Franks.
"There are some people who think that if Franks had some more money he might have been able to close the gap," said one Republican consultant, Steve Salmore.
Mr. Salmore added that even $1 million more would have allowed Mr. Franks another week's worth of television advertising, which in a late-deciding state like New Jersey, could have introduced the congressman to more voters and made a crucial difference in the outcome of the race.
It does not help that although Mrs. Whitman has left the state, she has not left the headlines -- mostly in an unflattering way. For one thing, Mrs. Whitman has been portrayed as an out-of-the-loop chief at the environmental agency. And at a time when the issue of racial profiling is a top priority in Trenton, the former governor finds herself being sued for frisking a black youth in 1996 while accompanying State Police on a drug sweep of Camden. As it turned out, the youth had no drugs in his possession, and a photograph of the incident captured Mrs, Whitman -- in white exercise suit and gloves -- smiling for the camera. 
Ask most legislators in Trenton, and they will say that Mrs. Whitman's departure has not left any discernible void among Republicans. According to polls, there was little disappointment when she left for Washington and almost a collective sigh of relief among the lawmakers. Many acknowledge it was Mrs. Whitman's style to dictate, rather than negotiate with legislators, which goes a long way toward explaining why the Republican message in the governor's race so far has been to run away from, rather than highlight, her eight-year tenure in New Jersey.
To some political observers like Jon Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspective and an aide to former Gov. Jim Florio, it is interesting that Republicans, who presided over one of the state's longest periods of economic prosperity, would be running away from their past and toward a self-described "reform" agenda.
"Franks and the Legislature are not running on Whitman's record, and nobody thinks they should," said Mr. Shure. "It was an eight-year administration, it was an unprecedented economic time, and yet you don't see Republicans going around saying, 'What Christie Whitman started, I'm going to finish.' "
Mr. Salmore put it this way: "To a large degree, it is a reflection on Whitman. She never drove home the fact that she should be taking credit for the good times. She never really talked about it in '97. Instead, she was on the defense the whole time talking about auto insurance and property taxes."
The reform agenda being driven by Mr. Franks has ruffled some party stalwarts. They don't believe that ideas like voter initiatives, term limits and an elected state auditor are the kinds of issues that drive voters to the polls. They say the Republican Party is not doing enough to remind voters of what life was like under Governor Florio and the Democratic Legislature, including Mr. McGreevey and Mr. Codey.
"Our environment is cleaner and we're putting more people in prison," said Assembly Speaker Jack Collins. "Republicans have been in power for nearly a decade. Look at our success coming in after the Democratic-controlled government in 1990 and 1991. New Jersey was at its lowest ebb. Now, the G.O.P. has got major futuristic plans, including things like school construction, open space and the transportation trust fund."
For his part, Mr. Collins believes that Republicans should just take the ads devised by Mr. Corzine in his primary race against Mr. Florio and run them for the party.
"We should be constantly be nailing them with Jon Corzine's commercials talking about what life was like under Florio and Doria and Codey and Lynch," he said, referring to the Democratic Legislative leaders early in Mr. Florio's first term. "And then we should be asking people, 'Do you want to go back to that?' "
To the contrary, Republicans seem bent on dismantling some of what Mrs. Whitman put in place, including her former right-hand man, Peter G. Verniero, whom she promoted from chief of staff to attorney general and then nominated for the State Supreme Court.
Calls for Mr. Verniero's resignation surfaced this spring when lawmakers determined he misled the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1999 while testifying about his knowledge of racial profiling by the State Police. Mr. Verniero, who not so secretly floated the notion of perhaps running for governor, was was now being villified by his own party.
During Mr. Verniero's confirmation hearings for the State Supreme Court, State Senator William Gormley, the Atlantic County Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Mr. DiFrancesco had twisted arms to get Mrs. Whitman the votes needed for Mr. Verniero's nomination. Now they were angered because they believed that Mr. Verniero had misled them. Indeed, Mr. Gormley -- who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Franks in the Republican primary for the United States Senate race last year and is expected to make another run next year -- immediately called for Mr. Verniero's resignation and asked that the Assembly begin impeachment proceedings.
The result was a party at odds with itself. For one thing, Speaker Collins was miffed, and did not want the whole Verniero affair dumped in the Assembly's lap. He refused to take up the question of impeachment, figuring that it was the Senate's problem. Still, the rift between Senate and Assembly Republicans is seen as little more than a scuffle that will be forgotten long before the fall elections, when the Legislature and governor's seat are up for grabs. 
"The common interest is their political future," Mr. Bodman said.
But the November battle poses its own problems for Republicans. The Democratic nominee for governor, Mayor Jim McGreevey of Woodbridge, has no opposition in his primary, and is already shoring up support from such important flanks as labor unions, ethnic groups and minorities. And like Mr. Corzine, he is also assiduously working the all-important elderly vote. In the meantime, the Republicans face a nasty primary battle between Mr. Franks, who is not opposed to legalized abortion, and Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City, a conservative who is.
If Mr. Franks wins the primary, he will have to embrace the conservative flank delicately while not alienating the moderates. He will also have to come to terms with the pro-gun lobby, perhaps carving out a position where it will quietly support Mr. Franks or, at the very least, stay out of the race.
While many blame Mr. Schundler for the leaks to the media that resulted in the unflattering stories involving Mr. DiFrancesco's ethics, others speculate that the pro-gun lobby -- a group that Mrs. Whitman actively courted while running for governor in 1993 -- was partly to blame for Mr. DiFrancesco's demise.
"They never got over the fact that Don wouldn't post the assault weapons repeal under Florio," said Mr. DiFrancesco's spokesman, Mr. Wilson. 
Already, factions of the Republican Party are peeling off. State Senator Bill Schulter, whose district was carved up during the redistricting battle, announced he will run as an independent candidate for governor -- though no one gives the veteran senator from Pennington a prayer. Still his agenda of campaign finance reform will probably peel more votes from the Republican base rather than the Democratic side.
In addition, State Senator Jack Sinagra, who has represented parts of Middlesex County for 10 years, has announced he will not run again, leaving his newly redrawn district seat largely to a Democrat, Barbara Buono. Mr. Sinagra has criticized an important aspect of Mr. Franks's reform plan, Initiative and Referendum, a method to give citizens a chance at making their own laws.
Those looking for a silver lining can say that at least the Republicans are grabbing all the ink. But there are many within the party who do not accept the notion that any media exposure is a good thing. There are many who want a do-over of the past year. And there is little denying that there remains a lingering anger on the part of some Republicans who still can't believe their party blew the redistricting decision. 
The way the final negotiations played out are telling. Even after Mr. Bartels told Mr. Codey he was going to support the Democratic map, Mr. Codey was not taking anything for granted. All he had left to do was pluck the professor from the hotel suite where Republican Party leaders were seething over Mr. Bartels's decision. Earlier that week, Republicans tried bolstering their case by hiring Walter Fields, a public affairs consultant and former political director of the state N.A.A.C.P.
Mr. Fields, who opposed the idea of diminishing minority districts, was stunned that Mr. Bartels had abruptly decided the matter. Republicans were under the assumption that their maps -- constantly being revised -- were still in play. They wanted answers, and Mr. Bartels was not going anywhere until he did some explaining.
Mr. Codey was not about to let them whittle away at Mr. Bartels' resolve. He needed to get Mr. Bartels out of the room quickly. First, he convinced attorneys that Republicans were questioning Mr. Bartels in anticipation of a lawsuit. Anything he said could and would be used against him, Mr. Codey said as he tried to extricate Mr. Bartels from the room. By now, Mr. Codey's plan to portray the Republicans as unreasonable -- and his weeks of cajoling, humoring and just plain charming the buttoned-down Mr. Bartels -- was working. 
Democrats had so successfully wooed Mr. Bartels -- not only convincing him that they needed to take a hasty vote but also that there might be physical threats -- that when the vote to realign New Jersey's voting districts for the next 10 years was finally taken, there was no public notice and security guards flanked the room. It was a master stroke by Democrats, who successfully urged quick action lest the unruly Republicans stop the vote. 
The truth was that nothing was going to stop the Democrats at this point. They had worked too hard to turn back.
"It appears that the Democrats have been at this the last 18 months and have had substantial help from the Democratic National Committee," said Assemblyman Paul DiGaetano, a Republican from Passaic who hopes to become the next Assembly speaker.
Mr. DiGaetano had hoped going into the process that he would emerge with a more Republican district. His 1997 race was so competitive that Mr. DiGaetano was forced to raise and spend unprecedented amounts to retain his seat. He even recently moved from Passaic, which is heavily Democratic, to Nutley in the hope of having a safer political district. But because of the dilution of minority districts, Mr. DiGaetano now has a district more laden with Democrats.
Mr. Codey, on the other hand, emerged victorious. With a majority of his district minority, critics say Mr. Codey understood it was only a matter of time before a member of a minority group would challenge him for his seat, so in picking up more white suburban towns, he has enhanced his own re-election efforts.
Mr. Codey acknowledged that Democrats had been preparing for redistricting for more than a year, amassing money and working with the National Committee for an Effective Congress, which is financed by the Democatic National Committee, to come up with a system to "unpack" New Jersey's minority legislative districts that were put in place by Republican maps a decade ago.
Republicans had no way of knowing that unpacking minority-based districts would be allowed. After all, the districts were put in place after the 1990 census as a way of giving minorities greater representation in the Legislature. If a Republican were to suggest that the districts be unpacked, there was little doubt they could have been seen as politically incorrect or simply racist.
"If Republicans tried the same tactics they would have failed," Mr. Fields said. "No one would buy the fact that Republicans were trying to protect minority interests."
But Democrats were able to convince minority lawmakers that the changes were a good thing. The mantra was repeated over and over, "It's better to be a minority in a majority than a minority in a minority."
"It was a very ingenious suburban strategy," said Mr. Fields. "They basically said that we will break up this urban base and connect with some of those white suburban voters that lean Democrat. They're going back and trying to get the Reagan Democrats -- a blue-collar working-class Democrat. It's very ingenious and at some levels, a very devious strategy."
For his part, Mr. Fields said the strategy offended him because the minorities made all the concessions.
"Rule No. 1 in politics is that you never give up your base," Mr. Fields said. "Now we're being told less is more."
The other thing Democrats had working in their favor was the sheer enthusiasm they brought to the table. While Republicans viewed Mr. Bartels as a statistician to be put up with, Democrats wanted him to be their good friend. Mr. Codey went so far as to order sweatshirts and hats from the colleges where Mr. Bartels had studied to be stockpiled in his car as a potential weapon of flattery and humor. He also read everything Mr. Bartels had ever written and would often cite his own research during his arguments.
While Republicans attended the meetings and scurried around to seek last- minute help from their Washington allies, the Democrats were focused on execution of their plan. One unstated rule was never to let Mr. Bartels hit a restroom alone. They would talk about sports, joke about families, make small talk, all while subtly portraying the image of the Republicans as out of touch.
"There's no question Democrats did a better job of manipulating the 11th member," Mr. Fields said. 
Some Democrat staff members jokingly referred to the Republican commission staff members -- all of whom were mostly white men -- as "the Blue Ridge Mountain boys" within earshot of Mr. Bartels or his assistant.
By contrast, the Republican contingent on the redistricting commission was mostly old-guard Republicans, and what might be perceived as a fatal error, few of whom actually had a political stake in the redistricting map. 
There was the chairman of the Republican Party, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian -- an appointee of Mrs. Whitman -- who was told midway through the negotiations by Mr. DiFrancesco that he would be replaced in June.
One Republican said in disbelief, "I still don't understand the timing of that announcement." 
Once a powerful Assembly Speaker, Mr. Haytaian had been out of elective politics since 1994 when he lost a United States Senate battle to Mr. Lautenberg.
Next, there was Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, who last fall briefly floated the idea of running for governor. Mr. Collins, an intense man who lives on a small farm in South Jersey, soon threw in the towel when he saw how much time and energy the race entailed. Also on the commission was Mr. DiFrancesco, the Senate president. When he was named acting governor, Mr. DiFrancesco's seat on the commission was given to Senate Majority Leader John Bennett.
Republicans have used the redistricting loss to their best advantage, at least in the short term. Contesting the redistricting maps in court gave Republicans more time to reconsider their top choice for the governor's race. The Republican-controlled Legislature agreed to extend the primary election until the end of June, which gave Mr. DiFrancesco enough time to bow out.
In the long term, the Republican Party needs to figure out how to deal with districts that are simply more Democratic-leaning.
The strategy that Mr. Fields supports is the "High Noon" version, in which the Republican Party walks into the main streets of Newark and other urban areas, and effectively says: "The fight starts here. We're not taking any vote for granted."
"They've got to go in now and declare war," said Mr. Fields, who is being retained as a Republican consultant. "You have to meet them on the street and declare a duel, stating you will not cede any more votes. As a black, it is a very paternalistic notion that the only place I can go is the Democratic party."
Mr. Fields believes it is time for Republicans to go after the black vote because he believes the Democrats in New Jersey have done relatively little for the minority community.
"The Republican Party must make a commitment to aggressively court the black vote," Fields said. "It's been manipulated for a long time. The Republicans should not be afraid to walk into black communities and put money behind candidates in competitive districts. They also have to be pursuing an agenda that is not antagonistic in any way toward black interests."
Others say that is a costly course to pursue. 
"If you decide to slug it out in the belly of the beast you'd better have a lot of resources," said one Republican strategist. 
Another strategy is to cede a few more districts to the Democrats and pump even more money into the remaining competitive districts, still allowing Republicans to keep their majority.
The Democratic plan is not foolproof. It is built on fragile alliances with the minority community that could turn sour if blacks and Hispanics start losing their representation to white Democrats. If there remains no net gain for minorities, Republicans should be poised to broker new alliances with minority communities.
Republicans are already looking to make inroads. For instance, Franks has named Secretary of State DeForest (Buster) Soaries as his co-campaign manager.
Republicans say this year has taught them a lot of lessons. They vow not to be unprepared again in the redistricting debates. Their biggest challenge is to reinvigorate the fight in those who are used to being in power and perhaps take it for granted.
"The redistricting decision got a lot of people mad," Mr. Wilson said. "And that's good."
Mr. Wilson should know a great deal about motivation. He managed Mrs. Whitman's 1997 campaign, in which the governor narrowly beat Mr. McGreevey. Many believed the campaign was flawed because of a certain malaise Mrs. Whitman herself brought to the race.
Like a motivational coach, Mr. Wilson believes anger may be just what is now needed for the Republicans. "It makes you work," he said, "a lot harder."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
At the Fed, 2 Opinions Of the Same Storm

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
ONE of the more interesting debates within the Federal Reserve has been the one between Alan Greenspan, the chairman, and Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor with a reputation as a doctrinaire inflation fighter. In recent speeches, on the same day but thousands of miles apart, they went at it again, in their indirect way. 
 In doing so, they provided a glimpse into issues with which the Fed is wrestling as it tries to determine what the 2001 slowdown says about forces that reshaped the economy for the better in the late 1990's. And they illustrated that for all the deference shown to Mr. Greenspan on monetary policy, his voice is not the only one at the table. 
 Mr. Meyer is known for his belief in rule-based forecasting that assumes predictable interplay among economic growth, unemployment and inflation. Mr. Greenspan has a more pragmatic, intuitive approach. 
Mr. Meyer has been skeptical of the notion that the economy's capacity for noninflationary growth has been permanently improved by productivity increases. Mr. Greenspan has been an advocate of the idea that the economy is just beginning to reap the benefits of technological advances.
Mr. Meyer's belief that strong growth and unemployment in the 4 percent range would inevitably generate inflation was tested by a long period in which that combination did not put much upward pressure on prices. Mr. Greenspan's optimism about technology and productivity is being tested even now, as the late 1990's boom has given way to a slowdown. 
Neither man seems to have changed his view substantially. In an address to a financial seminar on May 24 in Scotland, Mr. Meyer acknowledged that productivity growth accelerated sharply starting around 1995, from an annual rate of 1.5 percent the preceding two decades to 2.5 percent to 3 percent. 
At first, enhanced productivity growth stimulated demand by spurring both consumption and investment booms, Mr. Meyer said. Technological innovation promised high returns to businesses willing to invest in equipment. Surging stock prices -- themselves in part a response to higher profit expectations -- left consumers feeling wealthier and more willing to spend. 
At the same time, Mr. Meyer said, the surge in productivity growth had a disinflationary effect. Because workers did not immediately demand higher wages as their payoff for improved productivity, "unit labor costs fell, profits rose, and then competitive pressures passed along the lower costs to lower prices," Mr. Meyer said.
The effect was to reduce the level of unemployment at which strong growth would ignite inflation, he said. But the benefits were "temporary bonuses," he said.
"Once productivity growth stabilizes, even at a much-elevated level, these forces dissipate, growth slows, and pressures on prices might intensify," Mr. Meyer said.
There is reason for optimism, he said. Still, he added, "some will have confidence in the productivity story only when it is tested by a cyclical decline," suggesting that he remained unsure whether the productivity gains would fully survive a downturn.
Mr. Greenspan, by contrast, appears confident that technology-driven improvements in productivity will yield long-term benefits. And while Mr. Meyer remains nervous about inflation, Mr. Greenspan made clear that it is hardly on his radar screen.
There is "ample evidence that we are experiencing only a pause in the investment in a broad set of innovations that has elevated the underlying growth rate in productivity," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York, a few hours after Mr. Meyer's remarks across the Atlantic. Mr. Greenspan emphasized that the economy faced many risks, including a drop in demand for capital equipment. But he said inflation was not one of those risks.
While some inflation measures have been creeping up, the broadest ones have been relatively stable, and "the lack of pricing power reported overwhelmingly by business people underscores an absence of inflationary zest," he said.
FOR all their differences, Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Meyer often agree on monetary policy. And both have signaled that they might support one or two more rate cuts.
They agreed on one other thing: the current slowdown is not the Fed's fault. The central bank, Mr. Meyer said, got it just right over the last two years, until the economy was blindsided by "a coincidence of adverse shocks," like rising energy prices and jittery financial markets.
Not raising rates in 1999 and the first half of 2000 "would have added fuel to an economy that was already threatening to overheat," Mr. Greenspan said, and cutting rates too soon "would have risked cutting short the adjustments needed to sustain long-term economic growth."

HEADLINE: The Tax Bill Up Close: Some Facts, Some Tips 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH has fulfilled his promise that every American who pays taxes will send a smaller check to Washington. But under the legislation passed by Congress and awaiting his signature, the greatest and most varied tax-trimming opportunities will go to Americans who earn the most and save the most. And people with similar incomes and even similar circumstances will get widely varying benefits, with people in higher-tax states in the Northeast and the upper Midwest faring worst.
 The legislation lowers tax rates for everyone. That alone will save every taxpayer anywhere from less than $100 to an average of more than $1 million for the top 400 earners in the country. People who save, especially those 50 or older, will benefit from significantly increased limits on tax-favored savings. They will also get a new kind of 401(k) that will let them withdraw their gains free of taxes, thus extending the benefits of tax-free investing to those who now make too much money to qualify for a Roth IRA. 
 The legislation also allows more tax-free saving for education, including, for the first time, for private colleges. It increases tax credits for children. It reduces estate taxes, eliminating them in 2010 -- but only for that year. 
Still, many taxpayers making between $72,000 and $627,000 -- especially those with large families, big medical bills, or homes in higher-tax states like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Illinois and California -- will see perhaps two-thirds of their Bush income tax cuts taken away by another levy called the alternative minimum tax.
Alas, if anything ever created uncertainty about future tax liabilities, these roller-coaster provisions do. Most of the Bush tax breaks do not kick in for years; others start this year and end in four years. The estate tax is scheduled to end in 2010 -- only to be resurrected a year later.
Following is a taxpayer's guide to the most significant provisions of the new tax bill, including advice on how to get the most out of it.

Income Tax Rates
Tax rates will fall in stages for everyone over the next five years.
First, the bill creates a new 10 percent bracket. It applies to the first $12,000 of taxable income for married couples, the first $10,000 for single parents and the first $6,000 for singles.
Until now, that income has been taxed at 15 percent. So this change, which will be retroactive to Jan. 1, will save all married couples as much as $600, single parents up to $500 and singles up to $300 annually.
Higher-income taxpayers will also benefit from lower rates on the last dollar of their income. By 2006, the 39.6 percent rate paid by the top 1 percent of taxpayers will have fallen to 35 percent, the 36 percent rate to 33 percent, the 31 percent rate to 28 percent, and the 28 percent rate to 25 percent.
Higher-income taxpayers will also benefit because they will no longer lose personal exemptions for themselves and their children, as well as itemized deductions like charitable gifts and mortgage interest payments, as their income rises. These benefits are currently taken away at the rate of $30 per $1,000 of additional income above a threshold of as little as $64,475, depending on one's family status. This rate will fall to $20 per $1,000 starting in 2006, to $10 in 2008, and will be eliminated in 2010.
One way to take advantage of the legislation is to accelerate tax-deductible expenditures -- making them this year instead of in future years, when rates are lower. For example, someone in the top bracket could create a fund at his local community foundation this year with enough money to cover charitable gifts for the next decade or so, taking a deduction at the 39.1 percent top rate this year instead of the 35 percent top rate for 2006 and later. So a fully deductible $100,000 gift now, for example, would save $4,100 more in taxes than it would in 2006.
"There's no question that you save if you give now," said Albert R. Rodriguez, a partner in Rodriguez, Horii & Choi, a tax and charity law firm in Los Angeles.

Alternative Minimum Tax
Many middle- and upper-income Americans -- those making $72,000 to $627,000 -- will be upset to learn that their tax cut will be much smaller than they might have expected.
That is because of the alternative minimum tax, enacted three decades ago to prevent wealthy people from claiming so many deductions, exclusions and credits that they wind up with little or no tax bill. Since Congress has never revised this tax enough to account for inflation and changes in the regular income tax, it now rarely applies to people making more than $627,000, the very group for which it was intended. Rather, it raises the tax bill of Americans making less than that.
People are most likely to be affected if they have many children and thus many personal exemptions, unusually large miscellaneous deductions for items like medical expenses, or large deductions for state and local income taxes and property taxes. The 10 states where taxpayers are most likely to owe the alternative minimum tax are, in order, New York, Wisconsin, Oregon, Maryland, Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Connecticut and New Jersey, according to Democrats in the House of Representatives. Ohio is close behind.
For example, a couple with two children and with income of $373,000, the threshold this year to be among the top 1 percent of earners, receive a base tax cut of $11,900 under the legislation, but the alternative minimum tax will reduce the tax savings to $2,940, according to Citizens for Tax Justice, a Washington research group whose calculations are accepted by groups both supporting and opposing the Bush tax plan. The news is even worse for a single parent in a higher-tax state who makes $150,000 or $250,000, according to an analysis by the Deloitte & Touche accounting firm. Because of the alternative minimum tax, these parents get no tax cut at all.
In the legislation just approved, Congress provided modest, and temporary, relief from the alternative minimum tax. The bill increases the limit on deductions that are exempt from the alternative minimum tax by $4,000, to $49,000, for married couples. The exemption for singles rises by $2,000, to $24,500.
But these increases end in 2004. This means that in 2005 and later years, many taxpayers will see even more of their Bush tax cut taken away by the alternative minimum tax.
And the number of Americans affected by the alternative minimum tax is now expected to rise far faster than it would have without the new legislation, because that tax was not adjusted to account for the new lower rates. About 1.5 million Americans will pay this tax this year, and under current law that number would have grown to nearly 20 million by 2010. Under the new bill, however, the number is expected to soar to more than 35 million.

Retirement Savings
The legislation significantly expands tax-favored retirement savings.
For many people, the most important change is a new savings plan called the Roth 401(k), which will become available in 2006 to all workers whose employers also offer 401(k) plans -- even high-income individuals who do not now qualify for a Roth IRA. The current income limit for a Roth IRA is $160,000 for couples and $110,000 for singles.
In a traditional 401(k), workers can save up to $10,500 in before-tax income this year, as well as a certain percentage of their salary in after-tax dollars. But when money is withdrawn, taxes are owed on pretax contributions and all investment gains. With a Roth 401(k), contributions will be made with after-tax dollars, but all investment gains will be tax-free and the money does not have to be withdrawn before death. 
Workers will be allowed to have both traditional and Roth 401(k) plans, with a combined maximum of $15,000 annually, or $20,000 for people 50 and older.
Ed Slott, an accountant in Rockville Centre, N.Y., who publishes Ed Slott's IRA Advisor, a newsletter, said that most people who expect to leave at least some money to their children or grandchildren should choose the Roth 401(k). "Yes, you will be putting in after-tax dollars," Mr. Slott said. "But at the back end you are much better off, because not only will withdrawals be tax-free, but there is no minimum annual distribution required. You should think of your Roth 401(k) savings as not so much for your life as for the lives of your children and grandchildren, who will be able to draw the money out untaxed over their lifetimes."
Someone who contributes $10,000 to a Roth 401(k) this year, lives 10 years and then leaves the money to a teen-age grandchild is making a gift worth more than $600,000, tax-free, over that grandchild's projected lifetime, assuming an 8 percent annual return.
Daniel Halpin of Grant Thornton, the accounting firm, said that once the Roth 401(k) starts, "there would no longer be a reason to make after-tax contributions to a 401(k) unless they are Roth contributions."
Individuals who expect to use their 401(k) savings in retirement, rather than pass the money along to heirs, might prefer traditional 401(k) plans if they expect to be in a lower tax bracket after they stop working. 
Beginning next year, the limit for Individual Retirement Account savings -- which has held steady at $2,000 a year since 1981 -- increases to $3,000; it moves up in phases to $5,000 in 2008. After accounting for inflation in the last two decades, and assuming 3 percent annual inflation in future years, the new $5,000 limit will only restore the 1981 limit in real terms.
Starting next year the maximum annual contributions to 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans for nonprofit workers and 457 plans for government workers, which had ranged from $8,500 to $10,500, will be identical and will grow in phases until 2006, when the maximum will be $15,000.
Limits are being raised, to $10,000 in 2005, on Simple (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) retirement plans, which apply to enterprises with 100 or fewer workers.
Congress gave an extra break to workers 50 and older. They will be able to make extra contributions, called catch-up contributions, to their I.R.A.'s and to all four kinds of employer-sponsored retirement savings plans. 
The catch-up provisions are described in the new bill as a matter of fairness to women, many of whom presumably were out of the workplace to bear and raise children and had no earned income in some years. But workers of either sex can make catch-up contributions, even if they have worked continuously.
For the I.R.A., the catch-up limits are $500 in 2002 through 2005 and $1,000 in subsequent years. 
Participants in Simple plans havecatch-up contribution limits of $500 next year, rising in stages to $2,500 in 2005 and later years.
For 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plan participants, catch-up contributions start at $1,000 next year and rise in $1,000 increments until 2006.
The bill also provides a tax credit to help couples earning less than $30,000 ($15,000 for singles, $22,500 for single parents) save for retirement: they will receive a credit of 50 percent of the amount they save, up to a $1,000 credit on $2,000. Those who make up to twice these amounts can receive a credit of 10 percent or 20 percent of what they save, but only if they owe income taxes, which the credit can reduce to zero. And this credit is good only for four years,2002 through 2005.

The Marriage Penalty
Millions of married couples pay more in taxes than they would if they were not married. The legislation helps them.
For those affected by this so-called marriage penalty, the legislation provides some relief, but not until 2005, when it starts to phase in. But except for low-income couples, full relief never arrives.
For the tens of millions of couples in the 15 percent bracket, the marriage penalty will end that year. Millions of two-income couples who are in the higher brackets, however, will continue to be penalized. The maximum marriage penalty is almost $18,000, an analysis using TurboTax software shows, but the maximum relief under the bill, had it been in effect last year, would have been $1,531, according to Len Burman, a tax specialist at the Urban Institute in Washington.
The changes also mean that more couples will collect a marriage bonus, paying less in taxes than they would as singles because one spouse earns the bulk of the family income, said Eugene Steuerle, also of the Urban Institute. And in many cases, that bonus will be larger.

Tax Breaks for Children
The child credit increases this year to $600, from $500, for children under 18 and then rises in steps, to $1,000 in 2010. The maximum income for a couple to qualify for the credit will remain at $110,000, which means that millions of parents will actually lose this credit because of inflationary increases in their income.
The maximum credit for child care expenses will rise next year. Parents can receive a credit of as much as 35 percent of their child care costs, up from 30 percent, with a maximum credit of $3,000, up from $2,400. That credit doubles for families with two or more children.
The maximum credit for expenses in adopting a child will double next year, to $10,000 a child, and the maximum income for those parents before the credit begins to phase out will also double, to $150,000. In 2003, tax breaks for people who adopt children with special needs will also increase, to $10,000 from $6,000.

Education Expenses
Under current law, a $500 after-tax contribution can be made each year on behalf of a child to an Education I.R.A., for college expenses. Starting next year, $2,000 can be contributed annually. 
Interest, dividends and capital gains in these accounts can be withdrawn tax-free to pay school expenses. The new tax bill also allows the money to be used for kindergarten through 12th-grade education expenses, including tuition for private and parochial schools and expenses for state-approved home schooling, as well as for college.
The Education I.R.A. has income limits, but they do not effectively block anyone from making a gift, said Barry C. Picker, a Brooklyn accountant who works with retirement and other savings plans. Parents who "make too much to qualify for the education account can have the child fund their own account because you are not required to have income from a salary" to make contributions.
Another break is given to taxpayers who save for tuition and expenses at state colleges and universities through "529" plans. Currently, investment gains are taxed at the student's rate, usually no more than 15 percent, when the money is withdrawn. Now, such gains will be tax-free.
In a major expansion of the 529 concept, the legislation lets people save for tuition and expenses at private colleges and universities. These institutions will be allowed to form networks, so that someone could save for any one of a variety of schools. The legislation does not specify how much can be saved. 
Tuition subsidies, provided by some employers for their workers tax-free, were made permanent for undergraduate study and reinstated for graduate study. The maximum tax-free benefit to workers remains unchanged, at $5,250.
Interest on student loans will become deductible for the life of the loan, not just the first 60 months.
Congress also created a deduction for college tuition of $3,000 next year and in 2003, rising to $4,000 in the next two years before ending. The deduction is available to couples earning less than $130,000 -- half that for singles.

The Estate Tax
 Tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans, those who owe taxes on their accumulated wealth when they die, start kicking in next year, as the amount that can be passed to heirs tax-free increases significantly and the tax rate on the largest estates starts falling.
If you die this year, the first $675,000 is exempt from the estate tax and the top tax rate is 55 percent on amounts greater than $3 million. If you die next year, the amount exempt from tax will rise by 48 percent, to $1 million, saving $125,500 in taxes, while the top estate tax rate will fall to 50 percent. On a $100 million estate, dying next year will save nearly $5 million.
The exemption will keep rising in steps, until it hits $3.5 million in 2009, and the top estate tax rate will fall until it reaches 45 percent in 2007.
The estate tax would not apply to those who die in 2010. It would then be resurrected in 2011, with the exempt amount returning to the current figure of $675,000 and the top rate returning to 55 percent. Tax experts disagree on whether a future Congress will make sure that the tax is not revived and on whether repeal will ever take effect.
These changes make for a nightmare for people trying to plan. The worst mistake would be to assume the estate tax will not be owed if one lives long enough. But even if one lives until 2010 and repeal remains in effect, new problems arise that will require professional advice. 
Without revisions to a will, for example, the changing tax rates and rules can result in a surviving spouse being left with little or nothing, said Jonathan G. Blattmachr, an estate tax lawyer at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy in New York.
The new legislation will create another headache because heirs will have to determine how much their inherited assets have increased in value, to calculate the capital gains taxes owed when the assets are sold. The new bill will allow $3 million of capital gains to pass tax-free to a spouse and $1.3 million to other heirs. Gains above these amounts will be subject to capital gains taxes.
Taxes on gifts of more than $10,000 per person each year will also be lowered in stages, as will taxes on generation-skipping gifts to grandchildren and others who are much younger than the donor.
The bill also reduces the credit for state estate taxes paid, and phases it out in 2005. Some taxpayers may see their state and local income, sales or property taxes rise to make up for the lost revenue.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 10, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the effects of the new tax-cut law misstated the tax treatment of estates after 2010 -- the year that the estate tax is scheduled to be repealed but also the last year in which the law applies. Unless Congress acts, the maximum amount that an individual can leave without estate tax being owed as of Jan. 1, 2011, will be $1 million, not $675,000.

Econ 101: It's Right and It's Wrong

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN; Michael M. Weinstein is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

 BODY:
ELECTRICITY deregulation -- allowing power companies to set wholesale prices on their own -- has gone seriously awry in California. Severe shortages have led to rolling blackouts and soaring prices, with wholesale prices rising about 700 percent in a year, jolting the state's economy. Last week, Gov. Gray Davis grabbed for instant relief. When President Bush visited his state, Mr. Davis lobbied hard for federal regulators to impose a price cap on power companies -- a maximum price that wholesalers would be permitted to charge.
 The president dismissed the governor's demand, offering an economics lecture instead. "I oppose price caps," he explained, because, "price caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply." 
 That's a pretty sound argument, based on Economics 101. If price caps don't increase supply, they cannot relieve shortages. Besides, economics professors tirelessly preach about the evils of price controls. Applied to a competitive market, caps threaten to reduce output -- the opposite of what California needs -- by driving out companies that can't make a profit selling at the lower prices set by the government. Indeed, economics students who persist in thinking that price caps are pro-consumer risk being taken aside by their college advisors and urged to switch to another major.
Yet while Mr. Bush's lecture would sit well in most introductory Econ classes, it did not sit well with some of the nation's leading authorities on regulation. Ten prominent economists -- including Paul Joskow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Severin Borenstein of the University of California at Berkeley and Alfred Kahn, the architect of airline deregulation under President Carter -- have sent a letter to the president calling for the federal government to clamp down on wholesale energy prices. Nostrums suitable to the textbook world of perfect competition, they argue, do not fit the messy facts of electricity markets.
It might seem like a man-bites-dog story, but the idea of economists calling for price controls isn't nearly as zany as it appears.
Electricity prices skyrocketed in California in part for standard supply-and-demand reasons. The supply of power fell as rising prices for natural gas, used to produce electricity, drove up its cost of production. Supplies dwindled further as power companies in neighboring states exported less electricity to California. And demand rose swiftly along with the increasing use of computers and other electricity-guzzling hardware. 
The most contentious question is whether another factor has also been at play: manipulation by power companies of the rules set up by the state to enforce deregulation. Specifically, have the companies withheld supply in order to jack up the price that authorities pay for power? 
In truly competitive markets, attempts to withhold supply to raise prices are fruitless. If Farmer Brown withholds her 10 bushels of corn from a market of billions of bushels, corn prices would not rise one cent. But the market for electricity, California style, is different. The complex rules have provided an unintended incentive for power companies to fool regulatory officials. By withholding electricity at the price offered in the morning of a typical day, the power companies can count on the officials to come back later in the day and plead for power at a substantially higher price. 
This is not just a theoretical possibility. Mr. Joskow says he has found evidence. There is probably nothing illegal going on; the power companies do not appear to have conspired to withhold supply. Each acted alone.
If the 10 economists are right, Mr. Bush needs a refresher course in economics. Price caps, they say, can indeed increase supply. Once they are in place, prices can no longer rise. So power companies would have nothing to gain by withholding supply. They would sell more electricity, easing the shortage. The economists warn against setting price caps so low that power companies quit the industry. Instead, they call for setting caps somewhat above the actual costs of production -- which would allow companies to make a profit.
The gang of 10 have not taken leave of their professional senses. The economists don't advise adopting price caps indefinitely. Left in place, the controls would discourage investors from building new power plants -- which, along with fixing perverse incentives under deregulation, is the best near-term solution to California's energy crisis. Fortunately, price caps won't be needed very long because enough power plants are under construction to ease the shortage in 18 months or so. Then, the lessons of Econ 101 might start making sense again.

HEADLINE: Sunday Q & A 

 BODY:
 Sunday Q & A appears in this section weekly. Readers are invited to send in questions about national or international affairs; those selected will be answered by Times correspondents who specialize in those issues. Information about submitting questions appears below.

Leaky White Houses

Q. The Bush administration came into office saying it would stop leaks to the news media. How successful has it been?

A. David E. Sanger, a White House correspondent, responds:
 Every new administration vows to run a leakless ship, and eventually every administration has failed. For a while, many in the White House press corps thought President Bush and his aides might buck the trend. They stayed on message.
But recently -- to the enormous relief of White House correspondents -- that discipline has begun to break down. There are many reasons. First, Mr. Bush is no longer surrounded solely by the Texas loyalists who ran his presidential campaign with discipline and discretion. Now, jobs are beginning to go to Republicans with less loyalty to the president. Many are longtime Washingtonians, veterans of the city's bureaucratic wars over setting policy. 
Leaking is one way to fight those wars. Some officials send up trial balloons before publicly announcing a new policy; if the balloon gets shot down, the policy change magically disappears. Others seek to get a tidbit of evidence into the public domain that could tip the administration's internal debate. 
Sometimes the administration has begun to leak, in hopes of sending a message to a foreign power or to Congress without fingerprints. 
One oddity: Those no-discipline Democrats managed to keep secret Washington's biggest political surprise this year, the wooing of Senator James M. Jeffords, left, from the Republican Party. Doubtless the White House would have appreciated a good old-fashioned leak.

Asians in European Union?

Q. Turkey is not in Europe, is it, so how could it join the European Union?

A. Douglas Frantz, the correspondent in Istanbul, responds:
Modern Turkey, unlike its Ottoman predecessor, has only the barest toehold in southeastern Europe: half of the city of Istanbul is in Europe, and that part is linked by a couple of suspension bridges to the rest of the country, which geographers have traditionally described as falling in Asia. But if geographers often see the Bosporus as the dividing line between Europe and Asia, Turks do not see it that way.
In 1923, when Mustafa Kemal Ataturk shaped the new republic out of the ruins of the Ottoman Empire, he insisted that Turkey become European and set up European-style institutions virtually overnight. In his most symbolic gesture, Ataturk banned the fez and tried to force his countrymen to adopt the fedora. It never caught on.
Nowhere is this divide more evident than in the debate surrounding Turkey's candidacy for the European Union. For Turks, many of whom are still sensitive about no longer being a great empire, joining Europe's most exclusive club would confirm that they are as good as anyone.
Still, there are good reasons for welcoming Turkey to the European fold. It has been a relatively stable country that sits in a volatile and strategic neighborhood, is already part of NATO and, despite its current economic troubles, possesses a vibrant underlying economy. Not least, admitting Turkey would also send a message of tolerance by accepting into Europe a huge Muslim population often rightly suspicious of religious bias.

Views on Standardized Tests

Q. What do Americans think about standardized tests?

A. Kate Zernike, an education reporter, responds:
It depends on how and whom you ask.
Nationwide, 84 percent of parents polled by Public Agenda, a public opinion research firm, said students should not get a diploma if they fail graduation tests like those required by 29 states. But when asked whether it is "wrong to use the results of just one test" for graduation, 75 percent said yes. That changes when parents are asked whether they support a graduation test if states give students extra help and several chances to retake the test. In Massachusetts, the scene of bitter antitesting debates, 71 percent of parents in a survey last October by the research group MassInsight said students should have to pass the test to graduate. But that rose to 85 percent when parents were told that students got help and four chances to retake the test.
Testing gets more support in polls of black or Hispanic parents and of those whose children attend schools in large cities. In Chicago a survey last October for the public schools found that 64 percent of all parents polled said students should not be promoted if they did not pass an end-of-year exam. In the survey 65 percent of black parents supported the test, 71 percent of Hispanic parents and 59 percent of non-Hispanic whites.

HEADLINE: Arrest Me, Please (But Jail? No Thanks); 
Rediscovering the Price of Protest

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

 BODY:
Civil disobedience has an enduring and noble history. As long as human beings have made laws, they have broken them out of principle.
 But that history is not immune to farce. During a round of protests last year against police brutality, the Rev. Al Sharpton, now a temporary resident at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, decided to bring his protest to the theater district. 
 Leading a flying wedge of fellow demonstrators, reporters and police officers just before curtain time, Mr. Sharpton reared up in front of the New Amsterdam Theater, where "The Lion King" was playing. He sat down. He was going to block the entrance. Arrest me, he dared the police. 
Unfortunately, there was no show that night. No theatergoers. No arrests. So on Mr. Sharpton went until he reached "The Phantom of the Opera" at the Majestic, where, sure enough, he got himself arrested, capping a week of orchestrated sit-ins that were coordinated with the police.
Mr. Sharpton has carved himself a niche in America's chronicle of civil disobedience. He has done so during a post-Vietnam, post-civil-rights era, when civil disobedience more often than not approaches a courtly minuet danced by the authorities and the demonstrators.
But that may be changing.
The pax protestiana seems to be fraying.
Mr. Sharpton has received a 90-day prison sentence, and three Bronx politicians 40 days, for protesting Navy bombing exercises on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques. They said they had expected fines. The New York City police are cracking down on peaceful demonstrators by requiring a night in jail instead of a summons. The police in Washington arrested hundreds of peaceful marchers and closed down a demonstration headquarters during the World Bank meeting last year. Court decisions and a federal law have limited the actions of anti-abortion protesters at clinics.
On the other side, the protesters are not always keeping their side of the bargain. Civil disobedience turned ugly at world trade meetings in Seattle in 1999. At the Washington demonstrations, some activists did not tell the police ahead of time about their actions. Others linked arms through tubes, making it hard for the police to separate them. Some among the hundreds arrested at last summer's Republican convention in Philadelphia refused to identify themselves, the police said. 
To the chagrin of purists, many young protesters are not willing to bear even the smallest punishment, say a few hours in jail, for their disobedience.
What would Henry David Thoreau have thought?
His 1849 essay, "Resistance to Civil Government," or simply "Civil Disobedience" in a later book, is scripture for the movement. 
The essay's spark was a night Thoreau spent in jail for refusing to pay the poll tax as a protest against slavery. He begins with the premise, " 'That government is best which governs least,' " and goes on: "I think that we should be men first, and subjects afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume, is to do at any time what I think right."
That is the case even if prison is the penalty. "Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison." 
After 50 years of relative obscurity, the essay was read by a young Mohandas K. Gandhi, who later reprinted it as a pamphlet for Indian workers in South Africa and adopted its principles for a mass movement. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. read and reread the essay in college. In his own sweeping, Thoreauvian statement on civil disobedience, the 1963 "Letter From Birmingham Jail," Dr. King wrote: "There are two types of laws: there are just laws, and there are unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that 'An unjust law is no law at all.' "
History and literature have long had their lawbreakers who suffered out of conscience. Consider Antigone (suicide before death by burial alive), Socrates (poisoned by hemlock), Jesus Christ (crucifixion) and Christian martyrs in the Roman empire (lions, dismemberment, etc.). In our day, the penalties are usually fines or jail. But how much are our martyrs willing to pay the price? 
"Traditionally people thought, well, civil disobedience is something where you break the law and you accept the punishment, and that was part of the deal," said Arthur Spitzer, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in the Washington area. He is suing the District of Columbia Police Department over the treatment of the World Bank demonstrators.
"But it was also part of the deal that if people respected what you had done, the punishment might be light," he said. "Now, many people are trying to avoid even that punishment." 
Dr. King, in his Birmingham letter, wrote that those in his movement "repeatedly asked ourselves the questions, 'Are you able to accept blows without retaliating?' and 'Are you able to endure the ordeals of jail?' "
Perhaps the arrangement since the 1960's has grown too cozy. Civil disobedience has certainly become a settled element of the national discourse, and a successful one. Consider the causes it has attracted: unfair taxation in colonial America, abolitionism, women's suffrage, labor rights, civil rights, the struggles against the Vietnam War, apartheid, nuclear weapons, AIDS, pollution, abortion, animal rights. 
Tax protests don't count unless you tell the world. Civil disobedience needs its publicists to be effective, whether it's a Plato or the news media.
Maybe, then, it is no surprise that sit-in arrests came to be so well choreographed, and so well attended by celebrities and politicians seeking votes. 
During the protests in 1999 at police headquarters in Manhattan over the shooting death of Amadou Diallo, organizers arranged the arrests a day ahead. The police gave photographers a chance before arresting the demonstrators. Vending machines provided ice cream and chocolate bars while the arrests were processed. The quid pro quo is that in return for police accommodation, the protesters do not resist. 
That comfort level defeats the purpose, argues Akhil Reed Amar, a professor of constitutional law at Yale.
"The more the law is enforced, the better for the true civil disobedient, because that is the way you make your point," he said. "When the minuet is elaborately choreographed, that is repressive tolerance. It is a really clever government's way of blunting the civil disobedient. The martyr wants to dramatize the injustice of the law." 
In the South of the 1960's, "Martin Luther King prevails because he basically suckers them to turn on the fire hoses," Professor Amar said. "They are basically dumb enough and naive enough to do it, and the American people were good enough basically to side with him and against Bull Connor."
Curiously, it may have been the widespread acceptance of the civil rights movement in America that allowed subsequent generations of police officers to collaborate in civil disobedience, he said.
Others see a danger in the end of the minuet.
"We're concerned now that because of what's happening in the Vieques case, there could be a backlash, a chilling of peaceful civil disobedience in America," said Norman Siegel, former director of the New York Civil Liberties Union and a candidate for the city's public advocate. He is working on the Sharpton case.
John T. Tomicki is a man who may be light-years away ideologically, but who takes a similar position. He is executive director of the League of American Families, a conservative policy group, and has taken part in dozens of sit-ins at clinics to protest abortion. 
The Federal Access to Clinic Entrances Act, in addition to a number of court decisions, have sharply limited such sit-ins.
"There has been an increased police and judicial heavy-handedness," he said. "We see it in the free speech area, and we see it in the sit-in, demonstration area." There is no doubt, he continued, that the access law "had a chilling effect on civil disobedience" in front of clinics, he said. "If the same rules had applied to civil rights sit-ins at lunch counters, on buses, people would probably still be in jail today."
Why has the climate for civil disobedience changed, if it has?
Mr. Tomicki blames liberal judges. Mr. Siegel says the Bush and Giuliani administrations are threatened by mass protest movements. Mr. Spitzer of the A.C.L.U. suggests that the Washington police were mindful of the chaos in Seattle a year before. Fear of terrorism, stoked in recent years by Timothy McVeigh and the men who bombed the World Trade Center and the United States Embassies in Africa, looms larger, may be prompting less tolerance for protest. 
What has not changed is the experience of jail, whether for a night or 90 days.
Thoreau said he never felt confined, and felt freer than his fellow townsfolk. "The walls seemed a great waste of stone and mortar," he said. Dr. King used the "dull monotony of a narrow jail cell" to write his letter and to "pray long prayers."
Those jailed in Brooklyn over Vieques endure strip searches and wage a hunger strike. And they also watch television, give interviews and try to keep the political machine running.

HEADLINE: One Developer's Power Solution: Build a Plant at the Office 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
With state officials scrambling to stave off power shortages this summer, a New York developer has come up with his own solution: building a sophisticated power plant, complete with gas turbines and smoke stacks, inside his planned West Side office complex.
 Power experts and real estate brokers said the project might be the first privately owned one to generate the kind of high-quality, reliable power needed for computer operations. 
 Gas turbines are among the cleanest power generators. The heat exhaust from the turbines would be used to drive steam generators for the building's air-conditioning system. Any surplus steam would be sold to Consolidated Edison. 
The developer, Douglas Durst, is proposing to build a 47-megawatt generating station, with six gas turbines and enough power to light 40,000 homes a year. The power plant would serve his planned $200 million NYCyberCenter, a six-story building on a block bound by 11th and 12th Avenues between 57th and 58th Streets.
The complex would be for tenants needing huge, air-conditioned spaces for computers and electronic equipment used for the Internet or data storage.
But these kind of buildings, known variously as telecom hotels, server farms and data centers, require enormous amounts of electricity to power the computers and air-conditioning systems, typically 10 times as much as a comparable office tower.
Given the current concerns about power shortages, Mr. Durst, whose family owns 10 Manhattan skyscrapers, said he decided to build his own cogeneration plant rather than rely primarily on Con Ed. He has brought in the Trigen Energy Corporation of White Plains to build, own and operate the turbines.
"It's the most innovative and exciting project we have worked on," Mr. Durst said, "but it's also the most difficult. It has taken an effort by more than 40 people to come up with a solution that will enable companies with dense power requirements to secure premium power with unparalleled reliability."
Mr. Durst still needs permits from the state and the city, but government officials say they are intrigued by the proposal.
"It's a novel program," Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles said. "It seems to bring with it a number of benefits, but the city has to complete its due diligence before reaching a final decision."
Kevin Corbett, chief operating officer of the Empire State Development Corporation, said, "Anything that can help reduce emissions and provide energy more efficiently is certainly worth looking at."
Mr. Durst said he planned to begin demolition on the site in August for the first phase of the project, a 420,000-square-foot building. He will add office space and possibly a residential tower in two successive stages, he said. If the project is successful, experts said, other Internet data centers might quickly use the same technology, especially with tightening power supplies in California and the Northeast.
"With California facing a white-knuckle summer of up to 200 hours of rolling blackouts, every kilowatt of energy reduction is critical," said Dr. William M. Smith, a manager of the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit development organization for the electricity industry. "This cogeneration facility may be a forerunner of things to come as the digital economy tries to keep the lights on."
Demand for electricity has soared in recent years in New York as well, but private power companies have been slow to build new power plants since the deregulation of the electricity industry in the mid-1990's.
The first two of 21 proposed large and medium-size plants around the state will not begin operating until at least late 2003. Meanwhile, the state is spending $510 million to build six small gas turbine plants in the city and one on Long Island this year, some of which have encountered opposition.
The administration of Gov. George E. Pataki has also encouraged hospitals, factories and colleges that have their own backup generators to run them when demand for electricity is high and there is a threat of power shortages. But environmentalists have criticized the effort because most of those power plants are diesel generators, which would create more pollution, and most of them are in New York City, which already violates federal clean air standards.
That is what makes Mr. Durst's use of energy-efficient gas turbines and steam generators as his primary source of power attractive to environmentalists who oppose diesel generators and nuclear power plants.
"They're demonstrating that you can have high-quality, reliable power and do it in a very clean way," said Ashok Gupta, senior energy economist for the Natural Resources Defense Council. "We'd support expediting the permits if they met clean air standards."
According to Con Ed, Mr. Durst's project is one of 22 proposals it has received for telecom hotels or Internet data centers. But the other projects rely chiefly on Con Ed for their power, requiring 60 to 120 watts per square foot, compared with 7 to 10 watts for an office building. In addition, the tenants typically have a series of diesel generators and battery systems for backup power in the event of a breakdown.
Tenants at the telecom hotel at 75 Broad Street, for instance, have 44 diesel generators, each of which can cost millions of dollars to build and maintain and take up as much as 30 percent of each company's space.
Mr. Durst said that tenants in his building would save money because they would not need to rent the extra space or buy backup systems. His power plant would have backup turbines and in the event of a breakdown would immediately switch to Con Ed power. The electricity in his building, he said, would cost no more than what Con Ed charges.
"Customers won't have to worry about storms, lightning or Con Ed," said Richard A. Ubaldi, a vice president of Trigen Energy.
Still, there are risks in Mr. Durst's plans. Many Internet-related companies have collapsed over the past year, while those that survive are finding it hard to get financing for new projects. Real estate brokers said that few tenants were now willing to sign leases for space that has yet to be built.
That is one reason the developer has expanded his list of potential occupants to corporate data centers. Mr. Durst said he expected the market to recover in the 18 to 24 months it took to build his complex.

Er, Um, (ahem!)

BYLINE:  By William Safire 

 BODY:
A well-watched Russian newscast called "Naked Truth" is anchored by a woman with a serious expression who slowly strips as she recounts the major events of the day. The weather forecaster is topless. Above the A.P. article about this news uncoverage, The Seattle Times carried the headline "Russian Anchorwomen Do the Nudes, er, News."
 At about the same time last year, The New York Times headlined an article about Hillary Clinton's campaign for the Senate using that same representation of a verbal delay: "The Wonk, er, Woman Behind Mrs. Clinton." 
 These are examples in headlines of the arch pause. In olden times, writers drew attention to puns, nice turns of phrase or metaphors that the inattentive reader might otherwise miss with so to speak, as it were or if you will. Now the preferred little alarm to awake the sleepy is the written er, um, uh, ah, well or for extreme throat-clearing, ahem.
The signification of the arch pause with an er or an um is rampant in journalese. It says, "Here comes a little witticism, you ninny," as in this usage by Al Kamen in The Washington Post: "Loop fans will recall Tuesday's item on Monica S. Lewinsky preparing to field questions from law students in Manhattan that night as part of an upcoming HBO special. It was quite an, um, affair." That meaning of the pause -- Gee, but I'm being naughty here" -- recently extended to the gardening pages of The New York Times: "The spring peeper, Pseudacris crucifer," croaked Anne Raver in a delightful piece about frogs, "is one of the chorus frogs, so-called because of its joyful song heralding warmer weather and, ahem, the joys of mating." 
Sometimes the arch pause says, "I am understating," as in the Times columnist Gail Collins's "The wounds of the primary campaign have, um, not exactly healed." At other times, the writer, as if wondering, "Do I dare to eat a peach?" asks the reader's pardon for having the audacity to wax metaphoric, as in my colleague Paul Krugman's reference to "the renewed enthusiasm of Americans for huge, gas-guzzling vehicles -- an enthusiasm, er, fueled by cheap gas." In the same way, Andrew Coyne of Canada's National Post wrote last month that an energy report's "call for increasing capacity on interstate transmission lines is, er, well grounded."
Writing about the movie "The Mummy Returns," the U.P.I. Hollywood reporter Vernon Scott pulled out all the lingual stops: "While plots for mummy movies thicken and special effects provide more gaudy mayhem, the deep, primeval horror of the walking dead has been well, er, ah, deadened, so to speak." The reader who did not appreciate that metaphoric play must be wrapped in gauze.
The publication that led the way in the use of the arch pause is The Economist. In 1975, it wrote of the lawyers in the offices of Arab nations participating in the economic boycott of Israel: "Each office has the task of seeing that its country's trade relations are strictly, er, kosher." A year later, it wrote that "for Westminster to interfere with Edinburgh would be like, er, the House of Lords rejecting Commons legislation." And in the same month, an article on industrial success was headlined, "Take a Bow, Britain (er, Wales)."
In British English, the self-deprecating hesitation or Churchillian stutter is often used to draw attention to what follows; Rudyard Kipling in 1913 described life in smoking rooms as seen "through clouds of 'Ers' and 'Ums.' " Americans tend to see it as expressive of indecision. I put that to Johnny Grimond, editor of The Economist's style guide: "Probably when we've resorted to er or um, it's not so much an indication of indecision," he replied with authority, "but when one is led inexorably to a conclusion that is embarrassing or awkward or obvious."
Geoffrey Nunberg, who does a regular language feature on NPR's "Fresh Air," says he thinks that the use of the written er, um, uh, is an articulation of the dash, with which writers like Thackeray and Trollope indicated a rethinking of what went before. "In theory, in writing there should never be any false starts and pauses. When you use er or um, you are reproducing in a fictitious way the process of communication. It's a specious sense of the writer letting you in on the business of composition." Nunberg fears, as I do, that we'll see much more of this reconstruction of the writer's thought process in e-mail, which usually revels in the conversational and prefers the appearance of a work in progress. 
If the goal of the writer is to reflect a character's sloppy spoken language or to set on paper some revealing oral self-correction, then the pauses signified by er and its ilk serve a communicative purpose. We all make sounds that show we are thinking before we speak, and a writer's recording of them, though sometimes annoying, adds verisimilitude to dialogue. 
But that's not the arch pause in narrative or commentary. My target today is not just the signifier for "Here comes one of my best zingers" but the one that says, "I ostentatiously hesitate to say this." A good example of the latter is in a note that President George Bush the elder wrote to his wife, Barbara, after being told that his opponent, Michael Dukakis, was scoring points with voters by showing public affection for his wife, Kitty. "Sweetsie, please look at how Mike and Kitty do it," Bush wrote. "Try to be closer in, more -- well, er romantic -- on camera."
I inveigh against the use of the written grunt because either it assumes the reader is an ignoramus or it needlessly apologizes for a writer's attempt at wit. Do not presume that your reader is moving his lips as he reads your prose. Do not be afraid to deliver the nudes.

Watt Price Ideology?

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
 I once had a math teacher who responded to student errors by saying "Save that answer -- I may ask that question someday." I thought of him after George W. Bush's apparently pointless trip to California. 
 During that trip, Gov. Gray Davis asked for a temporary cap on wholesale electricity prices -- a request that gained extra force because it was backed by economists with strong pro-market credentials, including Alfred Kahn, who oversaw the deregulation of airlines, trucking and other industries in the 1970's. Mr. Bush, however, was unmoved. Again and again he declared that a price cap would do nothing either to increase supply or to reduce demand. 
Save that answer, Mr. Bush. We might ask that question someday.
Actually, Mr. Bush's assertion may have been wrong even on its own terms. I'll come back to that in a minute. But the most striking thing about his declaration was that it had nothing to do with the actual problem.
For the issue facing California right now is not how to increase supply and reduce demand. It's too late for that; summer is almost upon us, and it is simply a fact of life that there will be power shortages in the months ahead. It is important that the state build power plants as quickly as possible, so that this shortage is only temporary. But not to worry: power plants are being built at a furious rate, in California and in the nation at large. Indeed, last week the credit agency Standard & Poor's expressed concern that electric generating capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut.
Meanwhile, however, the temporary lack of capacity has led to incredibly high wholesale electricity prices, which are a huge financial burden on the state, over and above any disruption that may be caused by physical shortages of power. Nobody knows exactly how much California will pay for power this year, but reasonable estimates suggest that it will pay at least $50 billion more than two years ago -- an increase of more than $1,500 for every resident. The great bulk of that represents not an increased cost of production but windfall profits for a handful of generating companies.
The main purpose of a temporary price cap would be to reduce -- though by no means eliminate -- this transfer of wealth away from California residents. That is, we're talking about dollars, not megawatts. And Mr. Bush's response is therefore almost surrealistically beside the point.
You could argue that any financial benefit from price caps would be more than offset by a worsened physical shortage. But that's a hard case to make. Nobody has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power producers from making extraordinarily high profits; why should this reduce the supply of power? 
It's true that Econ 101 teaches that price controls tend to produce shortages. But this would be a minor effect in this case, since neither production nor consumption would be much affected. And anyway, students who go beyond Econ 101 learn that strictly speaking the standard argument against price controls applies only to a competitive industry. A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need not cause a shortage, if it is set high enough; indeed, price controls on a monopolist can actually lead to higher output. That's not an argument you want to use too often, but given the extraordinary prices now being charged for electricity, and the considerable evidence that producers are exercising monopoly power, if ever there was a case for a temporary price ceiling, California's electricity market is the place.
I am actually somewhat surprised by Mr. Bush's obtuseness on this whole subject. No doubt his determination to answer the wrong question is deliberate: misrepresenting policy issues is, after all, standard operating procedure for this administration. But even on a cynical political calculation, Mr. Bush's remarks seem to be foolish, only reinforcing the sense that he neither understands nor cares about California's problems.
Maybe Mr. Bush's advisers are knee-jerk ideologues who believe that the market is always right, even when textbook economics says it is wrong. Or maybe they are so close personally to energy industry executives that they believe that whatever is good for Enron is good for America.
Whatever the real story, it's clear that this administration not only has no answers for California, it won't even listen to the question.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts and Political Shift Threaten Bush's Plans for Military 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO and THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2 

 BODY:
Powerful political and economic forces are threatening President Bush's pledge to design a "new architecture for the defense of America and our allies." While some of these forces were unleashed by the administration itself, Mr. Bush and Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld seem in some ways to have been caught off guard.
 The president entered office with a broad and ambitious agenda for the military, vowing to pare back "uncertain" peacekeeping missions overseas, swiftly deploy a ballistic missile shield and transform the forces with futuristic weapons that would make them lighter, faster and more lethal. 
 Mr. Bush was expected to begin announcing some of those potentially radical changes at a graduation speech before the United States Naval Academy last week. But those plans were postponed, in what was widely viewed as a sign of Mr. Rumsfeld's difficulties in reshaping the national military strategy. 
Paradoxically, Mr. Bush's signature achievement, a $1.35 trillion tax cut, is emerging as one of the largest potential obstacles to his military agenda. The fiscal plan has drastically reduced the amount of surplus dollars available to develop the kind of advanced weaponry the administration desires, not only for its missile shield but also for modernizing conventional forces.
Democrats in Congress contend that because of the tax cut, the federal surplus will disappear in 2003 for at least two years, leaving no money to expand Pentagon spending without cutting social programs, slashing military forces or dipping into the Medicare or Social Security surpluses. All those ideas would face fierce opposition in Congress.
On Friday, the administration asked Congress to augment the current $296 billion defense budget by $5.6 billion, largely to pay for increased health care and fuel costs. Mr. Rumsfeld is also expected in the coming month to request an increase of approximately $20 billion for the proposed 2002 budget to pay for everything from missile defense research to improved benefits.
Congressional officials say there will probably be money for Mr. Rumsfeld's 2002 request. But they say fiscal restraints will tighten significantly in 2003, when Mr. Rumsfeld hopes to begin enacting major, and potentially costly, changes to the military -- most likely by procuring higher-tech weapons like unmanned aircraft or antimissile technology. The Pentagon controller, Dov Zakheim, said this week that developing a missile shield would require "considerably more money." 
Representative John M. Spratt Jr., a South Carolina Democrat who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, said, "By our calculations, there is not enough money to meet even minimal expectations of what Rumsfeld's requests will be." 
"Without a compelling threat, an immediate threat," Mr. Spratt said, "I don't think cutting education or the environment is going to work."
Some Republicans have raised similar concerns. But the administration does not accept the Democrats' budget analysis. And some military officials have suggested that Mr. Rumsfeld could modernize without spending huge sums. 
Mr. Bush's efforts to scale back American peacekeeping missions and to build a missile shield are also facing sharpened opposition. Overseas allies remain deeply skeptical. And having already lost momentum on missile defense, the Republicans have now lost their Senate majority.
Finally, Mr. Rumsfeld has come under sharp criticism from senior military officers and powerful members of Congress who, worried that he may try to cancel favored weapons programs, reduce forces or close military bases, have accused him of ignoring them in his deliberations on overhauling the Pentagon.
As a result, Mr. Rumsfeld has been on a public relations offensive in the last month, visiting Congress repeatedly to plead for patience, consulting the military's most senior officers, sitting for interviews with reporters and inviting independent defense policy analysts to breakfast.
Even as he was preparing for a trip next week to visit with NATO defense ministers in Europe, Mr. Rumsfeld met every day this week with the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the secure Pentagon conference room known as the Tank to discuss a new defense strategy. All indications are that the strategy will focus more resources on Asia, missile defense and outer space.
While no final decisions were reached on a strategy, military officials said the intensity of the meetings showed Mr. Rumsfeld's desire to mend fences with senior military commanders, who have considerable influence on Capitol Hill. 
Mr. Rumsfeld's efforts may have eased tensions with Congress and the military brass, but advocates of transforming the military say the secretary also has seemed intent on reducing expectations for major change -- at least for now.
"On transformation, I think they think the best a politically savvy team can do is get a first down or two," said John Hillen, a military analyst who helped write Mr. Bush's campaign speech in which, as a candidate, he first advocated a "revolution in the technology of war." 
"But they won't go for the goal line," Mr. Hillen said.
Mr. Rumsfeld, in a spate of interviews and public appearances over the last few weeks, has clearly signaled that any transformation will be slow and incremental. 
"There's no question but that change is not easy for people," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "Any time anyone raises an issue about reviewing 'what is,' it inevitably causes people who like 'what is' and are comfortable with 'what is' to be concerned about it. The reality is that no one is going to be making any dramatic changes in anything because that's just not how Washington works."
Mr. Bush took into office a vocabulary borrowed from those who advocated a revolution in military affairs, and after a campaign in which he accused President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore of squandering the military readiness that he said was planned and paid for by the preceding Republican administrations.
Mr. Rumsfeld immediately assembled a coterie of wise men and women to review the issues confronting the nation's military, both in how it conducts war and how it conducts business. Individual panels, known as the Rumsfeld Reviews, considered acquisition, financial management, morale and quality of life, space, transformation, conventional force structure, crisis management, nuclear force posture and international strategy.
In public, Mr. Rumsfeld said that having been away from the Pentagon for a quarter-century, he needed a refresher course. "When you come from business to this department, and you're not as current as you would want to be in every aspect of what's going on here, what you need to do is find out what you think is important," he said.
But some senior officers and some members of Congress whispered to the media that by resume and reputation, Mr. Rumsfeld already must have known the answers to the questions he was asking. Thus, the view spread that each of the review panels would hand down the equivalent of stone tablets from some military Mount Sinai, whether as a specific new Pentagon policy or even a presidential directive. 
Today, though, many who have spoken with the secretary say the quality of the reviews was mixed. Some were visionary; some recommended the status quo; some contradicted others.
One panel assigned to study "transformational" weapons systems recommended many programs that had been supported by the Clinton administration, including the V-22 Osprey, the F-22 fighter jet, the Joint Strike Fighter and the Comanche helicopter. Another panel that explored major cuts to ground fighting forces shied from controversy.
"I think it's dawning on the Rumsfeld team that some good steps were already being taken toward transformation," said one senior military officer. "They believed what they said in the campaign, and they are finding it wasn't all true."
And Mr. Rumsfeld had every right to complain that his work has been slowed by the fact that only he and a tiny handful of senior policy assistants were confirmed by the Senate.
So even as the Rumsfeld review panels charted a new direction, he decided to steer the building with its standard rudder, an apparatus mandated by Congress: The Quadrennial Defense Review and the budget process.
"I think there was a widespread perception that there would be many more near-term announcements of dramatic change than what we're actually going to see," said Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, assistant secretary of defense for public affairs. He said the reviews were ordered up solely to "stimulate Secretary Rumsfeld's thinking," and the decision was then made "to fold them into the budget builds and the Quadrennial Defense Review."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about President Bush's efforts to overhaul the military misstated the Pentagon title of Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, who commented on review panels assembled by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. The admiral is deputy assistant secretary for public affairs, not assistant secretary.

HEADLINE: Bush Advisers On Energy Report Ties To Industry 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2 

 BODY:
At least three top White House advisers involved in drafting President Bush's energy strategy held stock in the Enron Corporation or earned fees from the large Texas-based energy trading company, which lobbied aggressively to shape the administration's approach to energy issues.
 Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political strategist; Lawrence B. Lindsey, the top economic coordinator; and I. Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, all said in financial disclosure statement released on Friday that they already had or intended to divest themselves of holdings in Enron, the nation's leading trader and marketer of electricity and natural gas, as well as holdings in other energy companies. 
 Mr. Lindsey received $50,000 last year from Enron for consulting. Mr. Rove's statement said he intended to sell stock holdings in Enron valued at $100,000 to $250,000, though the statement does not make clear if he has completed the sale. Mr. Libby sold his stake in the company. 
The financial disclosures for senior White House aides show that many of Mr. Bush's top advisers are millionaires. Among the wealthiest are Mr. Rove, Mr. Lindsey, Mr. Libby and Andrew H. Card Jr., the chief of staff, who earned $479,138.77 as chief lobbyist for General Motors and reported assets of $810,000 to $2.1 million.
Mary Matalin, Mr. Cheney's senior counselor and a former political commentator, reported income of more than $1.5 million last year from speaking fees and television appearances. Her husband, James Carville, a Democratic commentator and political adviser, made $2.1 million last year on the speaking circuit, Ms. Matalin's financial disclosure shows.
Enron was one of the largest contributors to Mr. Bush's presidential campaign. Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman, has close ties to Mr. Bush, as he did to Mr. Bush's father, and he has had considerable access to the Bush White House.
The administration's energy strategy issued last month recommended opening protected lands to oil and gas drillers, building hundreds of power plants and easing some environmental controls, measures strongly favored by the industry. It suggested that the federal government exercise more power over electricity transmission networks, a longtime Enron goal.
Mr. Lay and other Enron officials interviewed several candidates to fill vacancies on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates Enron's main markets. Mr. Bush selected two people for the panel who were favored by Enron and some other energy companies.
White House officials have said that Enron's views were not crucial to their selections. "The energy task force had a singular goal to present a plan that best addressed America's energy needs," a White House spokeswoman said. "Any decisions made as part of that process were made with that one goal in mind." The spokeswoman said the White House counsel's office had worked with all officials to ensure they met the highest ethical standards. 
Administration links to energy companies are wide ranging. Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, had stock holdings of $250,000 to $500,000 in the Chevron Corporation and earned $60,000 as a director of the company in the last year. She resigned her position and sold her shares.
Clay Johnson, director of presidential personnel, reported holding a stake in El Paso Energy Partners valued at $100,000 to $250,000. El Paso is a Houston oil and natural gas company. As part of his White House duties, Mr. Johnson has been involved in selecting people to fill vacancies at the energy regulatory commission, which oversees the natural gas market.
There was no indication in his disclosure statement that Mr. Johnson intended to sell his stake in El Paso.
The stakes in Enron held by Mr. Rove and Mr. Libby were part of diversified stock portfolios. Mr. Rove also reported investments in BP Amoco and Royal Dutch Shell, as well as several leading pharmaceutical, technology and financial companies. Mr. Libby, a lawyer, sold tens of thousands of dollars' worth of energy stocks. They included Texaco, Exxon Mobil and Chesapeake Energy as well as Enron.
Mr. Lindsey, the director of the National Economic Council, reported the most ties to major American and international companies. His Washington consulting firm, Economic Strategies Inc., advised 67 leading American, European and Japanese banks and businesses, including American Express and Citibank. Mr. Lindsey was paid an annual salary of $918,785. He also reported $50,000 in consulting fees from Crow Family Holdings, a Dallas real estate concern, and Moore Capital, a leading hedge fund, as well as Enron.

HEADLINE: FILM; 
A Portrait of Shattered Brilliance Comes Together

BYLINE:  By NINA DARNTON; Nina Darnton, who is based in New York, writes about entertainment.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J. 

 BODY:
ON a fine spring day, with the Princeton campus in fragrant, pastel bloom, John Forbes Nash Jr., winner of the 1994 Nobel in economic science, is making his daily rounds. He spends the morning at home, working on computations for an article he is hoping to publish. About noon, he stops in at the Institute for Advanced Study, where he eats lunch and talks shop with some colleagues at the math table. Finally, in the late afternoon, he enters his campus office at Fine Hall, the mathematics building, where he is meeting a reporter for an interview.
 He has come a long way from the time when, known as "The Phantom of Fine Hall," his feet bare, his hair long and dirty, his teeth worn down to stumps, he haunted this building in a bizarre caricature of an academic life, corralling students, ranting about religious prophecies, finding empty classrooms and scrawling formulas on the blackboards. 
 The remarkable journey of the boy genius who sank into paranoid schizophrenia for 30 years and then emerged to win the Nobel Prize for work completed before his breakdown is the subject of "A Beautiful Mind," a film being directed by Ron Howard and starring Russell Crowe as Mr. Nash and Jennifer Connelly as his wife, Alicia. 
The title is taken from a 1998 biography of Mr. Nash by Sylvia Nasar, a former reporter for The New York Times, but the filmmakers are quick to point out that the movie is not a literal biography. Instead, they say, they used Mr. Nash's story as inspiration for a broader attempt to depict the process and ravages of mental illness and to find a visual analogy for it.
"The film uses the architecture of Nash's life in the broadest possible sense," said Akiva Goldsman, the screenwriter. "We hit landmarks -- genius, marriage, Nobel prize, illness -- and that became the frame on which to hang dramatic anecdotes that I'd like to believe are true to the spirit of John and Alicia's lives. It is certainly not factual and never pretends to be. Most of the things that happen in the movie didn't happen in John's life."
Mr. Howard and his partner in Imagine Entertainment, the producer Brian Grazer, had long been interested in developing a film about mental illness; they had shepherded two previous projects on the subject to the script stage. But they felt that they had never solved the inherent dramatic problem of the material: how to take the mystery of the human mind and make it visually and dramatically compelling; how to create images for things that are intellectual and potentially static and at the same time present a human story that transcends these obstacles.
Mr. Goldsman's script met the challenge with strong characterizations and a powerful love story at its center. It also employs twists and surprises. Most important, it tries to present mental illness in a way that doesn't allow viewers to keep it at arms' length; the aim is to draw them into the experience from Mr. Nash's point of view.
Mr. Howard's interest in mental illness began with a childhood trauma. When he was an 8-year-old star on "The Andy Griffith Show" in the early 1960's, he witnessed the sudden mental collapse of a guest actor while the camera was rolling. "He was sitting in a chair, doing his dialogue," Mr. Howard said on the set at St. Marks Church in the East Village during a recent break from shooting. "Within a few moments he wasn't making sense, and by the time people realized he needed help, he was on the floor in the fetal position. It was one of the most extraordinary, intense, terrifying things I ever witnessed." 
For Mr. Grazer, the lure of the project was the chance to explore the connection between madness and genius and, ultimately, to present a story of human survival and triumph. But the triumph is not of the usual Hollywood variety; here, it is subtle and complex. "The triumph isn't that he beat schizophrenia, because he didn't," Mr. Grazer said. "The triumph isn't that he won the Nobel -- it's a great thing, but it isn't the singular triumph. The triumph is that his mind, his soul, his spirit, his intelligence, all of that survived against the will of the madness of schizophrenia. He was still able to engage."
The principals involved in the film express a respect for Mr. Nash and his wife bordering on awe. It's easy to see why. The story of his rapid ascent and devastating decline is the stuff of classical tragedy. At his height, he was brilliant, handsome, arrogant, a luminous star in Princton's renowned mathematics department. At his lowest point, deeply delusional, he was repeatedly hospitalized against his will. Finally, living with Alicia, who had divorced him in desperation and then took him in when, with no place to go, he begged her to protect him, he spent his days wandering the streets of Princeton, impoverished, paranoid, laughed at by the neighborhood children, sheltered not only by Alicia but also by the mathematical community. 
"She was unemployed, on welfare, raising their kid, nonetheless still young and beautiful and hoping to pick up her life again," said Ms. Nasar, who, though not involved with the film, occasionally visits the set at locations throughout New York and New Jersey. "But she could not bear to turn him away, so she took him in. And this is a big part of this script, and I think that's right. Because that's why this guy survived, because people like that usually don't survive." The Nashes, who never remarried, have remained together.
Mr. Nash's behavior seemed odd right from the beginning. To his colleagues in Princeton's elite graduate program in 1948, the personality of this loner was more an indication of brilliance than of potential madness. He entered Princeton with a one-line recommendation from his college adviser: "This man is a genius." Within 14 months, he had produced the Nash Equilibrium, the paper on game theory that won him the Nobel in economic science almost half a century later. (He shared the prize with John C. Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten.) Yet, according to Ms. Nasar, Mr. Nash's reputation rests not just on game theory but also on his work in pure mathematics, for which there is no Nobel Prize. "What he won the Nobel for is the most trivial thing he ever did," one mathematician told her.
He was drawn to problems that other mathematicians thought unsolvable and in some cases actually solved them. "He just went ahead and did it," Ms. Nasar said, "and to have that kind of inner certainty is a little crazy. It's also a certain level of genius."
Although Mr. Goldsman had never met Mr. Nash before he wrote the script, the character he created after reading "A Beautiful Mind" is surprisingly similar to the John Nash whom Ms. Nasar came to know. "The kind of mono-dimensional involvement in mathematics, the dry sense of humor, this incredible self-confidence which could at times appear to be arrogance, the complete focus on things and ideas instead of people, the social isolation -- all this is reflected in the script," she said. 
But only a hint of all that is reflected in a conversation with the John Nash of today. At 72, Mr. Nash is still handsome but thinner and more delicate-looking than he appears in photographs as a youth. He gives an impression of sweetness, even innocence, far from the brash, competitive young man described in the book. He speaks softly and articulately, answering questions in a straightforward way. He is willing to talk about his years of mental illness but admits that his memory is limited.
His memory is sufficient, however, to cast some light into the obscure corridors of a schizophrenic's mind. He rationally explains his system of delusions like an interpreter from a distant planet. He also tries to explain the process of his recovery. In the early, florid years of his illness, he says, he was hospitalized, under supervision and taking medication. He responded in the sense that his symptoms abated, he says, but it was not until years later, in the late 1980's, when the illness slowly and mysteriously began to retreat without medication, that he began to make real progress.
"Before, I was behaving rationally for short periods and I was renouncing my delusions, but I always went back to them," he said. "It's only by a gradual process that I escaped from them more philosophically, like escaping from a cult."
It would seem that these observations would be useful to Russell Crowe, who has the difficult job of portraying Mr. Nash from the time he entered Princeton at 19 through his deterioration and eventual recovery in his 60's. But Mr. Crowe has refrained from interviewing Mr. Nash, although he did run into him on the set one day and observed him informally, engaging him in a short chat and offering him a cup of tea.
Mr. Crowe has tried to immerse himself in the character in other ways: he examined what few early photographs of Mr. Nash exist, and he listened to taped interviews with Mr. Nash and with patients with similar disorders. He relied heavily on Ms. Nasar's biography. "She wrote that his way of speaking was 'ornamental and Olympian,' for example," he said. "I tended to grab onto lines like that."
Although he has not visited any mental hospitals to observe schizophrenic patients, he said, he believes that such a field trip would be unnecessary under his present circumstances. "I'm staying in New York City," he says. "I go for a walk every Sunday and I do my research." 
At first glance, Mr. Crowe's brash Aussie persona seems incompatible with the gentle, polite and soft-spoken John Nash of today. Intelligent, thoughtful, witty and articulate, Mr. Crowe is also abrupt, impatient and self-confident to the point of arrogance. He tries to control the conversation by both asking and answering his own questions -- a job he does very well. His manner, however, is not so far from that of the young John Nash, the cocky, overbearing mathematical star Ms. Nasar describes.
Mr. Crowe says bridging the chasm between the elderly Mr. Nash we see today and the youthful one he portrays is one of his major challenges. Comparing this role to his Oscar-nominated portrayal of Jeffrey S. Wigand, the tobacco industry whistle-blower in "The Insider," Mr. Crowe notes that with Mr. Wigand, whose story took place only a few years before the making of the film, he had a model on which to base his character.
"I had so much evidence staring me in the face," he said. "Wigand was slightly overweight, he had hair of this shape, he parted it this way, he always wore glasses like this, this is how his hands moved when he talked. I couldn't step away from that."
But John Nash is different. "We don't have footage of Nash as a young man. We don't know what his voice sounded like before medicine and illness and old age. I've had to assume so much of the physicality as a younger man that if I zero in on him too much as he is now, I will be playing him post disease, and post 30 years of trauma."
So, like Mr. Goldsman and Mr. Howard, Mr. Crowe is using Mr. Nash as an inspiration rather than a template. Noticing that Mr. Nash has beautiful, graceful hands, for example, Mr. Crowe let his own nails grow and concentrated on the way his character uses his fingers. For him, the physicality of the disease is grounded in Mr. Nash's hands.
In the end, it may be that the artists who take inspiration from someone's life come as close to getting it right as the historians who document it. As Mr. Goldsman said, referring to the liberties he took in writing the screenplay: "There's a tendency to think that's an audacious thing to do. It's really a humble thing to do. How do you tell the truth about a life?"

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about "A Beautiful Mind," a film based on the life of the mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr., included an outdated reference to his relationship with Alicia Nash. The Nashes, who were divorced in 1963, have remarried; the wedding was June 1, after the section went to press.
Because of an editing error, a picture caption with the article misidentified the filming location where the actor Russell Crowe was shown playing Mr. Nash. It was Bronx Community College, not Princeton.

HEADLINE: Finding Offshoots For Profit 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
POLITICAL battles over gun ownership may rage, but there's one place where there's a consensus that guns are not a growth industry: the gun industry. 
 Production for domestic and overseas handgun sales declined 52 percent between 1993 and 1999, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
 The number of licensed gun dealers has fallen to 104,000 from a high of 284,000 in 1992. Twenty years ago, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, 1 in 14 Americans was a licensed hunter. Today, it's 1 in 18. 
"The long-term prospects," said Tom Diaz, an analyst at the Violence Policy Center in Washington, "are bleak." 
Well, gun companies are, above all else, companies. And they're going to the mattresses. Not over the right to bear arms, though. The buzzword of the moment is diversification.
Smith & Wesson, which started selling guns in 1852 and became a fixture of popular culture through Clint Eastwood's use of its .44 Magnum revolver in "Dirty Harry" movies, has opened retail stores where customers can buy the gun maker's logo on jewelry, gym bags, mountain bikes -- even teddy bears. (The company, whose sales plummeted after it pledged to install safety devices on its guns, was sold last month by its British owner, Tomkins P.L.C., to the Saf-T-Hammer Corporation, a start-up in Arizona that makes trigger locks.) 
Firearms from Fabbrica d'Armi Pietro Beretta S.p.A., the 475-year-old Italian arms manufacturer, can be found at the Beretta Gallery on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, a boutique with a facade of hand-chiseled stone extracted from quarries in Italy. But they are on the mezzanine. The main emphasis is selling other high-end items that seek to build on Beretta's patrician image: books on African game hunting, Beretta-branded sportswear, hand-painted porcelain and engraved knives.
Then there is Sturm, Ruger & Company, the nation's largest publicly traded handgun company. Sturm, whose stock has declined by more than 60 percent in the last five years, is getting into the golf business by making use of its metal casting operations. The company's "Great Big Bertha" series of titanium golf club heads, made for the Callaway Golf Company, have become a favorite on the professional golf circuit. 
"Those companies that don't diversify," Mr. Diaz warned, "will find themselves in unprofitable niche areas or out of business." 
There's precedent. Verney-Carron, the French firearms company, began making bicycles and fishing and tennis equipment in the late 1930's, enabling it to make it through World War II. 
But for today's gun makers, the motivation goes beyond mere economics. 
If Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle company that now sells a range of clothing -- and has a chi-chi Manhattan cafe -- can move beyond its association with the Hell's Angels, then why can't the gun industry make a similar jump? Gun makers' desire to regain their position in mainstream culture has much to do with their diversification. 
"If gun companies can get beyond shooting ranges to sell products to the guys in bowling alleys then they'll be fine," said James Hall, editor of Guns & Gear magazine. "This is about the place of guns in civil society." 
The new administration has raised some hopes on that score. President Bush is a longtime ally of the National Rifle Association. And his attorney general, John Ashcroft, said last month in a letter to the group that he "unequivocally" believes the Constitution guarantees the right of individuals to own guns. That represents a radical shift from the government's longstanding interpretation, based on a 1939 Supreme Court decision, that the Second Amendment gives only a "collective right" through the federal or state militias. 
"As we head into the first years of the Bush administration, I hope that we as an industry will begin focusing again on the problem of negative growth," Bob Robb, a 49-year-old gun enthusiast, recently said in an editorial in Shooting Sports Retailer.
"If we do not, one day we will wake up, look in the mirror, and see old men and women in the woods, with not enough of the younger generation taking our place to make a difference politically or economically." 
Still, there is no shortage of disincentives for gun makers. The Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 allowed nationwide background checks on potential gun buyers, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has made it more difficult for dealers to gain certification. Since 1998, 32 cities in the United States have filed lawsuits against gun manufacturers and dealers, seeking reimbursement for the public costs of dealing with gun violence.
But rights are one thing. Profits are another.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 17, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on June 3 about diversification in the gun industry referred incorrectly to an opinion expressed by James Hall, editor of Guns & Gear magazine. He said that diversification was a logical step for gun manufacturers because they were profit-oriented companies, not because that was a key to their survival.

HEADLINE: The Mirage of a Growing Fuel Supply 

BYLINE:  By Evar D. Nering; Evar D. Nering is professor emeritus of mathematics at Arizona State University.

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. 

 BODY:
When I discussed the exponential function in the first-semester calculus classes that I taught, I invariably used consumption of a nonrenewable natural resource as an example. Since we are now engaged in a national debate about energy policy, it may be useful to talk about the mathematics involved in making a rational decision about resource use.
 In my classes, I described the following hypothetical situation. We have a 100-year supply of a resource, say oil -- that is, the oil would last 100 years if it were consumed at its current rate. But the oil is consumed at a rate that grows by 5 percent each year. How long would it last under these circumstances? This is an easy calculation; the answer is about 36 years. 
 Oh, but let's say we underestimated the supply, and we actually have a 1,000-year supply. At the same annual 5 percent growth rate in use, how long will this last? The answer is about 79 years.
Then let us say we make a striking discovery of more oil yet -- a bonanza -- and we now have a 10,000-year supply. At our same rate of growing use, how long would it last? Answer: 125 years.
Estimates vary for how long currently known oil reserves will last, though they are usually considerably less than 100 years. But the point of this analysis is that it really doesn't matter what the estimates are. There is no way that a supply-side attack on America's energy problem can work.
The exponential function describes the behavior of any quantity whose rate of change is proportional to its size. Compound interest is the most commonly encountered example -- it would produce exponential growth if the interest were calculated at a continuing rate. I have heard public statements that use "exponential" as though it describes a large or sudden increase. But exponential growth does not have to be large, and it is never sudden. Rather, it is inexorable.
Calculations also show that if consumption of an energy resource is allowed to grow at a steady 5 percent annual rate, a full doubling of the available supply will not be as effective as reducing that growth rate by half -- to 2.5 percent. Doubling the size of the oil reserve will add at most 14 years to the life expectancy of the resource if we continue to use it at the currently increasing rate, no matter how large it is currently. On the other hand, halving the growth of consumption will almost double the life expectancy of the supply, no matter what it is.
This mathematical reality seems to have escaped the politicians pushing to solve our energy problem by simply increasing supply. Building more power plants and drilling for more oil is exactly the wrong thing to do, because it will encourage more use. If we want to avoid dire consequences, we need to find the political will to reduce the growth in energy consumption to zero -- or even begin to consume less.
I must emphasize that reducing the growth rate is not what most people are talking about now when they advocate conservation; the steps they recommend are just Band-Aids. If we increase the gas mileage of our automobiles and then drive more miles, for example, that will not reduce the growth rate.
Reducing the growth of consumption means living closer to where we work or play. It means telecommuting. It means controlling population growth. It means shifting to renewable energy sources.
It is not, perhaps, necessary to cut our use of oil, but it is essential that we cut the rate of increase at which we consume it. To do otherwise is to leave our descendants in an impoverished world.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Introduction Is Set for Broadband Data-Voice System

BYLINE:  By SUSAN STELLIN 

 BODY:
Hoping to carve out a niche in the emerging market for bundled voice and data services, a Silicon Valley start-up and a major telephone manufacturer have developed technology that delivers Internet access and multiple phone numbers over a single line.
 The new technology, called the broadband phone, is to be announced today by the start-up, Jetstream Communications, and the manufacturer, the Matsushita Electrical Industrial Company's Panasonic unit, at the Supercomm trade show in Atlanta. 
 Designed for the residential market, the phone would enable home users to operate up to four phone circuits and high-speed Internet access through a single base unit connected to a single line from the public phone network. Up to eight wireless handsets could communicate with the base station, each with access to all four phone circuits. 
The goal of the partnership is to compete in the nascent market for voice services delivered over broadband networks -- in this case, D.S.L., or digital subscriber line, technology. D.S.L. is a form of phone service that more typically offers Internet access at speeds of 300 kilobits a second or more, with a single, simultaneous voice line. 
Although voice services delivered over D.S.L. have so far been marketed primarily to businesses, Panasonic and Jetstream are betting that the consumer market will grow as telecommunications carriers -- particularly ones competing with incumbent telephone companies -- look for ways to extract additional revenue from customers who have signed up for D.S.L. Internet access.
"This bundled package gives service providers the ability to reach a set of customers they couldn't reach before," said Manish Gupta, vice president for corporate development at Jetstream, based in San Jose, Calif. "If you create a package, you can reduce customer churn significantly. You also increase the revenue potential and the profitability for the service provider."
According to Mr. Gupta, Panasonic contributed its expertise in wireless technology to the partnership, while Jetstream developed the software and hardware that enable voice communications to travel over a D.S.L. connection. Jetstream also manufactures what is known as a voice services platform used by central telephony offices to detect and transmit separate voice and data streams.
The two companies plan to market their technology to phone and data service providers, who would in turn sell the hardware and bundled services to consumers. A service provider, for example, might offer customers packages of up to four phone numbers with local and long distance service and high-speed Internet access at a discount to what consumers now pay separately for Internet access and multiple phone lines. Mr. Gupta said the quality of the voice circuits and speed of the Internet link would not be compromised by having multiple users on the system at the same time.
Although Panasonic and Jetstream do not yet have signed agreements with any telecommunications providers, Mr. Gupta said the partners were in discussions with various service providers and expected the technology to be available to consumers by the end of the year.
But a few hurdles remain. Although many analysts expect the market for voice services delivered over data networks to grow, the disparate companies that provide such services -- combined with uncertainty about how many people would subscribe -- make the market's evolution uncertain. 
Kathie Hackler, vice president and chief analyst at the Gartner Group, said voice-over D.S.L. was attractive to service providers because it created additional revenue opportunities without the need for significant new investments in the network. 
Ms. Hackler said that offering higher-margin voice services in addition to Internet access, particularly using a single phone wire as with the Jetstream-Panasonic technology, would present an attractive business model. "To be able to derive services off this one pair of copper," she said, "would give them quite an economical platform."
From the consumer side, Ms. Hackler said, it remains to be seen what types of prices and packages service providers will offer. But one appeal of the broadband phone is that it aims to make consumers less beholden to phone companies. Consumers would still have to arrange for any new services and for payment, but they would not have to wait for someone to go to their house. "Services can be delivered not at the provider's convenience, but at the consumer's convenience," she said. "Say you have somebody visiting for the summer; you could activate an additional line in your home for three months."
She said there were 2.5 million D.S.L. subscribers in the United States -- a small part of the total available market. And although D.S.L. is growing at a faster rate than is cable Internet access, cable is still in the lead, with more than 3.7 million subscribers in the nation at the end of 2000.
Another question is whether local telephone companies will ultimately embrace voice-over-D.S.L. technology, said Norm Bogen, a director at the Cahners In-Stat Group, a research house. "I'm not sure it's that attractive to them to deploy it," Mr. Bogen said. "They're cannibalizing their existing phone service."
And the broadband phone could be a tough sell to consumers, he added, particularly if it could be priced, as Jetstream indicated, at up to $500.
For those reasons, Mr. Bogen said he did not expect the residential market for voice-over-D.S.L. service to be as big as the business market. "How many people have three lines at home and are looking to do this?" he said. "There's some, but it's just not the broad market."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW; 
Incursion of a Superstore Galvanizes a Quiet Town

BYLINE:  By JULIE SALAMON 

 BODY:
Who would have thought "I love Starbucks" could be fighting words, especially when uttered by a gentle-looking woman as she makes cookies in her kitchen.
 But they are, in "Store Wars: When Wal-Mart Comes to Town," a documentary that really isn't about coffee or cookies or even Wal-Mart. The real subject is homogenization, and whether a town benefits more from preservation or change. 
 Will building a Wal-Mart ruin Ashland, Va., (population 7,200) financially and aesthetically, forcing businesses to close and creating traffic jams and eyesores with its bland, boxy architecture? Or will it, as the Wal-Mart people promise, enrich the community with jobs and one-stop shopping with lower prices? 
This excellent program uses a David vs. Goliath scenario -- small-town citizens versus corporate behemoth -- to offer an engaging rendering of a placid community enlivened by political action. As time passes, the pro- and anti-Wal-Mart factions harden their positions, but politely for the most part. The young mayor, up for re-election, tries to appease everyone but mainly worries whether people like him.
In Ashland, where many people still speak in soft Southern tones, politeness matters. "Passion and emotion give you the French Revolution," says the mayor. "Passion and emotion don't let you think through issues." "Store Wars" captures how quixotic passion and emotion came to dominate life in Ashland for a time, when Wal-Mart decided to set up (a very big) shop there. The zoning battle is hardly the French Revolution. No one is beheaded, and many of the protest signs are prettily decorated by protesting children. 
It does galvanize the town, however, not to unified action but to unified discussion. Wal-Mart -- and what it means and doesn't mean -- come to dominate discussion in coffee shops, kitchens and even churches. Everyone proclaims expertise: Wal-Mart is said to be a good employer and a bad one; it's said to be generous and last among corporations in charitable giving.
When Wal-Mart put in its proposal to build a store, Ashland wasn't exactly a virgin in the homogenization department. Just off Interstate 95, the town had already been invaded by fast-food restaurants and motel chains. But its downtown looks untouched by time, and it still has a Fourth of July parade at which children ride on ponies wearing American flags wrapped around their ankles. Its hometown song contains the lyric: "Ashland, Ashland, center of the universe." 
The filmmaker Micha Peled follows a tradition of social-minded documentarians, dutifully presenting all sides, including Wal-mart's, though his heart is clearly with the protesters. Wal-Mart doesn't emerge from this portrait as evil so much as piggish, with its desire to open a store in Ashland when there's another Wal-Mart 10 miles away. Its very bigness seems loutish, especially when compared with the cozy little stores Mr. Peled visits. 
The Wal-Mart representatives come off as decent enough but soulless men who argue that if their stores are so bad why do so many people shop there? The film answers that, too: prices are cheap, variety is plentiful, and Wal-Mart refuses to sell CD's whose lyrics haven't been sanitized, a policy many parents apparently appreciate (and their children deplore).
Mr. Peled uses portraiture, not polemics, to address the economic and philosophical issues. He wisely chose a local woman, Rosanne Shalff, to act as narrator and guide. This affable woman, who lives in Ashland and wrote its only history book, introduces the characters with affection and an insider's knowledge of their predilections. As the Wal-Mart proposal makes its way through the development board up to the town council, she wryly comments on the action without judgment.
Mr. Peled's persistence is rewarded by actual drama. As the deadline nears for the town council to decide whether Wal-Mart can come to town, the pressure that comes to bear is heartfelt. Neighbors argue; political fortunes are upset. People weep real tears over the outcome. 
In capturing this passion, "Store Wars" becomes a fascinating study in community action and a valuable reminder that people still can care enough about a place to fight for it.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Talks on selling TV time slog on, as agencies hem and haw over prices amid a slowdown.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
WITH apologies to Herman's Hermits, there's a kind of hush, all over the world . . . of advertising, anyway, as negotiations between the big broadcast TV networks and the big agencies for the purchase of commercial time ahead of the coming fall season are getting off to their most sluggish start in years.
 By this week in 1999 and 2000, the process to determine prices for 30-second spots in prime-time programs had pretty much been completed, with agencies agreeing to pay record rates on behalf of their advertiser clients. This year, of course, the national economy is in more parlous a state, slowing the talks as the agencies decide whether to buy in advance of the 2001-02 season in the so-called the upfront market. 
 Typically, the broadcast networks sell as much as 75 to 80 percent of their commercial inventory before the season starts. That may fall off if agencies decide to wait simply until the series begin making their debuts in September before they buy time, in what is known as the scatter market, hoping that prices may be lower. 
"For the first time in a while, the buyers have more power than the sellers," said Michael J. Russell Jr., an analyst who follows the advertising industry for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York.
As a result, the agencies "are going to look for some discounting," he added, as well as "for some goodies" like additional flexibility in when and where their spots would run.
So far, the big broadcast networks -- ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN and WB -- are resisting the pressure from the agencies to lower prices, meaning they have not been signing many deals.
"The upfront could be down even farther than we'd projected," said Jack Myers, chief economist at Myers Reports in New York, a company that publishes media newsletters and research reports. In March, Myers Reports forecast a decline in ad revenue of 4 to 6.5 percent from what the broadcast networks took last spring when they sold commercials ahead of the 2000-01 season.
Now, Mr. Myers said, he is estimating a decline of more than 8 percent, which would be the first significant decrease in the upfront market in eight years.
Christopher Dixon, media analyst at UBS Warburg in New York, forecast a decline more than twice the revised Myers figure, predicting that the falloff in total ad revenue could be as much as 18 percent compared with a year ago.
"Last year, because of the Olympics and elections, most advertisers decided to overcommit" in the upfront market, Mr. Dixon said. "This year, it is 180 degrees reversed.
"If I were an advertiser, I'd be asking 'Why should I make commitments now rather than wait a little bit?' " he added.
That will result in "an upfront market that lasts longer than most people anticipate," Mr. Dixon said, probably not concluding until the end of summer. That was the prevailing pattern before the late 1990's, when the booming economy made agencies rush anxiously to buy time ahead of the season, fearing that prices would be higher later and supply scarcer.
"The advertisers were at the mercy of the networks in the last several years," said Dennis Leibowitz, managing director for media and strategies at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. "Now, it's going to be very slow.
"But if the networks don't panic," he added, and avoid making deals at fire-sale prices to jump-start the market, "they could do better than most people think."
Are the networks now at the mercy of the advertisers as the agencies decide it's payback time to recoup what they overpaid in recent years?
"They didn't overpay" if they wanted and needed the commercial time when consumers were in an ebullient, spending mood, said Alan J. Gottesman, who follows advertising and media companies as managing director of West End Communications/Consulting in New York.
"As for 'payback time,' it's great posturing," Mr. Gottesman said, adding: "If someone came into the market only once, last year, and was coming back now, trying to get even, fine. But this is a very concentrated industry. These are people who know each other by their first names. There are buyers who have been to every Super Bowl since the Super Bowl began."
In the upfront market before the 2000-2001 season, the broadcast networks sold more than $8.1 billion worth of commercial time. The declines the analysts are forecasting would lower the ad revenue committed before the start of the 2001-02 season to $6.8 billion to $7.5 billion.
But it must be remembered that last spring brought gains of $1 billion or so for the broadcast networks over what they took in during the upfront market before the 1999-2000 season, meaning they would lose little or no ground compared with two years ago.
"Last year was like a once-in-a-hundred-year flood of money pouring into the media companies" that own the broadcast networks, said Tom Wolzien, senior media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. They are: the Walt Disney Company, parent of ABC; Viacom, which owns CBS and UPN; the News Corporation, parent of Fox; the General Electric Company, owner of NBC; and AOL Time Warner and the Tribune Company, parents of WB.
"We're in a period of getting closer to reality, on both sides," Mr. Wolzien said. "Nobody wants to be the poster child to do the first, and worst, deal."
Still, "marketers need to advertise and media companies need to sell advertising, so there are going to be deals," he added. "It's just going to take a while."

HEADLINE: New Policy Won't Slight Europe, Rumsfeld Says 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, June 3 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that any efforts to realign America's defense strategies and resources toward Asia would not come at the expense of the NATO alliance.
 "Any suggestion that the United States is going to and wants to or might turn away from Europe is fundamentally flawed in logic," Mr. Rumsfeld told reporters aboard his plane enroute to Europe for his first extended overseas trip on behalf of the Bush administration. 
 With his weeklong, seven-nation tour scheduled to culminate in a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels on Thursday, Mr. Rumsfeld made clear today that one of his primary missions will be to reassure European allies about his review of Pentagon policies.
People who have seen parts of a strategic study prepared for Mr. Rumsfeld say it concludes that the United States must address emerging threats in Asia. That conclusion in turn has raised concerns among NATO officials that Mr. Rumsfeld intends to shift American troops, planes and aircraft carriers from Europe to the Pacific.
Today, Mr. Rumsfeld said that although there is a need to address the growing economic and military importance of Asia, America's commitment to NATO should not be reduced.
"I think the Asia thing is overemphasized," he said, referring to reports about his review. "Asia is different than Europe. And how you are arranged for Europe is one thing and how you ought to be arranged for Asia is conceivably something else. The distances are different, the needs are different, the circumstances are different and it would be unwise for the United States to not recognize those distinctions."
But, he added, "It's perfectly possible for the United States to address that in a way that in no way diminishes the importance of the Atlantic alliance."
Still, Mr. Rumsfeld did not foreclose the possibility that at some point the United States might want to reduce its forces in Europe, as some of his advisers have counseled. But he has also said that any such changes would be made only after consultations with European allies. To emphasize that point, Mr. Rumsfeld distributed transcripts today from one of his final news conferences as secretary of defense in the Ford Administration 24 years ago, in which he similarly argued that "no nation in the alliance should unilaterally reduce forces in Europe."

HEADLINE: Incongruity In Wyoming: Costly Energy Amid Bounty 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: CHEYENNE, Wyo., May 31 

 BODY:
The first thing Jack Miller did to offset rising electricity bills at his spacious cowboy theme store, Wyoming Home, was to replace all the 150-watt and 250-watt bulbs with fluorescent lighting. Next, he said, the basement boiler goes in favor of a forced-air heating system, a $15,000 changeover that could save him $1,000 a month.
 Throughout the West, not just in California, record energy costs are squeezing family and business budgets of millions of people like Mr. Miller. Mr. Miller's recent bills for Wyoming Home have soared as high as $2,200 a month from a previous peak of $1,400. 
 But the annoyance over soaring energy costs here is magnified by a glaring paradox: Wyoming has so much coal, natural gas and uranium reserves that Gov. Jim Geringer, a Republican, recently told Congress that the state could match the energy output of the OPEC nations for the next 41 years.
"It's not a rare observation on the part of our customers," Bryce Freeman, the leading rate analyst for the Wyoming Public Service Commission, said. "People look out their windows and see 15 drilling operations, and they're still paying some of the highest rates in the nation."
The cause of that incongruity is simple, energy officials say, and it is one reason energy prices in many other parts of the West are expected to rise for several more years before they stabilize.
The electricity grid in Wyoming cannot carry any more electrons, they say. New lines must be strung or existing lines improved. The state expects to gain perhaps four new power plants in the next few years, but far more critical, Governor Geringer said, is adding high voltage lines to carry more electricity generated by the state's oil, gas and coal reserves.
Wyoming has none of the 500 kilovolt lines that loop through the Pacific Northwest south into California, then east into Arizona. This means that Wyoming's lines play a limited role in supplying energy to the points of greatest need, because most can carry only 230 kilovolts. But plans for more transmission lines remain largely in the talking stage.
Wyoming's own energy demands and operations are limited; its population of about 490,000 is the smallest of any state. Energy companies in Wyoming export about 80 percent of what they produce, sending natural gas, oil, uranium and wind-generated electricity to 32 other states.
"We have even more energy supplies than Texas, Alaska or Venezuela," said Mr. Geringer, who supports the Bush administration's policy of developing more domestic fuel sources and building new plants and lines to carry the energy to market.
Much more energy lies dormant, as Wyoming, through a new energy commission, contemplates ways to attract investors to build more power plants and new transmission lines to help supply the growing demands in other states.
Running a high-voltage spur from Wyoming into central California would start a domino effect of benefits throughout the region, Mr. Geringer said. He believes that by helping satisfy the demand in California and other populous regions, generators could wean themselves from the expensive spot market for electricity and sign more long-term contracts, which would help stabilize prices all across the West, including Wyoming. Only by adding energy to the total grid can an individual state draw more energy for its own growing demands.
Environmentalists in Wyoming and elsewhere generally oppose the solutions proposed by Mr. Geringer and the Bush administration. They urge conservation, rather than construction, as the best approach to lowering energy costs.
But Mr. Geringer and other officials insist that conserving energy is only a small part of the long-term solution, which they say must include developing new energy supplies to bring prices down and keep them down.
For now, that offers little solace to many Wyoming residents, like Mike Straw, of Pine Bluffs, who is a planner for VAE Nortrack, a railroad company.
Eating lunch today at the Diamond Horseshoe Cafe, Mr. Straw said his residential electricity bills had doubled, to about $100 a month, which meant he had to postpone buying a van for his family, which includes five children, to replace his 1976 model.
"I feel victimized," he said. "We used to have among the absolute lowest rates in the country. I don't think there are any shortages. I guess it's just easier to let Wyoming suffer."
Like many other hotel owners around the west, Paul Smith, who operates the 260-room Hitching Post Inn here, has begun to pass the rising energy costs to customers in a $4-a-night surcharge to cover a $7,000 jump in his monthly electricity bills.
A similar increase is expected next January, but Mr. Smith said he had not decided whether to pass that on. He fears it might drive away business.
At her small general store not far from the Hitching Post, Linda Romero does not have the luxury of passing on her energy costs, which have surged to $400 a month, from $125. She now sells only small, inexpensive items after the increase forced her to close a building she used for selling furniture and antiques. It was costing her too much for heating and light, Ms. Romero said.
Next to go, she said, may be the cart she uses to cook hot dogs and mix slushy drinks.
Standing on the sidewalk out front, she said wistfully that the simulated Wild West gunfights staged daily for tourists, starting this weekend, might attract some business.
"I sure hope things get better," she said, looking into the distance. "If not, next year I might not be here."

HEADLINE: Calls for Slavery Restitution Getting Louder 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
It has been more than a century since Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman ordered that the coastlands confiscated in the Civil War be divided into 40-acre plots and distributed to thousands of former slaves. 
 After Abraham Lincoln's assassination, Andrew Johnson rescinded the order and took back the land that had been distributed. Since then, the idea of compensating African-Americans for the sins of two and a half centuries of slavery has hovered in the background, far from reality. But now the movement for reparations is gaining steam. 
 As a political matter, reparations has been a nonstarter: every year since 1989, Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, has introduced legislation calling for a comprehensive study of reparations, and every year the legislation has stalled. 
But as a social and legal movement, the call for reparations has taken on substantial force this year. Black professionals and scholars are taking up a cause that used to engage mostly working-class blacks. And beyond the longstanding efforts to seek government restitution, there is a new focus on winning reparations from corporate targets that once profited from slavery. 
The new momentum is apparent on many fronts: 
*A California law that took effect this year requires every insurance company licensed in the state to research its past business, and that of its predecessor companies, and report to the state whether it ever sold policies insuring slave owners against the loss of their slave property, and if so to whom.
*A team of prominent African-American lawyers has announced plans to file lawsuits early next year seeking damages from the federal government and companies that profited from slavery. The team is part of the Reparations Coordinating Committee, led by Charles Ogletree, a professor at Harvard Law School, and Randall N. Robinson, the founder of TransAfrica, a lobbying group.
*In March, the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Race Riots of 1921 recommended that survivors and their descendants be paid reparations for the uprising in which thousands of whites stormed a prosperous black neighborhood, destroying homes and businesses and killing at least 40 people. 
*Aetna formally apologized in March 2000 for having written policies for slave owners on the lives of their slaves. Three months later The Hartford Courant, which had run a front-page article about Aetna's apology, made a front-page apology of its own, for having run advertisements for the sale and capture of slaves.
*Advocates of reparations are fighting to make compensation for slavery an official theme of the United Nations World Conference Against Racism in August, and hoping to win a declaration that slavery is a crime against humanity for which reparations should be paid.
*Last month, The Philadelphia Inquirer published two full-page editorials urging the creation of a national reparations commission. 
The idea of reparations raises tangled questions about who should pay the money and who should receive it -- and, more profoundly, about the relative merits of affirmative action and restitution. 
The Reparations Coordinating Committee's litigation is unlikely to get into such particulars. The first task, lawyers say, is to establish a legal wrong that must be remedied. 
"The history of slavery in America has never been fully addressed in a public forum," Mr. Ogletree said. "Litigation will show what slavery meant, how it was profitable and how the issue of white privilege is still with us. Litigation is a place to start, because it focuses attention on the issue." 
Some blacks still dismiss the reparations movement as a digression from the issues that matter. "If the government got the money from the tooth fairy or Santa Claus, that'd be great," said Walter E. Williams, chairman of the economics department at George Mason University. "But the government has to take the money from citizens, and there are no citizens alive today who were responsible for slavery. The problems that black people face are not going to be solved by white people, and they're not going to be solved by money. The resources that are going into the fight for reparations would be far more valuably spent making sure that black kids have a credible education." 
Reparations remain a divisive idea, opposed by the vast majority of whites but widely supported by African-Americans. "There is now no major black organization that does not support reparations," said Mr. Robinson, whose book "The Debt: What America Owes to Blacks" is a steady seller in black bookstores.
The legal argument, he said, is compelling: "When government participates in a crime against humanity, and benefits from it, then that government is under the law obliged to make the victims whole. That's recognized as a principle of law." 
Certainly, reparations payments have become an increasingly familiar concept. The United States government has paid reparations to Japanese-Americans interned in World War II, and to several Indian tribes. Holocaust survivors who were used as forced laborers have won reparations from European countries. Mexican braceros who worked in the United States during World War II have filed a class-action lawsuit for reparations.
Stuart E. Eizenstat, who as a senior official in the Clinton administration negotiated settlements under which Holocaust victims would receive $8 billion in reparations from the governments of Germany, France and Austria and from Swiss banks, said that he viewed those cases as different from the African-American claims, because Holocaust reparations are going largely to surviving victims, while slavery reparations would go to descendants generations removed. 
"For slavery qua slavery, I think the appropriate remedy is affirmative government action in general, rather than reparations," said Mr. Eizenstat, who is now in private life. "And if 100 years from now the great-great-grandson of a Holocaust laborer asked for reparations, I don't think that would be appropriate, unless there was some specific property that had been confiscated that they wanted to recover." 
Those campaigning for reparations say that they are prepared to prove that African-Americans today continue to suffer from the legacy of slavery -- and, after slavery, another century of legal discrimination. 
"We are not raising claims that you should pay us because you did something to us 150 years ago," said Adjoa Aiyetoro, a legal consultant to the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, which is preparing its own lawsuit against the federal government and working with the coordinating committee. "We are saying that we are injured today by the vestiges of slavery, which took away income and property that was rightfully ours." 
Part of the new momentum in the reparations movement comes from efforts to win restitution not just from the federal government, but also from companies that profited from slavery. "I started doing research about the possibility of a lawsuit against the government," said Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, a lawyer. "But I turned to corporations, after finding how difficult it would be to win a claim against the government, given sovereign immunity, the statute of limitations, and an opinion by a relatively liberal court rejecting the idea. If you can show a company made immoral gains by profiting from slavery, you can file an action for unjust enrichment." 
Historians say that slavery was so central to the economy in the early days of America that almost every business benefited from it. "The entire economy of this country was based on slavery, North as well as South," said Eric Foner, a professor of history at Columbia University. "New York had a stranglehold on the cotton trade, which made up half the total value of U.S. exports in 1850. Brooks Brothers supplied a lot of clothing to plantation owners. Merchants, manufacturers, everyone felt the economic ripples." 
Government benefited, too, often using slaves to build public works. Slaves helped build the United States Capitol -- and their owners received $5 a month for their labor. 
Ms. Farmer-Paellmann, who found the documents about Aetna's slave policies, is pursuing other companies that profited from slavery. Among her discoveries was a 1906 history of the New York Life Insurance Company, which explained that "among the first 1,000 policies issued, 339 were upon the lives of negro slaves in Maryland and Virginia." 
Spurred by the California legislation, New York Life is now reviewing its archives, to find out to what extent the company may have sold insurance to slave owners.
Although no lawsuits have been filed, some old-line companies have reportedly begun to worry about their exposure. Owen Pell, a New York lawyer who represented several companies in Holocaust-related litigation, has spoken informally with several companies about the possibility and potential shape of claims relating to African slavery. 
Ultimately, insurance companies may not be the most important defendants. The ripest potential defendants, some lawyers say, may be municipal governments, which do not have the same sovereign immunity as the federal government, and tobacco companies or railroads -- even those that declared bankruptcy after the Civil War, since the old bankruptcy code did not wipe out any debts or liabilities that were not specifically declared. 
Often the connection to slavery is mentioned in company histories: a history of the Arkwright Manufacturing Company, now owned by the Dutch company Oce, describes how James DeWolf, a slave trader, "invested his slaving profits in the textile mills" Arkwright operated in Rhode Island. 
To be sure, it is a long stretch from a 19th-century slave trader to a 21st-century Dutch company that makes copying machines, and Oce officials seemed baffled by any possible connection to the slave trade. "This is the first I've heard of it," said Karen Fitt, a company spokeswoman. 
Still, Ms. Farmer-Paellmann says, companies built on the profits from slavery may become strong advocates for reparations from the government, as opposed to the private sector. 
"My interest in this is to get these corporations, once they are aware of their own connections, to be our chief lobbyists in Washington for other forms of restitution," she said. "Apologies aren't enough."
If the idea of paying reparations for slavery makes Americans uneasy, Mr. Ogletree of Harvard said, it is probably partly because, for most whites, it is a new idea, based on a history they do not understand. "The uneasiness that some express about reparations is the same uneasiness that we had about integration, about women's right to choose," he said. "We've gained some important mainstream viability, but these things take time."

HEADLINE: After Blood and Guts, Seeking Landmark Glory; 
Many Residents Aim to Save Meatpackers Along With Neighborhood's Gritty Charm

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
The streets, paved with nubby Belgian blocks, splay at awkward angles to the waterfront. The sidewalks run with rivulets of greasy blood, and prostitutes pick their way around discarded chunks of fat. Beginning at 3 a.m., the luggers, with red-stained sleeves, hang beef carcasses on moving hooks and escort them, as if they were dance partners, along rails that lead into refrigerated cutting rooms. 
 Most Manhattan neighborhoods have reputations that cling even as change overtakes them. The meatpacking district, with its growing number of expensive restaurants and boutiques, is still commonly thought of as the underbelly of Greenwich Village. And if a group of preservation-minded people has its way, that is exactly how it will stay. 
 The group, made up of nearby residents and many of the owners of those new boutiques and restaurants, wants landmark status for the district, which spans a few blocks below West 14th Street, between Washington Street and the water. The campaign, called Save Gansevoort Market (from the area's old name), has hired a historian, printed postcards that people can mail to the Landmarks Preservation Commission to express their support, and got more than $70,000 from a fund-raiser held at Diane Von Furstenberg's disco-size studio and home on West 12th Street. 
The group makes no apologies for its sophisticated packaging, saying it needs broad support to achieve its goal. "Save Gansevoort Market is not to stop gentrification," said Jo Hamilton, a longtime Village resident and a co-chairwoman of the campaign. "It's to preserve the unique character of the place. It's 'does this become a generic neighborhood like First and Second Avenue on the Upper East Side, or not?' "
Preservation experts say that Save Gansevoort has a good chance of success, given its momentum and the cohesiveness of the meatpacking district. Also, they say, saving an industrial area is not uncommon. 
SoHo and TriBeCa, now among the city's 77 historic districts, were both home to light manufacturing businesses, although by the time they were declared landmarks their use was changing or had changed. The Erie Canal is a New York State heritage area, the Joseph Loth & Company Silk Ribbon Mill in Washington Heights is a city landmark, and Dumbo, the Brooklyn waterfront area under the Manhattan Bridge, was recently placed on the National Register of Historic Places.
But the meatpacking district presents an unusual challenge, says Laura Hansen, a co-director of Place Matters, a city preservation group, because the meatpackers are still there. Although many of the Save Gansevoort people say that it is important for the meatpackers who gave the area some of its gritty charm to stay, landmark status would protect only the exterior appearance of the district's buildings, not their use. 
"It's an interesting moment to see where it goes, to see if we can do more than preserve the buildings and encourage art galleries to use the meat hooks," Ms. Hansen said. "To me, it's interesting to hear people talk about the meat market without understanding the meat industry."
Save Gansevoort Market takes its name from the farmers' market off the Gansevoort Street docks. They were named for Gen. Peter Gansevoort, whose grandson, Herman Melville, worked on the docks for 20 years.
By the 1930's, the area had become primarily a wholesale meat market served by the high line, the elevated freight line that was completed in 1934. To protect their wares from the elements, the meatpackers added the metal sidewalk canopies now cherished by Save Gansevoort supporters as one of the neighborhood's distinctive details.
The meatpackers have long coexisted with people attracted by the area's relative remoteness, narrow streets and gritty atmosphere. Partly because there were few legal residences in the district, a raucous night life began flourishing in the 1970's, catering at first to gay men, then expanding its audience. 
In 1985, Restaurant Florent brought what its owner, Florent Morellet, calls "the first bit of gentrification to the area." (Mr. Morellet is a co-chairman, with Ms. Hamilton, of Save Gansevoort.) Jeffrey, the expensive clothing store, and Pastis, the restaurant that offered celebrities a chance to do some chic meat market slumming in a faux-Parisian brasserie, opened in 1999. Other restaurants and boutiques followed, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the four-star chef, plans to open a restaurant on Ninth Avenue next year.
The gentrification has worried relatively early birds like Mr. Morellet and Keith McNally, who owns Pastis and who said he was drawn to the area because he once worked as a porter in London's meatpacking district. "One of the best things again about the neighborhood is not the buildings, it's the vast amount of sky," Mr. McNally said. "I hate the idea that I come into a neighborhood and prevent other people from coming in. I don't think it's about making it a petrified forest or something. I just would like to see some degree of preservation. I would hate to see a high-rise in the neighborhood."
Because it is zoned for manufacturing, the meat market is already somewhat more sheltered than the rest of the Village's waterfront area. On nearby Perry Street, for example, two residential towers advertised as "new landmarks by Richard Meier" are under construction. Still, real estate pressures are having an effect in the district: they are driving the meatpackers out. 
Two major companies have left in the past month, according to Joseph Nemecek, a third-generation meat man who used to own Adolph Kusy Company. He estimates that 25 to 30 companies are left, from about 100 meat companies 10 years ago, and says that altogether they process a million pounds of meat each week. 
For some supporters of Save Gansevoort Market, having the meatpackers remain is not necessarily an important component of preserving the neighborhood's cobblestoned cachet. Mr. Nemecek said he had been forced to close his meat business and go to work for another owner when he lost his lease. The new owner of his building, Starwood Urban Investments, of Washington, wanted four times the rent he had been paying, Mr. Nemecek said. "They're just yuppies from Washington, D.C.," he said. "They don't care at all about the neighborhood."
Yet the chief executive of Starwood, John Richman, has donated money to the Save Gansevoort campaign and says he is restoring the building, which is on Washington and West 14th Streets, with an eye to historical accuracy. 
"It's certainly part of the character of the place, the meatpackers," he said. But, he added, "The issue of where businesses locate is something up to individual businesses."
Once regarded as anathema, historic preservation has gained some acceptance among developers because landmark designations typically push up property values and rents. In Gansevoort Market, the upscale restaurants that occupy former meat plants are a perfect example of "adaptive reuse," a favorite politician-wooing phrase of preservationists like Scott P. Heyl, president of the Preservation League of New York State. "We are economic development practitioners," Mr. Heyl said. "It's an economic development tool. It's no longer just 'George Washington slept here.' " 
Higher rents are bad for meatpackers, of course. But on the flip side, Mr. Nemecek said, "I don't see how they could get any higher." 
He supports Save Gansevoort because, he said, it is the only way the market buildings will be saved. A landmark designation, he said, might change the minds of landlords who have evicted meatpackers in hopes of being able to build office towers in place of warehouses.
And, Mr. Heyl pointed out, historic preservation cannot do the work of economic planning or support from the city. Joe Maggio, of the Maggio Beef Corporation, said the city, which owns several of the meatpacking plants, recently offered to renew his lease for more than double the previous price. (Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which manages the property, said that Mr. Maggio's new lease was based on a new appraisal of the property, minus a 20 percent discount.)
Some people see the surge of interest in the meatpacking district as an opportunity to experiment with a new kind of preservation. "If the designation is solely to protect the buildings," said Ronald Shiffman, a former city planning commissioner, "then I think the chances are that it would not allow for the flexibility that's necessary."
Mr. Shiffman, now the director of Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development, which is completing a report on how to retain manufacturing in the city, said that a landmark designation could be combined with other planning tools, like a city planning "special district" designation that could help maintain the mix of uses that people say they find appealing about the neighborhood. "The tools need to evolve with the times," Mr. Shiffman said. 
Joe Maggio might agree. "If they want to make it historic, it's O.K. with me," Mr. Maggio said. "As long as we keep doing business."

HEADLINE: White House Takes a Softer Line Toward OPEC in Hopes of Getting More Oil Imports 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
When the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries convenes tomorrow in Vienna, it will probably decide against increasing the amount of oil it supplies the world market. A year ago, such a move would have elicited an aria of outrage from Washington.
 Not so now. The Bush administration, at least publicly, has absolved OPEC of any role in pushing up fuel prices and instead blamed a limited refining capacity at home. Unlike the Clinton team, which interrupted OPEC meetings and infuriated its members with cell phone calls demanding action, the Bush White House has opted for a gentler approach to its key oil-rich allies, particularly the Persian Gulf states. 
 The White House is gambling that such low-key rhetoric will help it achieve a variety of intertwined goals, in the Middle East and back home, analysts said. In particular, being friendlier with OPEC, especially Saudi Arabia, the cartel's de facto leader, may in the end deliver more oil to the United States, which could send fuel prices lower in the coming months, administration officials think. The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, hinted as much during an April visit to Washington, the analysts said. 
Ari Fleischer, a White House spokesman, demonstrated the new tone with reporters on Friday. "There are quiet, diplomatic conversations going on with our OPEC allies to remind them that we are an interdependent economy and that we all have an interest to make certain that the prices don't spike up." 
The administration's critics, including former Clinton aides, point out that so far, the Bush administration has been rewarded with only production cuts, not increases. 
The Bush administration apparently also hopes to restore what it sees as the United States' damaged credibility in the Arab world -- tattered, many analysts have said, by sanctions against Iraq and unsuccessful efforts to ease the conflict with Israel. That credibility is aided by the presence of the political stars of the Persian Gulf war, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Vice President Dick Cheney, who both are said to favor a milder approach to OPEC.
Finally, by casting high gasoline prices as purely a domestic problem, the Bush administration can argue more forcefully for pet energy projects in the United States, such as the relaxation of environmental requirements to increase refining capacity or the opening of federal lands to oil drilling.
OPEC officials have suggested that, this fall, they might consider reversing their production cuts of January and March. In the meantime, the price of crude oil will probably hover in its current range of $27 to $29 a barrel, oil traders said -- a level OPEC is delighted with and the United States resigned to, unless it sends the global economy tumbling.
"Whenever oil prices go up as they did last year, it is followed by a recession or a subpar economy," said Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, president of Energy Trends, a Bethesda, Md., consulting firm. "And that's not even in OPEC's long-term interests."
Only a year ago, when gasoline prices jumped to more than $2 a gallon in some regions, then-Governor Bush said the government could damp prices by pressing oil-producing countries to "open up the spigot," a task he said the Clinton administration had bungled. Gasoline prices are now $1.74 a gallon, compared with $1.58 at this time last year. But on Friday, Mr. Fleischer said only that President Bush wanted oil prices to "come down," without elaborating.
Despite the fist-shaking campaign rhetoric, analysts said that traditional allies like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were cheered by a Bush victory, thinking the combination of oil men and gulf war leaders in the administration would breed greater sympathy for Arab countries. "Powell and Cheney are respected by virtually everyone in the region," said J. Robinson West, chairman of the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting group. "There's so much personal good will toward them and to Bush's father."
The Bush administration has, so far, delivered on that good will. Mr. Cheney has said repeatedly that there is plenty of crude oil in the United States, and that the low inventories of gasoline that have led to higher prices stem from not enough refining capacity.
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, articulating the administration's views on OPEC, said in an interview last week, "We reject privately begging or publicly bashing to get more oil."
Such pronouncements find favor with OPEC leaders. "They have gone out of their way to point out that OPEC's policies are not to blame for the current situation, and we welcome their sincerity with the U.S. public," said Ali Rodriguez, the secretary-general of OPEC, in early May. OPEC, a 10-member cartel, produces about 40 percent of the world's oil.
No one will reveal what the administration told the Saudis privately in April. But experts said the Saudis appreciated the White House's hands-off public posture. Moreover, the Persian Gulf countries think this administration is more comfortable with oil at around $20 a barrel than the Clinton administration was, Mr. Tahmassebi said. High oil prices also help the United States oil companies, which made record profits last year and are loyal Bush backers.
Several American oil companies, led by Exxon Mobil, were awarded contracts last week worth billions of dollars to develop large natural gas fields in Saudi Arabia. It was the first time since the mid-1970's that foreign oil companies have been allowed into the country.
Supporters of the new White House approach to OPEC said the diplomacy bolsters ties with individual members rather than with the entire group, as some in OPEC have cool relations with the United States. The focus of the charm offensive is clearly Saudi Arabia, the cartel's largest producer and among the largest exporters of crude oil to the United States. Last year, even before President Bush was elected, his father called on Saudi leaders in Riyadh.
Mr. Naimi implied after the April meeting that Saudi Arabia would produce more oil if high prices and market demand warranted. That would prove crucial now that Iraq, long chafing under United Nations sanctions, has threatened once more to take its oil off the world market.
While Bush supporters count on the Saudis to make up any Iraqi shortfalls, skeptics point out that the Saudis have long been the "swing" producers. Even such allies have their own agendas, mainly to get as much in oil revenue as possible to prop up their one-note economies, and United States overtures will hardly sway them, these critics say. 
In fact, last year, OPEC raised production despite anger over the Clinton administration's admonishments, mainly because the group, especially the Saudis, thought prices had risen so high that they threatened economic growth. Others also point out that so far, friendliness to OPEC has yielded only a 2.5 million barrel a day reduction in output since January.
"Given the approach taken by then-Governor Bush a year ago in the campaign, he established the expectation that once in office, OPEC would be more likely to increase production," said Ronald E. Minsk, an energy adviser to former President Bill Clinton. "And even if they have been having discussions in private, all they have to show for it now is a big production cut."
To prevent future gasoline price increases, the administration has argued for relaxing clean air standards to allow for the expansion of existing refineries and the construction of new ones. The White House also wants more oil production in the United States to reduce reliance on foreign sources. The United States, however, has little of the world's oil reserves. Most are in the Persian Gulf. And prices here, as elsewhere, are determined by the world market, which is heavily influenced by OPEC's decisions.
"Bush has signaled with his energy policy that there are a lot of things we could do on our own without ever calling on OPEC," said Adam E. Sieminski, a senior oil analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "But I'm inclined to believe that OPEC shares at least half the blame if there is blame to go around. If there had been more crude, we would probably have more petroleum products."

HEADLINE: New Electoral Math Changing the Script In Los Angeles Duel 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 3 

 BODY:
 For weeks, the story line of the Los Angeles mayoral campaign has been that Antonio Villaraigosa, the charismatic insurgent seeking to become his city's first Latino mayor since 1872, stood poised to usher in a new political era in a city that is now almost half Hispanic and a nation where the Hispanic population is growing rapidly. 
 But on the brink of Tuesday's election, it now appears possible, even probable, that James K. Hahn, the phlegmatic establishment candidate who hopes to crown 20 years in city government by winning the top job, may be piecing together the winning coalition in a city where no group dominates, propelled by support from blacks and moderate whites.
That is not what some experts predicted when Mr. Villaraigosa, the former speaker of the State Assembly, finished first in a crowded primary election in April, with 30 percent of the vote. Mr. Hahn, the longtime city attorney, won 25 percent, joining Mr. Villaraigosa in a runoff because no candidate received a majority. 
Mr. Villaraigosa won endorsements from Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, and from the city's mayor, Richard J. Riordan, a Republican, who is barred by law from seeking a third term. But it turns out that Mr. Hahn, who is white and has solid black support, has attracted an impressive coalition reflecting an older Los Angeles, where non-Hispanic whites still constitute a majority of people who typically vote.
"Unless Latinos turn out in record heavy numbers, unless they become at least 25 percent of the electorate, I don't think Antonio Villaraigosa can win this race," said Sergio Bendixen, a veteran pollster based in Miami who has expertise in Hispanic political races. Mr. Bendixen was spending the last week of the race here doing nightly commentary for the Telemundo Spanish-language station. "They were about 21 percent in the primary, which was an all-time record, and for Antonio to win, they need to become a quarter," Mr. Bendixen said. "If that doesn't happen, the math just isn't there."
Whoever wins, the style of political leadership in Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city behind New York City, will change markedly from that of Mr. Riordan, a lawyer and a businessman who had never run for office but won the mayoralty in the wake of riots and a recession eight years ago on the pledge that he was "tough enough to turn L.A. around."
Mr. Riordan, a multimillionaire who works for $1 a year, often failed to build effective coalitions within the powerful City Council, but Mr. Villaraigosa and Mr. Hahn are used to political horse-trading.
Both men are Democrats in a nonpartisan race, and both are traditional liberals. They agree on the need for more buses and better schools, better jobs and less bureaucracy. But in recent weeks, they and their supporters have clashed sharply over questions of style, character, experience and who can best claim the mantle of the future in a city where the non-Hispanic white population is steadily shrinking and black political power has been considered to be on the wane since the 20-year tenure of the city's only black mayor, Tom Bradley, ended in 1993. 
The final days of the race have turned acrimonious, with charges and countercharges that would rank as unremarkable in the rough-and-tumble of New York City politics but still fall heavily on the ears of Angelenos accustomed to a tradition of nonpartisan municipal elections and comparative apathy.
In a television advertisement that juxtaposes grainy images of Mr. Villaraigosa with video of a crack pipe and a razor blade cutting cocaine, Mr. Hahn's camp has questioned Mr. Villaraigosa's 1996 letter supporting clemency for a convicted drug dealer whose sentence was commuted by former President Bill Clinton in his final hours in office, and concludes by saying, "Los Angeles can't trust Antonio Villaraigosa."
That has led Mr. Villaraigosa to accuse Mr. Hahn of fomenting "a climate of fear," and to compare him to former Mayor Sam Yorty, who ran what was considered an inflammatory, overtly campaign against Mr. Bradley in Mr. Bradley's first, unsuccessful run for mayor in 1969.
In comments after their last debate on Thursday night, Mr. Hahn, who has the endorsement of Mr. Bradley's widow, Ethel, took offense at that suggestion, and said, "For sure, Antonio Villaraigosa is no Tom Bradley."
Minutes later, Mr. Villaraigosa countered by saying of his rival, "Well, he's no Kenny Hahn," referring to Mr. Hahn's father, a longtime county supervisor who was a beloved figure among the city's black voters for his community service and steadfast devotion to civil rights for 40 years.
Mr. Villaraigosa, who has run all year on the pledge to be a coalition-builder, does not like to put it just this way, but the big questions for him and his supporters boil down to these: Isn't he the man for the moment, and isn't it about time? 
"I am running a campaign of hope," Mr. Villaraigosa said in his opening statement of the last debate. 
Mr. Hahn does not like to put it quite this way, either, but the big questions for him and his camp amount to these: Is Los Angeles really ready for Mr. Villaraigosa, and is Mr. Villaraigosa ready to lead it? 
"I am ready to lead this city," Mr. Hahn said in his closing statement at the same debate.
The latest polls suggest that Mr. Hahn has ridden his overwhelming support from black voters and a big advantage among white moderates in the suburban San Fernando Valley to a comfortable lead over Mr. Villaraigosa. The valley accounts for more than 40 percent of the citywide electorate, and the turnout among people who typically vote remains about 65 percent white despite large gains in the area's Latino population. For his part, Mr. Villaraigosa has forged a trailblazing coalition between the fast-growing population of Hispanic voters on the city's gritty Eastside and liberal whites on its wealthy Westside. 
Mr. Hahn, benefiting from his family name and his own long career, has retained striking loyalty from black voters, drawing the support of nearly 75 percent of likely black voters, a recent poll by The Los Angeles Times indicates. In the April primary, blacks constituted about 15 percent of the electorate, below their 18 percent level of just eight years ago. But the city's blacks are reliable voters and together with whites, who favor Mr. Hahn, they are expected to make up well over half of the electorate on Tuesday, enough to give Mr. Hahn an edge.
By contrast, Hispanic voters have never constituted more than the one-fifth of the electorate. Because Mr. Villaraigosa has sought to appeal to the widest possible coalition, he has been careful not to play too much to ethnic pride, and he has saved his campaign funds to advertise on English-language television.
In the primary, he faced competition for the Hispanic vote from another Hispanic candidate, Representative Xavier Becerra, and the recent Los Angeles Times poll found Mr. Hahn drawing support from nearly 30 percent of Latino voters, to just under 60 percent for Mr. Villaraigosa. Even Hispanic voters said they believed Mr. Hahn would do the better job of promoting economic prosperity and holding down crime. 
Both candidates have competed hard for the support of white moderates who backed other contenders, chiefly Steve Soboroff, a Republican businessman, and City Councilman Joel Wachs, a Republican-turned-independent who finished third and fourth in the primary. Mr. Wachs endorsed Mr. Villaraigosa, but the recent Los Angeles Times poll showed that Soboroff voters were now going two to one for Mr. Hahn, and Wachs voters are also supporting him, though more narrowly.
"This race is not only about changing demographics," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the University of Southern California. "It's also the candidates, their experience, their images. Demographics alone will not do it, and there's still a difference between the population and the electorate."

PROFILE: Antonio Villaraigosa
Antonio Villaraigosa, 48, was born Antonio Villar in Los Angeles and grew up in the heavily Hispanic Eastside neighborhood of City Terrace. He was 5 when his father left. He was reared by his mother, a state employee. A bright student with a self-described wild side, he dropped out of high school but later earned a college degree at the University of California at Los Angeles and a law degree from the People's College of Law. He has not passed the bar in four attempts. He worked as a negotiator for the local teachers union and later became president of the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. In his 20's, he fathered two daughters out of wedlock, but took an active role in helping rear his children. In 1988, he married Corina Raigosa, a schoolteacher whose name he blended with his own and with whom he had two children. The couple separated in the early 90's after he had an affair, but later reconciled. He was elected to the California Assembly in 1994. Term limits propelled him into the speaker's chair four years later.

PROFILE: James Kenneth Hahn
James K. Hahn, 50, the only son of a political family, grew up in South Los Angeles. His father, Kenneth, a longtime county supervisor beloved by his constituents, kept the family there long after white flight left the neighborhood overwhelmingly black. Mr. Hahn had a privileged childhood; he was the Dodgers' first honorary bat boy after the team moved from Brooklyn. But he also absorbed the lesson of his father's devotion to community service. After earning bachelor's and law degrees from Pepperdine University, he spent four years as a deputy city attorney and two in private practice before being elected city controller in 1981 and city attorney four years later. He has used injunctions to crack down on gangs and helped negotiate a federal consent decree for oversight of the city's troubled Police Department. But he has also been seen as a cautious plodder, and he sought the mayoralty only when term limits forced him out of his current job. His first marriage ended in divorce. He and his second wife, Monica, have two children.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about the Los Angeles mayoral race between Antonio Villaraigosa and James K. Hahn omitted a word in describing the 1969 campaign by former Mayor Sam Yorty, to whom Mr. Villaraigosa likened Mr. Hahn. The Yorty campaign was considered overtly racist.

HEADLINE: New Focus on an Old Nuclear Problem 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: PEACH BOTTOM, Pa., June 1 

 BODY:
The nuclear plant here split its first atom in December 1973. Both halves are still here.
 So is all the other fuel that the twin Peach Bottom reactors have used in almost three decades of making electricity. The same is true at more than 120 other nuclear power plants around the country, even though nearly 20 years ago their owners signed a contract with the federal government for the Department of Energy to take the fuel to Nevada for burial, beginning in January 1998. 
 What to do with used nuclear fuel is a technical and political conundrum that is getting new attention as the Bush administration pushes for a greater role for nuclear power, while Senate Democrats say they will not agree to the longstanding plan to bury the waste at the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada. 
The problem will only grow as reactors built years ago seek license renewals to keep running for many more decades. Next month, the owners of the Peach Bottom power plant will apply to extend its operating license from the once standard 40 years to 60.
Recognizing the storage problem, in the last few months Peach Bottom has set itself up to store its fuel on site for decades to come. 
"We never intended that Peach Bottom become a temporary storage site for used fuel," said James P. Malone, vice president for nuclear fuels at Exelon, the company that runs Peach Bottom's two reactors and 15 others around the country.
But Yucca Mountain, the federal government's proposed site for permanent storage, was never a sure thing and is about to become even less so when Nevada's senior senator, Harry Reid, a longtime opponent of the project, becomes assistant majority leader.
An engineer here who is now deeply involved in waste storage, Paul R. Rau, said that when he first went to work for the company that runs Peach Bottom 23 years ago, "I would never have thought about it."
But the neat grid of 3,819 spaces at the bottom of a pool where the plant stores its spent fuel has steadily filled with fuel rods.
So at this 620-acre site on the banks of the Susquehanna River, just north of the Maryland state line, Mr. Rau has built enough storage space to handle waste far beyond the expected lifetime of the reactors. The company built what looks like an exercise yard at a prison, a concrete pad two to three feet thick, surrounded by floodlights, motion detectors and two dozen cameras, with a double row of 10-foot fences topped with concertina wire. On the pad, which is the size of a football field, the company installed four casks last summer, each 18 feet high and 8 feet in diameter, each weighing 90 tons and holding 24 tons of spent fuel. This summer the company will add five more; eventually the total could reach 72, and even after that, the pad could be expanded. 
The casks, which could also be used for shipping, are designed to last at least 40 years. They are filled with inert gas to prevent corrosion, and require no mechanical cooling systems; David J. Foss, an engineer here who supervised their loading, said maintenance consisted mostly of inspecting them and sweeping the leaves off the pad.
Peach Bottom's approach is typical. For now, the 103 operating power reactors around the country store their wastes in spent-fuel pools like the ones here, 40 feet on a side and 40 feet deep, designed to withstand earthquakes and filled with purified water. Since the fuel rods still generate heat, even years after being removed from a reactor, the water is needed to prevent meltdown. It also provides radiation shielding. But the pool requires additional systems: heat exchangers to keep the water from boiling away, and filtration systems to pick out the radioactive material that builds up in the water. Over the long term, corrosion and cooling are concerns. 
The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's main trade association, says there are already 16 reactor sites with dry cask storage, and an additional 20 that will run out of space in their spent-fuel pools by the end of 2004 and will probably need such storage. Nearly all will need it by 2010.
But it costs more than $1 million for enough casks to store a year's worth of fuel for one reactor. So Peach Bottom's operator, at the time the parent company of the Philadelphia Electric Power Company, was one of 12 utilities to sue the Energy Department to recoup its costs after the 1998 deadline; Peach Bottom, like other reactors, had been paying the government a tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour generated, in exchange for a government promise, now broken, to take the fuel. 
Peach Bottom settled, with the department agreeing that the plant could skip payments equal to the price of the casks. But this has not placated Exelon, which is highly likely to be a builder of new plants if any are ever ordered in this country. The company, like other utilities, would like the waste problem solved first.
The cask storage sites have created a political role reversal: the companies that build them hate them, and the people who want to phase out nuclear plants see them as bolstering their argument. 
The companies are eager to empty them and have the Energy Department move the fuel, preferably to a federal burial site, but at a minimum to a centralized above-ground repository -- probably looking much like the one here, only bigger. For the companies, the casks are a reminder of an unresolved problem.
But opponents are happy to emphasize that the problem is unsolvable, and that the waste should stay in its containers, right where it is, a reminder in five dozen locations that there is no permanent repository. Their goal is to convince the public that the reactors should stop producing waste -- in other words, that they should stop operating.
"Their ulterior motive is to say that there is no solution," said Marvin S. Fertel, senior vice president at the Nuclear Energy Institute.
But storing the fuel in casks is "not a pressing problem," said Dr. Arjun Makhijani, the president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, a nonprofit group often critical of the Energy Department. Assuming proper regulation, Dr. Makhijani said, cask storage is quite safe, probably safer than Yucca.
"So long as the reactors are operating -- and this is not a plug for relicensing -- the waste should be stored on site," he said. 
Dr. Makhijani and others say that the government has proved unable to deal with its own nuclear wastes, from weapons production, and should not be trusted to find a burial spot that will stay essentially intact for 10,000 years. 
But other scientists like burial, and the industry contends that Congress will, too. "If you don't vote for it, the waste stays in your state for 40 or 50 years," Mr. Fertel said. Under the language of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, any senator can introduce a motion to approve the project, and the Senate must then take up the matter.
When the reactors now operating were designed, mostly in the 1960's, the builders assumed that reactors would store their wastes for only a few years before they were reprocessed for further use. One reprocessing plant ran for a few years in the 1960's, in West Valley, N.Y., but was a technical and financial failure. When Jimmy Carter was president, he barred a second plant, in Illinois, from opening. The Bush administration's energy report raises the possibility of reviving reprocessing, but experts say that technology's prospects are highly uncertain.
Even if Yucca Mountain opens, it is too small; under the 1982 law it is supposed to accept 77,000 tons of civilian and military wastes, but the civilian wastes alone will come to more than that, partly because of license renewals, which were not anticipated in 1982. The industry hopes that by the time this becomes a problem, Nevadans will see the economic benefits of the repository and support a change in the law to accept more waste. But the other possibilities are lengthy storage in casks and the search for a second site, which no one wants to undertake.

HEADLINE: Essay; 
Arafat's Arsenal of Missiles

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In launching a war to drive the Jews from his Palestine, the Arabs' Arafat has come up with an impressive array of weaponry. 
 It goes beyond the rifles and grenades that too-trusting Israeli governments permitted, which helped transform a police force into an army spoiling for a fight. Now it includes mortars built in Gaza factories and rockets smuggled in from headquarters in Syria. These are fired into Israel from sites near Muslim mosques, hospitals and schools so that when Israel retaliates Europeans watching CNN and the BBC will be shocked. 
 But the pride and joy of Arafat's arsenal is a weapon of mass terror that has no known defense: the human missile.
The latest in a series of these, carried by a brainwashed suicide bomber, ripped apart a score of young Israelis last week. These were mainly Russian immigrant women of child-bearing age, a high-priority target for those in Baghdad, Damascus and Jericho who dream of militarily or demographically overwhelming the Jews.
Because the human missile that massacred Tel Aviv teenagers so satisfied the lust for casualties, and because the incredible restraint of Ariel Sharon was about to snap, Arafat "condemned" this attack and told a visiting German diplomat he would join Sharon's self-imposed cease-fire "unconditionally." 
That means only that Arafat would not insist on the latest reward for violence recommended by the Mitchell commission, Bill Clinton's final vehicle for appeasement: cessation of construction in and around already-existing settlements. 
Sharon had already pledged to build no new settlements, a concession not offered by Rabin or Barak, for which he got no credit. An unnatural "freeze" on the natural growth of existing Israeli settlements would be fair only with an equivalent restriction on the expansion of Arab villages in the disputed territories. Not in the cards.
Arafat's guilty promise of a cease-fire may stay Israel's avenging hand if he finally takes the steps necessary to stop his war. His word is worthless because he has long specialized in what the poet Milton called "a certain clandestine Hostility covered over with the name of Peace." 
Arafat knows where the bomb factories are in Gaza because he ordered them set up. He knows what new and deadlier weapons of war are being smuggled in from Damascus because he pays for them. He knows who the most fanatic Muslim terrorists are because he released them from jail to prey on Jews.
And he knows where the human missiles are being programmed and armed. Such fanatic indoctrination takes time and isolation; it takes teachers of terror skilled in evoking visions of a martyrdom and requires recruits from vulnerably infuriated families who are known to other cells. The brainwashing is reinforced with official broadcasts of films of a dead boy beckoning potential suicide killers to join him in paradise. 
Does anybody still believe that Yasir Arafat is out of the loop in all this? For years, doves have bought the illusion that he was a peacenik at heart who had to bring along the extremists of the "Arab street." Yet, when the moment of decision came at Camp David, he was the man in the street, demanding all or nothing. When nothing was what he got, he became a hero by launching a war. Because his terrorists are ecstatic at their famous victory over the Russian immigrant youths in Tel Aviv, and because his European allies are a little embarrassed by his bloodletting, Arafat will lower the level of violence -- for a while.
After setting protections of Israelis in place, the surprisingly patient Sharon will ultimately offer half of the Barak-Clinton deal. Then the European Union and the U.N. will turn up the economic heat on Israel. Colin Powell will hear the pleas of Dennis Ross, Martin Indyck and the other architects of the current disaster to "get involved and make peace." When such pressure fails to deliver the whole West Bank and divide Jerusalem, Arafat's way is to open his jails and launch his human missiles again.
And at that point we may just hear from the Israeli "street." With doves turned to realists and pressure from Bibi Netanyahu to defend the nation, and with Israelis unwilling to further expose their children to lives of terror, Sharon will let Sharon be Sharon.

Before AIDS, there was no breast cancer walk in Central Park. Babies needing foster parents languished in hospitals for weeks, sometimes years. Clinics doled out medicines and sent the sick on their way, rarely looking at what it was in their lives that helped to make them ill.
 In many ways, New York City after AIDS is somewhat like America after World War II -- a place physically unscathed yet socially transformed, missing slices of entire generations of its citizens, its lasting effects at times concrete and at others evanescent. 
 It changed the speed at which social services moved, and changed the people with whom city politicians curried favor. It made patients with all types of critical illnesses press their doctors harder for information, and took public health workers out of their offices and into neighborhoods where they learned why certain diseases were prevalent. 
AIDS morphed the insurance, fashion, philanthropic, health care, real estate and music industries, and altered the hip quotient among the social set's choices in entertainment and charitable causes. 
Many of these changes, particularly those involving health care, were boosted along by myriad other factors -- managed care, a booming economy and the Internet, to name just a few.
But there is no question that AIDS -- which has killed 75,000 New Yorkers, nearly 20 percent of the Americans who have died of AIDS since it was first identified 20 years ago -- altered the city in ways both so widespread and at times so subtle that those shifts are no longer consciously associated with the disease. And while the rest of the country was also reeling from the epidemic, many lasting cultural changes began here.
"AIDS reached into almost every segment of New York and society in different ways," said Carol Levine, a former director of the Citizens Commission on AIDS. "It was horribly painful, and it was intriguing. It could not be contained into one thing. It was a disease, it was a social problem and it did not fit into a neat little conceptual framework to solve. It has been instructive to all of us. But at a horrible cost."
New York, the birthplace of the Gay Men's Health Crisis and Act Up, was among the first American cities where groups concerned with other diseases learned from AIDS groups how to successfully hector the government for access to new treatments and services.
"I think there is a very direct relationship between breast cancer activism and AIDS activists," said Ann Northrop, a longtime Act Up member. "Act Up created the concept of patient empowerment, it specifically ruled out that phrase 'victim,' and that was a whole new concept. Suddenly there was patient involvement in issues like drug approval."
The AIDS walk begot breast cancer walks, and public parades for other illnesses are now as much a rite of spring in Central Park as softball and Shakespeare. And while few groups staged the "die-ins" favored by Act Up that tied up Holland Tunnel traffic and turned Grand Central into a macabre rush-hour graveyard of the living, many emulated the strategy. 
"Liver and breast cancer groups would come and watch us," remembered Larry Kramer, Act Up's founder. Susan Safire, the executive director for Share, a breast and ovarian cancer support group in New York, agreed that while radical activism was not her group's taste, her group was quiet before AIDS. "There is absolutely more patient empowerment now," Ms. Safire said. "I say 'thank you' to AIDS activists, because they led the way."
For gays who did not take part in the coming out in the 1960's, AIDS brought about an inevitable if unwelcome second opportunity. Some men who became visibly ill, for instance, were suddenly out to their co-workers. Others whose past political acts were limited to voting suddenly found themselves taking to the streets.
"What AIDS did was to bring many more people out of the closet and politicize the group of privileged white men who thought they had already entered the mainstream," said Martin Duberman, a pre-eminent gay historian. "Then obviously the movement swelled."
Gays have become a political constituency in the city, one that rivals traditional voting blocs like religious Jews and African-Americans in some neighborhoods.
"The gay community was important in the 1989 mayoralty," said Mark Green, the public advocate who is running for mayor. "But it is geometrically more important now. On the Democratic side, there are several important gay leaders that candidates predictably meet with, talk with and woo." Mr. Green, apparently taking no chances, recently joined the influential Gay and Lesbian Independent Democrats. 
Before 1991, there was not an openly gay member of the City Council. But that year, Thomas K. Duane and Liz J. Abzug, the two gay candidates, fought over the Third District, where Mr. Duane, who revealed during that campaign that he was H.I.V.-positive, ultimately prevailed, and now there are several gay elected officials in New York, a shift in political representation that has fanned out around the country.
"On a practical level," said Ronald G. Bayer, a professor of public health at Columbia University, "the gay community has emerged as a political constituency that has to be dealt with. It is legitimization through disaster."

Dealing With Disease
In the mid-1980's, an unprecedented move in the State Health Department changed the way hospitals in New York cared for those with AIDS, with sizable implications for hospitals dealing with future illnesses.
In 1983, the Health Department set up the AIDS Institute to focus attention on and distribute money for the epidemic. At that time, hospitals and medical clinics were loath to care for AIDS patients, because of their costly and complicated needs, and out of fear over the stigma they would attract to the institutions.
With a clever Medicaid trick, the institute solved its problem. It offered hospitals the chance to be named AIDS Designated Care Centers, in exchange for Medicaid payments that were 20 percent higher than normal rates for Medicaid patients. New York hospitals leapt at the chance to become so designated.
What hospitals had to do was come up with a plan giving AIDS patients a sort of buffet of services, rather than just minimal health care to keep them alive. "It was not just going to be an infectious-disease person who was provider of care," said Dennis Whalen, a deputy health commissioner. "AIDS and H.I.V. patients required an interdisciplinary team of doctors, nutritionists, social workers, psychiatric workers, all to be put together in team approach." This special Medicaid rate system was later replicated for tuberculosis in the late 1980's.
And the system of coordinated care that the hospitals devised for AIDS has trickled down into the management of other illnesses, like asthma, strokes and cancer. To have a cancer patient wander an entire hospital campus for chemotherapy, radiation and psychotherapy is almost anathema in many hospitals; before AIDS it was standard.
In some ways, the legacy of coordinated care can even be seen in how the Health Department has attacked the West Nile virus. Health care workers talked to wildlife experts who in turn talked to scientists studying infectious diseases.
While many people with AIDS ended up on Medicaid, the collapse of one corner of the insurance market and the rapid rise of the uninsured in New York can also be traced in large part to the disease.
"One thing the epidemic did was kill the direct-pay individual insurance market in New York," said Bruce C. Vladeck, director of the Institute for Medicare Practices at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. He estimated that roughly 550,000 New Yorkers who were unemployed or self-employed bought individual health plans before AIDS. But AIDS brought too many sick people into that market, which responded by raising the rates to the sky. 
"This contributed to the financial crisis of Blue Cross and eventually caused the price of that coverage to rise substantially," Mr. Vladeck said. The number of New Yorkers in individual plans has fallen to about 72,000, according to the State Department of Insurance, and many people -- no longer just those with AIDS -- who cannot afford insurance simply go without. There are now roughly 3.1 million uninsured New Yorkers.
Taking its cues from grass-roots groups like the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the Health Department began to reach out directly to people living in specific communities where problems ranging from infant mortality to asthma seem the most stubborn, rather than just working through local clinics.
"Probably 20 years ago we would have not picked up on the opportunity to engage communities in their own self-advocacy," said Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city's health commissioner.
In one case, health care workers descended on a neighborhood to discuss methods for quitting smoking; it was learned that what the residents, many of them elderly, really cared about was the fact that people kept falling on the broken sidewalks.

How the Fun Changed
The seeds of cool are almost always planted among some marginalized group, and in the 1970's, gay men led the way in fashion and music, from Studio 54 and its predecessors, to the Pines on Fire Island, where Yves St. Laurent saw revelers in painter pants and jelly shoes and appropriated the look for his collection.
"Gays used to be the people that the record industry tested records on," said Hal Rubenstein, an editor at InStyle magazine. "They would take pressings from the studio to Paradise Garage or the Sandpiper in Fire Island and preview them out there. Lots of people took their cultural cues from gay people, because they were the taste makers and we were having more fun than everyone else."
The collapse of the Fire Island scene -- 25 percent of the homes there went unrented during the summers of the mid-1980's -- and of disco made way for a new urban music movement, hip-hop. A booming economy helped fuel a change in entertainment venues and trendy lifestyles that focused more on money and glamour than on outsider hipness, many popular culture experts say.
And cultural icons began to reappear from more traditional corridors, like Hollywood, with its stars and their stylists.
"Things that are safe are seen as much more desirable now,' said the writer Bob Colacello, a former editor of Interview magazine. "Risk is limited to Wall Street, and the wild life is at the White House and Gracie Mansion."
Charities became hot: dance parties for the homebound meal service God's Love We Deliver, the Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS annual holiday gala, fund-raisers at Barneys attended by Madonna. "AIDS made fund-raising hip," said Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York. "Before that, charities were the purview of Park Avenue ladies."
And the talent pool in fashion shifted in an unexpected direction. "AIDS did open up the industry to women," said Stan Herman, president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. In the late 1980's, many fashion companies shied away from hiring men, fearing they would die and not wanting to insure them, he said. 

New Urgency and Shift in Focus
AIDS brought an immediacy to social services that simply did not exist before, but whose legacy lingers. Intractable problems like poverty, addiction and homelessness were given a new urgency because many of those who suffered from them were now also dying, and quickly.
For example, before AIDS, drug policies in New York City focused almost entirely on getting people off drugs. Groups that provided housing for poor people recovering from their addictions often required users to be drug-free for several months. "AIDS upped the ante," said the Rev. Lisa Hill, director of special projects at the West Side Federation for Senior and Supportive Housing Inc., which runs apartment buildings for the elderly and those with AIDS. 
But unlike past drug users, whose treatment and relapse trajectory tended to snake over the course of many years, addicts with AIDS were dying and needed housing quickly. Rules had to change. Instead of saying people could not use drugs, house rules at group homes were altered to reflect that people now should not steal, or destroy property, Ms. Hill said.
Soon, the shift in focus from abstinence to what is known as harm reduction was in place for all addicts. "You see someone who is using and homeless and doesn't have AIDS," she said. "We can't say" that they deserve services any less quickly, she said.
"Harm reduction is an amorphous movement that says, 'Not everyone is going to stop using, so what are the ways that you are going to decrease harm?' " Ms. Hill said. "If AIDS is transmitted through drug use, how about switching to snorting? Or clean needles?"
The world of social services for children was also altered.
For one thing, the availability and quality of foster care improved along with increased need, said Gretchen Buchenholz, executive director of the Association to Benefit Children, a nonprofit agency that brought two lawsuits intended to fast track "boarder babies," those children born H.I.V.-positive or with crack in their systems, who were left behind in hospitals, into foster care.
The growing need led nonprofit agencies to lobby the government for more money to recruit appropriate foster parents. The effort moved into neighborhoods, with social service workers approaching potential parents directly or working though places like churches. In 1985, 16,618 children were placed in foster homes; in 1991, the number rose to 49,163. (It is now at 31,689.)
"AIDS and H.I.V. helped the policy makers and administrators understand the importance of recruiting people who had informed consent" about the difficulties and the realities of the children they were taking in, said Eric Brettschneider, who ran the city's child welfare agency in the Koch administration. 
And in many ways, many people in social services felt compelled to simply speed up the way they worked.
"We learned the measuring of what is important," Ms. Hill said. "With mental illness, for instance, getting better is not necessarily stopping having mental illness. There are other kinds of getting better, but it comes down to how you measure better now. Is it a job having a $50,000, or is it being able to have relationships with other people or not being hospitalized? There is more focus now on living in the moment in our work now. AIDS let us never forget that."

Tenant and Family Law Reshaped
In 1989, the State Court of Appeals overturned rulings that blocked a man from living in a rent-controlled Manhattan apartment that he had shared with a man who died of AIDS. That ruling led to numerous challenges to the state rent-control laws and to co-op boards. "Braschi is not limited to gay couples," said Nan D. Hunter, a professor of law at Brooklyn Law School, referring to the name of the plaintiff in that case. "That whole constellation affects unmarried heterosexuals with committed relationships, lesbian couples and other kinds of extended families which don't include a husband and wife in the area of landlord tenant law." The case reconstituted the idea of family in New York; in 1992, the city began allowing unmarried couples that have registered with the city clerk's office as domestic partners, an outgrowth of these early AIDS cases, say many.
And in 1986, School Board 27 in Queens tried unsuccessfully to sue the Board of Education for permitting an 8-year-old with AIDS to stay in the classroom, setting the stage for other cases of students with communicable diseases. 
"Public health law was really a pretty dormant area until AIDS happened," Ms. Hunter said. "The state passed a statute protecting the privacy of AIDS medical records, which brought us to the whole issue of privacy of medical records generally."

A Legacy of Pain and Loss
The funerals have lessened. Drugs have elongated lives and greatly reduced H.I.V. transmissions to infants. Social services are more plentiful. But the lasting wound festers in disparate corners of New York. The scar of AIDS, said Dr. Bayer of Columbia University, is "that which is not here."
Ms. Buchenholz is surprised that the memories still bring choking tears. 
"We watched families bury their babies," she said. "We watched Alfredo bury his wife, then his little boy. We watched Laurie die in her teacher's arms. So many of those children died in our arms. You watched kids start to walk and then start to run, and then you watched yourself lose them. It was the hardest time."
Mr. Doonan, of Barneys, cannot even count all the friends he has lost. "I have a whole new set of friends, and they are all younger," he said. "What do you say when you were a group of six and four of them have died? I don't go near them anymore. In order to continue your life you have to build bridges with new groups of people who don't have that experience.
"I think there are enormous holes left by the people who passed away," he added. "I don't think I have experienced any joy from surviving it. I just think what a nightmare it all was."

AIDS at 20
Later articles will investigate the impact of AIDS on the arts and on the federal government; current research on new treatments and vaccines; the lives of AIDS doctors and H.I.V.-positive teenagers; and concerns over new AIDS cases in the rural South and among young gay men.

HEADLINE: Attendants Accept 9.5% Raise And End Strikeat Aeromexico 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 3 

 BODY:
Mexico's largest airline, Aeromexico, was back in business today after its 1,500 flight attendants ended a two-day strike by accepting a pay increase of 9.5 percent.
 The strike had left tens of thousands of passengers stranded and scurrying for seats on other airlines in Mexico and abroad. Several hundred passengers were stranded overnight at Benito Juarez International Airport here. 
 Aeromexico said it was able to rebook about 18,000 passengers out of 30,000 whose flights were canceled Friday and early Saturday.
In all, about 500 flights were canceled after the strike began. Normal operations started to resume at 6:30 a.m. on Sunday.
The airline, in which the Mexican government holds a majority share, operates about 42 percent of the nation's domestic flights and about 20 percent of its international flights at 48 airports in Mexico and 20 airports abroad. It also operates code-sharing flights with Delta Air Lines and Air France, whose services to and from Mexico were also disrupted.
The flight attendants voted late Saturday to accept the 9.5 percent raise, which is about 3 percent above Mexico's expected rate of inflation for 2001. They had been seeking an increase of at least 11 percent. The attendants earn, on average, about $9,300 a year, according to the union. 
That is a living wage in Mexico, though less than the minimum wage for a 40-hour workweek in the United States.
The two-day strike was the first serious labor crisis for the administration of President Vicente Fox, who did not use his executive powers to halt it. 
Mr. Fox is on the first day of a weeklong tour of Asia to drum up international trade for Mexico. 
Last year, and in 1998, President Ernesto Zedillo put an end to short-lived strikes at Aeromexico on the grounds that the carrier's continuing operations were vital to Mexico's national interests.
Aeromexico officials estimated that the latest strike cost the company more than $10 million in lost revenue and operating expenses. 
In a statement released late Saturday, Aeromexico's general director, Alfonso Pasquel, said the wage agreement "preserves the financial health of Aeromexico." Wages represent about a quarter of the airline's operating costs.
The airline said passengers would be able to exchange or refund their tickets starting on Monday.

HEADLINE: Teachers' Leader Yielding on Mayor's School Role 

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
New York City's powerful teachers' union is preparing to abandon its decades-old opposition to mayoral control of the city's public education system. The change of position comes as the union seeks a sizable pay increase from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has long sought control of the Board of Education.
 The emerging union position calls for giving the mayor a majority of appointees to an expanded Board of Education, which would continue to select the schools chancellor. The approach goes nowhere near as far as Mr. Giuliani's call for turning the school system into a mayoral agency, and making the chancellor a mayoral appointee named in consultation with the City Council speaker. 
 The mayor, learning last night of the union's proposal, rejected the union's apparent olive branch as well as the concept. Anthony P. Coles, a deputy mayor and Mr. Giuliani's education adviser, called the idea of an expanded board "a mistake that would create less accountability, more bureaucracy and more confusion." 
Others, including education officials and legislators, said they saw the union's new position as a sea change and predicted that it could, once Mr. Giuliani leaves office in January, generate a real debate in Albany.
The teachers' union holds great sway with legislators, who, with the governor, determine the structure of school systems throughout the state. 
Any prospective debate in Albany might get a preview tonight, when the president of the United Federation of Teachers, Randi Weingarten, brings the issue to her executive committee. She will present a report -- by a task force she appointed last year to examine school governance -- that unanimously recommends giving mayors more control over education, and the leadership of the union is expected to accept the recommendations.
Ms. Weingarten said yesterday that she had been persuaded that mayors should have more accountability. "Part of what is motivating the U.F.T. to reconsider is that we're tired of this mayor or past mayors ducking responsibility for education," she said. "Each time we have a test result we have a bumpy ride. People under the most pressure, held the most accountable, are principals, teachers and to some extent kids. The mayor ducks out of all responsibility. Every time there's some problem in the schools, the mayor says, 'If I had control this wouldn't happen,' knowing full well he could not get control."
The union's concept is a modest one, compared to the mayor's. Its report calls for expanding the Board of Education to 11 members from the current 7; the mayor would appoint 6 of the 11 and each of the five borough presidents would name one. All appointments would be drawn from a master list of candidates recommended by a blue-ribbon panel appointed by the state education commissioner.
The chancellor would continue to be named by the board, but one with a mayoral majority. Currently, the mayor appoints two board members and the borough presidents name the other five.
Critics have long argued that this leaves no one accountable for the school system, while supporters contend that it makes for a board free of political interference. 
Mr. Giuliani, former Mayor Edward I. Koch and other critics of the status quo say that in practice, the system is badly fragmented and highly politicized -- often distracted, in fact, by political infighting. They point to many examples, the most recent being the board's election of a new president. The mayor's candidate, Ninfa Segarra, won after a bruising battle that pitted board member against board member.
The teachers' union has long argued that education has to be free of City Hall's influence and has always fought most changes in the status quo, probably because it has managed to wield considerable influence within the current setup. Why Ms. Weingarten would recommend a change now is not entirely clear. She said that it was for the reason she cited in an interview yesterday: a recognition that accountability counts.
Others link it to collective bargaining. "She wants a contract," said one education official, theorizing that by changing her position to favor more mayoral control of education, Ms. Weingarten hoped to please Mr. Giuliani and to move the contract talks ahead.
The talks are stalled and teachers, working under a contract that expired in November, are getting impatient. Ms. Weingarten has indicated to city and school officials that with the economy softening, she wants a contract sooner rather than later, even if the next mayor can be counted on to be more sympathetic to teachers than the current one. Ms. Weingarten reiterated yesterday that she also hoped to get a contract in place early enough to guarantee an orderly hiring process for the fall term.
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a strong advocate of limiting the role of the mayor in education, said in an interview that he remained opposed to the proposal "at this time."
Mr. Silver, who talked to Ms. Weingarten about her change in position last week, emphasized the differences between her stance and Mr. Giuliani's. "She wants the board to remain independent, and to continue to select the chancellor," he said. "She was very clear about that. She is not talking about a mayoral agency and still wants the board to name the chancellor."
Even so, Mr. Silver said, he could not now support the idea of a Board of Education controlled by the mayor. "Not at this time," he said twice.
Other Albany Democrats said Mr. Silver would not consider a change now because he has a rocky relationship with the mayor and does not want Mr. Giuliani to be able to claim school reform as part of his legacy. Given the reaction of Deputy Mayor Coles, lawmakers in Albany will not get a chance to thwart any Giuliani legacy-hunting unless the mayor gets to set the terms. That would be a tough proposition because of the teachers' union's considerable influence in Albany. Mr. Coles's remarks, made after he consulted with Mr. Giuliani, seemed to leave no room for debate with Ms. Weingarten.
"We have not had an opportunity to review the proposal yet, but it seems to make little sense to take a bad institution and make it bigger," Mr. Coles said. "The way to create accountability is to allow the mayor and the City Council to appoint a schools chancellor, and have the schools chancellor report to the mayor. I think this would be a step in the wrong direction, creating more confusion and bureaucracy rather than less. It's a very regressive solution. It would be a mistake."
Consensus for some kind of change does seem to be developing, in education, political and business circles. Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, have both said they favor giving the mayor more control of the city's schools. And the president of the New York City Partnership, Kathryn S. Wylde, said on Friday that businesses favor the state's providing more money for education and higher teacher salaries only if there is more mayoral control. Without that, she said, "the business community doesn't think another nickel should be put into the system."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Expects Inflation to Stay in Check 

BYLINE:  Dow Jones 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Monday, June 4 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, said today that inflation was "not a significant problem" in the American economy, but he stressed that the Fed was keeping a close watch for signs of potential inflationary pressures.
 The inability of businesses to pass along higher prices to consumers as well as the strong United States dollar are keeping inflation in check, Mr. 
Greenspan told participants at an International Monetary Conference in Singapore. He delivered his comments from Washington via teleconference. 
 "Inflation is not a significant problem at this moment," Mr. Greenspan said, adding: "There is also very little in the way of short-term inflationary expectations. But we are obviously watching."
A recent fall in labor productivity was widely expected following the unusually high productivity levels experienced recently, he said. "We've come off a very high level," he said, a surge of productivity in 1999 and early 2000 that went beyond long-term growth.
"All evidence still supports a fairly solid level of productivity," he said, adding that the level would be markedly above the average annual 1.5 percent rate the United States experienced during the 20 years before 1995.
While rising labor costs and slowing productivity have not triggered any inflation, they have cut into corporate profits, Mr. Greenspan said. 
He said there were signs that gasoline prices in the United States could drop in the months ahead. "Overall energy prices have declined since the first quarter, suggesting some easing of pressure on profit margins," Mr. Greenspan said.
Mr. Greenspan said gasoline inventories were finally beginning to grow now that bottlenecks at refineries were subsiding. But he added: "We cannot be certain that the recent spike in gasoline prices in the U.S. is behind us. Nonetheless, it is encouraging that forecasters are calling for prices to decline."

HEADLINE: MEDIA; 
Now Meet Jack Welch The Scribe

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 3 

 BODY:
John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of General Electric, said he was not trying to sell his forthcoming memoirs when he made his public debut as an author at BookExpo, the annual book industry convention, here on Friday. He was just being himself. But if so, he appears to take to selling books naturally.
 "If he wasn't trying to sell, he sure was succeeding," said Laurence J. Kirshbaum, chairman of the book division of AOL Time Warner, which paid a record advance of $7.1 million last year for the North American rights to Mr. Welch's book and threw a party in the Sears Tower here to start a big promotional campaign. Mr. Kirshbaum said the publishing house had received orders for more than 100,000 additional copies the next day. The book, "Jack: Straight From the Gut," written with John A. Byrne of Business Week magazine, is scheduled for publication in September. 
 Mr. Welch and Mr. Kirshbaum sometimes seemed to operate in tandem. "We are looking for an order of 200,000 copies -- that is not a problem is it?" Mr. Kirshbaum asked a delegation from Amazon.com as he introduced Mr. Welch.
"I talk to Jeff somewhat frequently," Mr. Welch said, referring to Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder and chairman and Amazon, "I'll tell him to buy at least two." Mr. Welch then began a passionate description of his favorite management theory, the quality-control program Six Sigma, and emphasized the importance of consistency in customer service. "It is a game changer once you get it," Mr. Welch said, as the Amazon.com executives listened attentively.
"So is that 200,000 or 250,000?" Mr. Kirshbaum chimed in to close. 
Mr. Kirshbaum and Mr. Welch have their work cut out for them. Mr. Kirshbaum estimates that breaking even after paying that huge advance, which Mr. Welch is giving to charity, will require selling at least 700,000 hard-cover copies -- something only a few books attain each year. 
Mr. Welch's reputation in business circles is prodigious. In 20 years as chairman, he has increased G.E.'s market value to nearly $500 billion from $12 billion. But his business ideas are not exactly unknown. About a dozen books about him are on the market, some written with his cooperation. Achieving the requisite sales is likely to require breaking out of the core business-book market, where the level of enthusiasm is no longer what it was last year.
The book business is suffering from the economic slowdown. Trade book sales fell 3.3 percent last year, despite the Harry Potter phenomenon, according to the Book Industry Study Group, and early indications are that sales this year are sinking further.
"Soft, soggy" is how Mr. Kirshbaum described the book market, echoing sentiments heard through the trade show, which ended today. The big national chains, Barnes & Noble and the Borders Group, both reported disappointing sales at Christmas, and several small chains and stores have since closed or slipped into bankruptcy. 
Phil Ollila, vice president for merchandising at Borders, said the decisive factor in the book's success would be Mr. Welch himself. "Mr. Welch's time is pretty limited, and the question is what kind of publicity or charisma can this guy build behind it," he told one of AOL Time Warner's publishers at a dinner after the reception.
"All we are going to do is put it in a prominent place in the store for two weeks to see if it takes off; the risk to the retailer is pretty limited; your risk is pretty high," he said, alluding to booksellers' right to return unsold copies to publishers for a refund.
Mr. Welch promised to give it his all. "I won't leave anything in the locker room, either writing it or getting it into people's hands," he said.
Mr. Kirshbaum said AOL Time Warner plans a $1 million marketing campaign, one of the biggest in publishing history, to promote the book, including a two-week tour by Mr. Welch. G.E.'s NBC and CNBC networks will be involved. The producers of the NBC program "Today" are booking their boss for an unusual two-day appearance, and he will appear as well on CNBC.
America Online is to run extensive advertisements online as well as set up chat rooms and online contests for the "best practice" inspired by Mr. Welch's approach to management. AOL Time Warner will carry ads in its publications, including Fortune and Time, in addition to ads in rapid transit systems and elsewhere. 
Mr. Welch called writing a book a very hard job, adding: "It is a lot easier to speak and leave the stage than to write and look at it in the morning. It's ugly."
He said he decided on the book after Mr. Byrne wrote an article about him in Business Week. As Mr. Welch described it, the article emphasized the weaknesses he overcame -- among other things, he is a short man who speaks with a notable stutter. Afterward, Mr. Welch said, he received more than 1,000 letters, many from people with speech impediments and others who found his success inspiring. 
His book, he said, would be a human story rather than a management treatise. "You may criticize it as too much of a people book -- where are all the pearls?" he said.
He will discuss some of his mistakes, from the time he was caught in the back seat of a car in flagrante, to when he accidentally blew the roof off a chemical research laboratory (no one was injured), to G.E.'s ill-fated investment in the investment bank Kidder Peabody. The opening scene recounts throwing his hockey stick after his high school team lost its last game; his mother stormed into the locker room to teach him a lesson about losing well.
The book was written in collaboration with Mr. Byrne and with extensive involvement from Rick Wolff, AOL Time Warner's editor, and Mr. Kirshbaum himself. Mr. Welch has kept a firm hand on the prose to make sure it reflects his voice. One of his favorite sayings is, "There is no straight line to a dream." Mr. Kirshbaum, hoping to add a touch of erudition, suggested elaborating with a quote from the German philosopher Immanuel Kant: "Out of timber so crooked as that from which man is made, nothing entirely straight can be built."
As he recounted the episode to a table full of booksellers on Friday, Mr. Welch, pronouncing the name in his broad Massachusetts accent, wanted to know: "Who the hell is Emmanuel Kant?"

Security Expert Warns Of Risk in Windows Version
The Internet is sustaining a growing plague of attacks that overwhelm Web sites by flooding them with data, and an Internet security expert is warning Microsoft that the planned consumer rollout of its Windows XP operating system for personal computers could make the global network even more vulnerable.
 The software's Internet-connection features, he contends, makes server computers more susceptible to a Web intrusion known as a distributed denial of service attack, in which attackers remotely commandeer hundreds of personal computers connected to the Internet and use them to release a disabling deluge of data against a Web site.

HEADLINE: AIDS AT 20; 
Advocates for Patients Barged In, and the Federal Government Changed

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4 

 BODY:
The AIDS epidemic has profoundly altered the way government responds to health emergencies, galvanizing medical research, speeding the review of new drugs and forcing officials who make health policy to share power with patients and their advocates.
 The federal government has poured billions of dollars into AIDS research, treatment and prevention efforts -- nearly $11 billion last year alone -- producing extraordinary insights into AIDS, the human immune system and basic cell biology. 
 But some of the most significant effects may be political. People with H.I.V. and AIDS barged into the councils of the scientific establishment, forcing scientists to consider their views, their desperation, their anguish. It was "a new form of constituency advocacy and activism," said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, "a phenomenon that clearly will be carried forth with other diseases in the 21st century." 
The protesters "used theatrical techniques to gain the attention of government officials," Dr. Fauci said. He added, "A lot of what they said made sense."
In other ways, too, the AIDS epidemic has been a catalyst for momentous changes in federal policy and operations, including these:
*Huge increases in federal spending on biomedical research and a much larger federal role in the development of new vaccines. 
*A new emphasis on swifter approval of prescription drugs for all sorts of illnesses.
*A deeper appreciation for the importance of social and behavioral science in trying to prevent disease.
*A growing realization that infectious diseases threaten the economic and political stability of many countries.
*New awareness of gays and their concerns.
The AIDS epidemic ushered in a new era of accountability, as people affected by the disease demanded a more adequate response from the government.
"We started out getting arrested wherever we could," said Mark Harrington, senior policy director at the Treatment Action Group, an AIDS research and advocacy organization based in New York. Nowadays, though, Mr. Harrington, a gay man with H.I.V., is more likely to be serving on a federal advisory committee than demonstrating against it. Often, he is the only committee member without a Ph.D. or M.D.
Dr. David Baltimore, the Nobel Prize-winning biologist who is now president of the California Institute of Technology, said this dialogue was one of the most important results of the AIDS epidemic. "I have learned a lot from these activists about the proper relationship of patients to research scientists," he said. 
William Snow of Berkeley, Calif., another of the citizen experts with H.I.V., said: "Scientists were scared and reluctant to open up what they were doing to public scrutiny. But over the years, most of them have learned there's real value in what the average patient and interested citizen has to offer."
People with other illneses have copied this style of advocacy. "We have learned a great deal from the AIDS activists," said Frances M. Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, founded in 1991. "We perceived that they were having a great deal of success in getting attention and in getting federal money."
The activists also forced politicians to acknowledge homosexuality as a fact of life. "Many politicians, especially those from rural areas, realized for the first time that they had gay constituents when they heard from people who had AIDS or had lost loved ones to the disease," said Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California.
In this respect, the government mirrored society. "The way society deals with gay people has totally changed in the last 20 years," Mr. Harrington said. "Americans developed a little more compassion as they learned about gay people and saw many who got AIDS and died."
Still, there were complaints from many quarters that President Ronald Reagan virtually ignored the disease in the early years of the epidemic, when some politicians saw AIDS mainly as a problem for gay men and drug addicts.
Dr. C. Everett Koop, who was surgeon general of the United States under Mr. Reagan, later said that "political meddlers in the White House" prohibited him from making public statements on AIDS from 1981 to 1984. When he pressed the administration to send a mailing about the disease, how it is transmitted and how transmission might be prevented, there was an uproar. Too many people "placed conservative ideology far above saving human lives," Dr. Koop said.
Gary L. Bauer, a conservative Republican who worked at the White House in 1981-82 and 1987-88, said Mr. Reagan was cautious because he "did not want to get into arguments about the effectiveness of condoms, or whether certain kinds of sex can ever be safe." He said he and Mr. Reagan were also uncomfortable with the idea that the government would provide graphic descriptions of the risks of "using dirty needles or having multiple sex partners."
Even though Mr. Reagan did not make extensive public comments about AIDS until 1987, the epidemic pushed the National Institutes of Health into the spotlight. The agency found new ways to discuss its work with the public. In time, it won bipartisan support for large budget increases for AIDS and other research.
Public expectations forced the institutes to re-examine how research was conducted, said Victoria A. Harden, the chief historian at the agency. Speed had never been a major concern, she said. The presumption was that "N.I.H. research would focus on the acquisition of long-term knowledge, not on public health crises like AIDS."
The AIDS epidemic validated the importance of basic research. Prior work on the immune system and viral causes of cancer provided invaluable insights into the mysterious new illness. But at the same time, investigators were pressed to pursue research that might offer quick payoffs for desperate patients. 
Dr. M. Michele Hogan, executive director of the American Association of Immunologists, said, "From the beginning, research on AIDS was very results-oriented, with a shorter time frame" than other N.I.H. research.
Still, basic research was critical, in part because so little was known about the AIDS virus when the epidemic began. Today, though, said Dr. Michael S. Gottlieb, who reported the first cases in 1981, "We know more about H.I.V. than virtually any other virus on the planet."
The AIDS epidemic has also brought vast changes to the Food and Drug Administration, accelerating the evaluation of new drugs. Drug companies had long lobbied for such changes, with little success. But when people dying of AIDS demanded a chance to try new medicines, the pressure became overwhelming.
The turning point may have come on Oct. 11, 1988. More than 1,000 protesters from around the country descended on the Food and Drug Administration's headquarters in Rockville, Md., demanding faster approval of new AIDS therapies. "Shame, shame shame!" they shouted. "No more deaths!" The police arrested 176 people.
The result, said Mr. Harrington, who took part in the demonstration at the F.D.A., was "a radical transformation of its policies with respect to drugs for H.I.V. and AIDS."
The drug agency says it has become "more supportive of thoughtful risk taking by patients who have run out of options." It now boasts that it "rarely blocks access to unproven medications" for the seriously ill.
It has developed several mechanisms to make experimental drugs available outside clinical trials. It allows "compassionate use" of some unapproved drugs by individual patients. It designates some products as "treatment investigational new drugs." And under its "parallel track" policy, it makes some promising new drugs available to people with H.I.V. who do not meet the eligibility rules for clinical trials.
The new emphasis on speed has carried over to the evaluation of drugs for other illnesses, to the point that some experts say things have gone too far. In a blistering commentary last month, Dr. Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet, a leading medical journal published in London, said the F.D.A. had become "the servant of industry" and had lowered its standards for approval of new drugs.
Once treatments became available, though, the question was how to make them affordable. The government has devised a whole new system of caring for people who do not qualify for help through existing programs like Medicaid and Medicare. 
Under the Ryan White Care Act of 1990, the government helps pay for a wide range of health and social services, including many drugs, for those with H.I.V. Spending under this law has more than doubled in the last five years. But for 2002, President Bush is proposing no increase above the current level, $1.8 billion.
The government is also increasing its commitment to vaccine research, even as many companies have cut back. Symbolizing that commitment is a new five-story building on the N.I.H. campus, which houses the new Vaccine Research Center.
This is a new role for the government. "It's almost unheard of for N.I.H. to have as a goal the production of a particular substance like a vaccine," Dr. Baltimore said. "In this case, because so few companies were doing it, the government decided to make a significant investment in a lab that could do everything from research through early-stage clinical testing."
More than 448,000 Americans are known to have died from AIDS, but thanks in part to new drugs, the number of yearly deaths has declined, to 16,273 in 1999 from 50,610 in 1995.
The government acknowledges that its efforts at prevention have been less successful. Paradoxically, officials say, the decline in AIDS mortality increases the need for prevention because it means that more Americans are surviving with H.I.V. infection and can spread the virus.
Federal health officials have drafted elaborate plans to halve the number of new infections by 2005, but Representative Waxman said the government was still failing to inform people about the disease in clear, forthright terms.
Many experts also complain that the message is not reaching young people and members of minority groups who most need to hear it. Half of all new H.I.V. infections are believed to occur in people under 25. Blacks account for more than half of all new infections, though they account for slightly less than 13 percent of the United States population.
Health officials worry that a sense of complacency has set in, partly because of their progress in fighting the disease. "The availability of treatment may lull people into believing that preventing H.I.V. infection is no longer important," says the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reported the first cases of AIDS 20 years ago, on June 5, 1981.

HEADLINE: Myanmar Tests Resolve of I.L.O. on Enforcing Standards 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, June 4 

 BODY:
Nearly all governments agree smooth, seamless international trade is good and mistreatment of workers is bad.
 But as antiglobalization protests in Seattle and elsewhere have illustrated, when free trade and labor standards intersect, the results can be surprisingly troublesome. 
 Look no further than efforts by many governments to take Myanmar to task for flouting international prohibitions against forced labor.
Last November, the International Labor Organization, a United Nations affiliate based in Geneva with 175 member countries, called for stiff measures against Myanmar, formerly called Burma, because of the military government's practice of forcing villagers to do unpaid construction work. 
Initially, the European Union, the United States and other countries indicated that they would impose sanctions against Myanmar over the issue. But a new report by the labor organization failed to identify a single nation that had responded to its call with any concrete action.
The reason is that Myanmar belongs to the World Trade Organization, and sanctions with some sting -- like a ban on textile exports -- would violate W.T.O. rules. 
If anything, the effort to isolate and punish Myanmar over its labor practices is losing ground. Japan recently announced the largest aid package since the military government suppressed prodemocracy demonstrators more than a decade ago.
The United States State Department listed Myanmar as among the three worst offenders in its annual report on human rights abuse, and trade preferences for Myanmar were suspended years ago; Americans are also banned from investing in Myanmar. But there is limited support in Congress for additional sanctions -- in part because the government of Myanmar has reopened dialogue with the country's most prominent dissident, Aung San Suu Kyi -- and the United States remains Myanmar's largest export market.
Indeed, Myanmar's trade with both the United States and the European Union has soared recently. According to Eurostat, the union's statistical agency, the volume of trade between the 15 countries in the union and Myanmar shot up from 222.6 million euros ($188 million) in December 1999 to 404.3 million ($342 million) in December 2000. The Commerce Department reports a near-quadrupling of American imports from Myanmar since 1997, reaching $412 million last year.
Oddly, that growth has occurred in part because of American diplomatic cold-shouldering of Myanmar. No agreement has been negotiated on a bilateral quota for apparel, like the ones the United States has with most other developing countries. Manufacturers from China and elsewhere have set up shop in Myanmar specifically to exploit the loophole.
The labor organization's fruitless effort to take a strong stand against Myanmar has shed a harsh light on its lack of enforcement power. At the March meeting of the organization's governing body, American officials worried publicly about its ineffectiveness. "In the absence of democratic reforms in Burma, the practical ability of an I.L.O. presence there to assure that forced labor has been eliminated nationwide is highly problematic," Charles Spring, a Labor Department official, told the group. 
Not that it has not kept trying: in late May, the organization said Myanmar had agreed in principle to allow an I.L.O. team into the country to conduct an independent investigation of its arguments that it is moving against forced labor. Details have yet to be negotiated.
The Bush administration has said it opposes the direct linking of trade issues and worker safeguards. In April, the White House said it would review a free-trade pact that the Clinton administration concluded last year with Jordan that included labor-standards provisions, the first such pact to do so.
Many developing nations prefer to leave the issue of labor standards to the labor organization, while trade unions and workers' rights activists want the World Trade Organization to have jurisdiction because the trade group's dispute-settlement system has the power to authorize trade sanctions.
Some on Capitol Hill would like to force the issue by enacting a ban on textile imports from Myanmar, which would probably provoke a complaint to the World Trade Organization. In late May, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, introduced such a bill in the Senate. William Goold, an aide to Senator Harkin, said leaving the matter solely to the labor organization was "asking governments to ignore the clear limitations of the I.L.O." 
The labor organization is scheduled to discuss Myanmar again at its annual meeting on Tuesday. Meanwhile, human rights groups and trade unions say nothing has changed in Myanmar, despite a decree against forced labor last October that they called a sham.
"Clearly there is a reluctance by the international community to take concrete steps," said Janek Kuczkiewicz, Asian specialist for the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

HEADLINE: Social Security Options 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Hal R. Varian (Economic Scene, May 31) reports that the stock market has returned 7 percent over 100 years. However, workers under Social Security receive a yield now that will greatly exceed 7 percent for many, if all the program's benefits are factored in -- among them the money saved if one doesn't have to contribute to parents who are not indigent but would be in the absence of their Social Security benefits. 
 A negative effect of privatization is that the large sums that would come on the market would artificially inflate stock prices, which would become additionally divorced from reality. The current price-earnings ratio of 25 is likely the result of the substantial sums regularly added by 401(k)'s and I.R.A.'s. Social Security privatization would further inflate and destabilize the market.

Price of Oil Rises as Iraq Halts Exports

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices rose yesterday after Iraq halted exports in a dispute with the United Nations, which is considering a change to sanctions that would make it harder for the nation to import weapons components.
 Iraq, which pumps almost 4 percent of the world's oil, stopped moving supplies through a pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan and to its own port of Mina al Bakr. Iraq said shipments would not start again until the United Nations backs away from its plan. Some of Iraq's OPEC colleagues said they would make up for any shortage. 
 "This is going to be a short-term fight between Iraq and the U.N.," said Edward A. Silliere, vice president for risk management at Energy Merchant L.L.C. in New York. "The Saudis and the other OPEC members can make up for any missing barrels, although there would be a short delay."
In New York, crude oil for July delivery rose 20 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $28.13 a barrel after rising as much as 2.9 percent during the session. Prices are down about 7 percent from this time last year. In London, Brent crude oil for July settlement rose 19 cents, to $29.26 a barrel.
The United Nations controls Iraq's oil income under sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The Security Council voted on Thursday to extend the restrictions in their current form for a month while considering a British proposal to modify the sanctions to loosen controls on most imports while tightening them on suspected military equipment.
Iraq opposed the changes and favored a six-month renewal of the previous agreement. "The sanctions plan has obviously scared the Iraqis," said Bill O'Grady, director of fundamental futures research at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
Iraq's export halt comes as members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries gather in Vienna for a meeting today on production levels. OPEC ministers have already signaled their intention to leave their self-imposed quotas unchanged.

HEADLINE: The Future of an Epidemic 

BYLINE:  By Michael S. Gottlieb; Michael S. Gottlieb, an immunologist, identified AIDS as a new disease in 1981 and reported it to the Centers for Disease Control.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
I remember standing on a beach on an overcast day in 1985, feeling as if I knew a tragic accident was about to happen and no one could hear my warnings. Now the world knows about what I feared then -- the enormous size of the AIDS epidemic -- but to look ahead from here is to feel again that not enough people appreciate how a failure to act effectively would undermine the quality of life for everyone on the planet.
 In the 20 years ahead, AIDS can be brought under much better control in the United States -- if we don't let down our guard -- but it will be devastating in some other parts of the world. 
 The incidence of new cases of H.I.V. could decline in this country from an estimated 40,000 a year to a few thousand by 2010. Future generations of antiviral drugs will reduce the virus further in body fluids. For those already infected, new drugs can be expected to push H.I.V. into a deep state of dormancy, though not to eradicate the virus. But to keep AIDS from continuing to spread, we need more culturally focused prevention programs, H.I.V. education in the schools must be routine, and we must treat drug addiction as a medical problem, so that drug users stop transmitting the disease through needle sharing and unprotected sex. 
Drug companies and government researchers are working now to develop vaccines. Promising candidates should be in use within 15 years but will require continuous modification to keep pace with the virus's prodigious mutation rate and recombination of strains. In the United States, the vaccines will probably be made available on a voluntary basis, especially to gay men, intravenous drug users, heterosexual partners of H.I.V.-positive men and women, the incarcerated, and people traveling to regions with high infection rates.
But in Africa, the Far East and the former Soviet Union, H.I.V. is now spreading virtually unchecked, and there is every indication that it will continue to do so for the next several years. According to United Nations statistics, the number of people who will have been infected worldwide by 2021 will easily top 150 million.
The United States Census Bureau has projected that in several African nations, deaths from AIDS will peak between 2010 and 2020. In Nigeria, 1.25 million are likely to die in 2020, at the peak of its epidemic, and by 2050 its population will be 73 million below pre-AIDS forecasts. In Southeast Asia, deaths in several countries are predicted to peak between 2015 and 2025. The Russian Ministry of Health recently predicted that 12 percent of the population of Russia will be infected by 2015.
By 2020, H.I.V. will have caused more deaths than any disease outbreak in history. The constant experience of suffering and death, and the privation that results as economies fail in AIDS-ravaged countries, especially in Africa, could lead to the downfall of governments and the breakdown of law and order.
The United States, the European Union, Japan, the United Nations, the World Health Organization and prominent American foundations have an opportunity to mount a coordinated effort at damage control. It is estimated that $10 billion annually is needed to develop health systems to deliver basic medical care and antiviral medications in Africa. In my opinion the effective deployment of these medications could reduce the mortality rate by at least 50 percent from what current estimates would predict, and completely eliminate transmission of H.I.V. from mothers to their babies.
Action by relief agencies will be needed to tend the dying and to assist the millions of healthy children orphaned by AIDS. The United States could foster stability by forgiving debt owed by African nations hard hit by AIDS. By the year 2010, I believe, several of the most promising H.I.V. vaccine candidates could be under study in controlled clinical trials in countries with the highest rates of new H.I.V. infection. And by 2021, one or more of these could have reached a level of effectiveness and safety that would allow its administration to children and adults in regions where the infection is most common.
We in the developed countries are finally beginning to grasp the size, scope, complexity and seriousness of the global H.I.V. pandemic. It took AIDS to teach us what Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg meant when he said: "The world is just one village. Our tolerance of disease in any place is at our own peril."
If we provide the money for effective action now, when the costs are still relatively low, we can minimize the setbacks that AIDS will cause at home and abroad. If we stand by or make token gestures, we will allow AIDS to spiral even further out of control.

HEADLINE: Pataki Is Said to Weigh Emergency Budget 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 4 

 BODY:
With budget negotiations stalled, the State Senate majority leader said today that Gov. George E. Pataki had raised the possibility of sending a three-month emergency spending measure to the Legislature when the current one expires next week. 
 If the Legislature passed such a measure, the impasse over the budget would probably continue until at least mid-September, breaking previous records for late budgets. The latest date for the adoption of a state spending plan came on Aug. 4 in both 1997 and 1999. 
 The governor's office said Mr. Pataki, a Republican who is expected to seek re-election next year, had not yet decided whether to propose a three-month emergency bill.
"At this point, it's far too soon to speculate on the potential duration of interim budget bills," Mr. Pataki's spokesman, Joseph Conway, said. 
But aides to the majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said the governor's staff had floated the proposal privately. In an interview on WROW radio in Albany this morning, Senator Bruno said Mr. Pataki was considering the option "to try to bring some semblance of order to the process."
The Legislature passed the April 1 budget deadline without adopting a spending plan for the 17th year in a row. Talks have become bogged down in differences about the economy's health and revenues. 
Last week, the governor said the state might fail to pass a budget at all this year. The Democrats have accused him of trying to save money for the election year by maintaining current spending levels. The governor has accused the Democrats of proposing unrealistic spending increases in the teeth of a national economic downturn.

HEADLINE: Putting a Tax Rebate to Use; 
Many Are Expected To Save the Money Or Pay Their Debts

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The $45 billion or so in tax rebates and cuts that are scheduled to take effect this summer should give the economy a modest but important lift at a critical time, economists say, just as jobs remain hard to find and energy bills are draining money out of pocketbooks.
 Combined with five interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve since January, the tax cuts should help the longest economic expansion on record continue through its 11th year, most economists argue. 
 "It's going to provide a little bit of a kick-start to the economy," said Michael Gregory, a senior economist at Lehman Brothers, "and it lessens the chances of a recession."
But economic growth is still expected to remain sluggish this year, according to interviews with economists, analysts and consumers in the 10 days since Congress passed the 10-year, trillion-dollar-plus tax cut advocated by President Bush. In part, that is because most of the immediate cut comes in the form of rebate checks that many people will consider little more than a temporary rise in income. As a result, they will save much of the money or pay debts, rather than spending it in ways that help spur the economy. 
"I'll take whatever they want to give me; really any amount would be fine," said Arlene Annerino, a 50-year-old secretary who lives on the South Side of Chicago and works downtown at a law firm. "But it's not going to make that much of a dent in anything."
Ms. Annerino said she planned to pay bills with some of the money and put the rest in her checking account.
If taxpayers follow historical patterns, they will quickly spend only about a third of the $38 billion rebate, but will spend almost all of the additional $7 billion or so they will receive this year after withholding tables are adjusted on July 1 to reflect slightly lower tax rates. The cumulative effect of the new purchases could cause the economy to grow by at least an additional half a percentage point in the third and fourth quarters, at an annualized rate, economists said.
In the first three months of 2001, the economy, adjusted for inflation, grew 1.3 percent at an annual rate, up slightly from 1 percent in the last three months of 2000, according to the Department of Commerce. The six months represent the weakest economic performance since the first half of 1995.
Some analysts think the economy could shrink in the second quarter. Business spending on equipment and technology remains weak, and employers cut an additional 19,000 jobs last month. Surveys in recent weeks have found that many people expect the economy to strengthen in the months ahead, but that they have yet to see evidence of improvement.
"Consumers are now at the crossroad," said Richard T. Curtin, the director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan. "Either we're going to have a slow recovery, or we're poised for another decline, depending on what consumers decide will happen with the economy."
The rebate checks, which the Treasury Department plans to mail in July, August and September, are the centerpiece of the most aggressive government effort to hasten an economic recovery in two decades. Individuals who had taxable income of more than $6,000 last year will receive $300, and married couples with more than $12,000 in taxable income will get $600. Single parents who earned more than $6,000 will receive $500. Those with taxable incomes below the threshold will receive rebates equal to 5 percent of their reported income for last year.
Starting in July, taxpayers will also receive the equivalent of a small raise as the government begins withholding less money from paychecks. In general, the more one earns, the bigger the raise.
But with unemployment expected to rise and a gallon of a gasoline costing $2 in some cities, many Americans say the money will not change the way they live.
"That money isn't going to change my life one way or the other," said Richard Fulkerson, a banking regulator who lives in Littleton, Colo. "I'm not going to do anything crazy. I might just stick it in savings."
Steve Bottomley, a stay-at-home father and part-time boat mechanic in Van Nuys, Calif., echoed that thought. "It's just going to meld into the rest of my recurring expenses."
"It isn't enough to make you feel like you can do something," Mr. Bottomley said. Other people say they are likely to split the check.
Steven Rikert, a 36-year-old father of two who lives with his wife in White River Junction, Vt., said, "I'd save at least half of it for a house, we'd like to get a house someday, and use the other half for just whatever I think I might need."
In two surveys earlier this year, more than 60 percent of Americans said they would save most of a rebate or pay debts with it. Fewer than a third said they expected to spend most of the money on new goods.
The last time the government mailed rebates -- in 1975, as part of a similar effort to spur growth -- taxpayers quickly spent 25 percent to 40 percent of the money and saved the rest, for a while, according to several studies. At the time, households received $100 to $200, roughly similar to the current rebates in inflation-adjusted terms.
By contrast, people usually spend nearly all of an increase in their take-home pay. In the early 1980's, after President Ronald Reagan and Congress cut tax rates, consumers spent about 90 percent of their additional take-home pay on average, according to a recent study by Nicholas S. Souleles, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. "People respond differently to different kinds of tax cuts," he said. 
Paul Nagy, a college student in Denver who also works as the promotions coordinator for a radio station, is an example. With the $300, he said, "I'll finally be able to pay off some of my school loans." But Mr. Nagy, who is 25, said the possibility of receiving a little more money in each paycheck had not even occurred to him.
Jill Blake, 53, works two jobs, one as a ticket agent at a bus terminal and one as a cook at the Black Angus Cafe in Quechee, Vt., where she lives. Out of her last paycheck of $400, $70 went toward taxes -- "a big bite" she said she cannot afford. She will use the rebate, she said, to pay some bills but wants to set aside the additional money in her take-home pay for a trip to Cancun, Mexico.
Shea Martin, a 26-year-old in Southern California who works as an actor and at an Armani store in Beverly Hills, said he did not expect to save any of the money. 
"As everyone out here is an aspiring actor, I'll put it into head shots or acting classes," Mr. Martin said, adding that he thought higher gas prices would eat up the rebate.
In fact, some economists think that despite what happened after previous tax cuts and what people have told survey takers, most Americans will spend most of the rebate. Unlike the rest of the tax cut, most of the money from the rebates will go to households with less than $50,000 in annual income, and many of these families live paycheck to paycheck.
"Such a large fraction of this is going to people with virtually no savings," said Jonathan Skinner, an economist at Dartmouth College, "that it seems reasonable that they will go out and spend it."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 8, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Tuesday with an article about the ways people are expected to spend tax rebates carried erroneous data. It showed the change in the price of goods and services bought by consumers, not the change in consumer spending from one year to the next. A corrected chart appears today, on Page C5.

Suarez for The New York Times; Above, Justin Lane for The New York Times) Chart: "Christmas in July"Starting next month, income tax rates will be cut slightly and the government will begin mailing rebate checks to millions of taxpayers, providing a modest lift to spending at a time when consumer confidence has faltered and growth has slowed.

PAYLESS CASHWAYS FILES FOR CHAPTER 11 PROTECTION

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 Payless Cashways said yesterday that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
The filing in United States Bankruptcy Court in Kansas City, Mo., came after the company's decision last month to lay off hundreds of employees and close 19 stores. Payless, based in Lee's Summit, Mo., sells building materials and finishing products. Its business is aimed at remodelers, contractors, property management and industrial companies, and do-it-yourself customers. Millard Barron, the president and chief executive, blamed poor economic conditions and an unusually harsh winter that led to lower-than-expected sales.

HEADLINE: Rule Limits Overcharging Of Roommates 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
In a case threatening upheaval for many rent-stabilized tenants in New York City, a judge has ruled that landlords may evict those who charge roommates more than a fair share of the rent.
 The ruling involved a disabled 70-year-old retiree who took in a roommate at her Park Avenue apartment in March, charging him $2,200 when her monthly rent was $1,847.77. The landlord moved to evict them both, citing a new state regulation on roommate overcharges. 
 The tenant, Jean E. Mazzolo, contended that the law does not provide for such evictions. But last Wednesday, Judge Larry S. Schachner of Housing Court ruled that the owner is entitled to use that provision in its suit to remove the tenant and her roommate, Brian Moro. There still has to be a trial on the specifics of that case. 
The ruling strikes at an increasingly common practice, especially with the city's worsening housing shortage, that has even spawned a niche of agencies devoted to matching prospective roommates for a fee.
The trend was spurred by a 1983 state law guaranteeing every tenant's right to have a roommate, a law aimed partly at protecting unmarried couples from eviction. By 1999, a Census Bureau study showed that 158,238 New Yorkers were living in rent-stabilized apartments with nonrelatives.
The rule upheld by the judge prevents rent-stabilized tenants from making roommates pay more than their fair share, generally interpreted as half the rent.
"What we have here is a potential for mass evictions," said Mrs. Mazzola's lawyer, Darnay Hoffman, who is appealing the decision. "It creates a lot of mischief. It gives landlords the right to act as gatekeepers. This is going to have a significant impact on students, poor people, people in the arts, the elderly, gay couples or other roommates who don't get married, for whatever reason."
The real estate industry welcomed the decision. William J. Neville, a lawyer for RAM I, the company that owns Mrs. Mazzola's apartment, at 1000 Park Avenue near 85th Street, said: "The intent of the law is to prevent tenants from illegally profiteering on the owner's property. Profiteering is not the purpose of the roommate law or the rent laws." He predicted success in winning the ultimate evictions.
Jack Freund, the executive vice president of the city's leading landlord group, the Rent Stabilization Association, said, "We do hear of quite a number of situations" in which roommates are overcharged.
The rule on roommates is part of a disputed recodification of rent regulations by the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. Tenant representatives are challenging the revisions in State Supreme Court, arguing that the state violated procedures and overstepped its authority in making changes like the roommate rules. The state defends its actions.
"We're not talking about people profiteering, we're talking about people surviving," said Judith A. Goldiner, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society. "Rents being what they are, almost everybody has a roommate."
The rule makes no allowance for roommates who pay more because they use more than half the space in the apartment, or for tenants who may pay less than half the rent but pay the cost of utilities and other joint expenses, Ms. Goldiner said. Evictions could also result when the person named in the lease is laid off, disabled or has returned to school, and the roommate -- who could be a domestic partner -- picks up the rent, tenants' lawyers said. 
Word of the rules is starting to spread. "We had a building where the landlord sent every tenant a letter demanding to know if they had a roommate and how much they were charging," said Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition. "It was pretty threatening."
Landlords should not pry into the personal lives and private arrangements of tenants, he said, but they are tempted to do so to empty apartments and raise rents for new tenants.
Mrs. Mazzola, a retired antiques dealer, has lived in her spacious two-bedroom apartment for 32 years, and says her annual income is $12,000. She suffers from emphysema and heart ailments, uses a wheelchair and relies on an oxygen tank. For several years, she has taken in a roommate to help pay her bills. "If anybody needs it, I do," she said.
She said her landlord wanted her out so it could sell the apartment as a co-op, which she estimated would sell for $1.5 million. She said she was never notified of the new state rule, and after her landlord challenged her and she called the state agency on three occasions, she was told that overcharge violations were not subject to eviction. 
Stanley Leibowitz, vice president of Classic Realty, which manages Mrs. Mazzola's apartment for the owner, said the case was about principle, not money. She should not be making a profit, he said. "I think it's wrong for people to do that."

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN; 
Riposte From Franks in Governor's Race

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
 A 60-second radio commercial, "Grace," was released yesterday by former Representative Bob Franks in his contest with Bret D. Schundler, the mayor of Jersey City, for the Republican nomination for governor of New Jersey. It is running on conservative talk programs in New Jersey, New York and Philadelphia.

PRODUCER -- Smith & Harroff.

ON THE AIR -- An announcer's voice mocks Mr. Schundler's most recent radio commercial, a testimonial by Grace Bowen, a Jersey City resident.

THE SCRIPT -- Announcer: "Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler is trying to convince Republicans that he never raised property taxes. But his outrageous attempts to cover up his tax-hiking record are almost comical. Listen to his latest."

Grace Bowen -- "I'm Grace Bowen. I've lived in Jersey City 77 years. Bret didn't raise taxes."

Announcer -- "Come on, Bret. The New York Times says Grace is actually a Hudson County Democrat committeewoman, who lives in a taxpayer-subsidized rental. That's right. She doesn't even pay property taxes. The truth is Mayor Schundler has taken over $800 million in aid from Trenton and still raised property taxes in Jersey City. Not only that, city debt's up, government spending's up, water fees are up, even sewer fees are up. In fact, the Schundler tax hike record is so bad, the only person he could find to defend it is a Hudson County Democrat who doesn't even pay property taxes. On June 26 in the Republican primary, vote no on Bret Schundler. We just can't afford him as governor."

ACCURACY -- Jersey City, like most other municipalities, has received annual financial aid from the state government; it is the second-largest city in New Jersey and thus receives more than most. The Franks campaign says the city has taken an additional $58.5 million under the state's "distressed cities" program; Mr. Schundler says he did so only after being threatened with a cutoff of other state aid. The municipal property tax rate has risen from 1992 to 2000, but at a rate slower than the inflation rate. Debt has grown by 14 percent during that time, also below inflation levels, Mr. Schundler says. But he says water and sewer rates have actually declined slightly. The Franks campaign relied on a comparison to 1994 and used water and sewer utility revenues, not rates.

SCORECARD -- Mr. Franks aims here at an easy target and hits his mark, but at some risk of reprisal. The battle between the two candidates has been over which of them is the more credible tax-cutter, and Mr. Franks once again does an effective job of depicting Mr. Schundler as a tax-and-spender. More important, dyed-in-the-wool Republican primary voters may well take exception to Mr. Schundler's use of a politically active Democrat to defend him and attack a fellow Republican. But Mr. Schundler has been arguing all along that he, more than any other Republican, is capable of attracting Democratic votes in the fall campaign. A Schundler campaign official said last night that he was considering counterattacking Mr. Franks for picking on a "defenseless old lady." DAVID M. HALBFINGER

United Airlines Buys Online Marketer

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Jumping into one of the most troubled sectors of the Internet economy, the parent of United Airlines said yesterday that it would buy MyPoints.com, an online marketing company, in a deal valued at $105 million.
 MyPoints runs a variety of programs that gather information about consumers, both online and off, and uses it to sell products and services to them. But it has been shrinking rapidly as the Internet advertising market has hit hard times. Its revenue in the first quarter was $10 million, down from a peak of $18.7 million in the second quarter of 2000. 
 The UAL Corporation, the parent of United, agreed to pay $2.60 for each share of Mypoints. That is well below the $88.50 it sold for in December 1999, but quite a lot better than the 50 cents that MyPoints shares hit in March. It soared 60 percent yesterday, rising 96 cents, to $2.56 a share. 
The purchase price is not much more than the $98 million in cash that MyPoints had as of March 31. 
While many big companies, like Staples, are closing separate Internet units and reabsorbing their activities, United is intent on building up its United NewVentures subsidiary, which operates the web site United.com and portions of its frequent-flier program as well as holding United's investments in several Internet travel companies. These include Priceline.com, Hotwire and Orbitz, an online travel agent it helped start that began operating today.
Scott Garner, a managing director at United, said United still believed that separating its Internet activities could help improve shareholder value, perhaps by allowing for a public offering of shares of the unit when the market for such divisions improved.
"We have identified areas of the company where we have assets that may not be fully valued by the market," he said.
But in the current environment, he said, United concluded that a simple holding company of investments would not be enough to attract investor interest.
"Our goal is to create a complete business that weaves together our other activities and creates additional value beyond that," he said. "MyPoints will be the glue that brings all those activities together."
John H. Fullmer, the chief executive of MyPoints, said that the company had not sought to sell itself but was looking at combining with other online marketing companies when an unsolicited bid came from United.
United said it expected that MyPoints, which is based in San Francisco, would continue to operate under its current name and management.
United will not merge its Mileage Plus frequent-flier program with the MyPoints' flagship rewards program, which gives users points when they read advertising e-mail or make purchases at certain merchants. The typical MyPoints user does not fly often enough to make airline miles valuable to them. But United will offer travel discounts as rewards for MyPoints points.
The deal would also give United a broader array of technology and potential marketing deals that it could link to its frequent-flier program. American Airlines and AOL Time Warner have created a program that gives American AAdvantage miles for online purchases, using technology from Netcentives, an ailing competitor to MyPoints.

HEADLINE: Building Boom and Less Demand Make Hotel Rooms Easier to Get 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
It was just a few months ago, it seemed, that it was almost impossible to book a hotel room in Manhattan. But those days are over -- at least for now -- because of a slackening economy and a record construction boom.
 The hotel room occupancy rate for the first quarter of the year declined by 7.6 percent since the same period last year, the biggest drop since 1994, according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers to be released today. 
 The occupancy rate during the first quarter of 2001 was 72.3 percent, down from 78.2 percent in the same period last year, a reduction of 5.9 percentage points. That is the lowest since the first quarter of 1996, when the rate was 69.2 percent, according to the report. 
Some of the decrease can be explained by the economy and the decline in business travel, the report said. But the softening demand was also accompanied by a record boom in hotel construction. About 3,500 rooms were added last year.
"Last year at this time," said Sean Hennessey, the director of the PricewaterhouseCoopers's hospitality consulting practice, "most of the first-class hotels were turning away 40 to 50 guests a night from Monday through Thursday.
"If that level of demand had continued at that pace, these 3,500 rooms would have been absorbed without a drop in occupancy rates," Mr. Hennessey said.
The survey was based on room occupancy figures from about 70 percent of the city's hotels. Those figures showed that demand for rooms declined from about 4 million during the first quarter last year to about 3.9 million from January through March this year.
Without the new rooms, the occupancy rate would have dropped by only 2.1 percent, said Tim A. Simpson, a senior associate at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Despite the negative trend, people in the hotel and tourism industry said there was no cause for hand-wringing.
"I don't think we are in any trouble," said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF, a company that tracks the hotel business. "A lot of profits are continuing to be made, and we will continue to be healthy for the foreseeable future."
Diane Briskin, the corporate director of sales and marketing for W Hotels, which operates four boutique-style hotels in Manhattan, said that many companies were no longer spending freely to send executives to conventions and conferences.
"We get called all the time by companies doing belt-tightening," she said. "They are looking at renegotiating their rates."
At the Mark Hotel, a luxury hotel on the Upper East Side, business for the first quarter was down 8 to 10 percent, said Bill Dunphy, the marketing director.
He said that some customers were being lost to newer hotels in TriBeCa and other downtown neighborhoods. "Those are the new hot neighborhoods," he said. "They are a natural draw, particularly for the younger business traveler."
But much of the new hotel construction has occurred below 24th Street, and that section's occupancy rate has declined 15.2 percent during the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2000. That was the steepest of any of the five broad Manhattan areas in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.
Some hotel operators shrugged off the slowdown. "I would not go so far to say we are recession-proof," said Brian Honan, the director of marketing for the Four Seasons Hotel on 57th Street near Fifth Avenue, "but there is a different layer of insulation at this level. C.E.O.'s, presidents and owners will always have to travel, and their expectation levels don't shift as the economy does." But he said that some guests were downsizing from suites to smaller rooms.
Leisure travelers, many of whom have been priced out of the Manhattan market in recent years, are expected to be the chief beneficiaries of the slowdown. The average daily room rate is still the highest in the country, but it increased only 2 percent in the first quarter -- to $200.47 from $196.60. Many hotels are turning to the Internet to fill empty rooms, often at bargain prices, said Jason N. Ader, a lodging industry analyst for Bear, Stearns.
It is too early to tell whether the lower occupancy rates were caused by a decline in tourism; the numbers will not be available until next year. Mr. Ader said that overseas travel to New York had decreased at least 5 percent, but other analysts said they did not think that the hotel figures showed that tourism was falling off.
Cristyne F. Lategano-Nicholas, the president of NYC and Company, the city's conventions and visitors bureau, said that the number of foreign visitors was expected to rise this year, though not at the same rate as before, in part because of the strong dollar. Tourism overall is expected to increase by 2 to 3 percent, she said.
"Because the last few years have really been gangbusters, we were expecting these phenomenal growth rates year after year," she said. "This is really an adjustment."
There are signs, Mr. Hennessey said, that hotel business is already beginning to improve, and PricewaterhouseCoopers has forecast that the industry will bounce back next year.
Mr. Dunphy of the Mark said that his hotel expected to reach an occupancy rate of 78 percent this month. In September, it expects to raise its nightly rate for a single room to $525 from $505, he said, although he added that many guests do not pay the published rate.
"The reality," Mr. Hennessey said, "is our occupancy rate is 10 percent better than the national average, and our room rates are more than double. Most hoteliers would be envious of us."

Turkey's Moment Of Truth

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL 

 BODY:
I thought Madonna had arrived. The place was the Ulus restaurant on an Istanbul bluff overlooking the Bosporus. The commotion started with police sirens blaring. Then there was a gaggle of a dozen television cameras and reporters, flashes popping. A murmur started to spread through the restaurant. Then the doors flew open, the reporters cleared a path, and the star walked in: Turkey's minister of economy, Kemal Dervis, had arrived for dinner. 
 Say what? Turkey's economy minister getting the Madonna treatment? Gotta tell you, it's the darndest thing I've ever seen. "Everywhere I go they follow me," shrugged Mr. Dervis sheepishly. This scene tells you everything you need to know about the unusual drama playing out in Turkey today. 
 Quite simply, Turkey's economy is on the brink of disaster. In mid-February the Turkish currency was devalued by 25 percent in one day. It was the culmination of decades of mismanagement and corruption, in which politicians used state banks and factories to pass out patronage and their patrons then used the money to buy and support the politicians. 
With little fanfare, the Bush team, which came to office swearing it would never do bailouts, as President Clinton did, quietly arranged for a $17 billion rescue package for Turkey from the I.M.F. and the World Bank. But on one condition -- that this time Turkey get real. Because there would be no next time. Turkey's feckless and squabbling politicians had no choice but to look for someone outside the political system who knew Turkey, knew economics and was not corrupt. 
Enter Mr. Dervis, a respected Turkish economist and vice president of the World Bank. Turkey's cabinet anointed him economic czar, with authority to drive through 15 reform laws that Turkey promised the I.M.F. and the U.S. it would pass in return for loans -- laws to end subsidies, create open bidding for government contracts and sell off state-owned assets, such as the phone company. If implemented, they will produce a revolution in Turkish politics. 
And that's the drama. The politicians know they have to implement these reforms. But they also know that in destroying the patronage system they will be undercutting their power bases and elevating Mr. Dervis, of whom they are insanely jealous. The Turkish public is widely rooting for the untainted, soft-spoken Mr. Dervis to succeed, hence the fascination with his every move. When he got up to use the restroom at the Ulus restaurant the elderly lady attendant handed him a towel and whispered, "Please don't quit."
But at the same time, people fear losing control of their lives to the I.M.F. "I really appreciate what the I.M.F. is doing," says Aysuda Kolemen, a student at Istanbul Bilgi University, "but I know that they are not doing it for me personally, so in the future they are likely to do things that I may not like or approve of, but I don't have a say in it. So I feel powerless, because any power I have as a citizen has now been transferred to some international technocrats." 
So Mr. Dervis is constantly, and so far deftly, walking a tightrope between coaxing his countrymen to do the right thing and not appearing to be a foreign agent. It's not easy. He regularly has to remind his cabinet colleagues, "But we promised the I.M.F. . . ." After the government slashed wheat subsidies, Agriculture Minister Husnu Yusuf Gokalp was asked why, and he said, alluding to Mr. Dervis, "You should pose that question to those having breakfast at the Hilton with foreign bankers ."
Last Thursday was a typical day here. At 10 a.m. State Minister for Privatization Yuksel Yalova declares that he will not sign a law -- which Turkey promised the I.M.F. it would pass -- ending subsidies to tobacco farms, which employ 600,000 people. At 11 a.m. Turkey's currency and stock market plunge. At noon I.M.F. officials complain. At 2 p.m. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit repudiates Mr. Yalova. At 2:30 p.m. Turkey's markets recover. At 4 p.m. Mr. Yalova is forced to resign.
The last act of this drama is still to be written. Andrew Finkel, a longtime analyst here, remarked to me that for decades Turkey's politicians had enjoyed "power without responsibility" -- lining their pockets without worrying about the future. Now, says Mr. Finkel, they have "responsibility without power." On one hand, they deserve it. On the other hand, they may not be up to it. Stay tuned. This is going to get interesting.

Bloomberg Beams In

BYLINE:  By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
Michael Bloomberg is supposed to enter the race for mayor of New York today, not in the flesh but via a barrage of TV commercials. There is also a Web site, where you can dial up www.mikeformayor.org and find a photo and biography. ("The former Eagle Scout's passion for helping others comes from his strong belief that those who are fortunate have an obligation . . .")
 Voters' first impression of the campaign is going to be that the city has a hologram running for chief executive. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, the latest in the nation's long list of rich-guy candidates, is supposed to appear in person later this week. A billionaire who runs a financial media company, he believes he can win the election by running tens of millions of dollars' worth of commercials between now and November. He may not be experienced, but he'll be familiar. If it works, maybe the Taco Bell chihuahua can run for comptroller.
This candidacy has been in the works since at least last fall, when Mr. Bloomberg switched parties and registered as a Republican under the very reasonable assumption that the spindly New York City G.O.P. would have less competition for its mayoral nomination. Since then he has hired a whole mess of consultants, done a couple of interviews and walked in the Salute to Israel Parade. It was his first parade "since his Eagle Scout days," said his spokesman. That puts him approximately ten thousand marching miles behind the four Democratic mayoral candidates, a numbingly experienced crew that Mr. Bloomberg is hoping to portray as hacks.
According to his campaign, the TV ads are going to show Mr. Bloomberg introducing himself and warning that the city "cannot afford to go back to the clubhouse." New Yorkers are supposed to connect Mr. Bloomberg with Rudy Giuliani, who has been trying to assist his campaign lately. But the mayor has no coattails. When it comes to helping out, he is the political equivalent of Typhoid Mary at a cookout.
Voters may also wonder if the city can afford to bring another outspoken, iron-willed outsider into Gracie Mansion. Mr. Giuliani is, frankly, beginning to drive everybody crazy. Mr. Bloomberg, who is divorced, would probably not get us involved in his marital problems, or force us to pay for police guards for his friends and his sweetie. But you do not get to be an iron-willed, tough-talking billionaire without developing a tic or two somewhere. Eight years ago New York needed discipline and order. Now we just need a rest.
And for a guy who made his fortune in the communications business, Mr. Bloomberg seems surprisingly tone-deaf. The other day he was quoted as complaining that New York City public school students "have personal hygiene problems." There is an old sexual harassment suit, long settled but destined to be much discussed, in which Mr. Bloomberg was alleged to have responded to news of an employee's pregnancy by telling her to "kill it." He denies saying it.
Back in March, Mr. Bloomberg appeared on an MSNBC special on the dot-com economy, in which he and a bunch of other new-tech moguls sat perched uncomfortably on stools trying to sound pithy. Asked about wireless communication, he told Tom Brokaw, "I've carried a mobile phone for a number of years and I don't remember ever getting a call, and I think I'm a mogul, so, you know, if I don't get them, what do you need them for?"
Later on, Mr. Brokaw brought out a little girl named Jalissa who was too poor to buy her own computer, and invited Mr. Bloomberg to explain whether big companies were "doing enough" to erase the digital divide.
"Well, the problem, Tom, is that it's not clear that we need people to spend more time away from books and away from teachers and there's this implication that the only technology that matters is the Internet," he responded, totally ignoring the child -- a New York City child -- who was standing right in front of him.
"The problem is that a lot of people are using the Internet as a baby sitter," he concluded. "And it's just not clear we're better off for that."
Mr. Brokaw interjected that he, for one, wanted Jalissa to be able to do homework on a computer. If this had been a debate, Mr. Bloomberg would have been George Bush the elder, looking impatiently at his wristwatch.

Shares Up on Gains by Oil Issues and Greenspan Remarks

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as oil shares advanced on the prospect of higher crude prices after Iraq halted exports. 
 Investors snapped up oil shares because "there's a pretty high degree of certainty about what earnings will be in the energy group this year," said Eric Thorne, a money manager for the Bryn Mawr Trust Company in Bryn Mawr, Pa. "Profits are going to be really strong." He recently bought shares of Chevron and Schlumberger. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 71.11 points, or 0.7 percent, to 11,061.52. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.44 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,267.11. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 6.49 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,155.93. Intel and Wal-Mart Stores declined, limiting the benchmarks' gains.
Stocks also got a lift after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a conference in Singapore that inflation is not a threat to the American economy, suggesting that the central bank may trim interest rates further when policy makers meet on June 27. 
The Fed has reduced rates five times this year to revive the economy, which expanded at an annual pace of 1.3 percent in the first quarter after growing 5 percent in 2000.
Lower rates may help offset an expected decline in earnings this year that has sent the Nasdaq down 12.7 percent in 2001 and the S.& P. 500 down 4 percent.
Some 835 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the second fewest this year and 30 percent below the three-month daily average. Major indexes swung between gains and losses before climbing in the session's final half-hour.
"We have almost no economic data and no earnings reports" to speak of this week, said Peter Boockvar, a trader for Miller Tabak & Company. "There's a lot of volatility when people have nothing to hold onto" and the market probably will not establish any direction in the next few days, he said.
In the absence of hard data, investors are focusing on signs of what to expect from a number of company meetings scheduled for this week with analysts.
Intel rose as much as 46 cents and fell as much as 68 cents before closing with a loss of 24 cents, to $28.50. Executives may lower their most-optimistic revenue forecast for this quarter when they brief analysts after exchanges close Thursday, said Terry Ragsdale, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. 
"We don't see how the news can be good," Mr. Ragsdale wrote in a note to clients, because demand for personal computers has not picked up. Intel is likely to forecast a revenue decline of 3 percent to 7 percent, compared with the first quarter, he said. The company now predicts revenue may be anywhere from up 2 percent to down 7 percent.
Still, he said he recommended the stock because Intel was likely to stop losing market share to Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and PC sales growth may pick up to 15 percent annually after this year.
Oil stocks gained after Iraq, the No. 4 producer in OPEC, halted most exports in protest over United Nations trade sanctions in place since the country invaded Kuwait in 1990. OPEC oil ministers also signaled that they intended to leave production quotas unchanged at a meeting that starts today, meaning oil prices are likely to stay near $30 a barrel.
Fourteen of 15 stocks in both the Amex oil index and the Philadelphia oil service sector index rallied.

Treasury Prices Increase
 (By Reuters) -- Treasury bond prices rose yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, calmed investors' fears over inflation and left the door open for more interest rate cuts to stimulate the sluggish American economy.
Data late last week that painted an unexpectedly bleak picture for the recession-mired United States manufacturing sector and a still-contracting labor market sent Treasury prices bolting higher, pushing yields lower. Yesterday's light trading activity built on those solid gains.
"I wouldn't bet against Treasuries in the short term," said Robert Justich, managing director for fixed income at Times Square Asset Management, citing expectations for lower rates and Fed-led optimism that inflation will remain contained.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 9/32, to a price of 97 18/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.32 percent from 5.36 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32, to 95 20/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.68 percent from 5.71 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: Surplus of Finger-Pointing In California Energy Crisis 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
Natural gas prices have plunged in the last few months -- everywhere, that is, but Southern California. While gas in New York costs about $4 per thousand cubic feet, gas delivered to Southern California still costs more than $11 wholesale. 
 That such numbers demand an explanation was about the only thing President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis could agree on when they met in Los Angeles a few days ago to discuss California's energy crisis. Mr. Bush assigned Patrick H. Wood III, a fellow Texan confirmed last month as a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to investigate. 
 To many experts, the woes of California's natural gas market are as profound as those of its electricity market: the state is short on pipelines, and the rules of the gas market, critics say, encourage sellers and traders -- including the biggest local gas utility -- to drive prices higher. 
At peak times, half of California's electricity is generated by gas-fired power plants, a higher proportion than in most parts of the country. And because 85 percent of the gas consumed in California comes from outside the state, the shortage of pipelines both into California and within the state has become a big handicap in fueling those plants. The strain has become especially acute as drought in the Pacific Northwest has curtailed imports of hydropower and gas-fired power plants have worked overtime to meet the demands of a booming state economy.
Vice President Dick Cheney's energy policy report last month proposed initiatives to speed approval and construction of new pipelines, noting that New England and other regions faced capacity squeezes, too. The report says that the United States needs 38,000 miles of new gas transmission pipelines, almost a 20 percent increase.
In the meantime, some industry executives and public officials take the argument one step further than the Bush administration, contending that today's shortage of capacity has made it possible for energy companies, intent on maximizing profits, to manipulate prices. 
"It really strains credulity to say this is a functioning market," said Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, who as chairman of the House energy subcommittee has been leaning on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to scrutinize the California gas market. "Reasonable people could conclude people have gamed the system." 
In one significant case, California utility regulators and Southern California Edison, one of the state's struggling electric utilities, have accused the El Paso Corporation of using its control of a major pipeline into the state to inflate prices artificially. El Paso officials deny wrongdoing and accuse California officials of making the company a scapegoat for the state's failure to build more pipelines. A judge at the federal energy commission is hearing the case in Washington. 
But fingers are pointing in other directions, too. 
For example, the Southern California Gas Company, the state's largest gas utility, has reaped huge profits buying and selling gas in the last year -- activity encouraged by state regulations intended to lower gas prices for consumers. But some gas marketers and electricity generators contend that the trading has contributed to price spikes, by tying up valuable pipeline space during peak times with gas shipments driven by financial deals, not power demands.
At the same time, Edison says that Southern California Gas failed to put enough gas into storage last fall for residential and small-business customers. If so, that would have driven the gas company back into the market in the winter, when demand from power plant operators was high, helping push gas -- and hence electricity -- prices yet higher, Edison complains. 
Between them, El Paso and Southern California Gas were responsible for $3.7 billion in excess prices for energy in the last year, Edison contends. 
Southern California Gas, a unit of Sempra Energy, denies that its trading has harmed the market. Rather, its executives note that electricity generators and industrial gas consumers -- which under state rules are responsible for managing their own gas supplies -- put very little gas into storage last year. By one estimate, large gas consumers in Southern California had only 11 percent as much gas in storage at the end of November as they did at the same time during the prior two years.
Another problem may emerge this summer, according to William L. Massey, a member of the federal energy commission. Mr. Massey said new commission rules intended to limit electricity price spikes in California will almost certainly prompt energy-trading companies -- which deal in both gas and electricity -- to manipulate gas prices. That is because the rules allow electricity generators to charge more if gas prices move higher. 
Similarly, growing attention is being paid to the role played by financial trading tied to the price of electricity and natural gas. Industry critics question whether huge trading volumes in these financial derivatives gives energy marketing companies the incentive to manipulate prices in tight markets.
Federal regulators "don't seem to understand that firms are really trying to make as much money as they can," said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute, a research organization on the Berkeley campus. "That's what they do for a living." 
Fixing the problem is simple, Mr. Borenstein said. "If you build more capacity," he said, "you reduce both the scarcity issue and you reduce the ability of people who currently own capacity to exercise market power." 
Regardless of whether companies are manipulating prices, the California natural gas market is fattening bottom lines. In the El Paso case, testimony has shown that pipeline capacity acquired by the company's marketing affiliate in March 2000 for $38.5 million produced profits of almost $900 million over the next 13 months. 
El Paso said its share of those profits was $184 million, the rest going to other companies with which it entered into hedging transactions intended to limit El Paso's exposure if gas prices fell. About half of those transactions were with the biggest energy trader, the Enron Corporation, according to people present at briefings El Paso officials have given to California officials. 
An Enron spokesman, Mark Palmer, said it was possible that Enron took the other side of the trades, but he said that Enron would have resold the pipeline capacity almost immediately, thus profiting little from the rise of gas prices in California. 
Federal regulators, concerned that the high gas prices in California may not be legitimate, have proposed requiring companies selling gas in the state to disclose extensive data about their transactions. They are also considering whether to reimpose price caps on short-term sales of pipeline capacity that were eliminated early last year. 
Further, regulators are scrutinizing the so-called gray market in which energy marketers bundle gas and transmission capacity and sell it to large customers, like electricity generators, for one price. Federal regulators have oversight responsibility for the interstate portion of gas shipments, but they have not looked closely at these bundled transactions, Mr. Massey said. 
"The whole thing has fallen through the cracks," he said.
Nearly all of California's gas comes from the Southwest, the Rocky Mountain states and Canada through a few huge, highly pressurized pipelines. In California, the gas is shunted onto intrastate pipelines that deliver it to consumers and to underground storage fields for later use. 
Those pipelines are now largely running full, and their capacity is about 300 million cubic feet a day less than what interstate pipelines can deliver. The difference is the amount of gas it takes to continuously fuel a 1,300 megawatt power plant -- enough to light more than a million homes.
"It's not resources, it's straws -- the straws needed to suck this gas where it needs to go," said Thom Kelly, assistant executive director of the California Energy Commission. "If the straws are full, that's a problem." 
Operators of interstate pipelines have proposed new construction that could double delivery to the state. Indeed, odd as it seems now, some in the industry worry that California could be "overpiped" later this decade, just as it was in the mid-1990's.
Likewise, Southern California Gas plans only limited expansion of its in-state pipelines, partly because it expects demand to fall as hydroelectric power supplies return to normal levels and older, less efficient gas-fired power plants are phased out. 
But the gas company's intentions are regarded with skepticism by others in the industry. Some executives contend that Southern California Gas has damaged the marketplace through its enthusiastic embrace of a state program that allows it to split with customers the profits from buying, selling and lending gas. 
A coalition of power generators, including Reliant Energy, the Williams Companies and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, has complained to state officials that the program "creates perverse incentives" for the gas company. The generators say it results in extra demand for pipeline space when capacity already is at a premium, making prices more volatile.
The consequences of the gas company's low storage inventories were evident in early December, according to John Stout, a senior Reliant executive. He recalled listening in on a conference call as a Southern California Gas official talked about injecting gas into storage. "I was floored," Mr. Stout said. "Prices were sky high, and they were putting more upward pressure on prices." 
Lee M. Stewart, president of energy transportation services for Southern California Gas, called the criticism "bogus." The utility's storage and trading practices have neither hurt the market nor curtailed gas sales to customers, he said.
"To say gas prices drive electricity prices is a falsehood," Mr. Stewart added. 
But to many regulators, it is clear that gas prices play an increasingly important role in electricity prices. 
Problems in the California natural gas markets "haven't been given the prominence they deserve for the detrimental role they are playing in high electricity prices," said Linda K. Breathitt, another member of the federal energy commission. "Natural gas prices have been the stepchild of this California crisis." 
This article is part of a joint reporting project with the PBS series "Frontline," which will broadcast a documentary about California's energy crisis tonight.

HEADLINE: Teacher Pact Still Far Off 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
On the surface, it seems like an auspicious moment for advocates of change in the New York City public schools. 
 The teachers' union president says she is willing not only to see the mayor take control of the Board of Education, but also to make it easier to dismiss bad teachers and reward good ones with some form of merit pay. 
 At the same time, a phalanx of big-name business leaders is trying to pry enough money out of Albany to finance a huge pay increase for the teachers to bring salaries closer to those paid by suburban districts.
Yet, after a bargaining session yesterday, prospects for a contract do not seem bright. The teachers and the city remain far apart on the size of raises to be given to the city's 80,000 public-school teachers. 
Yesterday, union officials accused Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of setting a new and unreasonable demand in contract talks, saying he would not agree to a contract until the State Legislature gave him the power to hire and fire the schools chancellor.
Many business leaders, educators and parents agree a landmark deal is needed to address daunting problems in the nation's largest school system, most notably the dismal performance of many city schools and the shortage of certified teachers.
"This is an opportune time for a path-breaking deal because of the problems in hiring teachers and the need to hold teachers accountable," said Joseph P. Viteritti, a public policy professor at New York University who is a consultant to Mr. Giuliani on education. "And with all the focus on education nationwide, it's an opportune time, because whatever we do in New York has high visibility and sets the tone for the rest of the country."
The teachers' contract expired in November, but Randi Weingarten, the president of the teachers' union, has set today as a negotiating deadline, saying she will ask the state to appoint an arbitrator to recommend a nonbinding settlement if no agreement is reached this week.
Last Thursday, the state-appointed mediator, Robert L. Douglas, said that unless an agreement was reached this week, there would not be enough time for teachers to ratify the settlement before the school year ends. He has called another negotiating session for this afternoon.
Last week, several officials involved in the talks said they would fail unless the two sides made significant movement on salaries.
The city has offered an 8 percent pay increase over two years. But the United Federation of Teachers wants a raise of at least 20 percent over two years, insisting that a large raise is needed to attract enough certified teachers, especially since many suburban districts pay 20 to 30 percent more than the city does. This year, 60 percent of the teachers hired by the city were uncertified.
Mr. Giuliani has said that a huge raise is not needed, and that the teacher shortage is not as bad as the union says. But even if he changed his mind, some City Hall officials say the city simply does not have the money for a 20 percent raise, which would cost $1 billion a year. The starting salary for teachers is $31,190, and the maximum is $70,000.
Complicating matters, if the teachers are given a 20 percent raise, other unions, notably the police union, will undoubtedly demand an identical increase.
Labor experts see another obstacle to a deal: the well-known dislike that Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Weingarten feel toward each other.
Ms. Weingarten's offers on mayoral control of the Board of Education and on merit pay have been rejected as inadequate by the mayor. Ms. Weingarten said on Sunday that the school board should be expanded, with the mayor appointing six board members, up from two at present, and the five borough presidents each naming one. Under her union's plan, the board would still select the chancellor, but the mayor, saying he wants to reduce bureaucracy and increase accountability, wants to abolish the board and give the mayor the power to appoint the chancellor. 
Ms. Weingarten said that yesterday's negotiating session lasted less than 30 minutes, and that the mayor said there would be no contract until the Legislature enacted a bill giving the mayor power to hire and fire the chancellor.
"It's not appropriate to make this a condition of a contract, since this has to be done by the state," Ms. Weingarten said. "It's just another straw man not to do a contract."
City Hall officials declined to comment on yesterday's negotiations.
Ms. Weingarten, who said she had tried to meet the mayor halfway, asserted that the school board should be preserved because it gives parents a mechanism to air their concerns and preserves a modicum of independence in running the schools.
But Mr. Giuliani said Ms. Weingarten's proposal would increase bureaucracy. "What they're proposing makes matters worse, not better," he said at a news briefing yesterday.
As the mayor and the union tangle over salaries and the Board of Education, they face intense pressures to reach a settlement.
Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the New York City Partnership, the city's main business association, said: "There's a sense that New York City, our future, our competitiveness in a knowledge-based economy, absolutely depend on getting the public education system fixed and doing it now."
In recent days, the union has signaled possible concessions on three of Mr. Giuliani's main demands, for longer hours, merit pay and faster ways to dismiss teachers who are incompetent or misbehave. 
But City Hall officials suggest that the union's talk of flexibility is more public relations than substance, asserting that the union has not gone nearly far enough on merit pay. 
Mr. Giuliani wants individualized merit pay, in which some teachers in a school receive bonuses while others do not, depending on how their students perform on standardized tests. Ms. Weingarten has indicated she would accept schoolwide merit pay in which all of a school's teachers and support workers receive bonuses if that school shows improvement by various measures.
Some business executives and educators voice concern that if no agreement is reached this month, then, because of the summer break and distractions caused by the mayoral race, no deal will be reached until a new mayor is sworn in next January. Supporters of educational change say that the chances of far-reaching reform will diminish if Mr. Giuliani does not reach a settlement and hands the matter to his successor. 
Some education experts, like Professor Viteritti, say the time is ripe for a deal, because in their view Ms. Weingarten has shown unusual flexibility for a teachers' leader. Just two years ago her union seemed dead set against any form of merit pay, a weakening of tenure or mayoral control of the Board of Education.
Some educators and political analysts also say Mr. Giuliani can only gain by reaching an agreement that will help achieve his goal of remaking the city's schools. 
"We have a mayor who's in the final year of his term and for whom there is very little to lose and a lot to gain by reaching a settlement with the teachers," said Arthur Levine, president of Columbia University Teachers College.
In recent weeks, much has gone on behind the scenes to produce a deal. Business leaders, including Jerry I. Speyer, the real estate executive, and Henry Kravis, the financier, have lobbied in Albany for more money for the city's schools and teachers. Ms. Weingarten and Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy have quietly urged state lawmakers to make hundreds of millions of dollars available to make it easier for Mr. Giuliani to finance a deal.
"It does boil down to funding," Ms. Weingarten said. "If we want to ensure that there is a well-prepared teacher in every classroom, then you have to address salaries. Salaries have become a quality issue."

HEADLINE: North Korea, Displeased, Said to Review Missile Pacts 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 4 

 BODY:
Citing their deep displeasure with Washington, officials from North Korea have threatened to pull out of two agreements under which that isolated nation had promised to halt missile testing and to stop building nuclear reactors that could be used to produce weapons, an American academic said today. 
 In a meeting in Pyongyang, Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun told the scholar that the United States had made hostile and offensive statements about North Korea, the American said as he returned from a visit there. Mr. Paek complained to the visitor that the administration was backing away from commitments made by President Clinton. 
 Last month, a delegation from the European Union said the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, had told them that he would unilaterally extend his country's moratorium on missile testing and production until 2003 as a good will gesture. But the foreign minister appeared to cast doubt on that.
"It has yet to be decided whether we maintain the moratorium on missile testing," Selig Harrison, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation who has studied North Korea, related that Mr. Paek had told him. "That depends entirely on the policy of the new U.S. administration, whether it is hostile or not."
Since he took office in January, Mr. Bush has signaled that he intends to be tough with North Korea, rejecting the policy of cautious engagement that had characterized Mr. Clinton's last year in office. 
Administration officials have been openly skeptical about South Korea's "sunshine policy" of engagement with the North. The officials have also pushed for immediate and aggressive inspections of North Korean nuclear sites, actions that North Korea has said it will not allow. 
Mr. Harrison said four high North Korean officials had each told him that such policies could threaten the two loose accords that now form the foundation for relations between North Korea and the United States. 
Under the first, the Agreed Framework, signed in 1994, North Korea said it would stop producing weapons-grade plutonium, closing its lone operating reactor and shelving plans for two others in exchange for a promise to help meet energy needs. The plan called for the United States, Japan and South Korea to build two light-water reactors in North Korea by 2003. 
North Korean nuclear reactors produced plutonium that could readily be processed for use in nuclear weapons. The light-water reactors do not. 
The second agreement, when Mr. Kim agreed in 1999 to a temporary moratorium on missile testing in exchange for relaxed American economic sanctions, was negotiated by former Defense Secretary William J. Perry. In late 1998, North Korea alarmed the world by sending a long-range unarmed missile toward Japan.

HEADLINE: Look Busy, Feign Interest and Be Paid 

BYLINE:  By JULIE FLAHERTY 

 BODY:
Bored with the daily grind? Consider a job as an impersonator. It is quite the rage these days.
 As the service sector grows, an increasing number of people are being paid to pretend to be somebody they are not. They sit as make-believe jurors to help lawyers sharpen their oratory. They pose as customers in restaurants to check on the bartenders. They crowd the seats near the stage in talk shows to make sure somebody claps at the right moment. They even rush around normally placid workplaces to make a favorable impression on visitors. 
 That is what Robert, a 66-year-old mechanical engineer from Boston, did after he was laid off. A potential client was coming into the office, and his old boss wanted it to look busy. So he hired Robert to come in and feign work. "I sat at the computer and called up an old design I had worked on, and started playing with it," said Robert, who insisted that his last name not be used. "There was nothing else to do." He was paid the same wage he received when he did the work for real.
Padding staff is a common ploy among start-ups. Kate Brant, staffing manager for Pro Staff in Boston, remembers helping one young venture beef up its skeleton crew. "They mentioned that it is hard for their clients to understand how they can run a business of that size and not have physical bodies there," Ms. Brant said. She did ask that the company find some nominal tasks, like stuffing envelopes, for her workers.
Matthew Swanson, president of the Express Personnel Services office in Redmond, Wash., also took no particular pride in assigning mock jobs for a local company that wanted to add heft to its staff. "We just went along with it," he said. 
Temporary staffing agencies like his are usually the first resort for filling phantom jobs, whether the employer wants candidates to fake working or fake not working. Lisa Schmitter faked not working. She would come home from her day job at Express Personnel in Trevose, Pa., change into jeans and T-shirt, and go hang out in a bar. But while she always ordered a drink, she never sipped it. Ms. Schmitter, 25, was helping a large restaurant chain check up on the diligence of its staff and was noting whether the bartenders asked for her ID.
She had to make two trips to each of 14 restaurants each month, which was "a little time-consuming," she said, but it was easy and the money was decent. The worst moments came when bartenders were fired, often on the spot, for not asking for her ID.
"That made it a little difficult to continue," she said. "I tried to get out of there as soon as possible."
Professionals in her line of work, known as mystery shoppers, have been around for decades. But Christopher Causey, director of business development for TrendSource Inc., which sends out mystery shoppers, says the practice has spread to a greater variety of industries. TrendSource's revenue has shot up 40 percent a year for the last five and a half years, he said.
"Even during tight economic times, we will see companies that will look to initiate this type of service because of the realized benefits of increasing the quality of their customer service," Mr. Causey said.
Keith Alter, president of Alternative Solutions Inc. in Boston, sent workers to a bank with customer service problems to pose as customers demanding tricky transactions. He has also provided people as an audience for lawyers wanting to practice their courtroom deliveries. "They just wanted some people that would not cause any trouble," Mr. Alter said.
Diane Warner, staffing coordinator for Express Personnel in North Houston, Tex., also supplies mock jurors to law firms. "Some of my people said it was very boring," she said. "They had to drink coffee in between breaks to stay awake." At least they earned about $15 an hour, more than real jurors do.
The list of role-playing jobs is almost endless. Ms. Warner says one business asked her to send people over to play around with its Web site as if they were customers and to comment on its good and bad points. Leo Craig, owner of the Express Personnel franchise in Trevose, received a request from a market research company that was training employees to conduct market research interviews. He sent "everything from Ph.D.-candidate-type people to people from other countries," he said.
Perhaps the ultimate nonjob involves no questions, no talking, just standing around and looking tough. When a professional wrestling outfit was filming an event at the CenturyTel Center in Bossier City, La., Larry Wilson, the arena manager, said he put out a call for "gentlemen between 20 and 30 years old with a big build." Placed strategically next to doorways, the men had only to look like bouncers keeping order.
Others who crave the spotlight have found solace in talk shows. Often those well-dressed, professional-looking people sitting in the first few rows of the studio audience are being paid to clap their hands. Television producers find them more appealing than the T-shirt-and-baseball-cap crowd that lines up for free tickets.
"It's an easy job," said Lisette St. Claire, who works for Central Casting in Burbank, Calif. "You sit there and you get paid to clap and you have fun."
She also casts for laughers -- people who lend their guffaws, chuckles and titters to the taping of a show.
Pat Nixon, 70, of Glendale, Calif., tried out as a laugher a few years ago because she needed extra cash to supplement her Social Security. She describes her laugh as "titillating" because it incites others to laugh as well -- just what casting directors want.
While most audience work is sporadic, laughing can be a relatively steady part-time job, she said. When Fran Drescher, the actress, was threatened by a stalker, she made sure the entire studio audience for her show "The Nanny" consisted of hand-picked laughers and applauders. Ms. Nixon had that as a standing job for two years.
As if her funny bone were not already excitable, Ms. Nixon takes cues from the assistant directors, who wave their arms when they want an audience to laugh.
"They tell us to laugh, I laugh," she said, with a laugh.

HEADLINE: Trees vs. Produce: Clashing Greens In Union Square 

BYLINE:  By REGINA SCHRAMBLING 

 BODY:
NEW YORK is not at its most savory in summer. One of the few compensations for the brutal weather and the weird quiet is the Greenmarket on Union Square. A Saturday morning there is like a cross between a mind massage and a trip to the country, without the shrink or the jitney.
 Manhattan simply has the best farmers' market in the United States, the model on which hundreds are now based. Founded exactly 25 years ago, when pea shoots and fresh basil were not even gleams in the most adventurous chef's eye, the Greenmarket has grown into a showplace of variety and perfection that would almost make a Parisian envious. Marquee chefs can be found there, picking through the sugar snap peas and the strawberries, along with throngs of other cooks, serious and vicarious. No wonder guidebooks list the market as a must-see in a city with no shortage of culinary (and other) splendors. 
 But this is shaping up as the summer of discontent for both the Greenmarket and its devotees. Union Square West, its busiest boundary, feels like a war zone while a century-old water main is being replaced; heavy equipment and construction barriers have invaded space normally clogged by dedicated shoppers as well as the dog proud and the stroller encumbered. Farmers are pushed leaf by jowl in what little room is left amid the dirt and the noise. And the market is still weeks away from the corn and tomato frenzy that makes it wilder than Times Square when the theaters let out.
Even if the market survives without the construction driving away customers, though, farmers will soon face a more forbidding trial by renovation. Next year, the city's Parks Department plans to revamp the southwest corner of Union Square. And what that means for the market has fears festering under the white canopies between 14th and 17th Streets. Lacking any solid information from the city, farmers and their advocates are hoping for the best and envisioning the worst.
The latest dispute appears to be a flare-up from the last one, in December, when the Greenmarket blanketed the park with ominous notices of a potential shrinking of the market after drawings for a $6 million redesign for the southwest corner of the park were making the rounds. Greenmarket advocates worried that the design for new tree plantings would force some farmers out, and shoppers and chefs started voicing their objections. Then the dispute quieted. 
Now, with construction unsettling the market, those worries have resurfaced. At worst, advocates say, the market could indeed be truncated, forcing farmers out; at the very least, they say, the design could keep out the large trucks farmers rely on to bring in the tons of fruits and vegetables that supply not just home kitchens but also 60 to 85 percent of the menus in some of the city's top restaurants in summertime.
In an interview Monday, Henry J. Stern, the city parks commissioner, would say nothing specific, but offered comments ranging from, "We'll design it and then see what fits," and "I don't think one farmer or any farmer will be forced out" to "There will be room for 90 percent, or 95 percent" of the Greenmarket.
And so David Distler, a Manhattan lawyer whose small Friends of Greenmarket group coalesces whenever the market feels imperiled, is back on the ramparts. "If the Parks Department would honestly state what their intentions are, in detail, it could dissolve any controversy," he said on Saturday. "They're not saying anything, yet they're saying some things that are very scary."
Michael Batterberry, the editor and publisher of Food Arts magazine, was involved in the drafting of a letter in support of the market from top chefs like Daniel Boulud, David Bouley, Alfred Portale, Diane Forley, Wylie Dufresne and Michel Nischan. Mr. Batterberry puts it more bluntly: "There is something very pungent buried here."
It's hard to believe this all grows out of rhubarb and potatoes.
But the Greenmarket seems to function as New York's own Pauline, perennially strapped to the railroad tracks with a train barreling down. In the quarter-century since an urban planner named Barry Benepe recruited a handful of struggling farmers from the Hudson Valley to set up shop in what was then more drug haven than city park, both Union Square and the neighborhood have become magnets for money, developers and tourists. Location is everything in Manhattan, and the 65 farmers who set up stands on the asphalt four days a week at the height of the season are occupying some very valuable real estate and paying only small fees to the Greenmarket, which is run by the Council on the Environment of New York City. (Interestingly, it is Adrian Benepe, the founder's son, as Manhattan parks commissioner, who is overseeing the redesign so many farmers fear.)
The market sells to the homeless as well as to some of the most renowned chefs in the city; 40,000 shoppers come through on a typical Saturday in summertime, said Lys McLaughlin, the council's executive director. But even though the Greenmarket is also a tourist attraction, it doesn't exactly fit in the age of Disney. The KnollKrest Farms stand selling chickens and eggs may attract crowds worthy of the "Producers" cancellation line, but the market itself is not about T-shirts and corporate tie-ins. Instead it has become a national prototype precisely because farmers are allowed to sell only what they grow or can or bake themselves.
In the realm of agribusiness, it's hard for the one-crop farmer to be king, especially growing fragile foods like zucchini blossoms. Many farmers say they are totally dependent on the Greenmarket; and chefs say they prize not just the freshly picked food but also the accountability in an era of mad cow disease and genetic engineering. 
The market's blessing and curse is its location in a high-rent neighborhood, with the newest W hotel on one corner and restaurants and theaters all around. Advocates for the farmers say the relationship between the Parks Department and the Greenmarket has deteriorated as Union Square improved after the farmers moved in.
"When we first started, 20 years ago, my husband was mugged while setting up and spent four days over in St. Vincent's," Sue Gorzynski of Gorzynski Organic Farm said Saturday. "To push us out is not right. There weren't nice stores when we first started coming here. Henry Stern forgets that."
Mr. Stern, however, insists that he is "pro-Greenmarket" and that "we're happy they're there." But he also says, "when it comes to choosing between trees and trucks -- big trucks -- I'm for trees." 
The commissioner said in the interview the only problem was that "the Greenmarket has a couple of professional wolf-criers." His response to the letter from the chefs who banded with Mr. Batterberry says the Greenmarket was never given permission "on a permanent basis" to expand into the southwest corner and adds that "allowing large trucks into this area would displace park users and endanger trees and paving."
But as farmers and their supporters point out, there can't be a market without trucks. Chickens don't take the R train; some farmers drive five hours or more each way, from South Jersey or the Finger Lakes or even Vermont. They also can't just park in a lot because they need ready coolers. 
Originally it was actually just the Parks Department's plan for the water main that had farmers dreading this summer. Yet the agency was mostly praised by those I spoke with on Saturday. "They're doing a good job," said Suzie Dare, of Cherry Lane Farms in Bridgeton, N.J. "We've been rearranged, but it's not unbearable. I have no complaints, and I thought I would."
Many farmers gave up a quarter or half of their usual space so that others could squeeze in this summer. 
Ms. McLaughlin of the Council on the Environment, who is now the only Greenmarket official authorized to speak to the press, also put a positive face on the situation this summer. "We're willing to squeeze and reconfigure and all pull together," she said. "It's a real nice feeling. Reason prevails, we hope."
Not everyone agrees, of course. "A lot of customers have told me they won't come back because the farmers are so tight," said Ted Blew, owner of Oak Grove Plantation of Pittstown, N.J. "I don't want to sound like a real complainer, because the city has to have water, but the gross income is not here this year because it's harder for the consumer to get around. Farmers have taken their trucks out of the market, and there's still not enough space."
And then Mr. Blew, like so many others, brought up the beautification project. "At least with the construction we'll get our space back," he said. "We could lose farmers with the work at the end of the park."
Linda Paffenroth of Paffenroth Gardens, said: "No one is telling us anything. In summer we usually have three spaces. This summer we may have to consolidate and not bring both our trucks down. It's the unknown that's bad -- we have to buy seeds and plant in advance." 
A worker at a neighboring stand said he already had to divide produce between Union Square and a Greenmarket on East 47th Street. "We're cramped in here," he said. "We can't even park our truck. We have to take it to the other market."
It's not just farmers who are edgy. Mr. Dufresne, the chef-owner of 71 Clinton Fresh Food, says he relies on the market for 75 percent of his produce in peak season. "I've gone all four days the market is open for years now," he said. "I've seen it go through changes before. But mostly it gets bigger. It always seems to be having growing pains, but now it's having shrinking pains. The city does not value the Greenmarket for what it did in that park."
Both Dan Barber of Blue Hill in Greenwich Village and Philippe Bertineau of Payard on the Upper East Side say that up to 85 percent of their menus comes from the market in mid-June and July.
Some in Mr. Batterberry's chefs' group say they got stung when they tried to communicate their empathy and their dependence on the market. As Mr. Nischan recalls, the group was meeting to discuss an unrelated farm-chef project when they decided to fire off a letter last winter to Mr. Stern because "there was an awful lot of fuzzy gray area about whether the farmers would get an equal share in the redesign of the park." But he and the others were outraged when, last week, they got what they called a "very patronizing" response. 
"We're a powerful economic resource in this city," Mr. Nischan said. "It cheapened it to have him say we were writing because the Greenmarket told us to." In another interview, he said: "It's such a benefit to give our customers fresh food that's responsibly grown. Any elected or appointed official would see this as a good thing."
Mr. Distler, who heads Friends of Greenmarket, says he and others are suspicious simply because the Parks Department is being so closed-mouthed about the specifics of the design. The farmers and their advocates almost appear to be reduced to studying sheep's entrails to get a sense of the future: they pass around purloined architects' renderings and try to interpret how the placement of trees or the specification of blue paving stones will affect their trucks. On Saturday, The Villager, the neighborhood newspaper, was circulating among booths as farmers tried to read between the lines of Adrian Benepe's quotations on their rights to the park.
Mr. Distler says there's a reason so few specifics have been made public. A year and a half ago, he said, Friends of Greenmarket gathered 19,700 signatures in two weeks on petitions opposing another department plan. "Every time there's a disclosure, we stop them," he said. "I don't know why they're so antagonistic to one of the most successful amenities in the city."
But both sides might be surprised to learn they are in agreement on one point at least. Mr. Distler says: "I want the facts. This is not the way open government should work." And Mr. Stern said the constant agitation was "like mushrooms -- it flourishes in the dark."

HEADLINE: Rumsfeld Pays Visit To Troops In Balkans 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: CAMP BONDSTEEL, Kosovo, June 5 

 BODY:
In his first foray into the Balkans, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld heard today from American troops and commanders about the difficulties of stemming ethnic fighting along the Kosovo-Macedonia border, where some Bush administration officials want to curtail the United States' role.
 Traveling by Blackhawk helicopter in the shadow of Kosovo's snow-capped peaks, Mr. Rumsfeld surveyed the intricate networks of mountain trails used by Albanian rebels to smuggle weapons into Macedonia from Kosovo. He also talked to soldiers involved in gun battles along the border and was shown dozens of weapons seized from smugglers in recent weeks. 
 Though Mr. Rumsfeld has said little about what he wants to do with the 6,000 American troops in Kosovo, he has made clear in the past that he believes American forces are overextended across the globe, specifically pointing to Bosnia as one place where United States involvement should be wound down.
During the American presidential campaign, Condoleezza Rice, now President Bush's national security adviser, called for having the Europeans take up more peacekeeping duties in the Balkans -- a position the administration has since backed away from. 
In brief remarks to several hundred soldiers inside a tentlike movie theater here, Mr. Rumsfeld did not mention the debate in Washington over peacekeeping missions, and instead praised the troops for having taken up a "noble cause" that he said has often been overlooked. 
Brig. Gen. William David, the new commander of the American contingent in NATO's peacekeeping force in Kosovo, told reporters that conditions seemed to have improved somewhat along the border in recent days. He said the recent decision to allow Yugoslav troops back into a buffer zone around Kosovo had allowed NATO troops to focus more resources on stemming rebel activity along the Macedonia border.
But General David said it remained difficult to stop the flow of fighters and weapons across the hilly and heavily wooded Kosovo-Macedonia border, where Albanian smugglers using mule trains and cell phones sometimes operate with impunity. 
Asked if he thought American troops were still needed to keep the peace, General David said yes. "This can be a deadly place," he said.
Camp Bondsteel is in a way emblematic of the growing entrenchment of the American military here. Two years ago, it was little more than an encampment of tents. Today, it is a sprawling, self-contained city with wooden barracks and command centers, a water treatment plant, makeshift helicopter hangers, a movie theater, gymnasiums and a hospital under construction. 
Mr. Rumsfeld and his contingent, aboard the helicopter protected by two Apache gunships, also dropped into a hilltop outpost just yards from the Macedonia border. During a brief clash in early March, an Army platoon captured the hilltop from Albanian rebels, who had been using a schoolhouse there as a base to fire mortars into Macedonia. 
As he surveyed the outpost, Mr. Rumsfeld, dressed in a dark suit and raincoat, looked like a politician on the stump, shaking hands, posing for photographs and entering a bunker to chat with the troops. "We're keeping track of you every day from Washington," he told them.
In Skopje, Macedonia, the secretary also inspected six unmanned aircraft known as Hunters that are being used for reconnaissance along the Kosovo border. The planes, slow-moving but hard to shoot down because of their small size, carry powerful cameras and infrared sensors that can transmit information almost anywhere in the world. The planes represent the kind of high-tech weaponry Mr. Rumsfeld has said should be at the heart of a new American military.
Mr. Rumsfeld began his day in Kiev where he met with the Ukrainian president and minister of defense to discuss the nation's recent political crisis, its efforts at military and economic reform and missile defense. Washington views Ukraine as an important buffer against Russia but has been alarmed by the recent ouster of its Western-minded prime minister, Viktor Yushchenko, and accusations that its president, Leonid D. Kuchma, ordered the killing last year of a journalist, Georgy Gongadze.
Mr. Rumsfeld said in a news conference after his meetings that he had been "impressed with the very solid commitment" of the Kuchma government to making political reforms and strengthening ties to the West. But he said he also urged Mr. Kuchma to conduct "a thorough and transparent" investigation into the death of Mr. Gongadze.

HEADLINE: A New Flight Plan 

 BODY:
Summertime nears, and the flying is not easy. Passengers experienced record delays in each of the past two summers, partly as a result of the air traffic system's failure to keep up with growing demand for air travel. Despite recent improvements, this summer may be no better, especially if some airlines are crippled by labor troubles. But there are heartening signs that the widespread outrage expressed by millions of inconvenienced fliers, and not a few members of Congress, may have galvanized the Federal Aviation Administration and others into formulating long-term solutions to what is not only an exasperating consumer issue but a serious economic one as well. 
 Today the F.A.A. will outline a comprehensive 10-year air traffic control modernization plan aimed at increasing the system's capacity by a third. Rather than a silver bullet, the plan is a long list of needed piecemeal measures, many of them previously announced, aimed at dealing with four categories of problems: capacity constraints at major airports, congestion en route, bad weather at airports and bad weather en route. Over all, the plan is estimated to cost $11.5 billion. 
 Skeptics will rightly point to the F.A.A.'s poor record of living up to its own ambitious goals in the past. The agency famously wasted several billion dollars in a failed modernization program launched in the 1980's, leading many of its critics to call for the air traffic control system's privatization. The agency, as a result, has preferred in recent years to make changes in a quiet, decentralized fashion. 
But even though many of this plan's components are already in the works, it was important for Jane Garvey, the F.A.A. administrator, to pull them all together into one coherent strategy. The severity of the current situation requires an ambitious response, and a move to privatize the agency would be likely to delay action, if not create further problems. The agency's plan rightly signals a sense of urgency and accountability. Rather than trying to monitor seemingly unrelated actions, the public and the Congress can now hold the agency to its plan's concrete timetable and promised improvements. 
Most of the 10-year plan's items entail building new infrastructure like runways or deploying technology, notably satellite-based navigation, to make better use of existing capacity. An F.A.A. study released in April of the nation's 31 busiest airports, which are used by more than 70 percent of the nearly two million daily passengers, showed that many of them are operating beyond their capacity. Some airlines are adjusting their schedules as a result, particularly at their hubs. 
Over the next decade new runways will be built at half of the busiest airports. Where capacity cannot be expanded, as at La Guardia in New York, the F.A.A. will look to new market-based means of rationing scarce landing slots. New ground radar will also allow for a safer and more efficient use of existing runway capacity. 
Greater flexibility is the operative word when it comes to improving the flow of airborne traffic. New weather-forecasting computers and closer coordination between air traffic control and airlines is expected to enhance the ability of flights to react to weather with shorter notice. Formerly restricted swaths of military and Canadian air space will also provide alternate routes around storms. 
Reliance on satellite navigation systems will be phased in, altering the old control-tower-to-cockpit dynamic. Pilots will be empowered to plot their own, more direct flight paths instead of being confined to existing jetways established by ground-based radar stations. More complete and reliable data in the cockpit also means that spacing between aircraft can be safely reduced. 
The modernization plan's more than 50 separate items add up to a realistic response to the current gridlock in the skies. But to work, it will require unprecedented cooperation between the F.A.A., airport authorities, airlines and contractors.

HEADLINE: Iran's Leader Says U.S., to Improve Ties, Must Ease Policy 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, June 5 

 BODY:
President Mohammad Khatami, who is seeking to be re-elected on Friday, said today that the United States would have to change its policies toward Iran if relations are to improve. 
 "I see no obstacle in relations between the Iranian and American people," he said. "But American politicians ignore the interests of their people and American companies that want to invest in the region and Iran's growing economy. They need to make fundamental changes in these policies." 
 He also said the American economic sanctions on Iran were a major barrier to normalizing relations, adding, "The United States has been the source of much harm to Iran." 
The United States severed relations with Iran after students seized the American Embassy in November 1979, taking 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
After his election in 1997, Mr. Khatami reached out to the United States with a call for "a dialogue of civilization." The Clinton administration relaxed sanctions, and Mr. Khatami made some overtures to Washington, but little progress has been made on improving relations.
At a news conference today, less than 48 hours before Mr. Khatami and his nine rivals wind up the election campaign, Mr. Khatami appeared decisive and in a good mood, contrary to a month ago, when he tearfully announced his candidacy. 
He defended the performance of his government and, without giving specifics, said his government had gone through "a tunnel of crisis" in the last four years.
"But I believe that we have succeeded because these crises and tensions did not lead to turmoil," he said. "And secondly, we never compromised on our pledge with people for the establishment of democracy and the rule of law. What I will not do is surrender to violence and extremism in this country." 
Mr. Khatami won in 1997 with nearly 70 percent of the votes. His supporters hope he can attract a large turnout on Friday as a stamp of approval for the reform movement.
Mr. Khatami is expected to win easily. But because there are a large number of candidates, his margin may be small. 
Ahmad Bourghani, a reformist close to the president, said Mr. Khatami's headquarters had arranged for 100 talks around the country during the campaign. 
Mr. Khatami also sent a message to his supporters today, indicating how a large turnout will matter. "The more votes the president gets, the more confidently he can carry out his plans," he said. "He can perform his duties more from the bottom of his heart."

HEADLINE: Business Travel; 
The day of private supersonic jets may not be far off.

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail:jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
A BIG new Boeing Business Jet costs about $40 million, stripped. Add maybe $5 million more for furnishings and interior finishes and equipment, and you've basically got yourself a Boeing 737, refitted as a fancy private corporate jet.
 The BBJ, as it is known, has more than double the cabin space of its closest luxury competitor, the Gulfstream V series. It carries about 18 passengers, who ride on leather seats and plush sofas. Most models also have a conference room, two bathrooms with showers, and a bedroom with a queen-size bed. 
 Since the plane has a maximum range of about 6,600 miles, that means you can hole up in an airborne hotel room from New York to Cairo. "You can walk into the bedroom, close the door and go to sleep," said Richard T. Santulli, the chief executive of Executive Jet, the leading company in the business of selling fractional shares of corporate jets to corporations. 
So it doesn't get any better than this, does it? Actually, it might -- at least for those who argue persuasively enough that time is money. The day of the supersonic private business jet might well be approaching. 
Now that comfort, range, arguable bottom-line value and airline-free convenience are a given in the business-jet market, "the last major improvement will be breaking that speed barrier, and being able to do it economically," said Lee D. Monson, a vice president for sales at Boeing, who predicts that cost-effective supersonic business jets will become a reality "hopefully within the next 5 to 10 years."
Boeing is now talking with airlines about the design and manufacturing of a prospective new and fast commercial airliner, known as the Sonic Cruiser, that is tentatively being planned to fly just below the speed of sound. "We certainly are not committed as a company yet to go supersonic," Mr. Monson said.
Aircraft systems manufacturers like Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and others are, however, involved in government-sponsored research projects on the feasibility of more widespread supersonic flight. Once technological problems are solved and demand is clear, "we'll be in a position to be able to take advantage of it," Mr. Monson said. 
The two big technological obstacles are noise -- the sonic booms created when aircraft exceed the speed of sound -- and high maintenance costs. The commercial Concorde, grounded since a crash that killed 113 in France last summer, was notorious for high maintenance. Since Concordes mostly flew over the ocean, sonic-boom complaints were not a big factor.
The United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is financing research projects, for both military and civilian use, into developing supersonic engines and airframes that, according to the agency, will fly "over land without adverse sonic-boom consequences."
"The consensus is very definitely, if you can't fly it over land, it isn't going to get built, because nobody's going to buy it," said Bill Dane, a senior aerospace analyst at Forecast International/DMS, an aerospace research firm that predicted "renewed emphasis" on development of supersonic business jets after the grounding of the Concorde. 
Mr. Dane said that aerospace engineers generally believed the sonic-boom noise problem was ready to be solved. "The implication seems to be, yes, if the money's there, we can completely eliminate it, or reduce it at least to the point where nobody's going to complain," he said. 
"If you can do that, you'd have a huge market," said Mr. Santulli, whose company, which was acquired in 1998 by Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, has said it will order a substantial number of supersonic jets immediately if the noise and excessive maintenance problems are solved. 
The price tag for a supersonic business jet is generally estimated to be $80 million to $100 million -- which experts say means that its main market will be in fractional ownership deals.
As to speed, "everybody seems to think it's going to have to be about Mach 1.5," or one and a half times the speed of sound, Mr. Dane said. The Concorde flies at about Mach 2.
Speed is the final frontier in business aviation, said Steven P. Brechter, the chief operating officer of Executive Jet. Billion-dollar deals are done by executives who meet face-to-face and then want to get home fast, he said; for them, "it's not about opulence, it's about time."
Records from the company's NetJets fractional ownership program show that many clients with a share in one type of aircraft, on occasion, require the use of another model, which the company arranges. The company's fleet ranges from seven-passenger Cessna Citations, which are made by Textron's Cessna Aircraft Company, to the top-of-the-line models like Gulfstream V's, manufactured by a unit of General Dynamics, and the new BBJ's. 
Many owners sometimes ask to use another type of plane, he said. But not those who own shares of the Cessna Citation X models, which, flying at Mach 0.92 (about 600 miles an hour), are the fastest business jets currently available.
The eight-passenger Citation X has a relatively tight cabin that is 5.7 feet high and 5.5 feet wide. By comparison, cabins in the fancier 13-passenger Gulfstream V's are 6.2 feet high and 7.3 feet wide. (The BBJ cabin is 7.1 feet high and 11.6 feet wide). 
But customers of the Citation X -- which flies coast to coast about 45 minutes faster than any other business jet -- typically decline to accept a temporary upgrade, even to a Gulfstream V. 
"The people who own the Citation X bought it for the speed," he said. "They dig their heels in for that extra 45 minutes."

HEADLINE: Productivity Declines 1.2%; Its Largest Drop Since 1993 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
The productivity of American workers declined 1.2 percent in the first quarter, the sharpest drop since 1993, as labor costs increased at the fastest rate in a decade, the Labor Department reported yesterday.
 After the boom of the late 1990's, which was fueled by investments in technology to help make productivity more efficient, this measure of the output of American workers was bound to decline, economists said. But the drop in productivity has created a debate over what level of growth is sustainable. 
 "It is the most important question facing the economy for the next five years," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. "It makes a heck of a big difference in how the economy performs over a generation compared to its past performance and compared to other countries." 
Higher labor costs squeezed corporate profit margins in the first quarter. Unit labor costs -- the amount of labor expense to produce goods and services -- rose at seven times the pace of the increase in wages. The amount that workers received, adjusted for increases in consumer prices and other factors, rose at an annual rate of 0.9 percent, the lowest since the end of 1999, even though unit labor costs increased 6.3 percent.
In its preliminary figures, the Labor Department reported that productivity, which had increased annually at an average rate of 2.8 percent since 1995, declined 0.1 percent in the first quarter, the first drop in six years.
After the Commerce Department lowered its estimate of the economy's overall growth, the Labor Department had been expected to lower its productivity figures. Still, the extent of the revision, to a decline of 1.2 percent, surprised economists who had been predicting a drop of 0.8 percent.
The increase in labor costs comes at a time businesses are already struggling with smaller profits because of falling demand and excessive inventories. Higher labor costs are "a lagged response to the increase in headline inflation that took place in 1999 and into 2000," said John Youngdahl, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. 
"We had very tight labor markets throughout that period," Mr. Youngdahl said, "and workers had a lot of leverage. They were able to claw back some of the costs they were experiencing."
In the manufacturing sector, productivity fell 2.1 percent, instead of increasing 0.3 percent as initially reported. Productivity in the manufacturing of durable goods fell 2.4 percent, while productivity in nondurable goods fell 2 percent. Output fell at a sharper rate than hours worked, the Labor Department said.
For all businesses except agriculture, Americans worked 2.2 percent more hours than in the previous quarter, and their output increased 1 percent. In the first quarter of 1993, the last time productivity declined, Americans worked 3.9 percent more hours and their output declined 1.3 percent. At that time, labor costs rose 5.8 percent, compared with the latest quarter's rise of 6.3 percent, the biggest increase since a 6.8 percent jump in the last three months of 1990.
The difference, and the reason some economists say that the drop in productivity is temporary, is that workers' output is still rising. The technological advances that fueled the economic boom have created a new class of highly paid workers, but they have also allowed businesses to quickly respond to shifts in demand and overstocked inventories.
New data emerged yesterday indicating that workers' output has declined since the second quarter began. For the service sector, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its nonmanufacturing index fell to 46.6 in May, from 47.1 in April, showing a significant contraction. Economists had expected the index to rise to 47.8.
And factory orders fell 3 percent, to $336.94 billion in April, the Commerce Department reported. The decline was most pronounced in orders for washing machines, refrigerators and other long-term investments that consumers make when they feel confident and when credit markets are loose. Economists had expected a drop of 2.8 percent.
The Federal Reserve has lowered short-term interest rates five times for a total of 2.5 percentage points this year, and many investors say they believe that Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, and other Fed policy makers will act to lower rates again later this month. That action, combined with the increased spending from the tax cut, could help the economy maintain a productivity growth rate close to 3 percent, some economists said.

HEADLINE: Turner's U.N. Fund Plans World Resource Survey 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 5 

 BODY:
One of the most ambitious projects to assess global environmental damage from the rapid consumption of natural resources was announced today by an unusual coalition of scientists, corporations, foundations and international agencies. 
 Timothy E. Wirth, president of the United Nations Foundation, a sponsor of the project, called it "the first global report card on our environment." The fund, set up in 1997 with a 10-year $1 billion grant from Ted Turner, founder of CNN, has been looking for environmental projects to support. It has already made grants in areas like women's and girls' health. 
 In March, it approved its largest donation, $10 million, for a campaign to save endangered coral reefs. The fund will give $4 million to the effort to give the earth a physical checkup.
Other contributors include the World Resources Institute in Washington, whose president, Jonathan Lash, was instrumental in developing the project; the Global Environment Facility, set up after the Rio de Janeiro summit meeting on the environment in 1992; the David and Lucile Packard Foundation; and the World Bank.
Officials expect the project to cost $21 million, with $17 million already pledged. Up to 1,500 scientists will be asked to volunteer for the cause. Secretary General Kofi Annan, formally introducing the program today, said that it was "designed to bring the world's best science to bear on the present choices we face in managing the global environment."
The project, set up and run by the United Nations Environment Program, will also benefit from 16,000 satellite images donated by NASA. 
Officials expect a final report to be published in 2005, with interim studies released occasionally. 
At a news session today, Mr. Wirth, a former senator from Colorado and a former under secretary of state for global affairs, called the survey the first real assessment on the earth's life-support systems. 
"Why is this important?" he asked. "The very basic fact is that we are living off our ecological capital, and if we continue this approach, we will soon discover that this is a bankrupt way for us to operate. The bulk of our economy is rooted in five biological systems -- crop lands, forests, grasslands, oceans and freshwater ways. When the environment is forced to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 because its resource base has been polluted, degraded, dissipated and irretrievably compromised, then the economy goes down to bankruptcy with it, and so does everything else."
Angela Cropper of Trinidad and Tobago, a development expert who will be a scientific panel co-leader, saw much preliminary evidence. "Coral reefs are dying, the forests are being degraded and disappearing -- these things have to be rehabilitated," she said. "Fish stocks are being significantly depleted."
She said the world would have to learn to regulate and manage dwindling natural resources. 
Mr. Lash of the resources institute added that two-thirds of the agricultural lands were seriously degraded and that the number of people who depended on those lands for food was expanding. To revive that land, water is needed, among other items. 
"Water use is rising twice as fast as population," he said. "Seventy percent of water is used for irrigation, and that suggests a set of trends that simply do not lead to a good outcome."
Calling the report crucial to understanding how to deal with growing human pressures on resources, Mr. Lash said, "If it's successful, in a few years you will have a good statement of the state of the world's health in terms of its capacity to produce the goods and services that support all human well-being and prosperity -- food, clean water, fiber, the materials that make our world possible."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Nasdaq Leads Shares Higher, Despite Economic Reports

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as investors, buoyed by positive news from technology companies, shrugged off several disappointing economic reports.
 Lucent Technologies and Xilinx both issued reassuring financial projections, helping to set off a rally in technology stocks. 
 "The public's back," said Jeffrey Saut, chief market strategist at Raymond James & Associates. "You couldn't get people to pry loose of their cash with a nuclear device back at the end of March and April. With the upside momentum that's been generated here, now they're excited." 
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index climbed 77.73 points, or 3.6 percent, to close at 2,233.66. 
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 114.32 points, or 1 percent, to 11,175.84. And the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 16.46 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,283.57.
Analysts said investors paid little attention to a series of economic indicators released yesterday that confirmed the widely held belief that the American economy remained weak. And the market's activity was only slightly tempered by the expectation of dismal earnings forecasts in the next few weeks, they said.
"The economic news is going to get worse before it gets better, but the market has the opportunity to continue upward," said Francis D. Gannon, a senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management.
Yesterday's technology rally was led by Lucent, one of the day's most actively traded stocks, which gained 49 cents, to $8.49. Henry Schacht, Lucent's chairman and chief executive, told analysts yesterday at a trade show in Atlanta that the company's sales and earnings would improve over the second quarter.
Xilinx surged $4.02, to $45.61, after the company, a maker of specialty semiconductors, said its losses in the second quarter would be within the range it had expected and that order cancellations had slowed.
The news from Lucent and Xilinx spurred buying interest in other technology companies. Shares of Cisco rose $1.81, to $21.54; Microsoft gained $1.82, to $72.60; and Qualcomm was up $1.58, to $63.52. 
Shares of Intel rose $1.23, to $29.73. Other semiconductor stocks also rose, pushing the Philadelphia semiconductor index up 40.92 points, or 6.7 percent, to 647.90.
Computer makers and storage companies displayed strength as well. I.B.M. rose $3.33, to $116.97; EMC was up $2.85, to $34.50; Sanmina gained 99 cents, to $27.41; and Brocade was up $4.24, to $43.49.
Among the nontechnology stocks that pushed the Dow higher was Boeing, which rose 90 cents, to $66.93, after it secured a $4 billion contract with the United States Air Force to upgrade 500 of its C-130 transports.
Johnson & Johnson gained $2.05, to $102.19, after a UBS Warburg analyst, David Lothson, reiterated his strong buy rating for the company. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By Bloomberg News
Bond prices rose yesterday, pushing yields to a one-month low, after evidence of a slowdown in the service industries bolstered expectations for a sixth interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve this year.
"Weakness branching out beyond manufacturing may force the Fed's hand," and that is helping bonds, said Bruce Alston, who manages $1.5 billion at Value Line.
Bonds advanced after the National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of retail, construction and other nonmanufacturing businesses fell last month to its lowest level in four years.
The price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 14/32 , to 98. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.27 percent from 5.32 percent on Monday.
The 30-year bond rose 13/32 , to 96 1/32 . Its yield fell to 5.65 percent from 5.68 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
3 Interpublic Agencies Are Michelin Finalists

BYLINE:  By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
Michelin North America in Greenville, S.C., has narrowed a review for its account, with billings estimated at $30 million to $60 million, to three agencies from six.
 The finalists are three units of the Interpublic Group of Companies: Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich.; Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis; and the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic. 
 The three agencies that were eliminated were Merkley Newman Harty in New York, part of the Omnicom Group; Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide unit of the Bcom3 Group; and the Richards Group in Dallas.
A final decision is expected by early next month.
The Michelin North America account had been at the New York office of DDB Worldwide, part of Omnicom, for 17 years. It was eliminated from the review in April when Michelin, a unit of Compagnie Generale des Etablissements Michelin in France, selected the six agencies as semifinalists.
DDB New York laid off 26 employees out of 450 this week and is eliminating an unspecified number of posts that have been vacant. Marianne Flatley, a spokeswoman for DDB New York, attributed the staff reductions to "a general softening of the economy" rather than the recent loss of several accounts, including Michelin.
Also this week, the DDB office in Chicago laid off 28 employees out of 800. Amy Hoffar, a spokeswoman for DDB Chicago, attributed those layoffs to "the loss of the General Mills and Energizer accounts, reduced spending from a number of clients and the effect of a weakening economy."

HEADLINE: OPEC Maintains Output Levels, With Another Look in July 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: VIENNA, June 5 

 BODY:
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided today to delay an increase in production levels, a move that could push crude oil prices higher in coming weeks if Iraq makes good on a threat to keep its oil off world markets.
 At a meeting at headquarters here, OPEC members agreed to meet again on July 3 to consider increasing output if a reduction by Iraq led to steeper prices. 
In its official statement, OPEC said, "Having reviewed the oil market situation and supply-demand expectations for the forthcoming period, the conference noted that stocks of both crude oil and products are at satisfactory levels."
OPEC is gambling that it can maintain relatively high though stable prices in the near term, as it has done for the last six months. Analysts said that individual countries like Saudi Arabia, the largest producer, would probably fill in for Iraq and informally supply more oil to major markets, like the United States. 
Yet at the same time, the analysts here and oil traders in the United States worried that such substitutions might not be sufficient as Americans enter the peak driving season and demand for gasoline increases.
"If we keep Iraqi oil off the market for a few weeks, it will have an impact," said Thomas P. Bentz, senior energy analyst with BNP Paribas in New York. "Supplies will tighten and prices will rise."
Today, the commodities markets reacted calmly to OPEC's action, which had been expected. In New York, crude oil for July delivery edged up 11 cents, to $28.24 a barrel. In London, Brent crude oil for July settlement rose 42 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $29.68 a barrel. 
On Monday, prices rose as much as 2.9 percent during the session on the news of the Iraqi embargo, then slid back, settling slightly higher, apparently reflecting doubts about Iraq's resolve. Late last year, Baghdad halted exports for several weeks before gradually increasing them again. Iraq exports about 2.5 million barrels a day, or about 3 percent of the world's oil.
Iraq said on Sunday that it would not resume oil exports until the United Nations Security Council backed down on a resolution adopted last week that extended the oil-for-food program by only a month instead of the usual six months. The Council voted for the stopgap extension to allow more time to consider a British-American proposal for a complete overhaul of the sanctions against the Iraqis. London and Washington propose lifting restrictions on civilian imports while cracking down on oil smuggled out to Iraqi neighbors. 
"A lot of traders feel that Iraq is like the little boy who cried wolf," said Phillip J. Flynn, senior market analyst for Alaron, a trading firm in Chicago, "and they think it will come back."
OPEC, by its successful managing of oil prices over the last six months, has gained a degree of credibility on world oil markets that it had lacked. Since January, the 10-member group has twice reduced production, totaling 2.5 million barrels a day, as the global economy slowed and oil demand with it. 
Supply and demand, analysts said, have so far found a balance. Oil prices have fluctuated between $25 and $29 a barrel, raining revenue into the economies of the OPEC nations.
Yet even at those prices, supplies of crude oil have risen. After markets closed today, the American Petroleum Institute reported that United States inventories of crude oil had risen 3.4 million barrels, to 325.3 million, from 321.9 million barrels a week ago. Gasoline supplies rose more than 3.1 million barrels, to 209.3 million. That compares with 203.1 million barrels this time a year ago.
"Over the last five months, OPEC and especially the Saudis, have kept prices high yet stable," said Roger Diwan, managing director of the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consultancy. "They have convinced the market of their ability." 
OPEC's unwillingness to act stems from a fear of touching off a sharp fall in oil prices. OPEC countries maintain that there is sufficient crude oil in the United States and that high gasoline prices are a function of crimped domestic refining capacity. They also worry about introducing more oil onto the market as the world economy weakens. 
Iraq's decision to halt oil shipments adds uncertainty to OPEC's calculations. Though Iraq belongs to OPEC, its export quotas are set by the United Nations under the sanctions set up after the Persian Gulf war ended in 1991, and the Iraqis have no vote in OPEC decisions. The revenue Iraq receives from oil exports is monitored by the U.N. to ensure that it is not used to finance Saddam Hussein's military aims -- an effort many say has failed.
"Iraq sees these 'smart sanctions' as sanctions that will never be lifted," said Vera de Ladoucette, director of Middle East research for Cambridge Energy Research Associates. "They don't see it as an improvement of their situation."
With OPEC holding to its current quotas and Saudi Arabia expected to make up for some of the lost Iraqi oil, specialists pondered the total effect.
"There are two clear indications that the Saudis will supply more oil to the market," said Edward L. Morse, executive adviser at the Hess Energy Trading Company. "First, last December, when the Iraqis did this, the Saudis exceeded their export quota by a significant amount. And secondly, they said to the U.S. government and the press they would do it."
The question is whether the additional Saudi output, or even a possible OPEC increase in July, would be enough to meet summer demand in the United States. It takes about 45 days for oil from the Persian Gulf to reach the United States. By the time a July increase reached American drivers, the supplies of crude oil and gasoline already here might easily have thinned, with retail prices, already increased, rising further. 
And if OPEC does add supplies, will it be able to keep up a high level of production if Iraq remains sidelined? Before the export cuts this year, most OPEC members were producing near capacity.
Much may depend on how long Iraq can go without oil revenue. Analysts estimate that it has about $5 billion in cash from the oil-for-food program it can use.
"Smart sanctions are a cornerstone of Colin Powell's Mideast policy," said Walid Khadduri, editor in chief of the Middle East Economic Survey, "and for Saddam Hussein, the old sanctions were a system he had successfully eroded for years. The stakes are too high for both sides to back down easily. How long can Iraq go without oil? From the war in 1990 to the start of oil for food, it went for six years."

HEADLINE: Transportation Chief Predicts Rejection of Airline Merger 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5 

 BODY:
The secretary of transportation said today that the proposed merger of United Airlines and US Airways would not be approved. 
 But both airlines disagreed with the assessment, and the Justice Department, which has final authority to approve or block the merger, said it was still evaluating the proposal. 
 The transportation secretary, Norman Y. Mineta, speaking to reporters at a luncheon at his office, said that he expected additional merger proposals "now that the United-US Airways proposal hasn't gone through." Asked whether he meant that it would never be approved, he said, "If I were to read the tea leaves as they are right now, yes." 
Mr. Mineta said his department had no role in the decision other than to advise the Justice Department, which was still conducting an antitrust review. A spokeswoman there, Gina Talamona, said this afternoon that the evaluation was continuing. 
With the comments, Mr. Mineta became the highest-ranking administration official to predict the outcome of the proposal.
He contrasted the United-US Airways merger application with the recently approved acquisition of Trans World Airlines by American Airlines.
"In that case, it was the ailing-carrier doctrine that allowed American Airlines to pick up T.W.A.," he said, adding that the combination gave American nearly a quarter of the passenger market. 
"We don't have a failing-carrier doctrine to rely on in this United Airlines-US Airways situation," he said.
He said that other carriers -- United, Delta, Northwest and Continental -- each with 11 percent to 17 percent of the market, would not "be able to sit out there with these kind of percentages trying to deal with a T.W.A.-American" with such a large market share. 
"Somewhere I think you're going to still find some consolidation going on," he said. "Who and where and in what form, I don't have the slightest idea."
At United, Susana Leyva, a spokeswoman, said, "We're still vigorously pursuing this acquisition." 
"The final regulatory review rests with the Department of Justice," Ms. Leyva said, adding that a number of elected officials of both parties have expressed their support.
United's senior vice president for finance, Jake Brace, said in April that no decision was expected before the end of June.
At US Airways, Lawrence M. Nagin, executive vice president and general counsel, said, "We are continuing to work constructively with the Department of Justice on the merger approval process."
Mr. Mineta also said today that he was concerned about the financial situation at Amtrak, and that the railroad might have to give up on a national rail system.
He compared Amtrak's rail service to margarine and said the railroad was trying to spread itself over the entire country.
"It may be," Mr. Mineta said, "that we're going to have to take a look at the Amtrak operations as Eastern Seaboard, Western Seaboard and maybe some kind of hub out of Chicago up to the Twin Cities, up to Detroit and down to New Orleans, and look at selected routes rather than trying to blanket the country with service that is not financially viable." 
He said he expected to be appointed soon by President Bush to the railroad's board.
But a spokesman for Amtrak, William Schulz, said in a telephone interview that the railroad's strategy since last year had been to add service "where it made economic sense."
The railroad recently announced plans for a new passenger train on Florida's east coast, Mr. Schulz said. "We believe there are other opportunities to expand service that make financial sense."
Congress has told the railroad to expect an end to operating subsidies by 2003. Mr. Schulz said that Amtrak was on its way to doing that, but Mr. Mineta said he was not sure and was concerned about a plan by the railroad to mortgage part of Pennsylvania Station in New York, which it owns, for $300 million. Mr. Schulz said Amtrak wanted the money to make up for revenue lost by the late introduction of its Acela service in the Northeast corridor.

The Bush administration's efforts to limit steel imports won praise yesterday from industry executives, who said the action was long overdue, while analysts predicted the actions could provide relief to an industry suffering from a wave of bankruptcies and minimal profitability.
 "It's a significant move," said Aldo Mazzaferro, an industry analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The administration has taken a major step to protect the industry. It will allow the steel industry to fully participate in any economic recovery." 
 For the last decade, the domestic steel industry has been awash in bad news. The Asian economic crisis of the late 1990's pushed down global steel prices, which have yet to recover. And while imports account for less of the domestic steel market than they did at the peak of the Asian crisis -- about 27 percent now, down from 30 percent -- steel prices have been so low that steelmakers complain that they are having a hard time making a profit, or even staying in business. 
Since late 1997, 18 steel companies in the United States have filed for bankruptcy, with five of those shutting down operations entirely. 
It is against this backdrop that the Bush Administration's action was soundly praised by industry executives. James G. Bradley, president of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation, termed the Bush decision "a major victory.
"It is an important message that the United States will not allow its steel industry to be destroyed by illegal steel imports," said Mr. Bradley, whose company is operating under bankruptcy protection. Thomas J. Usher, chairman of the U.S. Steel Corporation, said the action "sends a message to our trading partners that the United States will no longer be a dumping ground for the world's excess steel." 
Still, despite the industry's difficulties, domestic steel makers have seen their stocks outperform the overall stock market this year, even though they are still well below their historic highs. A reduction in domestic steelmaking capacity, as more steel mills are shuttered and recent decreases in interest rates help steel users finance purchases, have attracted investors' interest. And investors interested in undervalued stocks are looking for bargains in the steel industry. 
USX-U.S. Steel Corporation shares have risen 22 percent this year. Shares of Bethlehem Steel have gone up 122 percent, and shares of the Nucor Corporation have risen 40 percent. News of the president's action pushed the Standard & Poor's steel index up 6.7 percent yesterday to 49.09. 
Some analysts said the Bush action might simply accelerate the turn in the industry's fortunes. "I think we were ready to have good times, with or without the government," said John Tumazos, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. "The protectionist walls might go up. But the steel market would recover whatever the government does or doesn't do."
Peter F. Marcus, an analyst with World Steel Dynamics, a research firm, said the rise in steel industry stocks that preceded the Bush decision was a sign that "investors are guessing that the worst is over.
"It had been evident that the government was willing to seriously consider the plight of a number of steel companies," said Mr. Marcus. "And the drop in interest rates means that, at some point, the economy will get moving again. And when the government of a country says publicly that it wishes this industry were doing better, that's good for that industry."
In fact, if all goes well, the picture for steel makers could change greatly. "If there is a strong economic recovery," said Mr. Mazzaferro of Goldman, "and import quotas are in place, you have a steel shortage."

HEADLINE: Energy Crisis in Brazil Is Bringing Dimmer Lights and Altered Lives 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 5 

 BODY:
At night, the lights on streets and beaches and in parks and tunnels are dimmed. Air-conditioners in the president's office have been turned off; nighttime sports events and concerts have been canceled. Government employees may soon be forced to shift to a six-hour work day, and private companies are talking of moving production abroad for the duration of the emergency.
 In response to what increasingly resembles a California-style energy crisis writ large, on Friday Brazil began at least six months of obligatory electricity rationing. 
 Three-quarters of the 170 million Brazilians have been told that they must immediately cut consumption by 20 percent or face rolling blackouts and unscheduled power interruptions, which would surely cripple the economy here, in Latin America's most populous nation. 
The government says the measures are needed because the country is in the throes of its worst drought in decades. With one of the most extensive river networks in the world, Brazil, which is larger than the continental United States, obtains more than 90 percent of its electricity from dams and has not invested extensively in alternatives.
Few ordinary Brazilians had any inkling of the seriousness of the crisis until the government announced the conservation measures in mid-May, sparing only the Amazon districts and the far south. But as the harsh reality of the situation sinks in, the initial shock and anger are giving way to a grim realization that nearly every aspect of life will be curtailed.
"We have been raised to think that ours is a land of abundance and riches, where nothing is ever lacking," said Lucina Trilho, a store clerk. "So yes, that may have led us to be wasteful. And yes, we may need to be re-educated. But it is going to be difficult, even frightening, to have to make all these adjustments."
Under the government plan, households that fail to meet conservation targets are to have their power supply cut for up to six days. Small consumers who manage to save more than 20 percent, on the other hand, will receive cash bonuses, while companies that cut consumption by more than that amount will be allowed to sell their extra savings to others.
Although Brazilians are used to government pronouncements that are quickly reversed or undermined, this time they are clearly taking the threats seriously: consumption fell by 10 percent even before the measures went into effect. 
"I've even disconnected the lights illuminating the little statue of the Virgin Mary in my living room," said Aurora Nascimento Fonseca, a jittery 81-year-old who lives on a small pension.
All across the country, in fact, the rationing plan and the penalties that go with it have set off a mad scramble to find ways to save electricity and money. Just try, for example, to buy a fluorescent bulb, flashlight, generator, gas-powered lantern, batteries or even candles.
"The demand for fluorescent lighting has shot up 1,000 percent in the last couple of weeks," said Eulalia Cardoso, a weary saleswoman at a hardware store where customers were lined up at the door. "We can't keep up with the requests, and neither can our suppliers. As soon as a new stock comes in, it immediately sells out."
Sales of electrical appliances, in contrast, have plummeted. As Miriam Leitao, a columnist for the daily O Globo, noted, items "formerly seen as symbols of status and comfort in residences are now being regarded with alarm and disconnected from their sockets."
In at least one sense, the timing of the government measures is propitious: with the Southern Hemisphere winter approaching, use of air-conditioners and fans is minimal. 
But most Brazilian households with power use electricity, not gas, to heat shower and bath water, which means millions must gird themselves for months of cold washes.
"At home, we're doing that and everything else we can to cut back on our electricity consumption," said Alfredo Rebello, a salesman whose monthly bill averages about $40. "We're watching television without lights on, doubling up the loads of laundry and disconnecting the coffee maker and microwave oven except when we have to use them."
Things are not much different at the office and residence of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Brasilia. 
"We're in the dark at the palace," the president said in a newspaper interview late last month. "We've turned off the outside illumination, and I've ordered all the interior lighting turned down, the refrigerators disconnected and the heat to the swimming pool turned off."
Here in Rio, a city of leisure-loving night owls, the municipal government has said the spotlights trained on Rio's most famous landmark, the statue of Christ atop Corcovado Mountain, will continue to shine. 
But outdoor street lighting has been cut by one-third, and nearly every nighttime activity in major cities is likely to be affected.
Gasoline stations across the country, for example, plan to shut from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which probably means fewer taxis and the loss of jobs for night-shift station attendants. Professional soccer games, concerts and other entertainments have been banned, but the level of protest has been less than expected because many people say they are afraid to go out into the darkened streets.
"The level of crime is already terrifying, so imagine how it is going to be with the streets darkened," said Maria Aparecida Guimaraes Gusmao, a 35-year-old homemaker. "I'm sure that the criminals are going to take advantage of these measures and that the ordinary citizen is going to remain at home, sitting in the dark."
The police plan more nighttime patrols, but the situation of other essential public services is less clear: barely half of Brazil's hospitals have generators, for instance, and private schools say they will have to struggle to cut consumption.
The rationing plan was first announced May 18. But the government's Energy Crisis Coordinating Committee continues to tinker with the measures, giving the impression that it is not in control of events and adding to the sense of confusion, frustration and uncertainty.
No sooner had the rationing been announced than lawyers said they planned to challenge it as unconstitutional. After a top energy official criticized judges "who must live on Mars," the government first issued a decree saying rationing takes precedence over the consumer protection code, which was to be the basis of the court case, but then backed down when a judge ruled otherwise.
Facing a long and costly legal battle, President Cardoso announced Monday that he was modifying a system of surcharges that had been a crucial part of the rationing effort. Even so, the public is irate.
"None of this would even be happening if the people in Brasilia had been doing their jobs properly all along," said Armando Tavares Araujo, an engineer. "I'm absolutely disgusted, indignant at the fact that we, the Brazilian people, are going to be made to suffer because for nearly 20 years the government hasn't planned ahead and kept up with demand."
Initially, the government had also said that if Brazilians met the conservation targets, that would be sufficient to avoid rolling blackouts. Now, though, officials are warning that it may become necessary to order the nation to adopt a four-day work week, giving employees Mondays off until the end of the year.
"All that is lacking is an official declaration that the country is in a state of emergency," Alcides Tapias, the minister of development, industry and commerce, said late last month in Sao Paulo, the business capital. "But in fact, that is the situation."
Brazil's economy, the eighth largest, grew a robust 4.4 percent last year, and initial forecasts were for a similar performance this year. But now, to the alarm of workers worried about their paychecks, those predictions are being scaled back by as much as half, raising fears of recession, inflation and the loss of foreign investment.
"Look, we're Brazilians, so we have already shown that can put up with just about anything," said Abrahao Miguel dos Reis Motta, a 29-year-old electrician. "But my big fear is that a lot of people are going to lose their jobs as companies cut back production, that this is not a temporary situation but the start of something that will only get worse and last for a long, long time."

HEADLINE: Diamonds Aren't Forever; 
After Years of Chasing the Next Koufax, Scouts Are Out

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
The drizzle fell steadily, the kind of weather that makes an old man ache. The New Jersey air stank of industrial solvents. It was beautiful. It was East Coast baseball.
 A group of gray men stood behind the backstop. They were major-league scouts of amateur talent, old-timers who when they meet a young ballplayer have the curious habit of examining his knuckles and inspecting the pads of his fingers. 
 They had come to this industrial patch near the turnpike to see the 17-year-old pitcher from St. Peter's Prep, Pete Duda, a right-hander who threw hard and had plenty of room in his chest to grow. Four old men: Eddie Ford; John Hagemann; Gil Bassetti, who works for the Baltimore Orioles; and a Catholic priest known in New Jersey more for his work behind the plate than in the pulpit. The four began a melancholic discourse about the waning life of a generation of meat-and-potato scouts in the Northeast. 
To hear the old-timers, they are an endangered species, for a variety of reasons. Bitterness shapes their theories, but so does cold reality, like the fact that more and more ballplayers are coming from foreign countries.
Some of the scouts think the front offices of major-league baseball teams are now filled with Ivy League bean counters more interested in the bottom line than in the box score. In this age of $250 million contracts, the relatively modest money scouts receive -- usually about $50,000 a year -- still gets plenty of belt-tightening attention.
New York is considered the densest, toughest, most difficult territory in the country to scout for amateur talent. The high school season is short, about six weeks. It is cold and dark and soggy, unlike Florida or California, where kids play year round on beautifully groomed fields rather than the mud lots and rock piles of the East Coast.
Some big-league stars have come out of the region: John Franco, Manny Ramirez, Jeff Bagwell, Mo Vaughn. But, weighing resources, baseball executives think they are more likely to find the new superstar in the Dominican Republic than in Danbury, Conn. So the old Northeastern scouts find themselves expendable or spread increasingly thin.
"Resources are moving south to the Caribbean, Venezuela and now the Pacific Rim," said Al Goldis, assistant to the general manager of the Cincinnati Reds, himself a former scout. He said clubs today tended to go with younger scouts who, armed with computers, can cover more ground. "The New York area has become less important in the scheme of things. The thinking is: give these young guys a straw hat, a stopwatch and a radar gun and send them on their way."
Mr. Hagemann, 63, spent the last 17 years combing the backwoods and the blacktop of the region for the Atlanta baseball club -- a Brave in Yankee country. Then in March, the Atlanta Braves announced the dismissal of 10 scouts and minor-league personnel, and Mr. Hagemann, well respected and well paid, was gone.
"I'm a pretty sophisticated man," Mr. Hagemann said. "I know what's happening with corporate America, but I honestly believed baseball was beyond that. I was wrong big time."
The decision came from New York. The Atlanta Braves became part of the AOL Time Warner conglomerate in January when America Online merged with Time Warner. Since the merger, the company has eliminated nearly 2,500 jobs. One of those on the list of the eliminated was Mr. Hagemann, who was instrumental in the trade for John Smoltz, a skinny 19-year-old minor-league pitcher in the Detroit Tigers' farm system. Mr. Smoltz went on to become the National League Cy Young Award winner for the Braves in 1996.
According to Mr. Hagemann, he was done in by dot-com guys.
Costs did appear to play a role.
"It was a simple monetary decision," said one Braves official who exchanged his frankness for confidentiality. "Sad but true. He cost too much."
"Ah, John, you deserved it," Mr. Ford managed to say through the whole pouch of chewing tobacco wadded in his mouth. "The question is: what took so long to fire you? We've been carrying you for years."
It was a joke, but Mr. Hagemann grimaced as though he were wearing a pair of ill-fitting shoes. "Yeah," he said. "I went from the penthouse to the outhouse before the first pitch of spring training was thrown."
Mr. Bassetti laughed, sipped his coffee and nodded. The same thing happened to him a few years ago. The Los Angeles Dodgers released him after 25 years. "Whole damn game has changed," he said.
Baseball scouts do not make the Hall of Fame. When average fans talk about the greatest of all time, they do not speak the names of Tony Lucadello, who in 50 years of scouting signed 50 big leaguers to amateur contracts before putting a revolver in his mouth in 1989 on a high school ball field in his hometown, Fostoria, Ohio; Hugh Alexander, known as Uncle Hughie, who had no left hand, couldn't pitch or hit, but knew promise when he saw it; or Ralph DiLullo, who always dreamed of signing a Hall of Famer and once almost did. But the Chicago Cubs were too cheap to sign a kid named Sandy Koufax.
The scout of amateur baseball talent, like John Hagemann, toils away in obscurity, gives his life over to the game. He crosses the country, combs the run-down ball fields, the streets and Little Leagues. He puts a million miles on his car, watches thousands of kids play the game, exists on buckets of fried chicken, sleeps in cheap motels and drinks plenty of bad coffee. His wife often eats dinner alone.
Not a single professional game could be played without the amateur scout. He is among the most knowledgeable people about baseball, the one responsible for finding the talent to put on the field.
The first whispers of such talent come from the "bird dogs," the local men like Mr. Ford who let the regional scouts know about the talented boys from the neighborhood. 
"The modern-day scout, he don't know nothing," said Mr. Ford, who used to scout for the Cubs. 
"They don't chew tobacco," he said. "They don't see six or seven games a day. They never played the game, and they couldn't tell a baseball from a watermelon." 
For these guys, the days are gone of scouting from behind the tree or the telephone pole or from the playground out in left field. The diamond in the rough, the farm boy or the swamp rat, is rarely found anymore. These days, every scout in the area knows about the big talent. Guys like Manny Ramirez, the Boston Red Sox slugger from Washington Heights, are heavily scouted and are as easy to find as a turkey in a supermarket.
It is the boys out of nowhere, kids like Rich Aurilia, the San Francisco Giants shortstop who leads the National League in hitting and who went to Xaverian High School in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, who are the true and increasingly rare finds. But who found him? In the scouting world, claims become matters of false credit, lies and pettiness.
"Since a guy gets drafted by a club before he gets signed to a contract, it's hard to know who was the first to spot him," Mr. Hagemann said. "But everybody now wants the credit, because everyone is trying to climb the scouting ladder into the front office. It didn't used to be like that. Guys wanted to be in the field, because they loved the game."
The young guys are little more than data collectors, the old guys say, their objectivity perhaps twisted by recent events. They say the young guys have no feel for the game. The radar gun can tell you the speed of the ball, but it never got a batter out. It doesn't tell you about a kid's aptitude. His head. His body potential. Scouts run in packs now. They share information. It didn't used to be that way, the old guys say.
Mr. Hagemann is unemployed, but still, he can't keep himself from these muddy games. Baseball is what he knows. He was a pitcher for the New York Giants AA farm team in the mid-50's, just a couple of dozen men away from Leo Durocher's bullpen. The game was there for him when his first wife died of cancer.
"Fifty years of baseball doesn't disappear with a pink slip," he said, his skin still tan from spring training in Florida, an Atlanta Braves World Series ring on his right hand.
"I don't like how they're treating the older guys," Mr. Hagemann said. "The front-office people aren't true baseball men like they were years ago. But the game will do all right. Baseball is bigger than any of us."
Mr. Ford smacked his pal on the back and spit out a puddle of tobacco juice.

HEADLINE: Dutch Giant Buys Control of Mexican Insurer 

BYLINE:  By GRAHAM GORI 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 5 

 BODY:
Control of Mexico's largest insurer, Seguros Comercial America, will pass from a Mexican entrepreneur, Alfonso Romo, to the Dutch banking and insurance giant ING in a deal announced today.
 Mr. 
Romo, whose holding company is struggling with growing debts, will sell his 45 percent stake in the company to ING for $791 million. 
 ING, which bought 42 percent of the insurer last year for $809 million, said yesterday that it planned a tender offer for the other 13 percent of the company's shares, which are traded publicly. 
ING has expressed interested in strengthening its presence in Mexico, which is a relatively underexploited market, and elsewhere in North America. It recently bought 49 percent of Seguros Bital, another Mexican insurer. 
Similarly, over the last four years, New York Life acquired Seguros Monterrey-Aetna, GMAC acquired ABA Seguros, Kemper Insurance took over Seguros La Territorial, and a German insurer, Gerling, acquired Comesec. 
"This is a reflection of the tremendous growth prospect of Mexico's insurance industry," Francois Facon, a Latin American insurance analyst at J. P. Morgan Chase, said. He said the insurance business represents a little less than 2 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product; in the United States the figure is closer to 9 percent. 
The decline of Mr. Romo's fortunes is evident in his sale of the stake when others see so much promise in the business. In the last decade, Mr. Romo, whose business portfolio once ranged widely, has been concentrating on aggressively building up Seminis Inc., his biotechnology venture, now one of the world's largest breeders of genetically modified crop seeds. But the costs of the expansion program and the weak market for seeds have left his holding company, Savia, $1.4 billion in debt.

 For most of the past half-century, Democrats were dominant. They controlled the House for 40 years, starting in 1955, and the Senate for but six of those years. During much of that time they held roughly three-fifths of all the state legislative seats in the country. More recently, however, their product hasn't sold so well. 
 Now, thanks to the entrepreneurship of Senator James Jeffords, the product is on conspicuous display again -- at the Senate location. How will it sell? To answer that question, it's important to understand why the old version did so well in the first place. It's important, most of all, to understand what the product was.
The commodity that the Democratic Party sold successfully, until the debacle of 1994, wasn't an ideology or a platform. It was a collection of candidates who held on to power through a full quarter-century even as their ideas were viewed with suspicion by a majority of the electorate and their standard-bearers were at a distinct disadvantage in the more visible universe of presidential campaigns. 
Presidential politics is unlike the rest of politics. Outside the presidential fishbowl, talent and enterprise mean far more than public opinion or ideology. The results depend on thousands of individual candidates who must want the jobs badly enough to fight for them. This is the way Democrats won, year in and year out -- by producing a generation of candidates who could outtalk, outthink and outwork their Republican opposition.
It was the generation of Bill Clinton, of Al Gore, of Tom Daschle, and of officeholders at all levels of government who fit their profile: born in the early baby-boom years; educated in the 1960's and early 1970's; introduced to politics at the height of national ferment over Vietnam, civil rights and the environment. Consistently liberal on all these issues, they were also skillful and industrious enough to win whether the voters agreed with them or not. This may not be America's greatest generation of statesmen, but in terms of sheer political skill, we have rarely seen its equal. 
Take, for instance, Mr. Daschle of South Dakota, the new Senate majority leader. He graduated from college in 1969, spent three years in the Air Force and returned home disillusioned with the Vietnam War. He worked for an antiwar senator, returned home to plan his own Congressional campaign, rang 40,000 doorbells and took the general election by 139 votes. Once in office, he was tireless and unbeatable. Politics was his career and his life. Everyone who challenged him looked like an amateur.
Republicans, meanwhile, in a party suspicious of government, had difficulty attracting their brightest young people to public careers that shut out private employment for years at a time. The Republican Party produced a certain amount of careerist talent in this generation -- there was, after all, Newt Gingrich -- but not enough to compete for power effectively on all the fronts that the system required. Republicans had moments when the talent turned out -- as in 1980, when young conservatives all over the country were struck by Reagan tax-cut enthusiasm -- but the moments didn't last. Many of these candidates were back in private life within a few years, usually by their own preference. They tended to view running for office as a necessary evil, not a lifetime occupation.
Then came 1994, and the familiar Democratic world came apart. Democrats lost Congress; they lost 10 governorships; they lost control of legislative chambers all over the country. Millions of words have been written about the 1994 election and its consequences, and yet none of the standard explanations -- the Clinton health care fiasco, the congressional bank scandals, the revolt of the "angry white male" -- is entirely convincing.
There is, however, another explanation for what happened. The Democratic Party's superiority in talent, energy and commitment finally gave out. The liberal baby boom cohort was no longer entering politics, and the generation taking its place lacked any of the critical enthusiasm or motivation. There was no Vietnam, no civil rights movement, no perceived environmental crisis. There was no longer much sense of possibility about government in general -- little conviction that government could be the instrument for solving the hardest social and economic problems of the time.
And so, given a push from some short-term public issues and frustrations, the whole edifice collapsed. The Republicans didn't exactly seize power in 1994, even though it may have looked that way. The Democrats relinquished it. It wasn't so much that young conservatives had suddenly developed a craving for politics; it was that liberals had lost theirs.
This theory, if right, suggests what the Democratic Party needs to do as it gets another, albeit limited, opportunity: persuade bright young people that there are issues worthy of the sacrifices a political career entails.
Easier said than done. There are no Vietnams or civil rights dramas to attract youthful enthusiasm. But there are other things. The rise of the global economy and the growing dominance of impersonal market forces over everyday life -- from health care to telecommunications -- are creating new issues everywhere in the political system. Dealing with these issues will be a messy job, but somebody will have to do it -- in fact, thousands of people. The struggle to attract them is the one Democrats must win to reclaim their role as the party of government in the 21st century.

HEADLINE: Wattage Where It's Needed 

BYLINE:  By Roger Anderson; Roger Anderson is director of the Energy Research Center at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.

 BODY:
President Bush's energy plan, to its credit, takes on in a coherent way all of the supply and demand elements that make up the nation's energy system, something not attempted since the Carter administration. And as the long view demands, the plan calls for a national system of power transmission -- a national electricity grid. Our increasing use of computers, requiring ever more electricity, makes this grid an absolute necessity.
 Historically, demand for electricity jumped after each of three technological breakthroughs: lights and motors in the early 1900's, air conditioning in the 1950's, and the rise of personal computers and the Internet in the 1980's and 1990's. Many Americans are unaware of this last enormous surge in electricity use, and the current experience in California suggests we are not ready to meet what is sure to be continuing growth in demand. But a country with an information-based economy cannot afford unreliable supplies of electricity. 
 More than $50 billion in new transmission lines alone will be required to connect the country's regional transmission lines into an integrated whole, and computerized controls will have to be very sophisticated. A glaring omission in the Bush plan is its failure to supply financing to develop these computer systems.
There are nine separate and unconnected power grids in the United States today. Excess electricity from one region cannot be easily transported to satisfy shortages in another. Because the Bush plan to connect the grids involves taking land by eminent domain, some will find it scary, just as the interstate highway system must have been for some when it was proposed. And the regions with the most stable electric supply may not readily see what they have to gain.
But the national grid is a necessity if we are to solve the problem of local shortages. We have plenty of generation capacity in North America, but with energy-hungry computer equipment concentrated more in some regions than in others, local shortages are likely to increase. California's difficulties could spread to other parts of the country. New York's electricity industry, for example, has striking similarities to California's. Both states have been slow to build new power plants and were caught off guard in the last year as demand jumped. Both depend heavily on natural gas to run their generators, leaving them vulnerable to soaring gas prices. Both have deregulated their electricity markets so they no longer control the price of power.
The energy problem has sneaked up on us because the personal computer that is attached to the Internet uses most of its power in ways not seen by the consumer -- through servers, routers and other trafficking infrastructure located many miles away from the consumer in gigantic, air-conditioned warehouses called server farms. The facts about some of this little noticed energy use are startling.
In 1995 there were 20,000 servers in the world. Today there are six million. Just one new server farm, proposed for the economic development zone of the South Bronx, will draw more than twice as much power as the entire World Trade Center complex. Forty-six such developments proposed for New York and Westchester County over the next four years will increase the total electricity demand on Con Edison by 4 percent. 
These servers are connected to about 200 million personal computers around the world. And although the power efficiency of the PC continues to improve with each new generation, the information trafficking volume is increasing even more dramatically. Wireless technology, too, is contributing to the nation's electricity demand. According to one study, a Web-enabled Palm Pilot uses as much electricity as a heavy-duty refrigerator.
The Bush plan's great failure is its lack of financing for research and development for a national grid. A command-and-control system of great scope and reliability will be required to distribute electricity quickly and efficiently. Developing it makes updating our antiquated air traffic control system look like child's play.
It is not a matter of simply joining the systems that run the nine regional grids. As the Pentagon found out in trying to integrate computer systems for control across a whole theater, and NASA learned while putting together smaller systems for the International Space Station, predictability declines as the integration tasks become larger and larger. Breakdowns will occur that have not been foreseen from the experience with the smaller grids.
There is no holding pattern in the electric power grid. It will take only six one-hundredths of a second for power generated in Washington State to be consumed by that server farm in the South Bronx. The computerized control for this kind of system is unlike anything that currently exists in the commercial world.
As California's leaders can attest, those in control will pay a political price if demand gets ahead of supply. Failing to help develop the national power grid would be a serious misstep for the Bush administration.

HEADLINE: Bush Moves Against Steel Imports; Trade Tensions Are Likely to Rise 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5 

 BODY:
President Bush took the first steps today toward imposing broad restrictions on imported steel, handing a victory to American steel companies and unions that have long urged the government to grant relief from foreign competition.
 The president's action, which initiates a challenge to imports and could result in higher tariffs on foreign-made steel within months, goes beyond any protections that the Clinton administration offered the industry and is certain to raise tensions with trading partners. 
 Administration officials said the decision came after a detailed study of the steel industry's woes. They described the once mighty steel sector -- with only a fifth as many workers as in 1980 -- as hobbled by an unending glut of imports from South Korea, Taiwan, China, Brazil, Germany, Russia, Ukraine and many other nations that often produce steel for less than their American competitors.
"I've told the world we're going to have an active, internationalist foreign policy with U.S. interests at its heart," Mr. Bush said this afternoon during a meeting with senators. "And it's in our nation's interest that if there are unfair trade practices in the steel industry we address them in a very aggressive way, which this administration will do." 
Mr. Bush's commitment to pursue a trade case before the International Trade Commission, an independent United States agency that adjudicates trade disputes, does not guarantee the industry that it will be granted relief. The trade commission must decide whether steel producers have suffered injury because of a sudden import surge. Only then would Mr. Bush have leeway to impose remedies.
Mr. Bush narrowly won West Virginia and narrowly missed winning Pennsylvania, two leading steel producing states, in last year's presidential election. Vice President Dick Cheney promised in an election-eve speech in West Virginia to do more for the industry than President Clinton had done.
Today's decision was hailed by the industry and its Congressional supporters because it put President Bush on the record as favoring help for the troubled industry, increasing the chances that steel producers will eventually get protection.
"This is what we begged for from the last administration," said Representative Bob Ney, an Ohio Republican whose district is home to steel producers.
While Mr. Bush's action could pay off politically, it means that his first major trade initiative is protectionist, intended to offer relief to an industry that is perennially seeking government aid.
Just last month, the president sounded more like a free-trade evangelist. He promoted opening the door wider to trade from less-developed nations as the best way to alleviate poverty and advance democracy.
"When we negotiate for open markets we are providing new hope for the world's poor," he said during a speech at the Council of the Americas. "And when we promote open trade we are promoting political freedom."
The rare step of beginning a case before the commission may help Mr. Bush gain support in Congress for his broader trade agenda. He wants Congress to give him the authority to negotiate trade agreements that lawmakers would then have to approve on a simple up-or-down vote, forgoing the right to tinker with details. Without that authority, the president's ambitions of leading a new round of global trade negotiations would be difficult to realize.
Mr. Bush announced the step before the administration had completed the details of its case, including which steel products would be included in what is known as a Section 201 investigation under the 1974 Trade Act. Administration officials said privately that the timing was dictated by the fact that Democrats took control of the Senate this week.
Led by Senator Jay Rockefeller, a Democrat of West Virginia , Democratic leaders had made clear that they would use their control of the Senate -- the first time they have controlled the body since 1994 -- to order the trade commission into action if the administration did not take the step first.
Administration officials said today that the matter had been under study for several months by the Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill; the commerce secretary, Donald L. Evans; and Robert Zoellick, the United States trade representative. They found that the industry suffered heavily in 1998, when the currencies of emerging-market nations collapsed one after the other and steel imports spiked to new highs, the officials said. Though imports have since receded, the industry's finances have not recovered, they argued.
"We found that the industry faces troubles in nearly every category," an administration official said of its internal examination of the matter. As a result, he said, the trade commission will probably be asked to consider the potential impact of foreign competition across the entire steel industry.
The steel industry pushed the Clinton administration to take a similar action right up to its final days in office. The Clinton White House had in the past imposed import restrictions on a few steel products and taken other steps to help the industry. But administration officials decided not to open a trade case, in part because they were wary of ending their tenure, which had produced several notable trade-opening agreements, with a protectionist gesture. Former Clinton administration officials said they were also unconvinced that the trade case had merit.
"We were open to the idea," said Gene Sperling, the former head of the National Economic Council, "but a strong majority of the industry lawyers we talked to did not feel the case was strong enough."
Mr. Sperling said that while imports had shot up to a high of 30 percent of steel consumption in 1998, they had since dwindled. In 2000, imports accounted for about 27 percent of domestic consumption. The trade commission looks closely at import trends when judging whether the industry has suffered damage from foreign competition.
Moreover, if the United States does eventually impose new restrictions on the steel trade, trading partners will certainly challenge the measure at the World Trade Organization. The United States recently lost a case at the trade body over a Section 201 measure related to wheat gluten, the protein extracted from wheat when it is milled into flour. 
Still, Mr. Bush's action won him a measure of support from some unaccustomed quarters -- House and Senate Democrats and union members. Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers of America, issued a carefully worded statement of praise. He and several other people who backed the action said the test would be whether they get import relief.
There is little question that the industry is being hurt. Since late 1997, 18 American steel companies, including the giant LTV, have filed for bankruptcy.
Yet the steel industry does not matter as much to the economy as it did 20 years ago, when big steel's decline became one of Washington's touchiest political issues. Steel producers employ roughly 160,000 people today, compared with 800,000 in 1980. The military depends far less on domestic raw steel than it once did.
Steel users, by contrast, represent a far larger slice of the economy and by some estimates employ more than eight million workers. And many of them complain that they will suffer from any restrictions in imports.
"We want the U.S. steel industry to thrive," said William Sopko of Stamco Industries in Cleveland, which uses finished steel products to make parts for heavy trucks. "But if we don't have access to high-quality products at competitive rates, including imports, then we're going to be put out of business."

HEADLINE: New York Life to Buy Union Pension Fund Manager 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Joining a wave of consolidation among asset management companies, the New York Life Insurance Company's investment arm will announce today that it is buying a privately held San Francisco firm that is a leader in managing union pension funds.
 Executives of both New York Life and the San Francisco company, McMorgan & Company, said they hoped the deal would permit them to capitalize on a trend in union retirement plans in which individual members, rather than trustees, make investment decisions. Union pension funds have lagged American companies in shifting to these 401(k)-style retirement plans. 
 McMorgan has a commanding position in the union pension market, and New York Life brings sophisticated computer systems, administrative expertise and a string of mutual funds that can now be offered through the West Coast company. 
"It's a very good fit," said Alejandro Przygoda, an investment banker at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Neither company would discuss the purchase price, but analysts and investment bankers estimated it at $400 million, based on recent sales of asset management companies.
The deal adds $27 billion in assets to New York Life Investment Management Holdings, the investment arm, raising its assets under management to $145 billion.
Insurance companies, banks and large asset management companies have been buying other asset managers -- which manage mutual funds, foundation endowments and other money for institutions -- at a rapid pace. The goal is to gain economies of scale and market share as baby boomers save money for retirement.
There were a dozen deals last year, and so far this year, there have been six, up from 10 in all of 1999 and an equal number in 1998. The New York Life deal comes just two days after FleetBoston paid $900 million to buy the asset-management business of the Liberty Financial Companies, which manages $51 billion.
Last June, in one of the biggest combinations, Alliance Capital Management, the investment arm of AXA, an insurance company based in France, bought Sanford C. Bernstein for $3.5 billion. And in 1999, Allianz, a large German insurer, bought Pimco Advisors for $3.3 billion. 
There have been smaller deals as well. In April, Amvescap of Britain bought Pell Rudman, a Boston company with $8 billion under management, for $200 million.
"Some of these companies are trying to get distribution -- access to new customers," Mr. Przygoda said. "Some are trying to get more products to offer and others are going after scale. In this deal, New York Life gets distribution and scale."
One risk when larger financial companies take over smaller asset managers, some analysts say, is that the unique strengths of the small companies become diluted as the new parent pushes for more and more assets. But Gary Wendlandt, the chief executive of the New York Life money-management unit, said McMorgan would remain a separate operation under New York Life. McMorgan has been led for the last two decades by Thomas A. Morton, one of the founders, with increasing help from his two sons. 
"This company has a terrific franchise," Mr. Wendlandt said. "To disturb that would be foolish."
As a result of the combination, McMorgan will have 50 mutual funds to offer clients, up from 5 now. McMorgan will also gain the expertise that New York Life uses to manage $13 billion in individual retirement plan funds, which will help as more of McMorgan's clients shift away from trustee-managed plans.
Mr. Wendlandt said that of the $430 billion in defined-contribution retirement plans run by unions, only 10 percent are set up so members can decide how the money is invested. But increasingly, he and Mr. Morton said, members want that freedom. 
"This is just the beginning of this trend," Mr. Wendlandt said.

 The United States Postal Service said it lost $166 million in the third quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. The service said it had expected to earn $146 million, but a weakened economy halted the growth in mail volume, so it could lose as much as $2.4 billion by the end of the fiscal year. To help increase revenues, some postage rates will rise for the second time this year starting on July 1.

HEADLINE: DESIGNED TO TRAVEL; 
Curating Relics of T.W.A. As It Prepares for Departure

BYLINE:  By TODD LAPPIN 

 BODY:
IF midcentury modern is your thing, you probably covet an Eames chair. If you're into Pop Art, you'll want a Warhol. For photography connoisseurs, it may be an Edward Weston. But I'm not interested in any of that stuff. I'm going for the airport look. Specifically, a T.W.A. departure lounge, circa 1962.
 I realize this seems odd at a time when air travel has become about as stylish as submarine duty. Nevertheless, my apartment is increasingly decorated in a style you might call midcentury airborne. A pair of small plastic Boeing 707's sit on my desk, alongside a Trans World Airlines swizzle stick with a streaking-707 silhouette. A mid-50's travel poster promoting T.W.A. flights to France hangs in my foyer. On the study wall is a lithograph of an early-60's T.W.A. 707. In the bathroom, my Q-Tips are kept in a vintage T.W.A. coffee cup. 
 I have a hard time explaining my addiction. I don't think it's an affaire de kitsch, and I'm not practical enough to think of T.W.A. objects as sound investments. It can't be nostalgia: I've never even flown on T.W.A. 
But I'm not alone. Ever since T.W.A. declared bankruptcy in January for the third and final time, selling itself to American Airlines, collectors have been circling like vultures. T.W.A. is the last of the aviation pioneers (Pan Am went under 10 years ago), and the company's design legacy provides touchstones that will endure even after the airline ceases to exist.
"Like a lot of people, I'm sentimental about the T.W.A. brand," said Steven Isaacks, a T.W.A. crew scheduler. T.W.A. is more than a job for Mr. Isaacks, 36. His grandfather helped set up T.W.A.'s first jet-engine repair shop in Kansas City. His mother worked for the airline for 40 years. Conveniently, Mr. Isaacks lives in St. Louis, also T.W.A.'s hometown. He has been collecting its memorabilia since he was 8; I've run up against him more than once on eBay during heated bidding for travel posters. Inside his St. Louis apartment lies a T.W.A. gold mine: about 10,000 schedules, 5,000 seat-pocket safety cards, 500 decks of playing cards, 75 travel agency posters and -- his most prized possession -- Rosenthal china place settings for 12 in First Class.
Obsession, of course, is always relative. Dan McIntyre, 67, of Granite City, Ill., who retired from T.W.A. in 1992 as a ground service employee after 40 years with the airline, pocketed his first swizzle stick in 1952. His current collection occupies most of his basement, including a 35-by-15-foot room, which he calls "my museum." 
Mr. McIntyre has good reason for his fixation. For one thing, he met his wife at T.W.A. For another, he remembers when air travel was a more neighborly experience. "When you worked on the ramp at the airport during the 1950's and 1960's, you saw a lot of things," he said, referring to days when passengers stepped from airplane to tarmac. "People hugging and kissing. People crying. Family reunions. Kids going off to war in Vietnam." 
Nonetheless, he kept his habit a secret for many years. "I came out of the closet around 1979," he confided, "when a friend took me to my first airline collectibles and memorabilia show. Before that, I thought I was just a freak."
In fact, T.W.A. has spawned several organizations, including Clipped Wings International (www.twaclippedwings.com), former T.W.A. flight attendants who collect cabin uniforms, and Save-a-Connie, a group in Kansas City that tours the country in a restored 1950's T.W.A. Lockheed Constellation (www.saveaconnie.org).
In airport hotel ballrooms across America, collectors gather regularly for swap meets. (Mark your calendars: the Tri-State Airline Historical Society is to meet at the Newark Airport Sheraton on Sept. 8.)
They have a lot of material to choose from. Founded in 1930 by a group that included Charles Lindbergh, T.W.A. was the first airline to offer true coast-to-coast service, taking passengers on a 36-hour journey with an overnight stop in Kansas City.
T.W.A.'s rise took place in the 1940's, after Howard Hughes obtained a controlling interest. By the 1950's, its graceful Lockheed Constellations had become synonymous with elegant travel. "Hughes made flying glamorous for the rich and the wealthy," said Don Casey, T.W.A.'s executive vice president for marketing. "When he was running the show, T.W.A. became known as the airline of the stars."
It was a reputation that Mr. Hughes happily cultivated, sometimes by commandeering a Constellation, filling it with Hollywood celebrities and embarking on giddy sightseeing flights. Joe DiMaggio flew T.W.A. Constellations from New York to Los Angeles to visit his wife, Marilyn Monroe. And isn't that a T.W.A. Constellation with Frank Sinatra on the cover of his 1958 album "Come Fly With Me"?
My entry into what could literally be called the stuff of this legend came in 1999 on eBay, where hundreds of auctions for T.W.A. collectibles take place each week. I paid $10 for a 1954-55 promotional calendar illustrated with a slender Constellation. A few dollars more secured a postcard boasting that the Super-Constellation Skyliner was "the latest word in swift, modern passenger aircraft." Addiction began to set in.
As I collected, I learned more. The jet age took T.W.A.'s visual identity in a new direction. Not long after it began flying its first Boeing 707 jets, in 1959, T.W.A. rolled out a new logo designed by the legendary industrial designer Raymond Loewy. 
Mr. Loewy created the airline's instantly recognizable logo, with the red T.W.A. initials superimposed over two golden interlocking globes. The logo was painted on the tails and above the forward passenger doors of T.W.A. aircraft. A red stripe followed the line of the passenger windows from front to rear like a wedge, widening as if stretched by speed. (T.W.A. pilots were said to boast that their jets seemed to be going 600 miles an hour even when parked.)
But during the 1970's and 1980's, T.W.A.'s global brand recognition became a liability because it made the airline a conspicuous target for anti-American hijackers. Deregulation and competition from upstart airlines, coupled with rising fuel costs, started an economic decline. When the corporate raider Carl C. Icahn acquired control of T.W.A. in 1985, he promptly sold off many of its lucrative international routes. T.W.A. filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors twice in the 1990's. As if to signal the beginning of the end, in 1996 T.W.A. Flight 800 crashed mysteriously off the coast of Long Island, killing all 230 people aboard.
Along the way, T.W.A.'s visual identity was neutered. The twin-globe logo was phased out in the 1970's. Since 1995, T.W.A. planes have been a staid black, red and white, with a globe adorning the fuselage. The globe is intended to evoke the glory of the airline's earlier years, but at a glance, you can tell the thrill is gone.
So as T.W.A. is subsumed by American Airlines, ultimately losing its identity, many will mourn. But for me it also spells opportunity. I still have room in my collection for a certain eye-catching Eero Saarinen terminal building.

Dashboard Miser Teaches Drivers How to Save Fuel

BYLINE:  By ANNE EISENBERG 

 BODY:
DUTCH and Swedish researchers may have an antidote for rising gasoline prices. They have developed a computer-driven dashboard display that advises drivers throughout a trip on ways to reduce fuel use. 
 City drivers who follow the dashboard advice on acceleration, braking and other maneuvers reduce their gasoline consumption by 20 percent, the researchers reported. The prototype was tested in and around Enschede, the Netherlands. 
 The computer program in the device keeps track of essentials like speed, steering wheel angle and distance to the vehicle in front, constantly calculating what the driver should be doing to minimize fuel consumption. The program takes a dim view of idling, a notorious gasoline waster, and of that staple of New York City taxi drivers, rapid acceleration followed immediately by an equally rapid deceleration. 
"If drivers change their habits -- and they can with constant feedback -- they can complete the same journey in similar travel times using far less fuel," said Dr. Mascha van der Voort, who just finished her graduate work at the University of Twente in Enschede. Dr. van der Voort devised the computer program and dashboard display with the help of two advisers as part of the work for her doctorate. 
In the long term, Dr. van der Voort acknowledged, the bulk of gasoline savings will probably come from improvements in engine efficiency, not from changes in driving habits. "But I wanted to do something right now," she said, "in the short run, to conserve fuel and reduce carbon dioxide emissions." 
Dr. Therese Langer, transportation program director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit group based in Washington, said that on-board devices that monitored and advised drivers about driving methods that could save gasoline could indeed play a part in energy conservation. But she added, "Devices like these are not a substitute for the automakers to make a concerted effort to improve their fuel economies."
Many dashboards can already tell drivers, for instance, how much fuel they are using for a maneuver. "This device is different," said Dr. Mark S. Dougherty, a computer science professor at Dalarna University in Borlange, Sweden, who supervised Dr. van der Voort's research project. "It gives you constant feedback during a trip on many ways to improve fuel efficiency." 
The program was designed for standard-transmission cars, which are far more popular in Europe than cars with automatic transmissions. But the program can be adapted to automatic transmissions, Dr. Dougherty said.
Dr. van der Voort and her colleagues tested the program first in computer-controlled driving simulations and then on the road. In the simulated runs, drivers read the advice on a display that was next to an indicator light; the light changed from green to orange and finally red when they delayed heeding the admonition. "The orange warning was when the driver was 10 seconds late, for instance, in shifting from second to third gear," she said. Red warnings were given when two minutes had elapsed. 
In the driving simulations, reported this year in the journal Transportation Research, drivers with on-board advice had an average fuel-use reduction of 16 percent. Drivers in urban areas did even better, reducing fuel use by 23 percent.
"We decided, based on the simulations," Dr. van der Voort said, "that drivers in city centers could really use detailed advice on how to drive more fuel-efficiently for the complex situations they meet."
In the actual road tests that followed the simulated ones, the advice was shown without the colored warning light to make the display less distracting. The system uses a dashboard liquid-crystal display; the idea of audio cues was discarded as too intrusive. The computer program was calibrated to the engine performance of the Volkswagens used in the trials, and 36 people, a mix of men and women, took to the roads, suburbs and highways around Enschede in cars with manual transmissions.
"People who had the device on the dashboard drove on average 11 percent more efficiently than people without it," Dr. van der Voort said. In urban areas the fuel saving was 20 percent. 
Some of the gasoline savings came from changing the patterns of gear shifting. "People were shifting too late from first to second, and from second to third," Dr. van der Voort said. People saved the most gasoline when they pushed down on the accelerator briskly and then shifted quickly, keeping the revolutions per minute low -- not by accelerating very gently. 
"It's not commonly understood by people who drive," Dr. Dougherty said. "They think that the way to get best fuel economy is to accelerate very gently, but that proves not to be the case. The best thing is to accelerate briskly and shift. 
"Don't give it everything the car has, but push down when you're going to shift, using maybe two-thirds of the available power, and change through the gears relatively quickly." 
Another time when gasoline was saved was during braking. "The main thing is to anticipate better when you are going to need to stop," Dr. Dougherty said. Then you should take your foot off the accelerator and use air resistance and friction to help slow the car. 
In Europe, a number of driving programs, sometimes known as eco-driving or ecological driver training, instruct participants in many of the gasoline-conserving techniques that underlie Dr. van der Voort's computer program. Christina Schaper, a project manager at Deutsche Umwelthilfe (the German Environmental Aid Association) in Radolfzell, Germany, coordinates her work on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from traffic with many of these groups. 
"Most of the groups I work with report about a 20 percent gas savings by teaching people the right way to drive," Ms. Schaper said. "Fuel economy is a big issue here."
Driver education programs that stress fuel economy were more popular in the United States after the gasoline shortages of the 1970's, said Philip Patterson, an economist in the Office of Transportation Technologies at the Department of Energy who works with automobile companies to make vehicles more fuel-efficient. "We had educational programs into the 80's, but most of them gradually dried up," he said. "It's time we started working on this again."
Dr. van der Voort acknowledged that some of her dashboard-delivered advice, however sensible, was going to be a tough sell in a world full of people who often either ignore warnings or paste black electrical tape over them. For example, New York City cabbies, if not the ones in Enschede, are sure to reject the advice to turn off their engines after idling in traffic more than 30 seconds. "Most people don't do that even here," Dr. van der Voort said, "but we are trying to teach them."

To the Editor:
 Re "Manhattan: New Transit Approach Is Urged" (Metro Briefing item, June 5): 
 I'd like to applaud the five former New York City transportation commissioners for joining forces to bring New York City's transit woes front and center. 
Nearly 100 years ago, the city laid down miles of rail track in a short period of time because government officials were faced with the urgent need to solve population-congestion problems and to combat resulting disease. While the problem today may not be tuberculosis from overcrowded tenements, emergency measures are needed now, too. 
With subway ridership increasing and the growth of neighborhoods bringing traffic congestion, transportation is a quality-of-life and public safety issue that affects millions of New Yorkers. Not addressing it now is a detriment to the city's future economic growth.

HEADLINE: Drop Expected in Sales of Semiconductors 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., June 6 

 BODY:
Worldwide sales of semiconductors are expected to decline this year, an industry group said today, as demand slows for the chips, which run everything from personal computers to cellular phones.
 Semiconductor sales may slip to $175 billion this year, a drop of 14 percent from 2000, the Semiconductor Industry Association said. 
The group's president, George Scalise, said in February that chip sales could rise 10 percent, less than half an earlier forecast. 
 Sales of semiconductors increased last year as manufacturers stocked up. As consumer spending slowed, electronics makers relied on their excess inventories, leading to weaker-than-expected sales for chip makers, like Texas Instruments and the Intel Corporation. 
Sales are expected to rebound 21 percent in 2002, to $211 billion, the association said. It forecast sales growth of 25 percent for 2003.

HEADLINE: Price of Success In AIDS Treatment; 
Hospitals Confront New Therapy

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
The 20-year onslaught of AIDS has radically changed the economics of patient care, and its effects are still being felt throughout the health care system.
 In the first years, when AIDS patients generally needed prolonged bed care and little could be done to keep them alive, hospitals across the country scrambled for resources to treat them. 
 Now many AIDS patients are much healthier, as long as they adhere to complicated drug regimens. They are less likely to be admitted as hospital inpatients, but their treatments require fine-tuning and monitoring, in outpatient clinics and the offices of primary care doctors. 
That care also requires extensive services and expertise on the part of hospitals and doctors. But unfortunately for hospitals, money to pay for the expensive new treatments has not always followed the patients from the inpatient floors to the clinics. Some hospitals are reporting heavy losses on outpatient care for H.I.V. and AIDS patients today, particularly as the disease has spread beyond an affliction primarily among gay men to attack more low-income people who are without insurance, including heterosexual intravenous drug users and their spouses. 
Many family physicians and internists have been significantly affected by the sweep of AIDS as well. In the early days, they were often reimbursed by indemnity insurance plans that covered all services when they cared for AIDS patients.
Now, although they often find themselves spending as much or more time with patients who are controlling their AIDS with complicated drug regimens, health maintenance organizations often pay a flat fee for physicians' services, classifying AIDS as routine general care. 
AIDS has been anything but routine for patients and the health care system, however. From the first handful of cases in 1981 in California and New York that were later found to be AIDS-related pneumonia, the epidemic surged to a peak of 249,000 patient stays in 1995 in hospitals across the country, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In the early years, hospitals that treated many patients with the disease rushed to assemble AIDS units.
At San Francisco General Hospital, 60 of the 300 medical-surgical beds were dedicated to AIDS patients in 1993 and 1994. In Miami, AIDS patients occupied 45 of 380 beds at Mercy Hospital. There were 40 beds for AIDS patients in Bellevue in New York, and almost half the 220 beds in St. Clare's Hospital were allocated to AIDS patients. 
"It was not unusual to have maybe 100 inpatients out of a census in the hospital of 220," said Sister Pascal Conforti, a member of the Ursuline order who is a staff chaplain at St. Clare's. 
Although hundreds of hospitals treat some AIDS patients, much of the activity was concentrated in a few. Five percent of the nation's hospitals were treating 55 percent of all AIDS patients in the mid-1990's. Public hospitals like Bellevue have been among the largest providers of care for H.I.V. and AIDS patients, including many poor residents. For example, 50 percent of the H.I.V. patients in Dallas County have been getting their care in the public Parkland Health and Hospital System.
In cities particularly hard hit, hospitals transferred nurses and resident physicians to AIDS duty from other units, especially cancer floors.
At first, the course of the disease was often extraordinarily swift.
"They would say, 'I get a little short of breath going up subway steps,' " recalled Dr. Victoria Sharp, who arrived at St. Clare's in 1989. "Three weeks later, they were dead. 
"I was feeling like I was standing there with my arms open and just catching people as they came into the emergency room," added Dr. Sharp, now director of the H.I.V. center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. "It was truly horrific."
Dr. Paul Volberding, a San Francisco oncologist whose first patient, in July 1981, was "a young man with Kaposi's sarcoma," the virulent AIDS-related skin cancer, remembers that era as extraordinarily painful. "Deaths were absolutely routine," he said.
In addition to the sheer logistical challenge, hospitals had to contend with the stigma associated with AIDS and the fears of contagion from the strange new illness, even among hospital staff.
"It was a time when other people were not supportive,' Dr. Sharp said. "Dietary services, other specialties. There was a lot of fear, a lot of discrimination. It's amazing how far we've come."
Even as they raced to keep up with the patient flow, some hospitals tried to play down their AIDS services for fear of losing prospective patients with other diseases. Paula Sparti, a Miami family physician, said she was rebuffed in the 1980's when she applied for a salaried post at South Miami Hospital, where she had treated dozens of her AIDS patients. "They didn't want to be known as an AIDS hospital," she said.
And in at least one case, in 1991, a federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld a health plan that had singled out AIDS for special restrictions on coverage.
But concerns about finances took a back seat, for the most part, in the early years of the epidemic. 
Many of the early AIDS patients were young, white, homosexual men whose insurance paid for almost every test and medical service, with few questions asked. 
"In the first decade, we had a lot of gay men with indemnity insurance," said Shedrick J. Boren, director of special immunology services at Mercy Hospital in the Coconut Grove section of Miami. "They were financially profitable for the hospitals," he said. 
The Columbia Healthcare Corporation, the national hospital chain, saw AIDS treatment as such a lucrative business opportunity that it moved the big AIDS practice of Dr. Sparti and her partners into Columbia's Deering Hospital in Miami in 1992.
"In exchange for getting our admissions to the hospital, they were willing to put in a state-of-the-art H.I.V. unit" with full-time, dedicated H.I.V. nurses, said Dr. Michael Wohlfeiler, an internist in the South Beach section of Miami Beach who was one of Dr. Sparti's partners.
The economics began to change in the mid-1990's as the first AIDS drug cocktails revolutionized treatment. As the drugs gave many patients their lives back, but left them on complicated treatment regimens, hospitals found themselves facing the loss of a major revenue source but still needing to treat the same patients in outpatient clinics. 
The average hospital stay for H.I.V. and AIDS patients in the state of New York, which keeps the most complete records on AIDS care in the country, was 23.4 days in 1983, almost two weeks longer than the 9.6-day average stay in 1999, according to a forthcoming report by the state health department. 
Insurance companies and major employers who were faced with heavy costs for AIDS and other medical care began switching workers to managed care plans. And insurance companies started paying a flat fee for each day a patient was in the hospital or a case rate depending on the diagnosis. Hospitals could no longer bill for each service, no matter how necessary, and administrators pushed for quicker discharges.
Doctors treating AIDS now say they are often strained financially. Dr. Michael Somero, an internist in Palm Springs, Calif., who treats several hundred H.I.V. patients, canceled his contract with a local managed care medical group last August. The health plans were paying a flat monthly fee of $50 or $60 for each member to the medical group, which turned over $12 to the doctor. "That was a ridiculous amount for any patient, H.I.V. or not," said Nancy Green, Dr. Somero's office manager. 
Ben Singer, a spokesman for Pacifcare Health Systems, one of the H.M.O's with contracts in Palm Springs, said that for doctors with "a disproportionate number of H.I.V. patients, the insurance system, as designed, is challenged."
But he added: "The solution doesn't lie with any one H.M.O. or insurer" but with the willingness of society to continue financing care for AIDS at a cost doctors can live with.
Dr. Wohlfeiler in Miami said that H.I.V. patients require more time, they have more questions and more side effects to discuss. "In the eyes of the insurance company, we're just primary care physicians," he said. By 1997, Columbia-HCA Healthcare, as the chain was renamed, decided to end its contracts with the group of AIDS doctors in Miami. "Once they don't make the money they think they are going to make, the issues change," Dr. Wohlfeiler said. Jeff Prescott, a spokesman for HCA Healthcare, the company's current name, confirmed that Columbia had been "in a mode to get out of those contracts" as it retreated from deals with various types of doctors.
After H.I.V.-related hospital admissions plummeted 29 percent from 1995 to 1997, to 178,000 from 249,000, hospitals took even more drastic steps, closing their inpatient AIDS units or changing them over to treat contagious diseases of all kinds. Nurses and physicians were shifted to walk-in clinics for H.I.V.-related illnesses and to other parts of the hospital.
Mercy Hospital closed its inpatient AIDS unit in 1998 and dispersed the reduced numbers of patients around the hospital. Traffic at the hospital's outpatient AIDS clinic and the pharmacy that dispensed the drugs grew, meanwhile, and H.I.V.-related visits to outpatient clinics quintupled to 4,800 a year. Many of those patients were low-income intravenous drug users without insurance, money-losers for Mercy and other hospitals. 
"AIDS services have gone from being a profit center to being a loss center," Mr. Boren said. His unit reported a $400,000 loss in 2000.
Dr. Sharp at St. Luke's-Roosevelt said, "The change was wonderful news for patients but very bad news for institutions." She said reimbursement for her hospital dropped substantially from 1995 to 2000, costing St. Luke's-Roosevelt more than $1.7 million a year as inpatient admissions dropped by 600, to 1,800 a year, and outpatient visits soared to 47,000 from 4,500. 
She said that the hospitals received $10,000 a year, on average, for AIDS-related inpatients. Outpatient payments, amounting to about $100 a visit, did not make up for the loss of revenue. In New York and California, generous financing for AIDS programs fills the gap for hospitals. But in Texas, Parkland, for example, has a big deficit for AIDS cases, according to Dr. Ron J. Anderson, its chief executive.
St. Clare's, the first of 20 comprehensive H.I.V. centers to be designated and supported financially by New York State and New York City health officials, was pushed close to the edge by the rapid influx and even more rapid outflow of AIDS patients. In just five years, the hospital shrank from 220 beds with 110 patients with AIDS-related illnesses to 110 beds with only 15 or so occupied by AIDS-related patients. 
In the peak inpatient years, "We were a huge part of the business of that hospital: $35 million of $52 million in revenues," Dr. Sharp said. 
George Lowe, director of the out-patient Spellman Center for H.I.V.-related Disease, said the switch hit St. Clare's particularly hard. "The hospital has been knocked to its knees," he said. "There was even talk of changing the name because we had been known so many years as an AIDS hospital." 
With a federal loan to tide it over during three years of renovating, Saint Clare's continued to run the Spellman H.I.V. center and other out-patient services. Now it is marketing the hospital as "the new St. Clare's," Mr. Lowe said, a general community hospital with all new facilities: emergency room, operating rooms, intensive care unit, cardiac care unit, and plans for a new pediatric program.

HEADLINE: Travel-Management Deal Said to Be Near 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Navigant International Inc., a fast-growing supplier of corporate travel-management services, is expected to announce today that it has agreed to acquire SatoTravel, for $45 million in cash and stock. 
 Sato specializes in providing travel management services to government agencies and large corporations and ranks seventh in that niche. Last year it generated roughly $1.2 billion in gross annual air sales representing about $120 million in net revenue. It has about 2,000 employees. 
 The transaction will create the nation's second-largest travel-management company based on airline ticket sales. American Express remains the leader in providing business travel services. 
Since it was spun off from U.S. Office Products in June 1998, Navigant has grown to become the nation's fourth-largest travel management service business.
The only travel-management service company that is publicly traded, it has relied on acquisitions to fuel its growth. 
In the last three years, the company, which is based in Englewood, Colo., has acquired 35 regional travel concerns in the United States, Canada, Britain and Brazil. Currently, it serves 22 of the top 25 business markets and has 4,000 employees. Its client base consists primarily of middle-market companies that spend from about $500,000 to $20 million a year on travel expenses. 
Though aggressive, Navigant is not the only business travel service provider that is growing through acquisition. Consolidation in what had been a highly fragmented industry is under way, and is likely to continue. 
"There are clear benefits of scale," Paul Keung, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said. "Larger players are stronger players." 
While the current economic climate is dampening corporate travel plans, travel agencies have been under pressure since the mid-1990's, when major airlines cut commissions to most agents in half, and capped total commission paid on a round-trip ticket at $50. 
Revenues fell so sharply that hundreds of agencies have either gone out of business or have been acquired by other companies. The remaining agencies have been forced to move to a fee-based system. 
Thus far, the slowdown in the economy has not had a major impact on Navigant's business, said Edward S. Adams, Navigant's chairman and chief executive. 
"It would be naive to say the downturn hasn't affected us at all," he said. "Large companies react faster. But it takes longer to get down to the middle market. These companies realize they need face time with their customers." 
The purchase of Sato, which is based in Arlington, Va., is far and away the biggest deal Navigant has done to date. Mr. Adams said the price his company is paying for Sato is twice that of any of its prior purchases. 
"They are a great, profitable company in two business markets we are dying to get into, the government and military and large call-center transactions," Mr. Adams said. 
Under the terms of the transaction, Sato shareholders will receive 60 percent of the $45 million in cash and the remaining 40 percent in shares of Navigant common stock at a price of $12.25 a share. Navigant expects the transaction to close on Monday. 
Navigant, which is traded on the Nasdaq stock market, closed at $16.82 yesterday, down 8 cents a share. So far this year the shares are up 107 percent.
Founded in 1953, SatoTravel was owned by a consortium of 11 United States airline companies. In 1999, an investment group that included Lawrence Hough, former president of Sallie Mae, and a firm led by Peter and John Ueberroth bought the company for an undisclosed price. 
Mr. Hough, Sato's chairman and chief executive, will become a Navigant board member and retain operating responsibility for SatoTravel. 
Sato had been struggling since the mid-1980's, when it lost a near-monopoly hold on providing commercial travel services for the military and federal government. In 1984, Congress opened federal travel contracts to competitive bidding. In 1994, Sato lost three big Army contracts valued at more than $300 million. 
Mr. Adams said Sato had about 45 percent of the military travel market and 35 percent of the federal government market. 
Last month, Navigant reported revenue of $82.9 million in its fiscal first quarter, up more than 13 percent from the period a year ago.

HEADLINE: From a Woodland Elegy, A Rhapsody in Green; 
Hunter Mountain Paintings Spurred Recovery

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: HUNTER, N.Y. 

 BODY:
The Catskills had been laid to waste. Generations of loggers, leather tanners and farmers had stripped the valleys and hilltops of their trees. Streams were clotted with the debris of a dying forest. And the mournful painting of the wreckage that Sanford Robinson Gifford produced here just after the Civil War, called "Hunter Mountain, Twilight," became the woodland's elegy.
 Today, the trees are back, and Hunter is part of a new and vast green belt that stretches along the Appalachians through New York State and into Vermont and New Hampshire. How the land in the Northeast recovered -- from the scarred moonscape that Gifford painted in 1866, to the dense and verdant blanket that envelops Hunter Valley now -- is a tale of nature, technological change and conscious human intervention. Farms were abandoned, allowing the trees to advance. Other fuels replaced wood for heating homes. But in an odd and mysterious way, historians and naturalists say, the art of the Hudson River School -- and Gifford's painting of Hunter Mountain, in particular -- also played a pivotal role. Pictures helped shape and inform much of the debate -- still very much alive in the Catskills today -- about how the wilderness was to be treated. 
 Some of the images, drenched with glory and grandeur, made people fall in love with the landscapes of the Northeast, and then, in a kind of one-two punch, paintings like Gifford's galvanized them into action. 
That New York became the first state to enshrine its forestry goals in its Constitution, in 1894 -- with the famous language that some land was to remain "forever wild" -- was no fluke, conservation experts say. The New York-based painters helped show the way. 
"These were the first real images of ecological destruction," said Bill McKibben, an author who lives in the Adirondacks and has written extensively about the northern forest recovery. Mr. McKibben said that photographs and engravings in magazines like Harper's publicized the land's destruction further still, and the result was an emotional reaction that ultimately became political. "In the Catskills, and especially the Adirondacks, there was really an all-out effort to view these places as special and nurture their comeback," he said.
How art became a force for conservation is in some ways itself a portrait of a lost era, when science and aesthetic appreciation were interconnected subjects in the drawing rooms of the well-born classes.
Theodore Roosevelt, a scion of New York money, made the Adirondacks his wild woods playground as he rose in politics. Writers like John Burroughs and George Perkins Marsh captured the large and small glories of nights under the stars, and the risks to economic prosperity of a neglected environment.
Meanwhile, different economic interests were heading for a collision. Logging continued, and in some places intensified, as the nation's economy grew in the years after "Hunter Mountain, Twilight." But at the same time the families of the New York aristocracy were building their summer retreats upstate, and finding that the sound of a loon on a serene lake was something they wanted their grandchildren to hear as well.
And there was a man named Gifford Pinchot.

Capturing What Was Lost
Gifford Pinchot and "Hunter Mountain, Twilight" were made for each other. He was named for the artist, and born the same year, 1865, in which Sanford Gifford first sketched the scene that became the basis of the painting. His father, James, whose family had made its fortune in the lumber business, was an avid art collector, who became -- through his friendship with a circle of Hudson River School painters, including Sanford Gifford -- a passionate conservationist.
James Pinchot helped found Yale University's School of Forestry. He joined the conservation leagues that were springing up. He persuaded his son Gifford to go into forestry in the 1880's, at a time when such an occupation -- particularly for a young man of independent means -- was almost unheard of. And of course, he bought the painting that had inspired him, "Hunter Mountain, Twilight."
"James was very much affected by what these painters were trying to do," said Nancy P. Pinchot, who married James's great-grandson Peter Pinchot and is now writing a book about the family. "They were trying to capture something that was going to be lost -- he took what they were saying and turned it into policy."
And Gifford Pinchot took the family calling of forestry further than his father had dreamed. In the early years of the 20th century, Gifford Pinchot became perhaps the most well-known voice for conservation in the nation, as the first head of the United States Forest Service under President Theodore Roosevelt. Many historians consider Mr. Pinchot the father of modern forestry.
As the heady era of progressivism gathered force, Mr. Pinchot -- who later was twice elected the governor of Pennsylvania -- established a philosophical platform of land-use policies that became embedded in the nation's forestry doctrine. In the process he defined half of what came to be known as the Muir-Pinchot divide.
Mr. Pinchot believed that forests were renewable, manageable resources that should be used and cultivated. John Muir, the naturalist who was making his name in the Sierra Nevada Mountains at about the same time, argued that pristine wilderness left in as wild a state as possible was the only true measure of conservation. Their gentlemen's disagreement, played out over the subsequent century by disciples who took one side or the other, became a chasm.
And through it all, "Hunter Mountain, Twilight" and the Pinchots remained linked. The painting stayed in the family for nearly a hundred years. For more than 60 of those years it was literally embedded in the wall above the living-room fireplace of their home at 1615 Rhode Island Avenue in Washington -- a permanent part of the mantelpiece. It was the heart of a large art collection, and of their personal lives as well.
"That painting with all the stumps was more than just a picture," said Prof. Char Miller, the chairman of the history department at Trinity University in San Antonio and the author of "Gifford Pinchot and the Making of Modern Environmentalism" (Island Press), a book to be published this fall with Sanford Gifford's desolate Hunter Mountain view on the cover.
"Gifford's job was to put the trees back," Professor Miller said. "That's what his family geared him for."

Forested Lands Again
Jerry Franklin Pierce gestured with his hand to the wall of trees lining the roadside as he drove up Scribner Hollow Road, as though he were trying to reach out through the window of his pickup truck to touch them. Mr. Pierce, a 62-year-old retired civil engineer -- and distant relative to the 14th president, or so his family has always said -- has seen the rebound of the forests. 
He has lived in Hunter all his life, and the encroachment of the woods has become, he said, part the story of his life. There are a few places that he has followed almost like a biology project, including a 30-acre spread that as recently as the 1950's was open farmland and has since been reclaimed by the woods. Any hike, he said, will turn up cellar pits and hearths from even earlier days that are now reabsorbed completely. 
"There are places where I cut hay as a kid, and now they're almost totally forested over -- that's just in my lifetime," he said.
Across the Northeast, the return of the forests has been noted mostly by its consequences: deer and bear have returned, moose have drifted south from Maine and many naturalists say that wolves from Canada could eventually follow. 
But the basis of that resurgent animal life is a resurgent forest. In 1880, only about 25 percent of New York State was forested, according to estimates by the State Department of Environmental Conservation. Today, forests cover 62 percent of the land area. The Forest Service said that while many parts of the nation, especially in the West, lost forestlands in the 20th century, states in the Northeast -- New England along with New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- showed a big net gain, with more than 22.3 million new acres of trees. About six million of those acres -- an area roughly the size of Vermont -- were in New York alone.
Meanwhile, the decades-old argument between Mr. Pinchot and Mr. Muir about how best to use or conserve those woods is still being hashed out -- though these days the extractable resource in the Catskills is water, not wood. Over the last four years, New York City has bought more than 32,000 acres in the Catskills -- 5,600 within 10 miles of Hunter Mountain. Under an agreement with the Department of Environmental Protection, the city is trying to buy as much land as it can to protect the watershed and reservoir system that supplies much of its drinking water, in hopes of avoiding the need to build an expensive filtration plant.
But much of the land it buys becomes, in the name of water purity, off limits for many uses, including hiking and camping. The tightening belt of land enclosure has created a new tension point, with many local residents -- taking a page from Mr. Pinchot's book -- saying that they have been robbed of what should be a public patrimony. The city, staking out Mr. Muir's position, says its efforts are the purest form of preservation. People like Danny Murro, a former resident of the Bronx who moved to the Catskills a decade ago and now works in a hardware store just east of Hunter Mountain, said that all the terms are tricky.
"The word is control, not conservation," Mr. Murro said.

Tracking a Classic
Gifford Pinchot died in 1946, and when his wife, Cornelia, died 14 years later, "Hunter Mountain, Twilight" was still on the living-room mantel. Family members said that in the tumult after Mrs. Pinchot's death -- the house and its contents were later sold, and the family estate in Milford, Pa., called Grey Towers, was donated to the Forest Service -- they lost track of the painting. (It changed hands three times among private collectors and has been at the Terra Museum of American Art in Chicago since the mid-1980's.)
One of the enduring family mysteries, though, is what happened to about 200 other paintings that Forest Service workers found in the basement of the Pennsylvania home during its renovation in the early 1960's. All the family knows comes from a memo, which later turned up in government files, written by a member of the renovation team asking what should be done with the art trove. 
No reply to the memo has been found, and Pinchot family members said they feared, and suspected, that the paintings might simply have been dumped into a hole on the property and buried. Hudson River art, which has risen sharply in value over the last 25 years, was out of fashion then. Family members said they still recalled the appraisers from the New York art auction houses who said after Mrs. Pinchot's death that 19th-century landscapes were worth nothing more than the canvases they were painted on.
But the imprint of the Hudson River School's message, along with the old Pinchot obsession with the forests, lives on. Peter Pinchot, Gifford's grandson, is a forester, though he said he resisted it for years. The family legacy, he said, was simply too great.
"I spent half my life running from forestry," said Mr. Pinchot, 55. For eight years, he ran an organic dairy. He renovated houses in Brooklyn.
In the mid-1980's, he enrolled in the Yale School of Forestry and now manages an experimental forest in Pennsylvania that was started by his great-grandfather James.
"I finally realized you should go where your heart lies," he said.

In Art's Footsteps
The paintings of the Hudson River School are portraits of the Northeast, captured at a time when 19th-century America was re-examining its ideas about nature. The landscapes helped spur tourism, forestry and environmentalism. 
This is the second of 10 summer articles in which The New York Times returns to the places illuminated by Hudson River School artists. In the third article, a group of artists hikes into the Adirondacks, hoping to find a deep-woods waterfall that inspired the 1875 painting called "The Flume." Whether "The Flume" has changed is one question. Whether jaded 21st-century eyes can see the natural world the way a romantic 19th-century artist did is another.

HEADLINE: DiFrancesco Proposes New Arena Plan for Newark 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 6 

 BODY:
Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco and the owner of the New Jersey Devils and Nets announced a tentative agreement today for a $355 million arena to be built in downtown Newark and paid for largely with sales taxes collected in the area surrounding it.
 The deal is far more generous to the YankeeNets, the partnership that owns those teams and the New York Yankees, than one proposed by the former governor, Christie Whitman, on Jan. 31, her last day in office. But Mr. DiFrancesco said that unlike her plan, his would pose no financial risk to the taxpayers if the project failed. 
 If completed, the arena would be a major step in the long-running redevelopment of the once-blighted heart of Newark's business district, and would continue the nationwide exodus of sports teams from their sprawling but aging concrete complexes in the suburbs to trendier downtown locations.
But the share of public money involved -- $270 million toward the $385 million cost of the arena and road improvements -- would run counter to another trend, in which teams are privately financing more and more of the costs of their buildings. Two-team arenas in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia have been built in recent years with little public money.
The Newark plan would still require state legislation. And Mr. DiFrancesco, who is also the president of the State Senate, cannot speak for the Assembly. Today, Assembly leaders said they would not go along with the Newark plan until an agreement was struck to replenish the lost economic activity at the Meadowlands sports complex, where the Continental Arena would go dark after the exit of the Devils and the Nets, its two main tenants.
In addition, Assembly Speaker Jack Collins said he would hold up the proposed deal until South Jersey, his political base, received some form of enticement. He is said to favor development of a Nascar race track, or perhaps a new arena for Rowan University, his alma mater.
The proposed deal could also be affected by the New Jersey governor's race. Bret D. Schundler, a Republican candidate for governor, called today for a referendum on any state involvement in a Newark arena. Referendums are often fatal: In Charlotte, N.C., voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected a $342 million package for that city's pro basketball team, the Hornets.
Despite the political obstacles, officials say they expect the required legislation to be enacted by the end of the month, when the state budget has to be passed. Asked whether the deal would still exist if that deadline passed, Harvey Schiller, chairman of the YankeeNets, said, "We've tried to avoid those kinds of conversations, so let's just see what happens."
The agreement in principle announced today calls for the YankeeNets to pay $115 million, or less than 30 percent of the total cost. The rest would come from several public sources. Roads would be rebuilt with $30 million from the state's Transportation Trust Fund. Essex County and the City of Newark would pay $50 million, probably using bonds issued by the county's improvement authority, local officials said.
The largest part, $190 million, would come from bonds sold by an unspecified state entity, to be paid off using sales taxes collected in downtown Newark. That part of the city is now an urban enterprise zone, with a 3 percent sales tax, half the statewide sales tax of 6 percent. Of that 3 percent, 1 percent goes to the city and 2 percent to the state. The arena plan calls for converting the enterprise zone to a "sports entertainment district," and restoring the sales tax there to the full 6 percent.
Officials said that Newark now gets about $2 million a year as its share of the sales tax in the enterprise zone, and the state gets $4 million. The arena plan would allow the city and state to keep receiving those amounts each year, but anything over $6 million would go to pay off the bonds on the arena.
As with any mortgage, over the 30-year life of the bonds, the cumulative payments made from collections of sales taxes would total far more than $190 million, perhaps nearly twice that, officials said. Only after the bonds were paid off would the city and state receive any sales taxes from businesses in downtown Newark above their current amounts.
Mayor Sharpe James, who embraced the plan, said he was not concerned that the higher tax rate would drive away retail customers, saying Newark shopkeepers would end up benefiting from added activity generated by the arena.
"I'd rather pay 6 percent on $5 million gross than 3 percent on $1 million gross," he said.
Officials said that Mr. DiFrancesco, mindful that he has little time to carve out a legacy, was eager to reach a deal for the arena. Indeed, he called his plan a "major improvement" over Mrs. Whitman's proposal because, if the project failed, only bondholders would be hurt. Mrs. Whitman's plan called for no more than $215 million in public money. But the state's share, $125 million, would have come in the form of up-front grants and loans, which could have been lost if the project went into default.
Under his plan, the arena would be owned by the state, but built, run and maintained by the YankeeNets. The Devils and Nets would sign a 30-year lease, albeit at a nominal rent of $500,000 for the first five years and $1 million a year after that; the rent money would be used only for arena repairs and upgrades.

HEADLINE: Armies of Europe Failing to Meet Goals, Sapping NATO 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: LONDON, June 6 

 BODY:
Two years after NATO vowed to improve its military forces, the organization is falling well short of its goals, leaving a yawning gap between the United States and its European allies.
 An internal NATO review has concluded that if the alliance's current spending plans are carried out, it will fulfill less than half its "force goals" -- its 1999 plans to build up its military effectiveness and deal with problems that surfaced during the bombing campaign in Kosovo. 
 And NATO's secretary general, Lord Robertson, said in an interview that European members of the alliance are not doing enough to remedy their deficiencies. 
As a result, European forces could be overly dependent on the United States if they became involved in a new conflict. And if European nations try to tackle the crisis themselves, they may find they lack the means to do the job. 
"For the Europeans there is a clear message," Lord Robertson said. "If a crisis comes along, the capability will not be there."
The sobering assessment comes at a crucial time. The allies' defense ministers are to meet in Brussels on Thursday, and President Bush is to visit NATO's headquarters there next week.
A major topic on the ministers' agenda is NATO's effort to fill the gaps that emerged during its war with Yugoslavia. The conflict demonstrated that European nations have fallen well behind the United States in many areas, including precision-guided weapons, mid-air refueling, airlifting of war materiel, electronic jamming and weapons to knock out enemy air defenses.
European leaders have promised to remedy the shortfalls, both to strengthen their role within NATO and to develop the means to act independently of the United States through a 60,000-member rapid reaction force, which the European Union plans to establish by 2003. But only limited progress has been made. 
"We need to do more," Lord Robertson said.
Much of the consternation at NATO headquarters centers on the objectives the alliance set for itself at its summit meeting in Washington in 1999, for NAT0's 50th anniversary.
At the time, it was clear that the United States was carrying the main burden for the air campaign against Yugoslavia. And with much fanfare NATO approved a program to redress the imbalance and improve the alliance's ability to mount multinational operations, a program it calls the Defense Capabilities Initiative.
A series of "force goals" were specified for five areas: logistics, command and control, mobility, the survivability of forces and infrastructure, and "effective engagement," which essentially means the ability to find and strike targets from the air with precision-guided munitions.
A committee, with NATO's deputy secretary general, Sergio Balanzino, as chairman, was set up to monitor progress. But a review overseen by Mr. Balanzino indicates that NATO's current spending plans would enable it to completely fulfill less than half the "force goals." 
Nor is it clear whether remaining objectives will be met. The review notes that one-third of these objectives would be only partly reached under current spending plans. Other goals are still under discussion or appear to be effectively abandoned.
According to the review, most of the progress has been in logistics and in the materiel needed to sustain a conflict. 
Effective engagement, the term for precision-guided munitions and the systems that support them, is the weakest of the five areas: NATO's spending plans will only enable it to meet 35 percent of its goal, the review states. 
One major reason for the meager progress is lagging support in Europe for military spending. NATO's calculations show that only 11 of its 19 members have increased their spending, after inflation is taken into account.
"The constituency for defense spending is weaker now that the threat appears to have gone away," Lord Robertson said.
Spending estimates by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based research center, paint a bleaker picture. The institute notes that European Union nations as a whole spend about 60 percent as much as the United States. 
The level of effort varies widely. Britain's military spending, for example, far outstrips that of Germany, whose defense reforms are faltering. Another problem is competition among military programs. 
"Rising personnel costs and a wave of systems acquisitions initiated some time ago, as well as the costs of ongoing operations, leave little room for investment to satisfy newly identified requirements," the institute noted in its annual Strategic Survey.
Two items on Thursday's agenda for the defense ministers illustrate the alliance's difficulties. 
One is a proposal to acquire the ability to find and track enemy forces using an airborne radar, a program known as aerial ground surveillance. This has been a top priority for NATO's military command since 1991. But the alliance has not agreed on how to proceed, and few members have indicated any enthusiasm for paying for it. 
The United States currently has such a system, known as J-Stars. And it would like NATO nations to join Washington in developing a system for the alliance. But Europeans have different programs and ideas for how to go about this.
The other subject is development of weapons to attack enemy air defenses, like missiles fired from warplanes that home in on enemy radars. With the public increasingly loath to accept casualties, such suppression of enemy air defense is important. 
But only seven NATO nations have or are acquiring such systems. And of these, few can attack air defenses with real precision. Only the United States has an effective airborne capability to jam enemy communications.
The shortfalls have implications that go beyond NATO. With the encouragement of the United States, NATO has supported the European Union's efforts to develop a rapid reaction force. 
NATO's reasoning was that the European Union force might take on tasks that NATO is not eager to handle. Also, casting defense as an exercise in European integration, allied officials argued, could be a useful way to encourage support in European parliaments for military spending, which could end up benefiting NATO. 
In return, the organization has offered to give the European Union access to its military planners and, on a case-by-case basis, assets like bases and Awacs battle-management planes. 
But Europe's faltering effort raises the question of whether European Union nations are keeping their side of the bargain and whether their rapid reaction force will ever be more than a paper tiger.
"Capabilities is the European side of the bargain," Lord Robertson said. "If we are going to be able to handle a crisis with the E.U. in the lead or NATO in the lead, we need to have a better capability, or the crisis will simply not be tackled."

HEADLINE: Coalition Builder Wins Los Angeles Mayoral Race 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 6 

 BODY:
Riding the solid support of older black and white voters, City Attorney James K. Hahn emerged today as this city's mayor and quickly promised to form a government that reflected not only his coalition but also Latinos, who turned out in record numbers and had hoped to make his opponent, Antonio Villaraigosa, the city's first Hispanic mayor in more than a century.
 Mr. Hahn is a 20-year veteran of local politics and the son of a beloved political family that, with Tuesday's election, became a virtual dynasty, as his sister, Janice, handily won a City Council seat. The Hahns' father, Kenneth, was a county supervisor representing a heavily black district for 40 years ending in 1992. 
 Mr. Hahn beat Mr. Villaraigosa, the former speaker of the State Assembly, 54 percent to 46 percent, and in some ways his victory could be seen as a throwback to an earlier era in a city whose population is now nearly half Hispanic. 
But Mr. Hahn, who is white and who won roughly 80 percent of the city's black vote plus a large majority among conservative whites in the suburban San Fernando Valley, vowed to focus on the future. He said in a news conference this morning that Los Angeles was "poised for greatness, greatness based on the great diversity we have." 
In keeping with his low-key style, Mr. Hahn, who won about 20 percent of the Hispanic vote, said he did not believe Los Angeles was divided, but he acknowledged the strains inherent in the nation's second-largest city by vowing to form a "government that looks like the city it represents."
Rocky Delgadillo, the city's deputy mayor for economic development, won his race to succeed Mr. Hahn as the city's chief lawyer, defeating a longtime city councilman, Mike Feuer, to become the first Latino official elected citywide since Mayor Cristobal Aguilar left office in 1872.
Latino voter turnout edged up to 22 percent of the overall electorate, a record for a municipal election here, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls conducted by the William C. Velazquez Institute, a nonprofit research organization. The institute estimated that about 35 percent of registered Latino voters turned out, roughly the same percentage as the overall voter turnout. 
"This election is going to be seen as the turning point, the first time that Latinos have contended for power in modern Los Angeles history," said Antonio Gonzalez, president of the institute. "In the Villaraigosa campaign in 2001, Latinos began to assert their true leadership. He came close. He set the agenda. He provided cover for Delgadillo to coast to victory behind his heat shield. So I think it is something that, when you really look at it, ultimately indicates a step forward for the city."
Mr. Villaraigosa was upbeat in defeat, declaring at his news conference today: "When they write about it, they'll say we opened a door. We opened a door to opportunity, and it will never be closed again." 
Mr. Hahn, a Democrat like Mr. Villaraigosa, will succeed Mayor Richard J. Riordan, the millionaire Republican businessman who has led the city since 1993 but was barred from seeking a third term and is, in fact, considering seeking the Republican nomination to challenge Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, next year. Mr. Villaraigosa had the support of both Mr. Davis and Mr. Riordan, along with much of organized labor and the state Democratic Party, but Mr. Hahn himself is a foursquare Democrat expected to forge more effective alliances than Mr. Riordan did with the overwhelmingly Democratic City Council. 
Mr. Hahn, 50, and Mr. Villaraigosa, 48, agreed on most municipal issues, like transportation, education and housing. But Mr. Hahn, the city's chief civil lawyer and prosecutor of minor crimes since 1985, consistently portrayed himself as tougher on crime. In the last week of the campaign, he ran a television advertisement that used ominous images of drug paraphernalia to question Mr. Villaraigosa's support for clemency for Carlos Vignali, a convicted drug dealer whose sentence was commuted by President Bill Clinton after Mr. Villaraigosa and other local officials intervened at the request of the man's father, a contributor.
"Obviously, the Vignali ad had an impact," said Art Torres, the chairman of the state Democratic Party. "And there was also the fear factor of a Latino candidate that we were picking up in walking precincts in the San Fernando Valley in recent days. But I think it's very clear that there's a new threshold that appears to have been achieved here, and Antonio has laid the groundwork and there's no turning back now."
Indeed, there was powerful evidence of Mr. Villaraigosa's appeal to newer voters. A survey of voters leaving the polls conducted by The Los Angeles Times found that 5 percent of the electorate was made up of voters casting their first ballots in a California election, and among this group, Mr. Villaraigosa far outperformed Mr. Hahn, drawing 70 percent to 30 percent for Mr. Hahn.
Two of the three incumbent Latino City Council members endorsed Mr. Hahn, and one of them, Alex Padilla, who represents the most heavily Latino district in the city, said he saw the high Latino turnout -- well more than twice the level of the last contested mayoral race eight years ago -- as a good sign.
"Not to say that there weren't any tensions in the campaign," Mr. Padilla said, "but I think they're being overblown."
"In Jim Hahn, we still have a friend in City Hall," he added. "To me, the Latino agenda's the American dream, and that's going to be the agenda for the next four years."
Overall voter turnout stood at about 36 percent of the city's 1.5 million registered voters, well below the 45 percent turnout in the last contested mayoral runoff in 1993. With all precincts reporting in unofficial returns, Mr. Hahn had 293,273 votes to Villaraigosa's 254,491.
Mr. Villaraigosa, a onetime high school dropout and the son of a Mexican immigrant, grew up on the gritty Eastside. He began his career as a bargainer for the teachers' union and became president of the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union in 1994. Term limits propelled him to the speaker's chair four years later and out of office last year, and he began his mayoral campaign, which was considered a long shot.
Still, over two years of campaigning, Mr. Villaraigosa managed to forge a formidable coalition and finished first in a crowded field in the April primary, with 30 percent of the vote then, to 25 percent for Mr. Hahn. But on Tuesday, Mr. Hahn managed to win the overwhelming share of the moderate and conservative voters who had backed other candidates in the primary, and he won a majority of Jewish voters, whom Mr. Villaraigosa had courted aggressively.
Mr. Villaraigosa said he had no plans to run for office at the moment but acknowledged that he has more than $1 million in an account that he could use to run for a State Senate seat that will be vacant next year. Many local politicians expect he might do just that.
In a City Council race to succeed Mike Feuer on the city's politically eclectic Westside, former state Senator Tom Hayden, who left office because of term limits last year, struggled to continue his 20-year political career. He appeared to have lost a tight race with Jack Weiss, a former federal prosecutor, who claimed victory with 25,550 votes to 25,261 for Mr. Hayden, who had yet to concede. Mr. Weiss said he was already planning for his transition to office.

HEADLINE: Jersey City's Mayor-Elect Seeks Wider Prosperity 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, June 6 

 BODY:
Over the last 20 years, developers have transformed Jersey City's waterfront on the Hudson River from a gritty industrial neighborhood to a bustling downtown of gleaming office towers and apartment buildings. Property-tax abatements and other economic incentives have lured the builders and their billions in investment over the two decades.
 But as Glenn D. Cunningham prepared to take over as the mayor of Jersey City after his victory in Tuesday's mayoral runoff, he took notice today of what has been achieved and what has not been achieved here. 
 And in between accepting congratulations from well-wishers, Mr. Cunningham, who will be sworn in July 1, made it clear that one of his goals is to see that the prosperity of the waterfront is shared more evenly with the poor and working-class neighborhoods that have been left far behind. 
"There's a feeling that the city's been too easy to roll over for the developers at the expense of the rest of the city," said Mr. Cunningham, the first black to be elected mayor here. "We want the benefits of the growth and prosperity to filter into the other neighborhoods."
Particularly under the current mayor, Bret D. Schundler, who is seeking the Republican nomination for governor, the waterfront of this city of 240,000 came to be known as the Gold Coast. But Mr. Cunningham said during an interview, "The other neighborhoods are anything but golden neighborhoods."
Mr. Cunningham, 57, said one of his top priorities would be to draft a policy that future tax abatements be linked to developers' willingness to provide money for lower-cost housing, more police officers, two new swimming pools, summer jobs for unemployed teenagers, parks and teams in youth baseball and soccer.
During a victory visit in midafternoon to a grocery store on Newark Avenue, in a frayed commercial district west of the waterfront, Mr. Cunningham took up the issue again with happy supporters. He noted that the population of Jersey City, the state's second-largest city, grew by about 11,000 in the 1990's. Most of the newcomers, he said, settled in new luxury condominiums and high-rent apartments on the waterfront.
"The rest of the city is stagnant," he said. "Development has to penetrate every neighborhood of the city. No one has made the developers care about the rest of Jersey City."
During the visit, Mr. Cunningham said he was proud to be the first black elected mayor here. But he quickly stressed that he wanted to be known as a mayor of all races and ethnic groups. "Jersey City is not a black city, or a Latino city or a white city," he said. "We want to empower all the people."
In Tuesday's nonpartisan runoff election, Mr. Cunningham, a Democrat, beat Tom DeGise, a Democrat and the City Council president, who had been endorsed by Mr. Schundler. Many here viewed the runoff as a referendum on the Schundler era. 
 In Trenton on Wednesday, Mr. Schundler said he thought that Mr. Cunningham had won the race because he generated excitement among black voters, who turned out to the polls in large numbers. 
Mr. Cunningham, a tall, trim man, is no stranger to local politics. From 1981 to 1989, he served on the City Council in the early years of waterfront development. He joined the police force in 1967 after serving in the Marines and rose to the rank of captain. He resigned from the Police Department in 1991 and was Hudson County's director of public safety until 1996, when President Clinton named him head of the United States Marshals Service in New Jersey. Mr. Cunningham resigned from that position in December to run for mayor. 
Mr. Cunningham said today that he considered himself pro-development but added that residents would be more likely to support tax abatements for the waterfront if developers provided tangible benefits for other neighborhoods.
Real estate interests seemed receptive to Mr. Cunningham's comments. Brian C. Doherty, a lawyer who represents some of the waterfront's biggest developers, said his clients were willing to work with Mr. Cunningham.
"Obviously, there is the ability to better utilize monies generated from tax abatements for such things as affordable housing and inner-city commercial development," Mr. Doherty said. "The development community welcomes the opportunity to explore those issues with the administration."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Britain: Rates Held Steady 

BYLINE:  By Suzanne Kapner (NYT) 

 BODY:
 The Bank of England's monetary policy committee voted to hold the benchmark interest rate at 5.25 percent, as the threat from an economic slowdown imported from the United States subsides. 
Recent data show that British consumers are spending more, house prices are rising and tourism is recovering from the country's worst outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease that placed many rural areas off limits. To fight the threat of an economic slowdown, the central bank had reduced rates three times in the last four months, taking the key interest rate to its lowest level in seven months.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
SharesRetreat Amid Doubts About Economy's Revival

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as investors, without any fresh major economic data to consider, cautiously stepped back after four days of gains.
 Discouraging forecasts from Hewlett-Packard and J. P. Morgan Chase added to investors' uncertainty. 
 "Market rallies are brief encounters, to say the least," said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock & Company. "A short-term pullback under the current economic climate just doesn't seem to be surprising." 
He said traders seemed to be nervous as companies prepared quarterly earnings forecasts, adding, "that's why one would expect that under these conditions investors would tip-toe through the tulips."
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 105.60 points, or 0.9 percent, to 11,070.24. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 13.54 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,270.03. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index declined 15.93 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,217.73.
Weak economic reports have led some analysts and economists to revise their predictions about when the economy will rebound. Many are now looking at the second half of the year, at the earliest, in line with remarks from a Federal Reserve governor. That outlook, coupled with fears of dismal earnings forecasts during the next few weeks, has made some investors cautious.
Still, some analysts said yesterday's weakness provided little evidence of the stock market's trend. "I wouldn't put much credence in it from a fundamental standpoint," said John O'Donoghue, co-head of listed trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. "There's no huge drive one way or the other that's got the market doing what it's doing."
Shares of Hewlett-Packard fell $1.34, to $28.71, after company officials told analysts that sales in May were "softer than expected." Carleton S. Fiorina, the company's chairman and chief executive, said the company was "more cautious" about its projections for its fiscal third quarter. 
J. P. Morgan slumped $1.66, to $46.84, after it projected that its trading revenue for the second, third and fourth quarters would be lower than revenue in the first quarter, which totaled $2.09 billion. The company cited seasonal patterns and market conditions. Analysts at Merrill Lynch and Sanford C. Bernstein were among those who cut their earnings estimates for the company.
Shares of oil companies slipped as oil prices declined on a report from the American Petroleum Institute that said oil and gasoline supplies had increased. Exxon Mobil weighed on the Dow, falling $2.15, to $89.40. Chevron slipped $1.54, to $96.16; Phillips Petroleum fell $1.22, to $63.30; and Royal Dutch Petroleum lost $1.98, to $60.27.
Technology stocks, which have had a run-up as investors started to favor the sector again, were mixed.
Shares of Sun Microsystems gained 59 cents, to $17.61, after Laura Conigliaro, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said that the "worst may be over" for the company.
 --------------------

Treasury Prices Mixed
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Bond prices were mixed yesterday after Laurence H. Meyer, a Federal Reserve governor, said economic growth was likely to be "sluggish" until sometime in the third quarter, a sign the central bank may lower interest rates further.
Mr. Meyer, who spoke to the New York Association for Business Economics, said "the economy isn't likely to rebound soon," and that is good for bonds, said James Caron, a fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch.
The price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 3/32, to 98 3/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.23 percent from 5.27 percent on Tuesday.
The 30-year bond was unchanged at 96 1/32. Its yield was 5.65 percent.

HEADLINE: Circuit City Says It Expects Results to Improve 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va., June 6 

 BODY:
Circuit City Stores Inc. said today that it expected to report better-than-expected results for its fiscal first quarter and that it planned to cut its stake in CarMax Group by 10 percent to help pay for the remodeling of its electronics stores.
 Earnings in the quarter ended May 31 fell to 4 cents a share from 28 cents in the quarter a year earlier, said Dandy Barrett, a spokeswoman. 
Analysts were forecasting a loss of 3 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Circuit will report final results on June 15. 
 Sales at stores open at least a year fell 25 percent, more than the 20 percent drop that Circuit City forecast in March for the first and second quarters. The company has attributed the sales decline to a slowdown in consumer spending on high-price products like computers. Excluding appliances, same-store sales fell 13 percent. Same-store sales are an important indicator of a retailer's business because they exclude new and closed locations.
The retailer, which has said five times since July that profit would miss analysts' forecasts, has been cutting jobs and revamping stores to exit the appliance business and increase sales of electronics.
The company said that while computer sales remained slow, purchases of technology items in space previously allocated to appliances will rise. A new advertising campaign also is helping sales and the release of Microsoft's Windows XP computer operating system in October should also help increase sales. Circuit City will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission within the next week to sell 7.5 million of CarMax's tracking shares. Shares of Circuit City, based in Richmond, fell 14 cents, to $15.67.

HEADLINE: Metro Business Briefing Cisco Thinks Smaller 

BYLINE:  By Charles V. Bagli (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Cisco Systems, a manufacturer of computer networking equipment, is backing away from plans to take a major block of space in the proposed 37-story, 1.3-million-square-foot tower over the north wing of the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Eighth Avenue. The company, based in San Jose, Calif., had initially talked about having a major presence in the tower, about 500,000 square feet. That would have enabled the developers, the Lawrence Ruben Company and Vornado Realty Trust, to start construction on the project. But Cisco has been battered by a slowing economy and a drop in its stock price. "We have decided not to seek additional space in New York City right now," said Steve Landon, a spokesman for Cisco. "We are staying in New York and expect to grow there over time. We'll continue conversations about new locations." The company currently has about 100,000 square feet at 1 Penn Plaza, a building owned by Vornado.

HEADLINE: Hewlett-Packard Plans New Cuts in Costs 

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
Hewlett-Packard, contending that falling demand has spread to Asia and Latin America, said yesterday that it planned to further cut costs to increase the probability it can meet the earnings forecasts of analysts.
 At a meeting with securities analysts in Cupertino, Calif., Carleton S. Fiorina, chairman and chief executive of the company, said demand had slowed, making a point to single out China and noting that "this is a global economic slowdown which may last for some time." 
 The company did not modify its earnings projection, saying it continues to expect quarterly revenue to equal or be 5 percent less than the previous quarter, when it took in $11.6 billion. However, some industry analysts said the tenor of yesterday's announcement was leading them to modify their own earnings and revenue projections. 
"The question is whether we'll take them down a lot, or a little," said John B. Jones Jr., an industry analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, noting he plans to further analyze his projections in coming days. Mr. Jones initially had projected Hewlett-Packard would report earnings of 24 cents a share for its third fiscal quarter, which ends on July 31, compared to a consensus of industry analysts polled by Thomson Financial/ First Call of 23 cents a share.
The news from Hewlett-Packard follows a spate of earnings warnings from technology companies, including one last week from Sun Microsystems. Intel, the giant chip maker, has an announcement planned for today and Dan Niles, a computer and semiconductor industry analyst with Lehman Brothers, said he expected the company to join the list of companies warning it was suffering from a slowdown.
Mr. Niles attributed the flow of pre-announcements in part to a failure by companies to appreciate the gravity of a slowdown in information-technology spending overseas. "Everyone is so focused on the U.S., but they forget that over half the world's I.T. spending comes outside the U.S.," he said, adding that the prospect that the economy would turn around during the second quarter was getting less likely. 
Many analysts said the slowdown had reached its bottom in the second quarter. "Now they're calling that into question," Mr. Niles said. "This could drag on for some time."
As for Hewlett-Packard, Mr. Jones said the news from the company was neither surprising nor a particular indictment of the company's own efforts. Rather, he said Hewlett-Packard, like many of its competitors in the technology business, was succumbing predominately to macro-economic pressures.
The company said it still expected to cut $1 billion from expenses by the end of its 2002 fiscal year, including being on pace to cut 3,000 jobs by the end of this quarter.
Mr. Jones said the company had stated that it partially shifted its cost-cutting strategy, finding that it would have to increase spending on information technology and make up for those increases with additional cuts elsewhere in the budget. Mr. Jones said he found the shift encouraging because it suggested the company was not "just taking a hatchet but cutting intelligently and evaluating how to get their cost structure down."
Wendy I. Abramowitz, a market strategist with Argus Research, an investment research firm, said the continued stagnation in the United States and Europe was not surprising, but that the additional slowdown in Asia was of some concern. She said Hewlett-Packard could find itself facing increasing pricing pressure from other computer makers seeking to maintain or build market share amid a sluggish market.
Ms. Abramowitz said earnings might have bottomed out for Hewlett-Packard, but that its revenue might continue to deteriorate.
Last month, Hewlett-Packard reported earnings of 18 cents a share, 3 cents more than the prognosis of Wall Street analysts who had twice lowered their projections. 
Mr. Jones said he had initially projected profits of $487 million on revenues of $11.6 billion but said he would re-evaluate those figures.

HEADLINE: Don't Count on That Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By Robert D. Reischauer; Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, was the director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1989 to 1995.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush will sign his long-promised tax cut today. But conservatives shouldn't break out the champagne just yet, nor should liberals start taking their antidepressants. 
 Passing the cuts was easy. Mesmerized by projections of mountainous surpluses, few legislators could say no. But Congress and the president have turned their attention to crafting solutions to the nation's other problems, and now the real battle over taxes will begin. When the dust from this struggle settles, much of the relief the tax bill promises for later this decade is likely to be delayed, scaled back or repealed altogether. 
 Already, we know that there is bipartisan support in Congress for spending significantly more money on elementary and secondary education, defense and a Medicare prescription drug benefit. Other costly new proposals include a reform of the flawed farm support program, the president's energy plan and assistance to those without health insurance.
The costs of the tax cuts, the new initiatives and the government's ongoing activities are likely to strain available revenues. Barring an unexpected explosion of economic growth, the Treasury will have to dip into the Medicare and Social Security surpluses to pay for the income tax cuts scheduled for 2004 and 2006, the marriage-penalty relief that will start in 2005 and the elimination of the estate tax in 2010. 
How can the Medicare and Social Security surpluses be protected? Paradoxically, the much-derided timing gimmicks in the tax bill, which keep its sticker price below the $1.35 trillion limit allowed by the budget resolution, will give Congress an opportunity to reconsider its generosity.
One gimmick involves the termination after 2005 of the deduction for college tuition and of relief for those facing the alternative minimum tax, both of which start this year. If Congress doesn't extend them, many Americans -- particularly those in high-tax states like New York -- will be hit with tax increases in 2006.
So lawmakers will be under pressure to renew the breaks well before they expire. If they want to continue the provisions, while also allowing the 2004 and 2006 income tax cuts and the full repeal of the estate tax to take place, they will have to tap into the trust fund surpluses even more.
As they consider this possibility, lawmakers will inevitably look ahead to the consequences of a second gimmick they tucked into the tax bill -- the Cinderella provision that magically terminates the entire act at midnight on Dec. 31, 2010, just to keep the 10-year costs of the bill within the budget.
Extending the fully implemented tax bill through the following decade -- at a cost of over $4 trillion -- would require digging deep into the Medicare and Social Security surpluses or drastically reducing basic government services. Not extending the bill would trigger a big tax increase in 2011.
Every politician knows that it is easier to take away promised tax relief that has not yet been enjoyed than to raise actual taxes or cut existing programs. And so they will undoubtedly take the more fiscally sustainable and politically prudent route of scaling back or rescinding the 2004 and 2006 income tax cuts and reducing, rather than eliminating, the estate tax -- before any of these cuts takes effect. These actions would protect the nation's ability to support retiring baby boomers while maintaining necessary government programs.
As the rhetoric about tax cuts rings forth today, rest assured that the final outcome is almost surely not yet decided. Some of the excessive cuts will probably never come to pass -- which is what happened in the 1980's, when Congress passed legislation in 1982, 1983 and 1984 that rolled back about one-third of Ronald Reagan's huge 1981 tax cut.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
In America, to therichest go the biggest tax benefits. So what else is new?

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; This column appears here every Thursday. Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and a fellow at the Shorenstein Center at Harvard. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
HISTORY may judge it a little odd that after the greatest accrual of private wealth in a century, the United States decided to give its richest citizens a giant tax break. But in truth, favoring the wealthy has become a habit in Washington for a couple of decades, and may help explain why so many average Americans feel the federal government does not do much for them. Even President Bill Clinton adopted policy after policy that disproportionately benefited those who made the most money.
 I am referring to what are commonly called "tax expenditures." These are credits to and deductions from federal income taxes that usually reward some kinds of spending or saving. When businesses deduct the health care benefits they pay employees, for example, it is a sizable loss of revenue to the government. In effect, it is a government expenditure that subsidizes health insurance for the employed -- usually those employed by big corporations. The same is true of deductions for pensions and countless special corporate benefits, like accelerated depreciation. 
 The home mortgage interest deduction, so popular among all Americans, is among the largest such tax expenditures, costing the federal government some $100 billion a year. Individual retirement accounts, which enable Americans to deduct contributions, are also tax expenditures.
There are two reasons these programs almost always favor the wealthy. First, the higher the tax bracket, the more valuable the deduction. Second, people who are better off can spend more than others can. They buy bigger homes, so they get a larger mortgage deduction. They put more away in pension programs, so they benefit more from the tax advantages.
The top 10 percent of earners, for example, receive 24 percent of employer-sponsored health insurance benefits. Imagine the federal government giving $1,700 a year for health insurance to families that earn $100,000 to $200,000 a year but only $150 to those that earn $10,000 to $20,000. That is exactly what the current health care deductions add up to, says Jacob Hacker, a fellow at Harvard University.
The deductions for pension accounts, including I.R.A.'s, are skewed even further toward the wealthy, with the top 20 percent of earners receiving two-thirds of the benefits. 
Furthermore, as the political scientist Christopher Howard points out, the nation's policy makers do not know how effective or efficient the programs are. Mr. Howard thinks they are often wasteful. Many employees take more health insurance than they need because the corporation gets a tax benefit and the beneficiary is not taxed on the benefits received. Or, Mr. Howard says, the home mortgage deduction may encourage purchases of enormous houses. Or consider credits for college tuition: most of the people who use them would send their children to college anyway.
But the appeal of tax expenditures is compelling in an age of tight federal budgets because they do not appear to cost the government anything. "Even most Democratic legislators have forgotten how to defend direct government spending," says Mr. Howard, who has published a book on the subject, "The Hidden Welfare State" (Princeton University Press). "So, rather than make outright payments, they resort to these measures."
Several agencies estimate that tax expenditures now total $700 billion to $800 billion a year. When combined with traditional social programs, that makes true social spending in the United States about as large as it is anywhere compared with the size of the economy. Mr. Hacker figures that the combined social programs and tax expenditures, after taxes, come to 24.5 percent of gross domestic product each year in the United States. But in Sweden, which is widely criticized for running a welfare state, the equivalent social programs and tax expenditures are only slightly higher, at 27 percent of G.D.P. In Britain, they are 26 percent, and in the Netherlands 25 percent. The United States, however, has the highest proportion of tax expenditures.
That is a lot of money for programs that favor the wealthy, and it may not be an efficient use of money. But the United States keeps adopting tax-expenditure policies. Under Mr. Clinton, there was a tax credit for long-term care, more tax benefits for higher education, additional tax breaks for health insurance and still further breaks for retirement. Under President Bush's tax-cut plan, the allowable contribution to I.R.A.'s would ultimately more than double, to $5,000, but most Americans do not even participate in the program, let alone contribute the maximum. Limits on itemized deductions are also being raised.
What particularly grates is the complaint that there is no money in the budget for social programs. A sensible cap could be placed on the health insurance deduction for business, for example, and the regained revenues could be directed toward health insurance for the uninsured or to subsidize small business to provide employee health insurance. The health insurance deduction costs the federal government approximately $70 billion a year.
It may also make sense to reduce rather than increase the maximum allowable contributions to pension plans. The current limit for contributions to 401(k) plans is $10,500. Under the new tax law, it will eventually rise to $15,000. Why not cut it back and use the funds to help needier workers?
The relatively new Roth I.R.A.'s are especially costly because, in contrast to conventional pension programs, the proceeds are not taxed at all when withdrawn if they are used for certain purposes, like putting down a deposit to buy a house. There are a wide range of corporate deductions, involving special depreciation allowances and upfront deductions for capital expenditures, which are also ripe for cutting back.
The point is that there is plenty of grist for the social mill. It would be nice if a few legislators started to be straightforward about the true costs of tax expenditures, despite their popularity. They should be at best only one of many tools to make new social policy, but they have become nearly the only tool available.

HEADLINE: Willing but Wary, Irish Vote on Wider Europe 

BYLINE:  By BRIAN LAVERY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, June 6 

 BODY:
On the surface, a referendum in Ireland on Thursday is asking voters a basic question: should the European Union be expanded to include poorer Eastern European countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic?
 While the "yes" vote is expected to prevail by a fair margin, the referendum has raised broader questions, and some soul-searching, about Ireland's relationship with Europe. 
 "This is payback time for us," said Prime Minister Bertie Ahern when he began the government's "Vote yes" campaign. "This is our chance to show that generosity of spirit that was shown to us so often in the past." 
He was referring to Ireland's years of taking $25 billion in aid from the European Union when it was one of the poorer relations. German taxpayers, so the story goes, paid for Irish roads.
That changed when the boom of the 90's filled Ireland's coffers. But now, just as the Irish will start giving rather than receiving aid, they find they also have the power to shut the door on poorer applicants.
Technically, the decision is an yes-or-no vote on the Treaty of Nice, which sets the stage for expanding the European Union to 27 members during the coming decade. Of the 15 current members, only Ireland -- which has approved four other referendums on the union -- is requiring a vote to approve the treaty.
Most everyone agrees with Mr. Ahern's altruistic message that it is time for Ireland to share the wealth. So the debate has centered on emotionally charged issues like Ireland's historic neutrality and the concept of a two-tier Europe, in which smaller members lose their voices in the councils that determine policy.
According to the Irish government, the decision is simple: the Treaty of Nice sets up an administrative framework to expand the union.
According to the vociferous "No to Nice" campaign, which includes such odd political alliances as Sinn Fein, the Green Party and assorted right-wing groups, the treaty is hardly so innocuous. It will lead to a European army, they say, which would compromise Ireland's neutrality, and the treaty transfers too many decisions to Brussels.
An antitreaty campaign poster on nearly every Dublin street corner spells it out clearly: "You will lose!" it screams in capital letters on a blood-red background. And in case voters are not sure what is at stake: "Power. Money. Freedom."
The "Vote yes" campaign has tried to pass off such claims as paranoid posturing. Mr. Ahern has said English and American interests paid for the posters, a claim that nearly led to a lawsuit against him. 
But the prime minister's message of helping poorer countries has been echoed by influential groups like trade unions and the association of Catholic bishops. In an editorial last week, the Irish Farmers' Journal asked, "With 0.75 percent of the population of the European Union , could we seriously expect the torturously put together treaty to be renegotiated to suit our concerns?"
As it stands, the treaty already suits Irish concerns quite well: when it was negotiated over four long days last December, Ireland and England successfully fought against proposals to harmonize tax rates across the European Union. Ireland uses its low corporate tax rate of 10 percent (compared to more than 30 percent elsewhere on the continent) to encourage multinational companies to set up operations here.
Critics say greater economic unity with Europe will eventually threaten Ireland's control over issues like taxes. France's prime minister, Lionel Jospin, corroborated those fears in Paris last week, saying, "It is not acceptable for certain member-states to practice unfair tax competition."
Should the public reject the treaty, Irish politicians are likely to be greeted with daggers drawn when they go back to the negotiating table to work out a new version. A similar, less serious spat occurred last winter, when Ireland's finance minister, Charlie McCreevy, was publicly scolded at a ministerial meeting for his refusal to follow European Union guidelines in his annual budget.
It remains to be seen whether voters understand such issues, let alone care about them. An Irish Times poll found that 27 percent of people are still undecided on the Treaty of Nice. Two other domestic items on Thursday's ballot -- the abolition of the death penalty, and recognizing the international criminal court -- are expected to pass by wide majorities.
"Our approach to Europe has always been very short term, very pragmatic and very utilitarian," said Dr. Ben Tonra, deputy director of the European Institute at University College Dublin.

PERSON: Joseph P. McMurray 

HEADLINE: Joseph P. McMurray, 89, An Expert on Housing Policy 

BYLINE:  By PAUL LEWIS

 BODY:
Joseph P. McMurray, an expert on national and New York housing policy who was chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and president of three colleges, died on May 21 at Long Beach Medical Center on Long Island. He was 89.
 From 1959 to 1961 he was president of Queensborough Community College. He returned from government to the world of education in 1965, becoming president of Queens College of the City University of New York, a post he held during years of student unrest in the late 1960's. From 1970 to 1975 he was president of the College of New Rochelle. 
 Mr. McMurray thought government had a duty to provide everyone with access to suitable housing. His long association with housing began in 1948, when he was staff director of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, which had jurisdiction over housing matters. He played a role in drafting the 1949 Housing Act, which expanded the supply of housing for low-income families and encouraged urban renewal.
In 1954 he became executive director of the New York City Housing Authority, with responsibility for the city's low-cost housing program. The next year he was appointed New York State commissioner for housing under Gov. W. Averell Harriman and oversaw the Mitchell-Lama program, which encouraged developers to build housing that people of moderate means could afford.
In 1960 he published a report, requested by the National Association of Home Builders, on low-cost rental housing. It led to a federal program to encourage private developers to build rental apartments for the poor in the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965.
In 1961, the newly elected president, John F. Kennedy, asked Mr. McMurray to be chairman of his Task Force on Housing and Urban Affairs. The next year, President Kennedy summoned him back to Washington to become chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, a bank regulatory agency established during the Depression to oversee and provide liquidity for savings and loan institutions. 
Mr. McMurray was born in the Bronx on March 4, 1912. He received a bachelor's degree in economics at Brooklyn College in 1936 and did postgraduate work at the New School for Social Research. He then worked as an economist and statistician for federal agencies, including the Department of Commerce, National Resources Planning Board and Bureau of Labor Statistics.
He published studies on many aspects of housing policy, examining cooperative housing and housing for the aged in Europe and the United States.
Mr. McMurray's first wife, the former Isabelle Kenny, died in 1960. His second wife, the former RoseMarie Barker, died in 1996. He became a resident of Atlantic Beach, N.Y., in 1998. 
He is survived by four sons, Gerald, of Alexandria, Va.; Joseph, of Atlantic Beach; Kevin, of Brewster, N.Y.; and Brien, of Severna Park, Md.; and by two daughters, Kathleen Nelson of Atlantic Beach and Isabelle Pullis of Centerport, N.Y.

HEADLINE: The Ballyhoo's Over and Britain Is Voting 

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, June 6 

 BODY:
The battle buses made their final journeys, the candidates declaimed their final speeches in rallies around the country and workers stuffed mailboxes with 11th-hour get-out-the-vote leaflets as Britain's national election campaign came to an end tonight.
 "The future of Britain is on the ballot paper tomorrow," Tony Blair said in West Yorkshire. His Conservative rival, William Hague, countered in Hampshire, "Tomorrow the world will find out that the forces of conservatism are on the march." 
 On Thursday the country will be electing the 659 members of Parliament and determining whether Mr. Blair, 48, will, as expected, achieve his ambition to serve a second term, and by what telltale measure of support. 
Despite intense door-to-door canvassing, main street button-holing by incumbents and hopefuls, and multipage sections of newspaper coverage and extended radio and television attention, all indications were that the British public had generally clung to the same voting intentions it had when all the sound bites and photo calls began four weeks ago.
Election eve polls continued to show Labor and its candidate, Mr. Blair, with steady double-digit leads over the Conservatives and their leader, Mr. Hague, 40. The numbers translate into another parliamentary majority similar to the 179-seat one he gained in the last election, in 1997. 
"Very few British election campaigns decide the outcome," said Anthony King, professor of government at Essex University. "In the United States, voters are frequently confronted with at least one or two unknown or little known candidates. Here, voters have four or five years to make a judgment about a government's record in office and form opinions about the main opposition party and its probable performance if it were to win." 
That didn't stop Labor, the Conservatives and the third party Liberal Democrats from mounting media-conscious campaigns aimed at influencing people's choices. Still, with all the stage-managing, the most telling moments in the campaign were the unscripted ones. 
Mr. Blair was forced to come face to face with voter disgust over crumbling public services when a woman interrupted his tour of a Birmingham hospital to lecture him angrily on how her partner had been poorly treated there. The incident caused Labor to step up its emphasis on new spending promises, with the campaign changing its theme slogan in later days from "The Work Goes On" to "Schools and Hospitals First".
As for Mr. Hague, he was thrown on the defensive when a Conservative Treasury spokesman let slip that the party planned on $:20 billion ($29 billion) in tax cuts, a number that Labor artfully converted into the amount of money that the Conservatives would be taking out of public services. 
The profile of the national attitude arising out of all the opinion sampling suggested that Britons, while distinctly unconvinced by Mr. Blair and his New Labor project, were prepared to grant him a second term to see if he could redeem the ambitious promises he made in the first. 
Mr. Hague, who took over the party in 1997 less than two months after it received the worst drubbing from Labor in its history, may have faced an impossible task in trying to turn out the government after only four years.
"The Blair government has been the first very normal and competent Labor government, the first ever Labor government not only to preside over an economic crisis but to actually deliver economic success," Mr. King said. "They found themselves confronting a Labor Party in power that appeals to Conservative instincts and Conservative voters."
"Second," he said, "the British public always prefers Labor on major public services, and that was the issue of this campaign."
Mr. Hague told cheering supporters in Winchester today that "the forces of conservatism," reviled in a famous Blair party convention speech, were in fact "on the march." He said that the key choice for voters was whether Britain keeps the pound or joins the single European currency.
"Here in Winchester," he said, "the coins of our nation were minted for a very long time. The fact that we have had our own currency and coinage has been part of the independence of our country. Those people you see with Labor posters want to destroy the independence of our country within two years."
Mr. Blair has said that within two years he will decide whether the time is right for a promised referendum on Britain's swapping the pound for the euro. Mr. Hague has said he will bar any consideration of entering monetary union for at least five years, and he has pledged to renegotiate existing treaties with Europe to get Britain a better deal. 
Mr. Blair spent his last day on a helicopter dash to stops in England, Wales and Scotland, urging his crowds not to take Labor's win for granted because of its persistent lead in the polls. He sought to link Mr. Hague with former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who in the past week has campaigned for the Tories, sometimes on positions that go beyond the party stance.
"Today's Conservative Party is effectively Thatcherism plus," he said. "It's a more extreme version of the Thatcherism than we had, and it's pretty obvious who would be pulling the strings if they came back."

PERSON: Rosemary Verey 

HEADLINE: Rosemary Verey, 82, Dies; Grew Legendary Gardens in England and Tutored America 

BYLINE:  By ANNE RAVER

 BODY:
Rosemary Verey, the tough, artistic English gardener who brought the art of clipped boxwoods, laburnum walks and ornamental vegetable gardening to America, died in Chelsea Memorial Hospital in London on May 31. She was 82.
 "She was a marvelous lecturer and she knew so much," said Gregory Long, the president of the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. He first heard her speak about her famous garden at Barnsley House, a 17th-century rectory in the Cotswolds of England, about 20 years ago at the Horticultural Alliance of the Hamptons. 
 The four-acre garden was her working laboratory, where she domesticated elements from legendary gardens, like the yellow-flowering laburnum arch at the National Trust's Bodnant Garden, in North Wales, or the ornamental potager, or vegetable garden, at the Chateau de Villandry, in the Loire Valley in France, and made them seem possible for the home gardener. 
Mr. Long remembers staring longingly at the slides of the neo-Classical temple that Mrs. Verey's husband, David Verey, an architectural historian, had dismantled in an English park and rebuilt himself, stone by stone.
"It was a really good lesson in garden-building," Mr. Long said. "None of this redwood pergola stuff from catalogues."
Years later, when he became the president of the New York Botanical Garden, he would ask her to design an ornamental vegetable garden for the Bronx, complete with cold frames for extending the seasons and herbs that are used by gardeners from other cultures. She was working on the design with the sculptor Simon Verity the week that she died of pneumonia, possibly contracted while flying to Cincinnati and on to Kentucky to work on gardens there.
She was mentor to many American garden leaders like Marco Polo Stufano, who transformed Wave Hill, the public garden in the Riverdale section of the Bronx; Robert Dash, the painter who created the Madoo Conservancy, on the East End of Long Island, and Mr. Long.
Ms. Verey wrote more than a dozen garden books including "The Classic Garden" and "The Garden in Winter," which were seminal works for Americans interested in design and sophisticated use of plants, with color and texture year-round.
In her later years, she designed gardens for British celebrities like Prince Charles and Elton John. But her favorite people were gardeners. She often gave them cuttings and seeds from plants she herself had clipped or gathered from such legendary gardens as Gethsemane, outside the city of Jerusalem, or Monet's garden at Giverny. 
For more than 20 years she redesigned the grounds around Barnsley House, which is near Cirencester, in Gloucestershire, first with her laburnum arch, which dangles chains of gold flowers over purple alliums in May. Her husband laid the path beneath, a mosaic of colorful stone and pebbles collected from the Pembrokeshire beaches.
"She had an impeccable eye for color, an ability to embroider gold against purple," said Mr. Dash, whose gardens at Madoo, in Sagaponack, N.Y., are widely considered an American work of art. "She took that grim forbidding aristocratic face off English gardening, and with her charm and her writings, gave it a friendly, domesticated face."
Mr. Dash and Ms. Verey would occasionally lecture together, playfully arguing over whose garden was more original and just who stole from whom. Did Ms. Verey really swipe her famous laburnum arch from Bodnant?
"Of course!" Mr. Dash said, laughing. "But my laburnum arch bears no resemblance to hers. It's a question of following your own light."
She studied mathematics and economics at University College in London, but left before earning her degree to marry Mr. Verey in 1939, and proceeded to raise four children, like a proper English gentlewoman of her day. She was an accomplished horsewoman, until she fell in a hunting accident.
"A horse rolled over on her," Mr. Dash said. "So her husband gave her a book on mandrakes that piqued her interest." And a temple just to get her started.
A scholar and perfectionist, she began to read widely, collecting rare first editions usually seen only in the British Museum or the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library. Her redesign project began in 1950, and the grounds opened to the public in 1970. By the time her husband died in 1984, she had started a new career, and a garden that would eventually attract 30,000 visitors a year.
She lectured widely in the United States, where she made five or six trips a year to cities like New York, Seattle, Atlanta or Chicago, or to Indiana and Kentucky. "Flower shows in winter and the garden clubs in spring and summer," Mr. Long said. "We began to see a lot of laburnum arches in the Hamptons."
She took many young gardeners under her wing, drilling them in the Latin names of plants, and shooing them off for the day to plunge into the great gardens of England.
"She would get very cross with us if we didn't speak to the head gardener," recalled Mr. Stufano, who with his companion, John Nally, spent many days in the gardens at Barnsley. "Her garden was a very personal garden. She was always trying new things. It had the feeling of someone who loved plants and she was out in it constantly. She was a wonderful cook and one of my fond memories is being sent out to the garden for a few marrows, or zucchinis, for dinner."
Long before Mr. Long became president of the New York Botanical Garden, he made a gardener's pilgrimage to Barnsley, to learn some secrets for his place upstate. He had been happily wandering about in the rain, poking about as gardeners do, when he saw her looking out the window.
"She was so imposing in those days, I was a bit intimidated by her," he said. "I almost wished that she not come out. She showed me Phlomis fruticosa, which is a silver-leafed thing with yellow flowers in the fall. I tried to grow it at home and couldn't." 
Then she locked the gate and invited him in for drinks. Years later, at his own garden upstate, she sat on his compost pile and showed him how to dry the bulbs he had carelessly thrown away. They bloomed the next year.
Her influence was not restricted to naive Americans. David Wheeler, the editor of Hortus, a garden quarterly in England, who has built, with the artist Simon Dorell, a garden on the edge of Wales, was also nurtured by Ms. Verey, who opened up her library, garden and larder to him. 
She was a great networker, or Miss Fix-It, as Mr. Wheeler put it. When he admitted that he would like to meet Prince Charles, she simply rang him up. "Be here at 5," she said." "We're expected at Highgrove at 6."
Her vegetable garden, a tapestry of ever-changing cabbages, lettuces, strawberries, hop vines and espaliered fruit trees, "has become a cliche copied around the world," Mr. Wheeler said. "But she made us look at growing vegetables in these times of peace and well-being. We were no longer digging for victory and growing rows of vegetables. We could do this decoratively."
She also reinvented the formal garden, he said, with little parterres of clipped boxwood. "Those had been part of the English garden since Elizabethan times," he said, "but it had all but washed away with modernism and the 20th century." 
In 1999, Ms. Verey received a special award from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society for her work with English gardens, and the same year, was given the Royal Horticultural Society's most distinguished award, the Victoria Medal of Honor. 
She leaves two sons and two daughters. Over the last two years, her son Charles has overseen the gardens, which are still open to the public. "But the eye is gone," Mr. Dash said. "The artist is gone."

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Some Progress With Chinese onTrade 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, June 6 

 BODY:
The United States and China have narrowed their differences over farm subsidies, the thorniest issue holding up Chinese entry into the World Trade Organization. But many more questions must be resolved if China is to enter the global forum this year, the chief American trade official said today.
 The official, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said that two days of talks with Chinese negotiators on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting here had made some progress in setting limits for Chinese subsidies of fruit, vegetables and specialty agricultural products. And he said that the discussions had broadened to other W.T.O. membership issues, including details of how China would open its insurance, distribution and retail industries to foreign participation. 
 "I think it moved closer," Mr. Zoellick said of the Chinese position on farm subsidies, "and I think in that context the Chinese wanted to discuss other issues as well, so they're all going on together."
But he said that the talks would have to make quick headway if China is to join the organization in time to participate in a new round of global trade talks, which the United States and others hope to set in motion at a meeting at Doha, Qatar, in November.
China has trade agreements with the United States and many other individual nations, and questions over the details of those agreements have stalled the drafting of an accord necessary for China to join the organization. A principal American worry has been that subsidized Chinese produce could flood the United States, hurting domestic growers.
Advances in refrigerated shipping and mass distribution have made it possible for fruit and vegetables to enter markets that were logistically out of reach a few years ago, increasing the competitive pressure on local growers. Most recently, raspberry farmers in Washington State complained about imported fruit from Chile, which they contend is sold in the United States for less than it costs to grow and pick. 
The notion of competing with state-subsidized fruit and vegetable growers in a country China's size rattles some American farmers, Mr. Zoellick said.
Japan, which has protected its farmers from being undercut by cheaper produce from the United States, is already dealing with China's growing agricultural exports. It has temporarily raised import duties on inexpensive Chinese leeks, shiitake mushrooms and rushes used to make tatami mats for home use.
In response, China has threatened to halve its import of Japanese cars this year.
Mr. Zoellick said that the United States, which today set in motion steps that could lead to restrictions on steel imports, was not contradicting the wider free trade message it is promoting in China and other developing countries. "Sometimes the view in some quarters of the world is that the United States is always the market of last resort," he said, adding that is one reason Washington had a $370 billion current-account deficit last year. 
"If other countries are unwilling to move forward," he said, "we will take care of our own economic interests, whether with bilateral agreements, regional agreements or other steps."
In addition to settling its differences with the United States, China must reach agreement with Mexico, which has not yet endorsed the Chinese bid for W.T.O. entry. The Mexican president, Vicente Fox, who arrived in Beijing today, promised that his government would be flexible in negotiations and would work for China's speedy entry into the trade organization.

HEADLINE: City Officials Agree on Budget With $500 Million Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council reached an agreement yesterday on a $39.6 billion budget that would trim the city's income and sales taxes while restoring money to libraries, cultural institutions and services for the elderly that the mayor had sought to cut.
 The tentative budget settlement comes after earlier predictions that the Council might be forced to adopt its own spending plan this year because of disagreements with Mr. Giuliani on the tax and spending plan, particularly when it came to money for city schools. 
 But yesterday, a handshake between Mr. Giuliani and Speaker Peter F. Vallone ended the division, as the two agreed to a compromise package of $500 million in tax cuts, and the mayor backed off his plan to set aside $80 million to hire private companies to run some of the city's most troubled schools, and he offered to add money to keep city health clinics open. 
"A budget is a compromise," Mr. Giuliani said yesterday evening, standing in the City Hall rotunda alongside Mr. Vallone and nearly a dozen other City Council members. "You win some and you lose some."
The agreement would eliminate part of a surcharge on the personal income tax first imposed during the Dinkins administration, saving a household whose income is about $95,000 a year about $83 annually. The local tax on clothing purchases would be eliminated, as would a $2 fee on hotel rooms. Parents with children in child care would receive a new city tax credit, and more than 3,000 businesses in parts of Manhattan would no longer have to pay a tax on their rent. Most of the tax changes still need to be approved by legislators in Albany.
Leaders of the City Council -- which is expected to approve the budget as early as today -- complimented the mayor and their staffs, expressing broad satisfaction with a package that includes a collection of initiatives that seem tailor-made for Mr. Vallone's mayoral campaign, like a new prescription drug benefit for the elderly.
But school officials were not nearly as pleased. Even with the abandonment of the effort to hire private companies to run certain troubled schools, they said they were disappointed with their $11.5 billion allotment, which the Giuliani administration said was about a $50 million increase from the current fiscal year.
That increase, school officials said, is not enough to cover inflationary growth in spending. Restrictions have been placed on other school funds, and school officials estimated that they would need to find about $200 million in savings just to maintain existing services for the 1.1 million students.
"We have to take teachers out of school or reduce programs that all of us agree are tremendously valuable to children," said Deputy Chancellor Anthony Shorris.
Councilman Herbert E. Berman, chairman of the Finance Committee, said that the Council and the administration would be prepared, at the end of this summer, to discuss possible additional funds for the schools, but that Chancellor Harold O. Levy must first reduce spending on school administration.
"All they have to do is become accountable," Mr. Berman said.
The negotiations followed an annual ritual in which the mayor proposes large cuts only to have the Council restore much of that money during ensuing negotiations.
The budget for the 2002 fiscal year -- which begins July 1 -- includes about $50 million worth of restorations in spending on city libraries, $20 million in restored funds for hundreds of museums and cultural institutions, $5 million in reinstated spending for the elderly and $3.5 million in money that was going to be cut from parks and recreation programs.
There is also about $55 million in new spending for initiatives proposed by the City Council, like a $5 million program to help elderly citizens buy prescription drugs, $5 million in extra money for H.I.V. prevention programs and $5 million for initiatives that will try to reverse a recent rise in the city's infant mortality rate.
On the mayor's side, there is money to offer enhanced science and English classes to more than 40,000 students on the weekends, as well as about 50,000 more slots in the summer school program, among other initiatives.
Council members yesterday were particularly pleased with $4 million added to the budget to ensure that about 20 health clinics the Health and Hospitals Corporation had proposed to close will be maintained. As with the school system, Council officials have told the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the nation's largest public hospital system, that if it runs out of money, the Council is prepared to help. The system expects to run a large deficit in this fiscal year.
"If they have a problem with cash flow, we are committed to look and provide the means," said Councilman Victor L. Robles, chairman of the Health Committee.
Mr. Vallone dismissed suggestions that any of these new initiatives were intended to aid his mayoral campaign.
"The best politics is simply good government," Mr. Vallone said.
The total tax cut package agreed upon is $21 million less in the 2002 fiscal year than the mayor had first requested, but $151 million more than the Council had proposed.
Even with the new spending and tax cuts agreed to yesterday, city officials said they were confident that the next mayor would not be left with large budget deficits.
Yesterday's budget plan includes $25 billion over the next four years for city construction projects. Among the dozens of projects included on this capital plan are a new family court in Brooklyn, the renovation and expansion of the Museum of Modern Art, and the new Guggenheim Museum in Lower Manhattan.
And what about the baseball stadiums? Mayor Giuliani yesterday would provide no details, but once again he predicted that he was close to announcing plans to build new stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets.
"The money is there," the mayor said, although he would not point to where. "We will talk about that later." 

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Budget Highlights"A $39.6 billion budget, including $11.5 billion for city schools, $5.6 billion for social services, $3.2 billion for the police and nearly $1 billion for sanitation. $500 million in tax cuts in the coming fiscal year, including a reduction in the city's personal income tax. That reduction would save a household whose income is about $95,000 about $83 next year. New weekend science and English instruction programs for city schools. Expanded programs to reduce infant mortality. Money for a new public library in SoHo, and for a long list of cultural initiatives for institutions like the Museum of African Art, the Guggenheim, the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum and Lincoln Center.

Bloomberg Tries Walking The Fine Line

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG did well for himself yesterday, in his first foray as a real (as opposed to videotaped) candidate. 
 He didn't commit a fatal gaffe, parried gamely with the press corps, kept his sense of humor, seemed moderately comfortable shaking hands. 
 But if the billionaire businessman and improbable first-time candidate gets somewhere in his pursuit of City Hall, it will be less because of his mastery of street campaigning than because he has realized that this race for mayor is shaping up as a referendum on Rudolph W. Giuliani and that the winner will be the one to balance the public's love-hate relationship with the incumbent.
For Mr. Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat running as a Republican, that means appealing to Kenneth and Harriet Wald, without alienating Sandor Moskowitz or Demetria Thomas. No easy task for a newcomer. 
Mr. Bloomberg ran into the Wald family yesterday in Roberto's, near Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. He had come to have lunch with some civic leaders, and the Walds had come with their son, Joshua, 10, and Joshua's grandmother, Sophie Wald.
The couple are, theoretically, classic Democratic voters -- psychoanalysts from Manhattan's West Side, registered Democrats, products of the public schools, progressive in their thinking.
But they may be voting for Mr. Bloomberg.
"Will Michael Bloomberg be like Rudolph Giuliani?" asked Mr. Wald, 57. "If he is, he'll get my vote and that of most of my friends."
The reason, his wife said, is not complicated. "It's just a quality-of-life issue. Before Giuliani, people would threaten my children on the street." No more.
She knows that the current mayor benefited from a booming economy that reduced crime nationwide, but still gives him some credit, and worries that any of the Democratic candidates would rewind the tape. "They're all from the same old machine," Ms. Wald, 55, said. "To do something in New York, you have to break with the machine."
Both she and her husband still want to know more about Mr. Bloomberg, especially about his education policies. "They are a tragedy, the schools," Ms. Wald said. She blames all officials, including Mr. Giuliani, for schools she and her husband consider so poor that they send Joshua and his 14-year-old sister, Abigail, to private schools.
If Mr. Bloomberg wants the votes of these two New Yorkers, it is a good bet he will have to go well beyond the generalities that characterized many of his remarks yesterday. Even though it was his first day campaigning, he favored ambiguities when the questioning went where he did not want it to. For instance, when asked if he favored mayoral control of the public school system, Mr. Bloomberg said he did but declined to be specific. Wait until Monday night, he said. Why? Because that's when he has decided to present his education plan, he told reporters.
WHEN the questioning turned to race and he was asked about polarization, Mr. Bloomberg said he would invite a different government employee to Gracie Mansion for dinner once a week to "just break some bread." And when pressed about the fear some young people harbor toward police officers, Mr. Bloomberg said he would reach out to them, have police officers tell them the reason they are being stopped on the street. He said he wanted to "make them feel more included."
It is hard to see how that approach would satisfy Sandor Moskowitz, a jazz musician working as a waiter yesterday morning at a gospel breakfast of the Abyssinian Development Corporation. Mr. Bloomberg was one of several candidates who attended the event at City College. 
Mr. Moskowitz ("My mother is from Nicaragua, my father from Brighton Beach") said of Mr. Bloomberg, "If he's anything like Rudy Giuliani, what are we talking about? Please. Never." 
Demetria Thomas of the Bronx, a gospel singer, said she would worry if a Republican won City Hall again. "I would pray not," said the 38-year-old Ms. Thomas, whose group, Daughters of the Flame, sang at the breakfast. "We need someone a little fairer."
It would be quite a feat for a novice candidate to both embrace and reject the Giuliani legacy. Maybe that's why he said in one breath "I'm not Rudy Giuliani" and in the next said the mayor "has made this city better." Then again, Mr. Bloomberg is not one to recognize limits. "Our customers think we walk on water, and we do," he said. "And I can do that for the city."

HEADLINE: PANEL TELLS BUSH GLOBAL WARMING IS GETTING WORSE 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6 

 BODY:
A panel of top American scientists declared today that global warming was a real problem and was getting worse, a conclusion that may lead President Bush to change his stand on the issue as he heads next week to Europe, where the United States is seen as a major source of the air pollution held responsible for climate change.
 In a much-anticipated report from the National Academy of Sciences, 11 leading atmospheric scientists, including previous skeptics about global warming, reaffirmed the mainstream scientific view that the earth's atmosphere was getting warmer and that human activity was largely responsible. 
 "Greenhouse gases are accumulating in earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise," the report said. "Temperatures are, in fact, rising."
The report was requested by the White House last month in anticipation of an international meeting on global warming in Bonn in July but arrived just before President Bush leaves next week for Europe, a trip that includes talks on global warming with leaders of the 15 European Union countries in Goteborg, Sweden. 
European leaders expressed outrage in March when Mr. Bush rejected the global warming pact known as the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, and the subject has been building as an important test of the administration's foreign policy.
In the White House's first official acknowledgment of the academy's conclusions, Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, told reporters today, "This is a president who takes extremely seriously what we do know about climate change, which is essentially that there is warming taking place."
Mr. Bush and many in his cabinet, who discussed the subject at length on Tuesday, have been trying to hammer out a proposal on limiting the pollutants that cause global warming.
"A cabinet-level working group is still working on what it wishes to say to the president before we go to Europe," Ms. Rice said.
She said Mr. Bush would talk with the allies "a little bit about what we've learned thus far."
Without being specific, Ms. Rice said Mr. Bush was being guided by certain principles in formulating a proposal.
"One would want to be certain that developing countries were accounted for in some way, that technology and science really ought to be important parts of this answer, that we cannot do something that damages the American economy or other economies because growth is also important," she said.
In response to critics who have suggested that Mr. Bush is ignoring an issue of mounting international concern, Ms. Rice portrayed the group as feverishly committed to educating itself and coming up with a proposal.
"It has been a matter of bringing up to speed some of the highest-ranking people in this government," she said. "I would dare say -- dare challenge you to find a situation in which you've had so many high-ranking people sitting there week after week after week, understanding the challenge that we face in global climate change, everybody from the vice president, the secretary of state, the secretary of interior, secretary of agriculture. It has been quite something to see all of these people grappling with the issue."
Administration officials have said privately that the White House could have handled the matter with greater tact, and Ms. Rice conceded as much today.
"The president had made clear when he was a candidate that he did not believe the Kyoto Protocol addressed the problem of climate change in a way that the United States could support," she said. "In retrospect, perhaps the fact that we understood that we had already said this was not immediately observable to everybody, and it might have been better to let people know again, in advance, including our allies, that we were not going to support the protocol."
This was unusually blunt talk from a White House that until now has fastidiously avoided the phrase "global warming" and repeatedly expressed doubts about the clarity of the science underlying the theory that emissions from smokestacks and tailpipes were heating the atmosphere in ways that posed a threat.
In an indication of the headwind that Mr. Bush is sailing into next week in Europe, the journal Science, published by an American scientific organization, recently carried an open letter signed by 16 prestigious scientific panels in countries around the world calling for "prompt action" to reduce the gases like carbon dioxide that trap heat like in a greenhouse.
The increase in temperatures, the editorial said, "will be accompanied by rising sea levels, more intense precipitation events in some countries and increased risk of drought in others and adverse effects on agriculture, health and water balance."
It continued, "We urge everyone -- individuals, businesses and governments -- to take prompt action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases."
Many international business executives have been pressuring the administration to move more aggressively on the issue. And so has a powerful band of Mr. Bush's closest advisers, including Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Ms. Rice, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, and Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Today's report reflects the increasing certainty of the scientific community here and abroad that the warming of the last 50 years is probably because of the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. The panel said the degree of confidence in this conclusion was "higher today than it was 10 or even 5 years ago."
Still, it said, large uncertainties limit predictions of the extent and consequences -- good and bad -- of future warming. But it affirmed the scientific consensus that human-caused climate warming could well be a dominant environmental problem throughout the new century, depending on how fast the gases accumulate in coming decades.
"Human-induced warming and associated sea level rises are expected to continue through the 21st century," it said.
And it said that "national policy decisions made now and in the longer-term future will influence the extent of any damage suffered by vulnerable human populations and ecosystems later in this century."
The report thus all but eliminates one reason the administration has been using to forestall any action on global warming.
And it deals a strong card to Democrats on Capitol Hill who have long sought more aggressive action on global warming. Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and a leading advocate of action said of the report, "It confirms in stark terms the reality that many of us had accepted a considerable amount of time ago and refutes an effort by the White House to seek some sort of escape hatch from that reality."
Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska and a longtime critic of the Kyoto Protocol, instead highlighted the uncertainty mentioned in the report and drew the opposite conclusion of Mr. Kerry.
"This report is certainly not a prescription for the drastic measures required under the Kyoto Protocol," Mr. Hagel said in a statement.
Nonetheless, in a nod toward the unanimity of the scientific community, he added: "This report does provide us with enough evidence to move forward in a responsible, reasonable and achievable way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It provides us with a basis to move forward with an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol."
Environmentalists hailed the report as a significant step in the long effort to force the United States to curtail greenhouse gases. Phil Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, said, "The president can no longer wiggle out of aggressive action by arguing that the science is inconclusive."
Mr. Clapp also suggested that the report called into question Mr. Bush's proposed energy plan, which seeks to step up production of coal, oil and gas-fired power plants.
"This makes the president's energy plan look completely irresponsible," he said.
Mr. Clapp said environmental groups had estimated that if the energy plan was fully put into effect, it would increase the pollution that causes global warming by 35 percent over the next decade.
The report was written by 11 atmospheric scientists who are members of the National Academy of Sciences. The authors included Dr. Richard S. Lindzen, a meteorologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who for years has expressed skepticism about some of the more dire predictions of other climate scientists about the significance of human-caused warming.
The report was requested on May 11 in a letter to Dr. Bruce Alberts, the president of the National Academy of Sciences, from John M. Bridgeland, deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy, and Gary Edson, deputy assistant to the president for international economic affairs.
A statement from the academy today said, "The White House requested this fast-track review of the state of climate science in preparation for international discussions on global warming scheduled to take place in the coming weeks."
Initially, the White House asked two questions of the academy: What are the greatest strengths and weaknesses in the science pointing to human-caused warming? And, are there significant differences between the full scientific analysis completed recently by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, sponsored by the United Nations, and the final executive summary?
There have been three assessments of global warming by the international panel since 1990, and each has drawn a more conclusive picture than the last of the link between human activities and the prospects for significant harm to agriculture, ecosystems and coastlines.
But conservatives in Congress -- notably Senators Hagel and Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho -- and groups representing industries whose business depends on fossil fuels have long criticized the findings of the international panel as biased, pointing particularly to differences between the voluminous chapters on complicated scientific points and briskly worded summaries that tend to influence policy.
The panel, led by Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone, the chancellor of the University of California at Irvine, met initially in California and spent the next weeks intensively sifting the existing science.
The report does provide some ammunition for critics in its description of the conclusion of the international climate group. It concluded, for example, that the international panel had a tendency in its executive summary to understate caveats and focus on the harsher possible consequences of climate warming. But over all, the panel described the international work as "admirable" and robustly supported its conclusions.
In a telephone interview today, Dr. Cicerone said he hoped the report, by spelling out the scientific basis for various predictions, would dispel some unwarranted skepticism about aspects of the warming problem.
One climate scientist who critiqued a draft of the new report for the academy said no one in the administration should be surprised at the firm nature of the result.
"They asked a string of questions that might have been appropriate in 1990," the scientist said.
"Hello?" he said. "Where've you been the last decade?"

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Loyal to Two Cultures, From Chicano Roots To a New Ambiguity

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
In the spring of 1993, the traveling exhibition "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-1985" came to the Bronx Museum of the Arts. It opened around the same time as that year's Whitney Biennial, the political biennial that got everyone so ticked off with its emphasis on race and gender and its "I can't imagine ever wanting to be white" admission buttons.
 The two shows made an instructive contrast. They offered very different takes on what political art could mean. The Biennial, however obstreperous, was a mainstream production, fed by galleries and graduate programs and market savvy. The art was new and conceptual, and it stood at a cool distance from in-the-streets activism. 
 The work in the Bronx show was not new, nor was most of it conceptual. In political posters, documentary photographs and allegorical paintings, it dealt directly with the lives of working-class Mexican-Americans in California and the southwest United States, a territory referred to within the Chicano civil rights movement as Aztlan, the mythical Aztec homeland.
Eight years later, a second exhibition of Chicano art is at the Bronx Museum. Titled "Aztlan Today: The Chicano Postnation," it's a modest-size update to the first, but far more than a footnote. Two participants from the original show, Robert C. Buitron and Kathy Vargas, are back, joined by Daniel J. Martinez from the 1993 Biennial (he was responsible for those admission buttons) and several young artists showing in New York for the first time.
Of particular interest is the way "Aztlan Today" suggests changes in the nature of political art through the 1990's and into the present. Much of this new work takes the form of nondocumentary photography and video. The tone is low key; the technical polish is high. But a stance of rooted historical witness has been replaced by conceptual indirection and ambiguity.
It says something that the most polemical piece in the show, Laura Aguilar's 1990 photo triptych "Three Eagles Flying," is also the oldest. In it, the artist sits with her hands bound, her lower body wrapped in a United States flag, her head hooded in a Mexican flag. She seems to be the helpless prisoner of two nationalities in an image that departs from the often positive take on Chicano identity that predominated in the earlier show.
Elsewhere, questions of ethnic allegiance are treated with shrewd comic flair. Chuck Ramirez's still-life photographs of a coconut, whole and cut open, play off a joke among older Chicanos that their assimilated children have brown skin but are white inside.
Mr. Buitron, who contributed a pair of beautiful portraits in the 1993 show, is represented in this one by staged takeoffs on contemporary Chicano culture. In one picture, an Aztec princess looks right at home in a corporate boardroom; in others, the television characters Tonto and Pancho oversee colorized versions of their old black-and-white films and Malboro men consult recipes for a Tex-Mex meal.
Christina Fernandez's photographs are also made-for-the-camera theater. The series titled "Maria's Great Expedition" dramatizes the life of Ms. Fernandez's grandmother, who left Mexico at 14, worked as a fruit picker and a maid and eventually settled in California. The artist takes the starring role in each picture, with results that blend Cindy Sherman masquerade, television docudrama and tenderly recaptured history.
Photomontages by Ms. Vargas, a widely exhibited artist from San Antonio, combine images of religious amulets with handwritten texts and self-portraits in a fusion of allegory and autobiography. Also obliquely autobiographical is the entry by Phillip Avila, another San Antonio resident and at 27 the youngest artist here.
His episodic installation, spread over a gallery wall, mixes material from 1993 to 1999. It includes photographs of his ailing great-grandfather, digital drawings of children's toys, a print of Che Guevara and shots of the artist and his brother posing nude. The piece, a highlight of the show, resists easy readings but adds up to a bittersweet, homoerotic essay on patriarchy, conflicted innocence and loss.
Some sense of the ethnically grounded, uptempo character of the 1993 exhibition comes through in Armando Rascon's "Latina Postcolonial Photobureau," with its dozen large-format portraits of Latino women in real-life roles, from politician to performance artist to skateboarder. But much of "Aztlan Today" stands at a conflicted remove from cultural certainties, as seen in Mr. Martinez's memorable photodiptychs.
In each, a studio portrait of an African-American or Latino adolescent appears in one panel, and an artificial tropical flower, set against the backdrop of an urban landscape, in the other. The flowers are seen in an environment that would kill them if they were real. The adolescents, from an embattled social and economic class that produces "at risk" children, are threatened in precisely that way. How unnatural will they have to become to survive?
This series had its New York debut at the Project in Harlem in 1998, where recent self-portraits by Mr. Martinez are now on view. Titled "More Human Than Human," they also have a theme of unnatural transformation, but with a jolt of the attention-grabbing audacity familiar from the artist's earlier conceptual work.
In one image, he pulls his viscera out through a slit in his stomach. In another, he leans toward the camera to reveal suture marks circling his head, as if he had just undergone brain surgery. The pictures allude to many things: Baroque paintings of martyred saints, the self-lacerating fantasies of Goya and Artaud, an ethic of unflinching macho endurance and Hollywood splatter films. Hollywood, in fact, plays an active role here. The photographs are all collaborations between Mr. Martinez and the special-effects film makeup artists Bari Dreiband-Burman and Tom Burman.
Film also has a presence in "Aztlan Today," organized by Berta Sichel for the Consejeria de Cultura de la Communidad de Madrid in Spain and installed at the Bronx Museum by Edwin Ramoran. The exhibition includes a program of continuously screened videos, among them a piece by Mr. Martinez, and others by Alex Rivera, Jesse Lerner, Rita Gonzalez and Lourdes Portillo.
Ms. Portillo's "Corpus: A Home Movie for Selena," a meditation on the near-religious devotion surrounding a pop singer murdered by a fan, takes on a special resonance within the show's postnational context. A large part of Selena's appeal was that she kept her Chicano identity and successfully negotiated a way into the larger cultural mainstream. The same may be said of the artists in "Aztlan Today."
"Aztlan Today: The Chicano Postnation" remains at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, (718) 681-6000, through Sept. 9. Daniel J. Martinez, "More Human Than Human," remains at the Project, 427 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 662-8610, through June 30.

HEADLINE: Wheaties Inflation Indicator: Will Price Increases Stick? 

BYLINE:  By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
CHEERIOS prices are up. So are AT&T's basic rates. President Bush wants to protect the steel industry.
 Those events may not seem to be closely related, but there is a common thread. Corporate America is being hurt by rising costs in a slowing economy, and is looking for ways to pass on the costs to consumers. 
 Inflation is still widely viewed as something that went away two decades ago, and therefore of little concern to investors. It is recession that has worried Wall Street, and the markets now seem to be reasonably confident that the Federal Reserve has warded off that threat.
But within the economic slowdown are the forces that threaten to raise prices. Soaring energy costs in particular have squeezed many companies, and they need to charge more. General Mills, for example, pointed to such costs as it announced the first increase since 1999 in the price of Cheerios and other breakfast cereals.
There is a story in the box of Wheaties on your breakfast table. Cereal prices soared from 1980 to 1993, rising more than the general inflation rate every year. Those price increases added to profits, and Wall Street came to see food companies as growth companies. Obviously total food consumption was not growing very rapidly, but busy consumers seemed to be willing to pay more every year for brand names.
Then the industry hit a wall of consumer resistance. Since 1993, cereal prices have lagged overall inflation, and General Mills says that before it raised prices by 2.1 percent last week, it was getting about the same price it was collecting in 1993.
The share price of Kellogg, the closest thing to a pure play in cereals, reflects the changed environment. It rose 1,000 percent over the 13 years ending in 1993, four times the pace of the Standard & Poor's 500. Since then, Kellogg is down 6 percent while the S.& P. is up 174 percent.
Cereals are an extreme example, but many companies have found it difficult to raise prices in recent years. Fortunately, many did not need to do so. Now, the need is there. To the extent companies can get away with it, inflation will rise. To the extent they can't, profits will suffer. Kellogg has not said if it will match General Mills' price increase.
Competition also used to hold down long-distance phone rates. But with many companies in the industry reeling, that may be changing. AT&T's announced increases apply to its basic plan, which covers the millions of customers who are not smart enough to sign up for a discount plan. So far the discount plans are not being changed.
The steel case serves as a reminder that politics can play a role in pricing. President Bush has started an investigation under a section of the law that provides relief for domestic companies if they can prove they are being hurt by a surge in imports -- even if they can't prove dumping. But if the steel makers win, the companies, like the auto makers, that buy steel are the losers. Those price increases would filter through everywhere.
The Fed's aggressive easing will not soon revive the new economy, where far too much money was invested and overcapacity haunts many companies. But lower interest rates are stimulating the old economy, where companies need to pass on higher costs, particularly for energy.
We are not approaching the stagflation of the 1970's, when a stagnating economy combined with inflation in the double digits. But there are more inflationary pressures now than one would expect in a weak economy. If the current round of price increases endure, more could follow.

HEADLINE: A City Hesitates at Political Change 

BYLINE:  By Harold Meyerson; Harold Meyerson is executive editor of L.A. Weekly. He will begin as executive editor of The American Prospect next month.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
The future didn't happen here this week. For the past few months, Los Angeles has seemed poised to become home to a new political order in America. The mayoral candidacy of Antonio Villaraigosa, a former California Assembly speaker, promised to empower a political coalition rooted in the great Latin American immigration of the past 20 years. Los Angeles was to be to the new century what New York had been to the last, and Mr. Villaraigosa was our Fiorello LaGuardia, a gifted pol off mean streets who'd formed a citywide, pro-labor legion that would redefine liberalism in America, much as New York once did.
 He may yet be our LaGuardia. But for now, that future is on hold. 
 To defeat Mr. Villaraigosa in Tuesday's mayoral election, City Attorney James Hahn cobbled together one last victory for the old Los Angeles. In a city that's increasingly young and Latino, Mr. Hahn assembled enough older white and black voters to defer what looked to be Los Angeles's destiny. Dispatching Mr. Villaraigosa required the hitherto inoffensive Mr. Hahn, a mainstream Democrat, to wage the most demagogic campaign Los Angeles has seen since the bad old days of Sam Yorty, airing an ad that made Mr. Villaraigosa look like a cross between Marion Barry and Pablo Escobar. But Mr. Hahn proved equal to the task, surprising those who'd mistaken his low-key demeanor for an internal ethical compass.
And yet, Mr. Hahn's coalition is a politically incoherent, one-time curiosity that should not be mistaken for a new urban political force. He ran strongest in the black stronghold of South-Central, and in the city's last remaining bastion of white conservatism, the West San Fernando Valley -- a feat he was able to pull off only through a historic (actually, a genetic) accident. For many black voters, what distinguished Jim Hahn was his father, the late, legendary Kenneth Hahn, who, as a white county supervisor representing South-Central from 1952 through 1992, championed numerous black interests. "We can beat Jim Hahn," one Villaraigosa aide sighed in mid-campaign, "but we're helpless against Kenny." So helpless that when Hahn the Younger began airing ads designed to exploit the racial fears that white San Fernando Valley conservatives harbored toward Mr. Villaraigosa, he could do so without putting his own African-American base at risk. He may also have benefited from some black apprehensions about rising Latino political power.
Mr. Villaraigosa's was the more stable and coherent alliance, based in Los Angeles's liberal and Latino communities, which have come together over the past five years in a series of living-wage and unionization drives. His campaign planned to extend his support into the more centrist Democratic communities in the city's Westside and the Valley. But assembling a progressive majority without the African-American community was a daunting challenge.
By any number of standards, Mr. Villaraigosa should have been the logical recipient of black support. He helped form the city's Black-Latino Roundtable some 20 years ago, and as president of the city's chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union had been a champion of police reform, normally (though not this year) a defining issue in black Los Angeles. He did win the backing of the city's younger black political leaders, but the older leaders, and voters, stuck with Kenny Hahn's son. Too much can be read into this rift, though. Four years ago, black Los Angeles supported a white candidate -- and four years before that, an Asian candidate -- against Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican. Had Mr. Villaraigosa been running against a Republican, he would have won South-Central going away. But in Los Angeles's nonpartisan system, it was Democrat versus Democrat.
Mr. Villaraigosa's other problem was a lack of support among moderate and conservative white Democrats. Angelenos with long civic memories (a small but hearty band) may be excused for thinking they'd seen this before. Indeed, Mr. Villaraigosa's candidacy bears a close resemblance to the first, failed mayoral campaign of Tom Bradley, the liberal black city councilman who was defeated in 1969 by the race-baiting Sam Yorty. Like Mr. Villaraigosa, Mr. Bradley personified the rise of a new political order, in his case, a coalition of blacks and Jews who'd come to Los Angeles over the previous three decades. Both Mr. Bradley in that year and Mr. Villaraigosa in this inspired thousands of volunteers -- far more than in any other mayoral campaigns in the city's history -- who enlisted in the service of the overarching liberal cause with which their candidate was identified: civil rights in Mr. Bradley's case, economic justice in Mr. Villaraigosa's. Both candidates, though accomplished legislators, started off largely unknown to the public, making them vulnerable to attacks that they were too far left, too soft on crime. In the end, they lost by nearly identical margins -- Mr. Bradley by six points, Mr. Villaraigosa by seven.
But Mr. Bradley came back four years later, better known and harder to demonize, to win a decisive victory and begin a 20-year tenure as mayor. In Mr. Villaraigosa's case, the city is moving in his direction despite his defeat. Eight years ago, when Richard Riordan was elected mayor, Latinos constituted just 10 percent of the civic electorate. But Latino political mobilization has been rising steadily since 1994, when the community experienced the shock of Proposition 187, the anti-immigrant ballot measure. This has been an epochal transformation, funded and steered by Los Angeles's new-model labor movement, which had already pushed Los Angeles (and California) decidedly leftward well before this year's election rolled around. On Tuesday, Latinos were 22 percent of the voters, and Mr. Villaraigosa took 82 percent of that vote. A record 49 percent of the voters in the Los Angeles Times exit poll also identified themselves as liberal -- good news for the long-term prospects of Mr. Villaraigosa's alliance. And the white share of the electorate dropped 20 percent from 1993.
The Villaraigosa coalition has time on its side: among voters under 45, he won 57 percent support. Mr. Villaraigosa was as much the candidate of the new multiracial Los Angeles as he was its Latino standard-bearer, and to watch this charismatic candidate working the crowds at late-night eateries in the campaign's closing days was to see the first natural candidate of Los Angeles's 20-somethings, for whom a casually multicultural life is every bit as normal as it is abnormal for Los Angeles's 60-somethings.
As Tom Bradley showed, establishing a new political order can take more than one election. The new Los Angeles won't be built in a day, but it will be built.

HEADLINE: A Wall St. Bear Is Now Less Gloomy on Economy 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's chief economist, Stephen Roach, who has forecast a recession in the United States, driving stock prices down further, said in Paris yesterday that he had revised upward his forecast for a recovery in the fourth quarter but remained bearish over all.
 Mr. Roach said he expected the United States economy to contract by 0.5 percent this quarter and 0.6 percent in the July-September quarter before expanding 2.5 percent from October through December. 
 That compared with an April forecast for the gross domestic product to shrink 1.4 percent in the second quarter and 0.8 percent in the third. Mr. Roach said he had raised his fourth-quarter forecast from an initial estimate of 1.5 percent growth to reflect the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate reductions and the tax cuts, which he said should be felt at the end of the year.
"While the forecast has not worked out perfectly," Mr. Roach continued, "I think we have succeeded in making the point that the U.S., and the global economy, is in a much weaker growth mode than anyone thought at the start of this year."
There were signs of weakness in data released in Washington yesterday. The labor market continued to slump into early June, with the number of initial applications for jobless benefits increasing to its highest level in more than eight years. Claims rose to 432,000 in the week ended June 2, a period shortened by the Memorial Day holiday, from 419,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said -- the highest since September 1992.
The four-week moving average, which irons out week-to-week volatility, rose to 413,500 claims in the June 2 week from 402,500 the week before, its highest level since October 1992.
In a sign that the unemployed are remaining on the rolls longer, continued claims -- from people who had already received at least a week of benefits -- rose to 2,993,000 in the week ended May 26, the latest period for which figures are available, from 2,784,000 the previous week.
A separate report showed that inventories on wholesalers' shelves edged up 0.3 percent in April as supplies of both durable goods like cars and nondurable items like clothing and drugs increased.
Consumer borrowing rebounded sharply in April, the Federal Reserve reported. The Fed said that outstanding consumer credit rose by a larger-than-expected $13.9 billion. March consumer credit outstanding was revised upward, as well, to a $7.5 billion increase from an initially reported $6.1 billion.

HEADLINE: T. C. Tsao, 99, Educator, Dies; Aided Taiwan Technical College 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Tsen-cha Tsao, an engineer and educator who helped recreate one of China's leading institutions of higher learning on Taiwan, died on May 23 at home on the Upper East Side. He was 99.
 Mr. Tsao, known as T.C., retired in 1971 as a senior research engineer involved in defense-related work at the Riverside Research Institute in Manhattan. This nuclear laboratory conducts both military and medical research and is affiliated with the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. 
 A native of Shanghai, Mr. Tsao graduated in 1924 from National Chiao Tung University in Shanghai, one of China's finest engineering schools, and maintained close ties with it all his life.
He continued his telecommunications training in England and Germany and received a master's degree from Harvard University in 1929. After teaching at Chekiang University, he entered Chinese government service in 1932 and for the next 10 years headed the Chekiang provincial telephone company and the telecommunications commission for southeastern China.
After World War II, he oversaw public utilities in Shanghai. In 1949, he came to the United States to study the work of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and remained as Mao's Communist forces took control of the Chinese mainland.
He worked for the Consolidated Edison Company of New York until he joined the Riverside Research Institute in the 1950's.
But Mr. Tsao stayed in touch with the Nationalist Chinese government in Taiwan and encouraged it to re-establish Chiao Tung University on the island. Other alumni and Taiwan's ministries of education, communications, economics and defense joined the campaign, and it opened in the late 1950's.
The university regained its status as a crown jewel in the Nationalist Chinese technical education system. Mr. Tsao was celebrated as a founding father and for 20 years made annual visits to conduct seminars on engineering and technology.
Mr. Tsao's first wife, Winifred Chang, died in 1963. He is survived by his wife of 31 years, Christina Ching Tsao. Also surviving are three stepdaughters, Alice Ching Mock of Honolulu, Dr. Julia Ching of Toronto and Priscilla Ching-Chung of Hong Kong; two stepsons, Anthony B. Ching of Tempe, Ariz., and Frank Ching of Hong Kong; two grandchildren and three great-grandsons.

HEADLINE: Making a Network Of Lawyers; 
Small Firms Find Way To Compete With Giants

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
When his client presented Steven M. Nobil, a lawyer, with a problem involving California labor law, Mr. Nobil had a choice. He could deal with the issue from his office in Cleveland, probably costing the client, White Consolidated Industries, a few hundred extra dollars for legal research, or he could simply refer the question to a California firm.
 He chose the referral. 
 This was not a case of lawyerly altruism. Mr. Nobil's firm, Millisor & Nobil, belongs to a network linking 24 small employment law firms that represent corporate managers. The firm to which he referred White Consolidated was also in the network.
"We work together as service providers who mutually scratch each other's backs," Mr. Nobil said. "It was more cost effective for him to be referred" to lawyers who could answer the question immediately over the phone, he said, recalling the referral of several years ago. "I probably could've answered his question if I had gone and done some research." 
Alliances among law firms are one way that smaller firms are trying to compete with firms with offices all over the country, not to mention elsewhere in the world. The networks also offer an alternative to growth by mergers or acquisitions, which can create a host of problems because they require law firms to prune clients with conflicting interests and combine managements that might differ in substantial ways.
While it is difficult to determine how many networks there are, lawyers say that after a lull during the recession of the early 1990's, the networks began to proliferate again as the economy expanded and the number of cross-border legal issues increased.
"If you look back 10 years, there might have been 100" networks, said Charles A. Maddock, a principal at Altman Weil Inc., a consulting firm based in Newtown Square, Pa., that advises law firms. Today, he said, "we've identified more than 300 national and international law-firm networks."
The networks function primarily as a way for lawyers to refer their clients to colleagues in other cities, states, or countries, particularly when those clients need help in another jurisdiction. Technology has enabled more and more companies to do business worldwide, lawyers say, and that means corporate clients need to have legal advice in many locations -- from Los Angeles to New York, and also at times in Moscow, Buenos Aires or Tokyo.
Smaller law firms seeking to avoid being swallowed up in mergers, but still competing to serve corporations that need legal advice spanning national and international borders, can use networks to compete around the country or around the world. Through networks, they can pool resources and maintain relationships with lawyers in other jurisdictions.
One older network, Lex Mundi, which was created in 1989, is just such a counterweight to global firms. The network has more than 158 member firms in 90 countries, and allows law firms that may not have the manpower of a New York behemoth like Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom to offer a client advice about a merger with a Brazilian company as well as about a domestic stock offering.
The network carefully screens law firms before inviting them to join, to try to ensure that the same quality of legal service will be provided by any member. The idea is not only to refer clients who may not know where to look for lawyers in another jurisdiction, said Lynne E. Deitch, a partner at the Detroit firm of Butzel Long and the incoming chair of Lex Mundi, but also to draw on local expertise.
For example, Ms. Deitch had a client that wanted to use an employment application form in several states, but needed to make sure that the form met the different requirements in each jurisdiction. 
"I got answers from experts in those states," she said, using law firms that belonged to the network. Lawyers at her firm could have done the research to find out what the law in each state was, but it would have taken longer and cost the client more. "It was much more cost-effective doing it this way," she said.
In another case, she said, member firms helped conduct research on a trademark that a company wanted to register in 23 countries. In that case, to simplify the client's life, Butzel Long received all the bills for work done by the various law firms, and sent the client one big bill. Usually, once a client is referred, each firm separately charges for its services. Fees are normally not shared among the firms, and law firms within networks do not charge for referrals.
Other law firm associations are looser and may serve a different function. One such network, Private Enterprise Counsel, is not intended to serve primarily as a means of referring clients, but as a way for its six member firms to pool resources, said Terri Krivosha, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer at the Minneapolis firm of Maslon, Edelman, Borman & Brand.
"The emphasis of this network was different," she said. "It was a network designed for law firms that were not in competition with each other to leverage off each other" by sharing their management expertise and marketing materials.
For example, the firms shared the cost of surveying small-business owners about their service needs, allowing each member firm to share the data with its own clients. Members of the two-year-old network may also use each other's promotional materials, with one firm taking another's brochure and adapting it to use itself, she said.
Law firms that belong to networks are still independent of each other -- one advantage of the network is avoiding the cost of a formal merger, lawyers say. That independence can create a problem if a member firm cannot take a referral because that client is suing another of its clients. In that case, clients must find a local lawyer some other way.
Because law firm alliances allow small firms to compete more readily against large firms for big corporate clients, they have also been used to help lawyers historically unable to break into that part of the market. The American Bar Association created a network of 21 minority-owned law firms in 1989, and lined up three big companies -- General Motors, Chrysler and Aetna Life and Casualty (now Aetna Inc.) -- as sponsoring clients. "It grew to over 100 minority-owned firms and over 60 corporate sponsors," said Manny Sanchez, a founding partner of Sanchez & Daniels, which was the smallest of the 21 initial firms. At the time, Sanchez & Daniels had only three lawyers; the largest firm had approximately 25 lawyers. It also showed that minority-owned firms could indeed provide the services that large corporations need.
Out of the A.B.A. network came the Elephant, a network of minority-owned firms that Mr. Sanchez helped organize. That network ultimately imploded when some of its larger member firms disbanded, he said. Now, Mr. Sanchez's firm belongs to the Harmonie Group, a network founded in 1992 that has approximately 60 litigation firms, ranging in size from 12 lawyers to more than 200 lawyers, specializing in noncriminal defense.
While networks help smaller firms to take on referred business from far-off markets, they confer advantages on big firms, too. "We're members of several networks and always have been," said Bill H. McBride, managing partner of Holland & Knight, a law firm in Tampa, Fla., with more than 1,200 lawyers in offices in several states and overseas. 
Holland & Knight has expanded through acquisitions of smaller firms, but Mr. McBride said the networks were also helpful because it was not possible to have offices everywhere. The networks "give you an opportunity to know someone to whom you can refer your clients," he said. (Holland & Knight has also been a pioneer in the more controversial practice of offering nonlegal services, like private investigations or translation services along with traditional legal advice.)
The decision of Mr. Nobil to refer his client, White Consolidated, a maker of home appliances for Sears, Roebuck and others, illustrates how such arrangements are handled within legal networks. He told Richard Chesnick, the chief labor lawyer for White Consolidated at the time, that a firm in Los Angeles could probably answer his question quickly and cheaply. And one of Mr. Nobil's partners called the California firm to explain that Mr. Chesnick was a valued client.
"The local firm knew the answer" right away to a question about California laws on the minimum wage and maximum overtime hours, said Mr. Chesnick, who is now vice president for human resources at Brush Engineered Materials Inc. "They were very cost-effective."
White Consolidated was a longtime client of Millisor & Nobil, Mr. Chesnick added, and so he trusted its judgment. "Labor work especially is specialized, and it's hard to find good labor counsel in small towns," he said. "I liked Millisor & Nobil."
The high cost of legal services, Mr. Chesnick said, means that it makes sense to hire big law firms only for complex civil lawsuits or corporate transactions. Large firms may charge more than $200 an hour for a junior lawyer. "I don't need that level of overhead when I'm dealing with labor cases, because they tend to be smaller," he said. "It just seems like overkill."

HEADLINE: Businesses Shut by Accidents Ruled Ineligible for Damages 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
On Dec. 7, 1997, John Whaley had finished his lunch at Burger Heaven and was strolling down Madison Avenue toward his shop, 5th Avenue Chocolatiere, when the sky fell. "I thought somebody had bombed us," he said. "It was noise and confusion and people bleeding and people running and screaming and so much dust I couldn't see." 
 Thirty-three floors up, the facade of a skyscraper at the corner of 54th Street and Madison Avenue, weakened by construction work, had peeled away in a hail of bricks. 
 On July 21, 1998, a similar calamity struck West 43rd Street between Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, when a 700-foot construction elevator collapsed, killing an elderly woman. The street closings resulting from the accidents meant that Mr. Whaley and dozens of other merchants in both neighborhoods could not do business for weeks.
Yesterday, New York State's highest court, the Court of Appeals, told those businesses that they could not sue to recover their losses. The court ruled unanimously that the construction companies or property owners were liable only for property damage and personal injuries, not for loss of business.
Writing for the seven-member court, Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye said the case -- actually, three separate suits consolidated into a single appeal -- was unlike any the court had taken before, requiring it to create new law to settle the matter.
Proving negligence, the court ruled, requires showing that the builders had a legal duty toward the people who were harmed to meet a certain standard of conduct, the kind of duty that would be established by a contract, for instance.
"Absent a duty running directly to the injured person there can be no liability in damages, however careless the conduct or foreseeable the harm," Judge Kaye wrote.
A builder or property owner, she wrote, has a clear duty to people nearby "to take reasonable precautions to avoid injuring them."
"We have never held, however," she continued, "that a landowner owes a duty to protect an entire urban neighborhood against purely economic loss."
The judges indicated that the suits presented the difficult tasks of determining which businesses were hurt and which were not, and what they actually lost because of the accident.
The court also rejected the plaintiffs' claim that the people responsible for the construction had created a public nuisance.
The defendants included the companies that owned, leased and managed the building at 540 Madison Avenue, where holes were punched in an unstable brick face to create new windows, and the Tishman Construction Corporation, which was building the Conde Nast tower where the elevator collapsed.
The defendants argued that finding them potentially liable could open the way to a torrent of lawsuits in industrial accidents, and that in their cases it could threaten their financial survival.
In both accidents, the police blocked off the street, for several blocks in the Madison Avenue case, and would not let people go back to work. Mr. Whaley said he was not able to get back to his truffles and chocolate greeting cards for 18 days, and his customers could not return to his store for three weeks -- this during the holiday season, when he and his neighbors do their best business.
"I lost a minimum of $50,000," he said. "It was somebody's fault this happened, and we weren't compensated in any way. It doesn't seem right."

 BODY:
Cable Giants Refuse to Sell Ads to Internet Competitors
As the battle to provide high-speed Internet service heats up, the cable television giants are increasingly using a defensive tactic: refusing to sell advertising time to phone companies to promote digital subscriber lines, an advanced phone network technology that competes with cable modems.
 No laws or regulations appear to bar cable companies from blocking advertisements from competitors. But combined with the cable carriers' strong market power, the advertising bans are raising concerns from some consumer advocates. Page A1. 

Power Costs Decline in California
After months of baleful forecasts about California's worsening energy situation, electricity prices have fallen sharply in the last two weeks. Industry and public officials were quick to caution that the state still faces summer blackouts and that many factors could send prices spiraling higher again. A14.

I.M.F. Appoints No. 2 Official
The International Monetary Fund announced that it had named Anne O. Krueger, a Stanford University economist and a strong proponent of global free trade, to serve as its No. 2 official, responsible for carrying out the fund's role as the world's financial firefighter. Ms. Krueger will replace Stanley Fischer, who during his seven years at the fund managed a series of financial rescue efforts. C5.

I.B.M. Finds Way to Speed Up Chips
I.B.M. plans to announce that it has figured out how to stretch silicon during semiconductor manufacturing, a development that is expected to allow it to start making faster, less power-hungry chips within two years. C2.

Chip Stocks Lift Technology Sector
Semiconductor stocks rallied sharply, leading the overall technology sector higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 46.27 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,264.00. The rest of the stock market was modestly higher. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 20.50 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,090.74, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 6.93 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,276.96. C5.

Retailers' Sales Rose 0.7% in May
Retailers' sales rose 0.7 percent in May, less than expected, as shoppers spent less on clothing and sought bargains at discounters like Wal-Mart Stores to weather the slowing economy. The results trailed the firm's forecast of a 1.5 percent gain. Sales lagged a 3 percent gain in April and 4 percent increase in the month a year earlier. C4.

Bush Acknowledges Global Warming
The White House acknowledged that climate change was a problem but gave little clue as to what it intended to do about it. One crucial debate is how much to rely on the framework of the Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty on global warming that President Bush walked away from in March. Several multinational corporations favor the accord as a basis for some kind of agreement. A16.

HEADLINE: Russia's New Reach: Gas Pipeline to Turkey 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, June 5 

 BODY:
In early August, one of the world's largest and most advanced offshore platforms will slip beneath the two graceful suspension bridges spanning the Bosporus, with three feet of clearance, on its way to the Black Sea.
 If everything goes as planned, a month later the huge rig will begin laying a pipeline at record depths of 7,000 feet in corrosive mud on the bottom of the great kidney-shaped sea to bring natural gas from Russia to energy-hungry Turkey. 
 The $3 billion project represents more than a daring engineering feat. Its success would represent a setback in American efforts to curtail Russia's influence in one of the world's most strategic regions.
"Both economically and politically, this project is extremely significant for Russia," Fiona Hill, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., said in a telephone interview. "It is seen as a major coup for the Russian government." 
The pipeline would increase Turkey's dependence on Russian natural gas from the current 66 percent to around 80 percent. From the outset, American diplomats have warned that it would give Russia too much leverage over Turkey, and that it would constrain gas development in neighboring countries. But a powerful combination of Turkish and Russian politicians and business interests pushed the project through.
Washington and Moscow have been at odds for years over the development of energy in the Caspian basin, which could hold the key to prosperity and stability in a troubled swath of land sweeping from Turkey through the Caucasus and Central Asia to China's western border.
The region faces a Pandora's box of volatile issues with global implications. Among them are rising Islamic insurgency, drug trafficking, international terrorism, severe poverty and potentially explosive ethnic tensions. Four nations bordering the region have nuclear weapons -- China, Russia, India and Pakistan -- and Turkey is a NATO ally mired in an economic crisis.
Few nations are more vulnerable to energy blackmail than Turkey, which imports 98 percent of its energy. Since it began phasing out coal in the 1980's, demand for gas has increased steadily. Two-thirds of Turkey's gas comes from Russia through two existing pipelines, and demand is expected to quadruple by 2010.
Not only is Turkey the region's biggest customer, it is also one of the few with the hard currency to pay.
To meet Turkey's rising needs for gas, the American government had favored a pipeline from Turkmenistan to Turkey that would cross the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan and Georgia -- totally bypassing Russia. Turkmenistan has ample natural gas, and Western companies were willing to finance and build the line.
Russia countered with a proposed 750-mile pipeline from its Black Sea coast to Ankara, the Turkish capital. The line would have three segments -- separate land sections in Russia and Turkey connected by a 233-mile leg across the Black Sea from the Russia port of Dzhubga to Samsun in Turkey. 
It is this line, known as Blue Stream, that won out and is now under construction.
Blue Stream faced technical and financial hurdles, but it had strong support from big Turkish corporations doing business in Moscow; the corporations saw it as a way to strengthen economic ties between the countries. This support translated into backing from Turkey's powerful Motherland Party, which has been aligned with big business.
Mesut Yilmaz, now one of Turkey's deputy prime ministers and head of the party, was prime minister when the Blue Stream project was negotiated. Despite concerns in the government, he and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister then, signed the deal with great fanfare in Ankara on Dec. 15, 1997.
"The military and the Foreign Ministry had reservations about increasing our dependence on Russian gas, but Yilmaz went ahead," a former Turkish official said.
Mr. Chernomyrdin stepped down as prime minister a few months later and became chief executive of Gazprom. The Russian company is supplying gas for Blue Stream, and its construction arm, Stroitransgaz, is in charge of building the pipeline. Mr. Chernomyrdin left Gazprom last year, and is now Russia's ambassador to Ukraine, but his sons own about 12 percent of Stroitransgaz.
American diplomats stopped short of outright opposition to Blue Stream, but they cautioned their Turkish counterparts against relying too heavily on Russia, according to American officials. They also warned that Blue Stream threatened the Turkmenistan pipeline.
In September 1999, Mr. Yilmaz had dinner with several Clinton administration officials in Washington. He was out of government then, though he remained head of the Motherland Party.
"We really don't like this project," an American official told him, according to a dinner participant and an official who was briefed about the conversation.
"Let me be plain," Mr. Yilmaz was quoted as replying. "I'm going to get it done."
A week later, Mr. Yilmaz went to Moscow with other Turkish officials and businessmen to reassure the Russians that Blue Stream was on course, according to two who joined the trip. 
Last month, after the Turkish press raised questions about the Moscow trip, Mr. Yilmaz told party members that he had no official contacts in Moscow because he was not part of the government at the time. 
Turkey has continued talks with other potential suppliers, and officials said they expected Iranian gas to arrive through a new pipeline late this year, but no Turkmenistan gas is in sight. 
Industry officials and American diplomats said the Turkmenistan pipeline was essentially dead from multiple wounds. A $2 billion contract for the pipeline was awarded in 1999, but the refusal of Russia and Iran to resolve territorial disputes in the Caspian Sea stalled progress. Prospects also were damaged by public anger on the part of Turkmenistan's president, Saparmurat Niyazov, against Turkey for proceeding with Blue Stream.
The demise of its pipeline means that Turkmenistan will probably sell its gas to Russia, increasing Moscow's control over supplies in the region, or to Iran, both prospects that dismay American officials.
Russia may also use the Blue Stream line to sell gas from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to Turkey and southern Europe, Zeyno Baran, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said in an interview.
"Russian policy is to maintain and even increase its control over the transportation networks in and out of the Caspian as well as Turkey and Europe," Ms. Baran said.
Not everything has gone Russia's way. American diplomats were heartened in March when Turkey agreed to buy gas from a new field in Azerbaijan. The gas is expected to arrive in late 2004.
Blue Stream has run into its own difficulties. The project is a year behind schedule and has been caught up in an investigation of corruption at Turkey's Energy Ministry. Fifteen people, including former senior government officials, have been charged with bribery in contracts unrelated to Blue Stream. 
Energy Minister Cumhur Ersumer, a key figure in Mr. Yilmaz's party who negotiated the Blue Stream deal, was pressed into resigning after the scandal, though he was not accused of wrongdoing.
Prosecutors confirmed that they were looking into aspects of Blue Stream, including the no-bid contract to build the Turkish part of the pipeline and a $52 million advance payment to contractors close to Mr. Yilmaz's party.
Despite the controversy, the land section from Samsun to Ankara is complete, and work is expected to start soon on the undersea segment.
To lay the line in the Black Sea, Gazprom formed a partnership with Eni S.p.A., the big Italian energy company, and its Saipem construction unit. 
The deepest pipeline to date is 5,000 feet in the Gulf of Mexico, but Eni executives said they were confident their giant offshore platform can lay the pipe at 7,000 feet. They also developed a special coating to withstand the corrosive hydrogen sulfide concentrated on the sea bed.
"We are 100 percent sure we will not fail," Stefano Bianchi, general manager of the project for Eni, said in an interview.
Even with Blue Stream gas, Turkish officials said they needed multiple suppliers and pointed to the March agreement to buy Azerbaijani gas as an example. They also dismissed the idea of Russia's cutting off supplies for political reasons, saying it would be too damaging to Moscow's economic interests.
Russia demonstrated its willingness to use gas for political leverage last winter. Much of Georgia went dark when Moscow stopped the flow to underline its demands to keep military bases there. The gas resumed after Georgian officials pleaded with Moscow, and a company with close links to Gazprom is now negotiating for a stake in Georgia's gas distribution network.
Privately, American and European diplomats speak of concern about Russia's renewed drive to exert control through such bare-knuckle energy tactics rather than military intervention. For their part, the Russians view United States policy as an effort to weaken their influence in the region. Increasing gas sales is also vital to Russia's efforts to rescue its own beleaguered economy.
Americans counter that their intention is to promote economic cooperation and independence.
The Americans won a major round last month when the companies involved in a pipeline to carry oil from the Caspian port of Baku, Azerbaijan, to Ceyhan on Turkey's Mediterranean coast decided to proceed with the next phase.

HEADLINE: California Gets a Reprieve as Power Prices Fall 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
After months of baleful forecasts about California's worsening energy situation, the outlook has changed markedly, at least for the moment. Electricity prices in California have fallen sharply in the past two weeks, giving the state its first breathing room since a year ago. 
 The reason for the sudden turnaround is not entirely clear, though cooler weather, the return to service of power plants that had been taken down for maintenance, lower natural gas prices and conservation by consumers are all playing a role. 
 Industry and public officials were quick to caution yesterday that the state still faced summer blackouts and that many factors could send prices spiraling higher again. But, for now, practically everyone involved is taking some kind of credit. 
Aides to Gov. Gray Davis, who only a month ago warned of widespread power disruptions in early June, praised Californians' conservation as well as the long-term contracts the state signed with power generators to stabilize prices. The companies that generate electricity say that while the relief may be temporary, it demonstrates that they are not manipulating prices and that the market is capable of fixing itself. Some consumer advocates, meanwhile, contend that with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under pressure to investigate the price spikes that occurred in December and earlier this year, the companies are lying low. 
Whatever the correct combination of factors, daily spot prices for electricity have dropped to less than $70 a megawatt-hour from more than $400 in late May, according to Platts Power Markets, an industry publication. Contracts for electricity to be produced in August, the month of the highest demand, have fallen to about $200 a megawatt-hour from as high as $700 in April.
Some California energy officials said that the speeded-up efforts to bring new power plants on line and significant savings from conservation were helping by increasing supply and cutting demand. 
But no one is willing to bet how long the trend will continue. "We've been able to push back on prices, and the prices have taken quite a tumble," said Ray Hart, deputy director of the California Department of Water Resources, which has been negotiating long-term power purchases for the state. But when hotter weather arrives, he said, "we fully expect prices are going to be much higher."
Joe Bob Perkins, president of Reliant Energy's wholesale group, one of the largest owners of generation plants in California, warned that the state should not take "false comfort" in the falling prices. 
"We haven't done anything to fix the long-term supply and demand problems yet, and I am still very concerned about this summer," Mr. Perkins said. "We do not want to confuse price stability with having averted, or even mitigated, the amount of blackouts we may see this summer."
Still, state officials say the lower prices appear to have given new leverage in their dealings with electricity generators. Mr. Hart said that while the state would honor contracts it had already signed to buy long-term power from generators, negotiators were now demanding better terms for new or incomplete deals. The state has purchased almost half of the power it expects to need during peak periods this summer, and Mr. Hart credited that with reducing the demand for power in the marketplace and playing a role in the price decline.
Some causes of the falling prices are clear. Two weeks ago, power plants that generate 10,600 megawatts of electricity or enough to light eight million homes were off-line for maintenance, according to the California Independent System Operator, the independent agency that runs the state's electricity grid. By yesterday, the number of megawatts off-line had dropped to 4,800, as generators completed maintenance and brought plants back into service in preparation for the summer.
According to the California Energy Commission, the state will also have 5,000 megawatts from new power plants that will be in operation by this fall, including 2,200 megawatts up and running by next month.
West Coast consumers are also using less power. In California, total electricity use fell 2 percent in May compared with the same period last year and it fell 11 percent after factoring in changes in the weather and economic growth, according to the state energy commission. Demand may fall further once California consumers start receiving bills containing electricity rate increases of 30 percent to 50 percent that go into effect this month, analysts said. 
Reduction in demand from the Pacific Northwest, which competes with California for wholesale power, also appears to be playing a role. The Bonneville Power Administration, a large wholesale power generator in the Northwest, said it had already signed agreements to reduce demand from customers by 1,200 megawatts, or about 11 percent. Officials at the federal agency say they hope to be able to reduce demand by another 1,200 megawatts by the end of the month.
Mike Hansen, a spokesman for the administration, said that a rate increase planned for Oct. 1 that could have been as high as 250 percent now may be no more than 75 percent.
Prices for natural gas which powers about half of the state's generation plants during peak times have also fallen sharply in the past week. In Southern California, the average price during last week's "bidweek" process, which determines the price for much of the gas sold in the following month, was $11.70 per million British Thermal Units, according to Natural Gas Intelligence, an industry publication. But spot prices for gas sold on a daily basis have since drifted to below $7, compared with a high of almost $60 in December and current average prices of less than $4 across most of the nation.
Because of this month's savings, the average homeowner's gas bills from Pacific Gas & Electric, the giant California utility that is in bankruptcy because of the power crisis, are expected to drop 38 percent this month.
Some analysts and industry officials, including Mr. Perkins of Reliant Energy, said that the moderate price caps instituted earlier this year by federal regulators may be partly responsible for keeping prices in check. But Mr. Hart said the price caps were having no effect, and he reiterated longstanding complaints of California officials that federal regulators are not doing enough for the state.

HEADLINE: A New Offer for Finova Bailout 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., June 7 

 BODY:
The Finova Group's bonds rose today after the GE Capital Corporation and the Goldman Sachs Group sweetened the terms of the bailout offer they made to creditors of Finova two weeks ago. 
 Finova's bonds were bid at 91.5 cents to the dollar today, up about 2 cents from Wednesday. Finova's stock, which rose as much as 17 percent during the session, gained a penny, to $3.23 a share. 
 Bond and stock owners expect their holdings to be worth more as two rival suitor groups compete for Finova, which has $12.5 billion in assets. GE Capital, based in Stamford, and Goldman are sparring with Berkadia L.L.C., a joint venture between Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and the Leucadia National Corporation. Berkadia is aligned with Finova's management. 
Finova, a finance company based in Scottsdale, Ariz., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March.
The new offer from GE Capital and Goldman Sachs includes a $7.25 billion loan to pay debt holders, an increase from their May 24 offer of $7 billion, the companies said in a filing in United States Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. The filing objects to Finova's request that a bankruptcy judge allow it to go forward with an offer from Berkadia. 
Under the Berkadia plan, Finova would use a $6 billion loan plus its cash reserves to pay debt holders $7.35 billion, or 64 cents for every $1 of pre-bankruptcy debt and 3 cents of post-Chapter 11 filing interest for each $1 of their total claims. The rest would be organized into new 10-year bonds. 
GE Capital said its new plan offered increased liquidity and a loan set at the London interbank offered rate plus 2 percentage points a year, lower than the rate plus 2.25 percentage points offered by Berkadia.

Solving for C

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: ATHENS 

 BODY:
So here's an interesting question that you hear around Europe these days: What will the Bush foreign policy be? No, no -- not what was it during the campaign, not what was it for its first 100 days, but what will it really be?
 In case you haven't noticed, the world lately has done for the Bush foreign policy what Senator Jim Jeffords did for the Bush domestic policy -- pushed back. With the Bush team having come into office controlling the White House, the House, the Senate, the Supreme Court and a docile press, there were no internal brakes. So -- up to now -- it has been left to America's democratic allies in Europe, rather than the Democrats in Congress, to provide the counterweight. If one were to put this in mathematical terms: The Bush team came into office advocating foreign policy A. It ran into a world demanding more of foreign policy B. And if A plus B equals C, what will C be? 
 For instance, the Bush Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, heaped scorn on the Clinton team's "too frequent" willingness to bail out key allies when their economies collapsed. Well, Turkey just received a $17 billion I.M.F. and World Bank bailout, including $8 billion in April approved by the Bush team. Argentina just resumed getting its $13 billion, Bush-approved bailout-for-reform package from the I.M.F. The Bushies claim that only I.M.F., not U.S., funds are being used, but the U.S. is the biggest contributor to the I.M.F. Frankly, the Bush team made the correct decisions on both Turkey and Argentina. But it leaves hanging the question: What is its real approach to bailouts?
The Bush team came into office loudly proclaiming its intention to get U.S. troops out of Bosnia and Kosovo. But European officials say that after listening to Secretary of State Colin Powell during last week's meeting with NATO leaders in Hungary, they felt reassured that the U.S. would not be going anywhere soon, and would generally stick by the NATO principle "in together, out together." Again, it's good the Bush team is challenging Europe to take more responsibility for the Balkans. But no NATO operation will work for long without the U.S. in the middle. Everyone else will drift away, and we can't afford that in Southern Europe. So what is the real Bush defense policy there? 
At the Hungary NATO meeting, the NATO allies, led by France and Germany, refused to bow to Mr. Powell's request that they endorse the Bush Star Wars missile defense plan and issue a communique saying that the Western allies faced a common ballistic-missile threat. Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, explained the European position by noting that any missile defense plan "must add to our security and stability . . . not lead to another arms race." Will the Bush team now push ahead on its own or slow down?
In the Middle East, the Bushies insisted -- with good reason -- that they would not be dragged into Arab-Israeli peacemaking unless the parties were serious. But pressure from America's Arab allies to "do something" before the instability spreads prompted Mr. Bush to send low-level diplomats, and now the C.I.A. director, to mediate. Ditto North Korea. First the president trashed the Clinton negotiations with the North. But with both America's European and Asian allies appalled by that, Mr. Bush has now ordered a resumption of talks. How will they be different?
Maybe the biggest question Europeans will have for President Bush when he comes here next week is: Now that you have dumped the Kyoto treaty as a vehicle for reducing global warming -- which the National Academy of Sciences just confirmed is happening -- what will you replace Kyoto with? The answer needs to be a serious plan, say Greek officials, otherwise it will cause a major rift with Europe's people.
There is nothing wrong with a new team coming in and saying: We're going to be tougher than the previous lot. Some of Mr. Bush's instincts are right. But there is a fine line between a tougher effective foreign policy and a tougher ineffective foreign policy, with no allies. Clearly the Bushies don't want the latter. But it remains to be seen what their option C is -- where exactly they will strike the balance between their campaign rhetoric and the world of our allies. The Bushies started out with anti-Clintonism as their framework. They are now abandoning that -- but without defining an intellectual framework for their new approach.

HEADLINE: Meadowlands Is Loose End In Arena Plan For Newark 

BYLINE:  By MARIA NEWMAN and RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
When Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco announced plans Wednesday for a proposed $355 million arena in Newark, he said he hoped to sign legislation by the end of the month that would move the New Jersey Devils and Nets to a new home there. 
 That timetable may be optimistic. 
 While the proposal was hailed in Newark, officials in Bergen County, where the teams' Continental Arena in the Meadowlands is located, said yesterday that no proposal could go forward without a firm development plan for the Meadowlands. Assembly Speaker Jack Collins said he was concerned that the plan offered nothing for South Jersey. At the same time, officials with the football Giants and Jets have already begun talks about a possible new football stadium to replace their current one in the Meadowlands complex. 
So Mr. DiFrancesco still needs to put a number of pieces together before his plan, which would shut the Continental Arena, can become a reality.
"I'm disappointed that the announcement was made about the Newark arena without a corresponding announcement with regard to the future of the Meadowlands," said William Schuber, the Bergen County executive. "Accordingly, I will be withholding my support until such time as I see what the state's proposal for the Meadowlands will be."
The sports arena at the Meadowlands was built in 1981, and the entire complex, including a racetrack and stadium that opened in 1976, draws six million people a year. But last year it lost $3.3 million, and it requires a taxpayer subsidy of more than $10 million a year.
Mr. DiFrancesco vowed on Wednesday to find a way to quickly ensure the fiscal viability of the Meadowlands. "We are not going to let that golden piece of property lie fallow, even for a moment," he said.
He said negotiations were under way with "major entertainment companies" interested in building at the Meadowlands. The state is also in talks with officials from the Giants and Jets for long-term commitments to keep the teams in the Meadowlands and could build them a new football stadium, Mr. DiFrancesco said.
The governor enlisted Lewis M. Eisenberg, the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, to put together the Newark deal and a Meadowlands plan. He said he had spoken to more than 60 companies about possible attractions for the site, including a ski slope and a mall. 
Even as the YankeeNets, which owns the Nets and the Devils, was negotiating the tentative agreement on the Newark arena, the Giants and Jets were quietly discussing the possibility of a new football stadium in the Meadowlands. Officials from the teams met with Mr. Eisenberg two hours before the governor announced the arena deal. 
The discussions are still preliminary, with the Giants more interested in pursuing a new stadium and the Jets focused on moving to a proposed stadium on the West Side of Manhattan. But the Jets are also considering either staying in New Jersey or returning to their past home Flushing, Queens.
"I think we're making progress with Lew Eisenberg," said Robert Tisch, the co-owner of the Giants, who met with Mr. Eisenberg, along with Jay Cross and Steve Gutman, Jets officials. "We need as much revenue as we can get. By 2004, 26 of the 32 teams in the N.F.L. will have new stadiums. We have to compete."
But Mr. Cross, the Jets president, said, "I don't think there's anything particularly serious to it."
The possibility of building a new stadium has emerged from discussions about renovating Giants stadium, which the Giants and Jets have shared since 1984.
But as the cost estimates have risen, attention has shifted to building a new stadium.
"It doesn't take long to get to $200 million," said James A. DiEleuterio, president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which runs the Meadowlands. 
If a new stadium is built, the Giants and Jets would want the maximum revenue, which would mean that the authority would take less than it does now.
Also in consideration as part of the development effort is the Meadowlands Mills, a proposed $1 billion shopping and entertainment complex being planned for a swath of wetlands in nearby Carlstadt known as the Empire Tract.
Environmentalists have said they would like to see Meadowlands Mills replace the Continental Arena -- which would maintain the Meadowlands' economic vitality and move the mall to a less environmentally sensitive area. 
In March, Mr. DiFrancesco called on the mall's developers to consider alternative sites, saying the 592 acres of wetlands should remain undeveloped. During a news conference in the Meadowlands, Mr. DiFrancesco hinted that building at the site of the sports complex might be an appropriate alternative.
Although it has not ruled out the arena site, the Mills Corporation, which plans to build the mall, said it preferred the Empire Tract. The company is still awaiting a ruling from the Army Corps of Engineers that will determine whether the project threatens the ecosystem. 
Rich Fritzky, president of the Meadowlands Regional Chamber of Commerce, has opposed any deal that would leave a hole in Bergen County. But he said he was hopeful the negotiations would yield something for the Meadowlands.
"If they can work out the Newark thing, God bless them," he said, "as long as they don't disinvest in the Meadowlands." 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 9, 2001

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about plans for the Meadowlands and for a new arena in Newark referred incorrectly in some copies to the football team that used to play in Flushing, Queens. It is the Jets, not the Giants.

Rally by Semiconductor Shares Lifts Technology Issues

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Semiconductor stocks rallied sharply yesterday, leading the overall technology sector higher, as investors hoped that Intel, the world's largest chip maker, would add to the evidence that the industry's decline was ending and that sales would revive in the second half of the year.
 After the market closed Intel said that its sales in the current quarter would be within the lower end of its previous forecast. Intel did not comment on the industry and whether it might be seeing a turnaround in demand. But analysts predicted the industry might be seeing a bottom. 
 "What Wall Street looks to is to discount and anticipate the future, and so you'd much rather have a situation where a company says we're not quite where we want to be now but we're upbeat in terms of where we're going," said David G. Dietze, president and chief investment officer of Point View Financial Services Inc. in Summit, N.J. 
The semiconductor rally helped lift the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index 46.27 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,264.00. 
Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company, called Intel's announcement "terrific news."
"This is exactly the kind of news that is going to get people that are sort of in the wait-and-see mode off of the sidelines and back into the marketplace," he added.
The rest of the stock market was modestly higher as weakness in Philip Morris and financial stocks weighed on the Dow Jones industrial average and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The Dow gained 20.50 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,090.74, while the S.& P. 500 rose 6.93 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,276.96.
Ahead of its midquarter forecast, Intel rose $1.32, to $31.14. In after-hour trading, Intel rose as high as $33.
Intel's forecast came after other signs that the semiconductor industry had reached a bottom and was beginning to rebound. Late Wednesday, the Semiconductor Industry Association projected that the chip industry would bounce back in the second half of this year, and it increased its 2002 sales growth forecast to 20.5 percent from 10 percent.
And National Semiconductor, even though it reported a quarterly loss yesterday, said it saw signs that the worst might be behind it. Its stock rose $3.07, to $31.04.
Among other semiconductor stocks, Broadcom gained $4.67, to $40.24, even though it forecast a decline of 32 percent to 35 percent in second-quarter revenue from the first quarter. Applied Materials gained $3.36, to $56.02; Xilinx rose $4.15, to $49.37; and Advanced Micro Devices climbed $1.91, to $30.28.
The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index jumped 49.70 points, or 7.7 percent, to 697.03.
Elsewhere, Philip Morris fell $1.48, to $48.52, a day after a California jury awarded $3 billion to a smoker with incurable cancer who said the company did not inform him of the product's health risk.
The financial services sector was also weak yesterday. J. P. Morgan Chase lost $1.21, to $45.63. Wells Fargo fell 18 cents, to $47.66, after company officials said that it would have an after-tax charge of about $1.13 billion, mostly linked to declines in investments in the technology and communications industries. 
Despite Intel's positive announcement, some analysts warned against the notion that semiconductor stocks would see a sustainable and sizable run-up in the market. 
"What's going to prevent a big rally from being sparked is that, yes, there are many signs of stabilization, but there are also still signs of deterioration," said Stephen J. Massocca, president of Pacific Growth Equities, an investment bank in San Francisco.

Treasury Prices Fall
By Reuters
Bond prices fell yesterday as dealers took profits after a strong six-day rally, which was based on expectations that the economy was unlikely to bounce back much before the end of the year.
"There is no question we have had a heck of a run, so I guess giving back a little is nothing to be surprised with," said John Santoro, head of government trading at SG Cowen Securities.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 13/32, to 97 22/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.31 percent from 5.23 percent on Wednesday.
The 30-year bond fell 30/32, to 95 3/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.72 percent from 5.65 percent.

Intel Remains Cautious Amid Conflicting Industry Reports

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 7 

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation, a closely watched bellwether of the semiconductor industry, said today that it was on target to meet revenue projections for the quarter, but that it saw no indication that the industry had hit its nadir. 
 Andy D. Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, said the company expected gross margins, expenses and revenues to be slightly below the midpoint of projections given in April. It had estimated that revenue would be $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion. Mr. Bryant did say that while the personal computer market was on track, Intel's sales to networking and communications clients were weaker than expected. 
 Mr. Bryant, speaking on a conference call to investors, stopped short of broad-level analysis of the industry and of whether it may be seeing a turnaround in demand. He noted specifically that it was "too murky" to know whether its business related to the communications sector had bottomed out.
Shares of Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., rose as high as $33 in after-hours trading. The company issued its forecast after the markets had closed. Its shares rose $1.34, to $31.16, in regular trading.
Intel's announcement came amid a flurry of news, some of it conflicting, in the semiconductor industry. National Semiconductor reported a fourth-quarter loss, and said today that it would post bigger than expected losses for the current quarter. It also indicated that its customers' inventory backlog was clearing up, suggesting recovery is in sight.
The Semiconductor Industry Association forecast on Wednesday evening that chip sales would fall 14 percent this year. But Doug Andrey, director of information systems and finance for the association, said the group also thought sales to computer makers would recover late in the third quarter, would become a broader turnaround for chip makers by the end of the year, and would lead to growth for the industry of 20 percent or more in 2002.
Taken as a whole, the evidence led some industry analysts to suggest that chip makers might indeed be seeing a bottom -- a conclusion analysts have not embraced in recent weeks for other high-tech industries, particularly those that rely heavily on information technology spending.
Referring to Intel's announcement that it will essentially meet earlier forecasts, Jonathan J. Joseph, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said, "No news is good news in this environment."
"It all points toward a bottoming in August and a re-acceleration from there," Mr. Joseph said. "Basically we've been in a very deep recession in semiconductors. This speaks to some recovery."
Fueling some optimism, Mr. Bryant, the Intel executive, said the company was not as concerned as it had been about having orders canceled -- a commonplace activity that causes high-tech companies to modify their projections -- and, in this case, was a sign that business was stabilizing. "We're getting pretty close to being able to say we're not worried about cancellations," Mr. Bryant said.
"If you ask me how much sleep I'll lose over the possibility we'll be slipping below low end of the range, I'm not losing any sleep," he said. The quarter "is unfolding exactly as I expected."
Investors were similarly heartened by news that Broadcom, which makes chips for cable modems and data and voice networks, was seeing signs that order cancellations were slowing. However, reinforcing the idea that news is mixed for the industry, the company warned that its revenue would fall below earlier estimates, and was now expected to be $207 million to $216 million, below the analyst consensus of $254.7 million.
Also on Wednesday, IDC, a market research firm, reported that domestic sales of personal computers -- a huge market for chip makers -- were expected to fall during 2001. If that holds true, it will be the first year the figure has dropped since 1994, when the firm started tracking the category, said Loren Loverde, a PC market analyst. IDC projected that PC sales in the United States would fall to 45.3 million this year, a 6.3 percent drop from 2000. Worldwide, the company projected PC sales to hit 138.9 million, an increase of 5.8 percent over last year.
Mr. Joseph, the Salomon Smith Barney analyst, said the numbers should not be seen as indicative of continued bad news for the industry. Rather, he said the companies and their investors had already taken expectation of slowed PC sales into account and now were preparing for a rebound.

HEADLINE: The Presidential Tax-Cut Moment 

 BODY:
Appropriately enough, President Bush signed his $1.35 trillion tax cut into law yesterday in a ceremony that looked like a campaign stop from last year. After all, a president who can get his No. 1 priority enacted within five months of taking office has accomplished something impressive politically. However, as this page has often noted, it is an achievement that comes at great cost. It will now be extremely hard to finance Mr. Bush's and the Congress's spending priorities, especially in health, education and defense. Indeed, lawmakers of all persuasions were predicting yesterday that the tax cut would have to be revised fairly soon just to fix the accounting tricks that disguised its cost. 
 In a book about the tax cut and budget wars of another era, Richard Darman, a budget director for Mr. Bush's father, described a similar ceremony two decades ago at which Ronald Reagan signed his own tax cut into law. The signing took place in the midst of a thick fog at Mr. Reagan's ranch, which Mr. Darman saw as a metaphor for the way he and others had failed to see the problems the tax cut would eventually create. The problems that Mr. Bush set in motion yesterday were much more obvious, in part because of what happened in the years after the Reagan tax cut. Mr. Reagan and his two successors all ended up raising taxes to pay for vital federal programs and balance the budget. The senior George Bush and former President Bill Clinton paid a big political price for doing so. 
 One of yesterday's oddities was the agreement among both conservatives and liberals that the tax bill was a kind of sham. Conservatives are upset that many of the provisions they favor -- particularly the reductions for the richest taxpayers and the repeal of the estate tax -- do not take effect for years. They expressed alarm that these are the very features that may be susceptible to repeal when Congress starts looking for the money to pay for school aid or a prescription drug benefit for the elderly. In addition, independent estimates suggest that if all the expiration clauses in the bill were eliminated, it would cost nearly $1.9 trillion by the end of 2011, forcing even tougher budgetary choices.
There is no telling at this point exactly how the tax cut will affect Mr. Bush politically. That will more likely be determined by the performance of the economy than by any voter feelings about the tax cut per se. Mr. Reagan's approval ratings sank after he signed his tax cut because of the recession that followed. For now the provision that is likely to register most strongly with Americans is the bill's $300 rebate for individuals and $600 for families due later this year. Economists tend to think that the rebate might help the economy a little but not much. If the economy sinks, Americans may well look at what Congress and Mr. Bush have wrought as a missed opportunity. A great many Americans at the lower end of the economic scale who pay sizable payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare will not be getting the rebate in any case.
In political terms, Mr. Bush is surely entitled to savor his achievement.If he can persuade Congress to pass education legislation in a form similar to what he has asked for, as seems likely, his second-biggest priority will also have come to pass. But the greatest test of his leadership will be to digest the consequences of this moment and make the appropriate adjustments as Americans come to realize that some of the other things they want out of Congress cannot get enacted because of what was signed into law yesterday.

HEADLINE: Badillo Opens Another Run For Mayor 

BYLINE:  By MIRTA OJITO 

 BODY:
After a record-setting political career that many believed dormant, Herman Badillo announced yesterday that he, too, wanted the city's top job.
 In a five-minute speech that relied heavily on his experience in government, Mr. Badillo outlined the themes of his mayoral campaign: crime reduction, educational reform and urban renewal. He joins a race already crowded with four Democrats and one other Republican. 
 "I believe that New York City is a jewel, and, as mayor, I will work to make it shine and brighten our whole environment," he said to reporters and supporters gathered in the solarium of the Women's National Republican Club in Midtown Manhattan. 
Mr. Badillo's announcement came two days after Michael R. Bloomberg, the entrepreneur and newly minted Republican, started his own candidacy with a series of bilingual television advertisements. Although both Republicans have earned words of praise from Gov. George E. Pataki, Mr. Bloomberg is thought to be the governor's favorite. Republican leaders tried unsuccessfully for the last few weeks to pressure Mr. Badillo into not entering the race.
In front of a banner that read, "Experience Money Can't Buy," Mr. Badillo portrayed himself as the anti-Bloomberg: a poor Puerto Rican orphan who made good and has the know-how to make life better for all New Yorkers.
Simultaneously translating many of his answers from Spanish to English and vice versa, Mr. Badillo compared this race to the 1989 Republican mayoral primary, in which the cosmetics millionaire Ronald S. Lauder spent $13 million but lost against Rudolph W. Giuliani, who spent $3 million.
"In fact, we can even call Mr. Bloomberg, Ron Lauder II," he said and the audience giggled. He then challenged Mr. Bloomberg to weekly debates, in English and Spanish.
Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, took a minute to respond to Mr. Badillo's challenge. "I've got a one-sentence reply to that," he said. "There will be debates."
Mr. Badillo's decision to run worries party leaders who fear that a Republican primary will be divisive in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, and it confounds political pundits who say Mr. Badillo's time has passed. "This campaign will cloud his legacy," said Juan Figueroa, president of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund. "It won't be his finest hour."
In a career that took him from the Bronx to the United States Congress, Mr. Badillo managed to be the first Puerto Rican congressman, borough president and city commissioner in just under two decades. But Mr. Badillo, who is 71 and says he still runs five miles several times a week in Central Park, does not think of his career as being in the past. He says he is intent on becoming the city's first Hispanic mayor, a feat he has attempted three times before. 
He has been campaigning all over the city, courting elderly Hispanic voters, young Republicans and Republican women. He said he has raised $180,000 and has the support of several Republican clubs, including the New York Young Republican Club. 
Although Mr. Badillo has been careful not to criticize his longtime friend, Mr. Giuliani, he portrayed himself yesterday as a candidate who harbors no ill feelings toward any group and is capable of working with all citizens of New York.
"The hostility that divides our city must end, and the absence of hostility must begin at the mayor's office," he said, distancing himself from Mr. Giuliani's failure as mayor to achieve alliances with black and Hispanic leaders.
Mr. Badillo said his candidacy would also help the Republican Party reach out to Hispanic voters. Few Hispanic voters are registered Republicans, he said, but more and more they are moving closer to Republican positions. A poll released Wednesday by the Hispanic Federation, an umbrella organization for Hispanic nonprofit groups, said 52 percent of Hispanic New Yorkers evaluate Governor Pataki's job performance positively.
"The Republican Party in New York City is not aware of what goes on in the nation," Mr. Badillo said. "Our community is gradually moving to the Republican Party."
He also said that only about 10 percent of Hispanic voters were Republicans, an estimate supported by the federation's poll. Norman Adler, a political consultant and lobbyist who has worked for both Republican and Democratic campaigns, disputed Mr. Badillo's assessment of Hispanic voting trends.
"People get their politics the way they get their religions, through their parents," Mr. Adler said. "And the truth is that, at least rhetorically, the Democratic Party continues to be the party of the disenfranchised and the disinherited."
Mr. Badillo knows the rhetoric of the Democratic Party better than most. For most of his political career -- city commissioner and borough president of the Bronx in the 1960's, congressman and deputy mayor in the 1970's -- he was a liberal Democrat, a Puerto Rican pushing the agenda he thought would improve the lives of those he calls "my people." He was the voice of urban renewal and bilingual education, securing an amendment to the Voting Rights Act for bilingual voting.
Then, eight years ago, he switched parties because, he said, his views on education were more in line with the Republican Party. In 1999, Governor Pataki appointed him chairman of the board of trustees of the City University of New York, a position he resigned earlier this week.
As a Republican Hispanic in an overwhelmingly Democratic city running for mayor against a billionaire who is trying hard to become a household name, Mr. Badillo is, once again, playing against the odds. "All he has is money," he said of Mr. Bloomberg. "I have everything else: the experience, the support, the vision, and the drive."
Details of Mr. Badillo's life suggest a man who thrives on adversity.
Born in rural Caguas, Puerto Rico, Mr. Badillo lost both parents to tuberculosis, his father when he was 1 and his mother at 5. Because his mother became ill with tuberculosis shortly after he was born, the only memories Mr. Badillo has of her are the glimpses he stole of her sickbed as the door to her room swung open to allow the rare visitor in.
"That's your mother," his aunts told him, quickly shutting the door before the little boy could catch a whiff of her disease.
At 11, without being able to speak English, he moved to the United States but he bounced from relative to relative until he settled in New York with an aunt at 14. By then, Mr. Badillo knew that school would get him out of poverty.
He went on to graduate with top grades from high school, City College, and Brooklyn Law School. At the beginning of his political career he was often dismissed because potential backers thought he wasn't Puerto Rican enough. He was told he was too tall (he is 6 foot 1) or that his English was too good to be a viable Hispanic candidate, he said. When he first ran for office, he recalled yesterday, he did not have the support of Democratic leaders. 
His political positions are often colored by his personal experience. He seems to believe that because he made it, others can, too. He is against social promotion in school and for rigorous standards in elementary and secondary education, beginning in the first grade.
"All human beings are created equal," he said. "The most insulting and demeaning policy we could follow is to continue to have a double standard -- one for whites and one for African-Americans and Latinos."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 9, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Herman Badillo's official announcement that he will run for mayor referred imprecisely to his nationality. He was born in Puerto Rico, a United States commonwealth, and was thus an American citizen when he moved to New York at age 11.

HEADLINE: In a Shift, White House Cites Global Warming as a Problem 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7 

 BODY:
With a new scientific report in hand that reaffirms the reality of global warming, the Bush White House readily acknowledged today that climate change was a problem but gave little clue as to what it intended to do about it.
 Ari Fleischer, the president's spokesman, told reporters that when President Bush heads for Europe next week: "He's going to tell the Europeans that he takes this issue very seriously, that global climate change is an issue that nations do need to deal with -- all nations, industrialized nations, the United States, developing nations, as well. And that through technologies and through growth and through other measures, that the world has a responsibility to face up to this." 
 This is the strongest language the White House has used on the issue and a far cry from its earlier position that the science was too uncertain to proclaim global warming a problem. 
But a report from the National Academy of Sciences, requested by the White House and released on Wednesday, reaffirmed the mainstream scientific view that the earth's temperature is rising, largely because of human activities, and that this could cause drastic climate changes throughout the century.
Even before the report, the president was meeting with cabinet officials to work out a position and figure out how to present it at home and abroad.
Mr. Bush is expected to address the subject of global warming on Monday before leaving for Europe that night. Administration officials said that a draft of his remarks was being reworked to reflect a more accommodating tone because of the new report.
Still, it is not clear whether the president will speak in generalities or put forth a specific proposal that he will take to appease European leaders, who have been furious with him for walking away in March from the international treaty on global warming, known as the Kyoto Protocol.
Environmentalists say that the central argument in the White House is whether to require countries to live under mandatory emission limits or to allow them to comply voluntarily.
Mr. Fleischer declined today to specify what approaches the White House was considering but said that it was looking at a wide variety of proposals, "many with great specificity about what to do."
Another debate is over how much to rely on the framework of the Kyoto accord, with its market-based incentives, to draft a new proposal. Some administration officials contend that Kyoto, which required mandatory emission reductions, is something the president would never accept and that it would be bad for the American economy.
Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, which represents several multinational corporations that favor the Kyoto accord as a basis for some kind of agreement, said: "Our companies are convinced this is a serious problem, convinced there will be an international agreement, and want the rules flexible and market based. And Kyoto has that framework." The companies represented by Pew include DuPont, the Enron Corporation and Alcoa. 
Ms. Claussen said the Bush administration was trying to figure out what approach to take on emissions in the United States before agreeing with other countries on limiting emissions. "They are weighing very heavily what they are prepared to do at home before deciding what to do abroad," she said.
But that inevitably leads to a conflict with the administration's energy proposal, which relies heavily on increasing production of coal and oil refineries, a difficult position for the administration to advocate at the same time it advocated reduced emissions. The problem of global warming was given only glancing attention in the energy report released last month.
Ian Bowles, President Bill Clinton's senior director of global environmental affairs at the National Security Council, said that he understood the Bush White House to be focusing on domestic emissions as well, and that this could be useful.
"The big-picture dynamic that the Clinton administration faced on Kyoto was that Europe never thought the U.S. was serious about reducing its own emissions," Mr. Bowles said. "Bush is correct that this boils down to whether the U.S. does anything domestically. But if Bush says our plan is to acknowledge that global warming is real and create incentives and voluntary commitments, that will be wholly unpersuasive to Europe."
Mr. Bowles is a co-author of an article in the journal Science in which he discusses the challenges of creating an international treaty on climate change. One of the big problems, he noted, is that climate change is occurring on a vast geologic time scale that is not usually evident to politicians running for office on a four-year cycle.
"Temperature changes during any single election cycle are likely to be quite small," the article says.
