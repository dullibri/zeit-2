HEADLINE: 6 Central Banks Act to Buy Time In Europe Crisis

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM; Stephen Castle contributed reporting from Brussels, Jack Ewing from Warsaw and Hiroko Tabuchi from Tokyo.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve and other major central banks moved on Wednesday to help foreign banks more easily borrow and lend money, seeking to forestall a breakdown of global financial markets and giving Europe more time to wrestle with its debts. The latest round of interventions by central banks, including the expansion of an existing Fed program that lets foreign banks borrow dollars at a low interest rate, reflects growing concerns that Europe's financial problems are hampering growth.
In a sign that the fallout is increasingly global, the Chinese central bank, which has sought to slow an overheated economy and inflation over the last year, also moved unexpectedly but independently Wednesday to encourage new lending by Chinese commercial banks.
In Europe and the United States, where the announcement broke well ahead of stock market openings, the prospect of more cheap money to ease banks' operations sent stock indexes soaring. A broad index of German stocks, the DAX, jumped almost 5 percent Wednesday, while the broad measure of American stocks, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, climbed more than 4 percent. Short-term borrowing costs also declined modestly for some European governments and banks. 
But policy makers and analysts were quick to caution that the Fed's action did not address the fundamental financial problems threatening the survival of the European currency union. At best, they said, efforts by central banks to ease financial conditions could allow the 17 European Union countries that use the euro sufficient time to agree on a plan for its preservation.
''The European sovereign debt problem will not be solved only with liquidity,'' the governor of Japan's central bank, Masaaki Shirakawa, told reporters in Tokyo. He said that he ''strongly'' expected Europe to ''push through economic and fiscal reform.''
European leaders, increasingly concerned by a deteriorating financial picture, said Wednesday they were forming a plan to convince markets that the debts of nations like Italy and Greece were not overwhelmingly large and to set new rules to constrain borrowing by euro zone members. They pointed to a scheduled meeting in Brussels on December 8-9 as a looming deadline for those efforts.
''We are now entering the critical period of 10 days to complete and conclude the crisis response of the European Union,'' Olli Rehn, European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said Wednesday after a meeting of European finance ministers.
Politicians in Europe and the United States have seemed paralyzed for more than two years by the twin challenges of reducing debt and increasing economic growth. That has left central bankers to act alone. A JPMorgan Chase analysis of the monetary policy of major central banks found that the tendency was more toward reducing borrowing costs than at any time since the fall of 2009.
The Fed, which announced new measures to stimulate the domestic economy in August and again in September, said the move announced Wednesday was designed to ease a particular strain on the global economy: It has become increasingly difficult for foreign banks to borrow dollars, which they need to finance existing obligations and to make new loans because a significant portion of global financial transactions occur in dollars.
The Fed and the other central banks announced that they would reduce roughly by half the cost of an existing program under which banks in foreign countries can borrow dollars from their own central banks, which in turn get those dollars from the Fed. The banks also said that loans would be available until February 2013, extending a previous cutoff of August 2012.
''The purpose of these actions is to ease strains in financial markets and thereby mitigate the effects of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses and so help foster economic activity,'' said a statement released by the Fed, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank.
The dollar crunch is most pronounced in Europe, because American money market funds reduced their investments in continental banks by 42 percent between the end of May and the end of October, according to Fitch Ratings. The retreat from France was particularly severe, with money funds cutting their exposure by more than two-thirds.
The lending program expansion is mostly a protective measure -- by easing access to dollars now, the banks can guard against a full-fledged liquidity crisis later. So far, the Fed has just $2.4 billion in outstanding currency loans, including $522 million lent last week to the European Central Bank. By contrast, at the height of the financial crisis in November 2008, the Fed had outstanding dollar swaps with foreign banks of almost $572 billion.
The European Central Bank will next offer dollar loans to banks on Wednesday. ''This is something that is very welcome,'' Silvio Peruzzo, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in London, wrote in an analysis. ''This will not solve all deep-based funding problems which are due to the sovereign debt crisis. But there is an issue with dollar liquidity, especially with foreign currency, and this measure addresses that.''
The Fed's policy-making committee approved the arrangements during a videoconference Monday morning by a vote of 9 to 1. The dissenting vote was cast by Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who said in a statement that the program amounted to an act of fiscal policy, which is the responsibility of the Treasury Department.
The arrangements carry little risk for the Fed, which receives an equal amount of the currency of the borrowing country together with a commitment to reverse the transaction at the same exchange rate. The loans also are modestly profitable, as the foreign central banks pass on to the Fed the interest payments that they collect from borrowers.
But the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, could face fresh political criticism for the decision. Republican presidential candidates, including Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, have blasted Mr. Bernanke for past lending to foreign banks, saying the Fed should focus on the United States.
The Fed lent dollars to a broader range of central banks from December 2007 through February 2010, then allowed the program to lapse because demand had dried up amidst signs of improvement in the global economy. It was quickly forced to reverse course, however, and it started the current program in May 2010.
The underlying price of the loans is based on a financial measure called the dollar overnight swaps index, which has hovered close to zero for several years. The Fed additionally charges a premium of one percentage point, which will be reduced to half a point on Monday. The most recent loan to the European Central Bank, which carried an interest rate of 1.08 percent, now would cost 0.58 percent.
The Fed will now offer money at lower cost to European banks than to American banks, which pay a rate of 0.75 percent at the Fed's emergency lending discount window. The difference reflects the reality that European banks are in much more trouble.
''U.S. financial institutions currently do not face difficulty obtaining liquidity in short-term funding markets,'' the central bank said in a statement. ''However, were conditions to deteriorate, the Federal Reserve has a range of tools available to provide an effective liquidity backstop for such institutions.''

HEADLINE: Inflation Fears Easing, China's Central Bank Turns to Lifting Growth

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's central bank, in a surprise move on Wednesday, shifted its economic focus from fighting inflation to stimulating growth by freeing the nation's commercial banks to lend more money.
The bank's move was separate from the subsequent announcement by central bankers in the United States, Europe and Japan that they would pump more dollars into the European banking system. And Western officials said Beijing's move was not done in coordination with theirs.
Still, China's motive was similar: to keep credit flowing through the financial markets. 
For more than a year, the Chinese central bank tried to squeeze the country's banking system in hopes of restraining inflation. Its action on Wednesday's indicated that China's government feared the country's growth engine was starting to falter.
On Thursday morning, the Chinese government released its latest monthly survey of purchasing managers, which confirmed spreading weakness in the economy. The index dropped to 49.0 in November, from 50.4 in October; any reading below 50 suggests a slowing economy, and the November figure was the first below 50 in more than two years.
Real estate developers, small businesses and other borrowers have complained strenuously in recent weeks of weakening sales and scarce credit. Prices have dropped up to 28 percent for new apartments in some Chinese cities this autumn, and real estate brokers have laid off thousands of agents as transactions slowed. Meanwhile, export orders have slumped, particularly those from Europe.
Beijing's action is a technical one. It allows commercial banks to slightly reduce the percentage of their deposits that they must keep on reserve at the central bank. But the change, which will take effect Monday, means that commercial banks will have more money available to lend, which could help rekindle economic growth and help prevent a disastrous burst of China's real estate bubble.
''This is a big move -- it signals China is now in loosening mode,'' Stephen Green, a China economist at Standard Chartered Bank, wrote in a research note Wednesday.
The Shanghai stock market jumped 2.7 percent at the start of trading on Thursday, as investors seemed to focus more on the easing of monetary policy than on the downbeat reading from the purchasing managers survey. The stock market fell 3.3 percent on Wednesday, when investors incorrectly bet that the government was not prepared to take any immediate action to address the weakening economy.
China's economic growth was the envy of the world until very recently. And even though the country's economy grew in the third quarter at its slowest annual pace in nearly two years, that growth rate was still strong: 9.1 percent in July to September, compared with a year earlier.
But a growing number of Chinese economic indicators are flashing warnings nonetheless. Thousands of Hong Kong-owned factories have closed in southern China this year as Chinese labor costs have risen, the Chinese currency has gradually appreciated against the dollar and export orders have slackened.
Despite signs of an export slowdown, many economists say China's currency, the renminbi, is still artificially low compared with the dollar. That, they say, is a result of Beijing's long-standing policy of buying dollars in international currency markets to depress the renminbi and keep the nation's exports cheap.
The move that the central bank announced Wednesday would make it more difficult for China to maintain that policy. That is because the central bank, the People's Bank of China, makes its dollar purchases with the money it forces the commercial banks to keep on reserve. By reducing those reserve requirements, the People's Bank will have less money to spend on currency intervention.
But economists said they saw signs in the last month that the People's Bank had less need to limit the renminbi's value, anyway. Speculation in the currency by foreign investors -- one factor that could force it higher -- has been dissipating as investors find more pressing uses for their money.
Until recently, much of the slowdown in the Chinese economy was deliberately engineered by the government to slow inflation. Government officials have been particularly blunt about their willingness to see housing prices decline somewhat, to make homes affordable to more of the nation's 1.3 billion people.
One question now is whether the government's tight credit policy damaged buyers' confidence in the real estate market and in the overall economy so much that it will be difficult to reverse course effectively. Another question is whether the government now risks a resurgence of inflation by relaxing its banks' lending constraints. It was a flurry of loans in 2009 and 2010, as Beijing sought to buffer China from the post-Lehman Brothers financial crisis, that helped set off inflation.
According to official data, inflation in consumer prices has started to slow, down to 5.5 percent in October from a peak of 6.5 percent in July. But private economists say that the true rate of consumer inflation may be twice as high because of shortcomings in the official data gathering.
By anyone's measure, inflation remains well above the government's goal of 4 percent. But policy makers now appear more worried about maintaining economic growth.
The move the government announced on Wednesday was a reduction in the so-called reserve requirement ratio -- something the central bank increased six times this year. The new ratios, as of Monday, will be 0.5 percentage points lower -- to 21 percent of total deposits for large banks, and to 19 percent for smaller ones.
The government provided no explanation for its move, releasing only a one-sentence statement: ''The People's Bank of China decided to cut financial institutions' renminbi deposit reserve ratio by 0.5 percentage points.''
Experts note that monetary policy changes in China are made by the State Council, the country's cabinet, and not by the central bank. Shifts in the broad direction of policy are usually made only with the approval of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party -- the nine officials, all men, who really run China.
Analysts said the decision to announce a change in reserve requirements, rather than quietly nudge state-controlled banks to make more loans, signaled an important political action.
''The public nature of this move -- a move that would have gone through the State Council -- is a clear signal that Beijing has decided that the balance of risks now lies with growth, rather than inflation,'' wrote Mr. Green, the Standard Chartered economist.

HEADLINE: A Lawmaker Back in Trouble, in a District That Knows Despair

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS; Lisa W. Foderaro, Thomas Kaplan and Kate Taylor contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Devon Moore heard the news on Wednesday morning, and he was disgusted. But not surprised.
When Assemblyman William F. Boyland Jr. was indicted for a second time, accused again of soliciting bribes in exchange for official favors -- in part to pay his legal fees from the first trial -- longtime residents of Brownsville, one of Brooklyn's most economically depressed neighborhoods, just shook their heads in resignation.
It was yet another disappointment from the man with the well-known name they sent to Albany to help them. 
''But of course -- you expect more,'' Mr. Moore, 35, said. ''But look where you're at.''
He stood in front of the Peanut Lucky Supermarket, on a forlorn corner of Pitkin Avenue, a main shopping thoroughfare. He was steps from where a 34-year-old mother, who was trying to shield a group of children, was shot and killed in October by a teenager firing from a rooftop.
Violence and unemployment are the status quo in this neighborhood, and records indicate that in the more than eight years Mr. Boyland has been in Albany, he has done little to help change that.
He had one of the worst attendance records in the State Assembly this year, absent for 20 of the 60 days the Assembly was in session. He was the only member of the State Legislature who did not introduce a piece of legislation in this year's session, according to the New York Public Interest Research Group.
Mr. Boyland, 41, a Democrat, was first elected in 2003 (following his father in the State Assembly) to represent the 55th District, which includes Brownsville, Ocean Hill, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Crown Heights and Bushwick. Since then, he has sponsored only two pieces of legislation that passed both the Senate and the Assembly, though he has been a co-sponsor of other bills.
One bill, authorizing a study on drugs for children with attention deficit disorder, was vetoed in 2010. The other, signed into law in 2005, made a technical change, sought by the Bloomberg administration, regarding loans given by the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development for neighborhood improvement projects.
''This neighborhood really needs help,'' said Supreme Johnson, 40, a community advocate who founded the group Men Elevating Leadership and Youth in 2004. He sat in a barber chair on Pitkin Avenue, perplexed by the latest developments.
Even more galling to him than Mr. Boyland's political inaction or bribery charges -- Mr. Boyland was acquitted in the first case on Nov. 10 -- was that the money he is accused of demanding could have been used in a far better way, Mr. Johnson said.
''We have to give people, those who can stop kids from killing each other and selling drugs, the chance to get these kids involved in other activities,'' he said.
Mr. Johnson said Mr. Boyland contributed to youth sports programs in the summer. ''But where's he getting it from, and who's he paying off?'' he said.
Few in the community could supply concrete answers on Wednesday about services that Mr. Boyland had delivered to his constituents. Viola D. Greene-Walker, the district manager for Community Board 16, spanning Ocean Hill and Brownsville, said that Mr. Boyland ''was able to bring some programs into the community, like funding for some of the housing that has been built.''
Mr. Boyland's district office in Brownsville is on Thomas S. Boyland Street, named for his uncle, a popular state assemblyman who was a highly regarded advocate for the less fortunate. The storefront office was virtually empty Wednesday afternoon.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Boyland did not return messages.
''The community loses again, not only to violence but to corruption,'' said Tony Herbert, an activist who plans to run for Mr. Boyland's seat.
The federal complaint issued on Tuesday said that Mr. Boyland negotiated $250,000 in bribes. The Capitol, a political newspaper, reported that Mr. Boyland filed per diems -- fees intended to repay his expenses while in Albany -- on several days when he was meeting with undercover agents in Brooklyn.
Asked about Mr. Boyland's claims that he had connections in City Hall and influence over certain city agencies, including the parks department, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said on Wednesday: ''From what we can tell it's just idle boasts.''
In the complaint, Mr. Boyland told an undercover agent and a cooperating witness that he had met with a deputy parks commissioner to discuss bringing a carnival to Brooklyn, saying: ''We pretty much have a green light here guys. ... We can pretty much do what we need to do here.''
A person with knowledge of Mr. Boyland's relationship with the department, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing, denied that Mr. Boyland met with anyone from the parks department about a carnival.
Blocks from Mr. Boyland's office, at the Glenmore Plaza Senior Center, a worker served women sugar for their tea as they created art projects.
Because of a lack of financing, she said, she bought the supplies with her own money. In the past, Mr. Boyland's office had contributed to the youth and senior programs, but not recently.
''It is really sad,'' said the employee, who would not give her name because she was afraid she would lose her job. ''You represent our district and you're putting it in your own pocket.''

HEADLINE: A Gallery That Helped Create the American Art World Closes Shop After 165 Years

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
After 165 years, Knoedler & Company, one of the oldest and most prestigious art galleries in the country, is permanently closing its doors. Opened at a time when there were no major museums in New York, Knoedler helped shape the tastes as well as decorate the homes of America's new class of wealthy barons.
Although the gallery's history is long and expansive, its statement Wednesday evening about closing was short and sudden: ''It is with profound regret that the owners of Knoedler Gallery announce its closing, effective today. This was a business decision made after careful consideration over the course of an extended period of time. Gallery staff will assist with an orderly winding down of Knoedler Gallery.'' 
Nothing was said about what will happen to one of Knoedler's most valuable properties: an enormous library that includes letters, photographs, sale records, stock books and catalogs going back to 1863.
News of the institution's demise was met with surprise at Art Basel Miami Beach, an art fair where leading artists and gallery owners from around the world have gathered this week.
''Goodness me, that's pretty stunning,'' said Lucy Mitchell-Innes, president of the Art Dealers Association of America, who was at the Art Basel fair. ''My reaction is one of tremendous sadness. This is a very venerable institution that provided great art to a number of the great collections and great institutions in this country.''
Knoedler, at 19 East 70th Street, has been rattled by a series of changes over the past three years, including the recession in 2008. In October 2009, Ann Freedman, the gallery's president and an employee of 31 years, resigned. Two months later, the gallery put the landmark Italian Renaissance-style town house that it has occupied for the past 41 years on sale for $59.9 million. This past February, the building was sold for $31 million.
Most recently, a civil lawsuit involving the Dedalus Foundation, a nonprofit organization created by the artist Robert Motherwell, put Knoedler in an embarrassing light. The foundation accused Ms. Freedman of selling forged paintings by Motherwell while she was president of Knoedler, an assertion she has denied.
Knoedler will be better remembered for its history of bringing the American art world into existence, however. The gallery, which has occupied eight different homes since it was founded by Michael Knoedler in 1846, has hosted works by the titans of American art, including Frederic E. Church, Winslow Homer, George Bellows, John Singer Sargent, Jackson Pollock, Milton Avery, Helen Frankenthaler, Frank Stella and scores of others.
From its tiny beginnings as the American representative of the French engravers Goupil & Company, Knoedler built a long list of private and institutional collectors like Andrew Mellon, J. P. Morgan, Henry Clay Frick, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Louvre, and the Tate Galleries in London. His eldest son, Roland Knoedler, took over the business, eventually moving it in 1925 to 57th Street and Madison Avenue, which became a new center for art dealers.
Knoedler's prospects darkened considerably after the gallery passed from the family's control. A move to the East 70th Street town house in 1970, accompanied by expensive renovations and mismanagement, put the business on a precarious financial footing. A year later, the financier and art collector Armand Hammer bought the teetering gallery for $2.5 million. The Hammer Foundation holds a controlling interest in the gallery, and Michael Hammer, Armand's grandson, is the chairman.
In 2004 and 2005, Knoedler once again remodeled its town house, restoring original 1909 details and constructing a new exhibition space below the main gallery, where up-and-coming artists could be shown in exhibition.
The decision to close the gallery came without warning. Even after the announcement Wednesday evening, the gallery's Web site said an exhibition of Charles Simonds's sculptures would run through Jan. 14, while callers heard a recorded message that insisted, ''We are open, but unable to answer your call at this time.''

HEADLINE: An Imposing Museum Turns Warm and Fuzzy

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
In some ways the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's expansion is like the many other recent building efforts by cultural institutions around the country. It is costly ($325 million), time consuming (due to be completed in 2016) and ambitious (the square footage will more than double).
But in other ways, the architects suggest, the project presents a post-recession template, in which function and use of a space almost take precedence over aesthetics. For example, although the museum's new galleries are designed by Snohetta, a firm arguably in the starchitect stratum, they are not intended to draw attention to themselves. They will have white walls and wood floors -- no challenging curves or flashy finishes. 
Moreover, the final design, to be announced on Thursday, devotes considerable space (40,000 square feet) to free public areas, as if to say that the museum is as much a place to gather as it is a place to view art.
''A challenge museums have now is how much are they about making social spaces,'' Craig Dykers, the principal architect at Snohetta, said. ''Is it a building filled with art with some people in it, or a building filled with people with some art in it? There needs to be enough social space to make people feel comfortable in what can be an austere environment, the white box. You shouldn't feel like you need to be quiet in the public spaces.''
The museum sought an airy, open aesthetic that would convey this laid-back tone and better connect with its neighborhood, known as South of Market. ''We really want the museum to be much more outward-looking,'' said Neal Benezra, the museum's director, ''to open up the doors and bring the public in.''
Mr. Benezra said he chose Snohetta after admiring the architects' opera house in Oslo. ''It's open, it's embracing, it's extremely generous in the way it interacts with the city,'' he said.
To keep the museum's users prominently in mind, the architects dreamed up various prototypes, creating names and narratives for them: the seventh-grade student, the art lover, the staff member. Then they walked these imagined characters through a hypothetical building. They also used information gleaned from workshops with potential visitors.
''We like to say that people aren't abstractions in our work,'' Mr. Dykers said.
The current building -- into which the museum moved from the Beaux-Arts War Memorial Veterans Building in 1995 -- served its purpose for a time. It is a massive brick structure designed by the Swiss architect Mario Botta that established the museum's presence and helped revive its surroundings, attracting small businesses and foot traffic.
But the museum needed more gallery space to show a collection that has doubled over the last 15 years, to 27,000 objects. And the building lacked a public presence, with no inviting front entrance and an undistinguished facade.
''It's a little bit fortresslike,'' said Gary Garrels, the museum's senior curator of painting and sculpture. ''You kind of have to take the plunge to come into it. It's a little bit hermetic.''
To counteract that imposing exterior, the architects are creating three entrances to supplement the existing one. So that the museum can better relate to its environment, the architects have also inserted a midblock outdoor promenade, running from Howard Street to Natoma Street, that will open a new route of pedestrian circulation through the neighborhood and enliven Natoma Street, currently a dead end. There will also be a passage connecting the new Transbay Transit Center (being developed northeast of the museum) to Yerba Buena Gardens.
The design of the expansion, to be built on lots behind the existing building, was inspired by the sloping streets and flowing water of San Francisco, the architects said, and it pays homage to that city's distinctive landscape.
''It's hard to ignore the beauty of the hills and how they somehow clash with the grid of the city,'' Mr. Dykers said. ''The fog rolling in and out creates a feeling of change.''
The facade will be made of precast concrete panels that appear to shift as the sun moves across them. The building will be set back from the street to allow natural light to pour into the public pathways.
Founded in 1935, the museum has built a reputation as a premier institution for contemporary art. Jackson Pollock had his first museum show there, as did Clyfford Still and Arshile Gorky.
Mr. Garrels said he was looking forward to being able to dedicate galleries to artists like Agnes Martin, Anselm Kiefer and Gerhard Richter.
The expansion will make room for 1,100 works from the collection of Donald Fisher, founder of the Gap and a former museum trustee, and his wife, Doris. Shortly before Mr. Fisher's death in 2009 the couple agreed to lend the museum an impressive cache, by the likes of Calder, de Kooning and Warhol, for 100 years.
But the design's primary thrust is to convey a friendlier, more welcoming feeling. The museum will create 10,000 square feet of outdoor space for congregating, in addition to the existing 9,000-square-foot sculpture garden atop the fifth-floor parking garage.
There will be a new all-glass gallery on Howard Street that is free to the public, a wider entrance stairway and a restaurant in the lobby.
''We changed the psychology of the museum,'' Mr. Benezra said. ''We want it to be an embracing, luminous space where you can get good coffee, a place where people come and meet their friends.''

An article on Wednesday about the expansion of a federal program meant to help some homeowners whose home values have declined sharply misstated, in some editions, the amount of spending power that would be added to the American economy if 10 million more homeowners refinanced and saved an average of $200 a month. It is $24 billion, not $240 billion.

HEADLINE: A Banker Speaks, With Regret

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
If you want to understand why the Occupy movement has found such traction, it helps to listen to a former banker like James Theckston. He fully acknowledges that he and other bankers are mostly responsible for the country's housing mess.
As a regional vice president for Chase Home Finance in southern Florida, Theckston shoveled money at home borrowers. In 2007, his team wrote $2 billion in mortgages, he says. Sometimes those were ''no documentation'' mortgages. 
''On the application, you don't put down a job; you don't show income; you don't show assets,'' he said. ''But you still got a nod.''
''If you had some old bag lady walking down the street and she had a decent credit score, she got a loan,'' he added.
Theckston says that borrowers made harebrained decisions and exaggerated their resources but that bankers were far more culpable -- and that all this was driven by pressure from the top.
''You've got somebody making $20,000 buying a $500,000 home, thinking that she'd flip it,'' he said. ''That was crazy, but the banks put programs together to make those kinds of loans.''
Especially when mortgages were securitized and sold off to investors, he said, senior bankers turned a blind eye to shortcuts.
''The bigwigs of the corporations knew this, but they figured we're going to make billions out of it, so who cares? The government is going to bail us out. And the problem loans will be out of here, maybe even overseas.''
One memory particularly troubles Theckston. He says that some account executives earned a commission seven times higher from subprime loans, rather than prime mortgages. So they looked for less savvy borrowers -- those with less education, without previous mortgage experience, or without fluent English -- and nudged them toward subprime loans.
These less savvy borrowers were disproportionately blacks and Latinos, he said, and they ended up paying a higher rate so that they were more likely to lose their homes. Senior executives seemed aware of this racial mismatch, he recalled, and frantically tried to cover it up.
Theckston, who has a shelf full of awards that he won from Chase, such as ''sales manager of the year,'' showed me his 2006 performance review. It indicates that 60 percent of his evaluation depended on him increasing high-risk loans.
In late 2008, when the mortgage market collapsed, Theckston and most of his colleagues were laid off. He says he bears no animus toward Chase, but he does think it is profoundly unfair that troubled banks have been rescued while troubled homeowners have been evicted.
When I called JPMorgan Chase for its side of the story, it didn't deny the accounts of manic mortgage-writing. Its spokesmen acknowledge that banks had made huge mistakes and noted that Chase no longer writes subprime or no-document mortgages. It also said that it has offered homeowners four times as many mortgage modifications as homes it has foreclosed on.
Still, 28 percent of all American mortgages are ''underwater,'' according to Zillow, a real estate Web site. That means that more is owed than the home is worth, and the figure is up from 23 percent a year ago. That overhang stifles the economy, for it's difficult to nurture a broad recovery unless real estate and construction revive.
All this came into sharper focus this week as Bloomberg Markets magazine published a terrific expose based on lending records it pried out of the Federal Reserve in a lawsuit. It turns out that the Fed provided an astonishing sum to keep banks afloat -- $7.8 trillion, equivalent to more than $25,000 per American.
The article estimated that banks earned up to $13 billion in profits by relending that money to businesses and consumers at higher rates.
The Federal Reserve action isn't a scandal, and arguably it's a triumph. The Fed did everything imaginable to avert a financial catastrophe -- and succeeded. The money was repaid.
Yet what is scandalous is the basic unfairness of what has transpired. The federal government rescued highly paid bankers from their reckless decisions. It protected bank shareholders and creditors. But it mostly turned a cold shoulder to some of the most vulnerable and least sophisticated people in America. Last year alone, banks seized more than one million homes.
Sure, some programs exist to help borrowers in trouble, but not nearly enough. We still haven't taken such basic steps as allowing bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of a mortgage on a primary home. Legislation to address that has gotten nowhere.
My daughter and I are reading Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath'' aloud to each other, and those Depression-era injustices seem so familiar today. That's why the Occupy movement resonates so deeply: When the federal government goes all-out to rescue errant bankers, and stiffs homeowners, that's not just bad economics. It's also wrong.

HEADLINE: After Uproar on Longer Exams, State's Testing Director Resigns

BYLINE: By ANNA M. PHILLIPS

 BODY:
The director of New York State's educational testing program resigned on Tuesday, according to education officials, the same day the state dropped a plan to extend the length of reading tests given in Grades 3 through 8 to nearly four hours. 
Principals received word of the plans to extend the length of the tests on Monday via e-mail, The Daily News reported. Some of them expressed outrage that young children would be asked to sit for such lengthy testing, and by the next day, officials had dropped the plan, saying it was a mistake to issue the order without first consulting principals.
David Abrams, the director of the testing program, resigned the same day. Dennis Tompkins, a department spokesman, would not say whether the news reports had influenced Mr. Abrams's decision to resign, but said it was a ''fairly sudden resignation.'' He said the department was already searching for a new testing director. Mr. Abrams did not respond to an e-mailed request for comment.
Mr. Abrams, who worked for the State Education Department for eight years, oversaw the recent changes to the state's math and English exams, which were modified in 2010 to make them harder to pass, after years of score inflation.
When the state decided to drop the test-extension plans, Mr. Tompkins told The Daily News that the department should have consulted the principals before making a change: ''That is our normal protocol. It should've been followed and it wasn't.''

HEADLINE: Report: Districts Pay Less in Poor Schools

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Education experts have long argued that a basic inequity in American schooling is that students in poor neighborhoods are frequently taught by low-paid rookie teachers who move on as they gain experience and rise up the salary scale. 
Until now, however, researchers lacked nationwide data to prove it. That changed Wednesday when the Department of Education released a 78-page report.
Its conclusion: Tens of thousands of schools serving low-income students are being shortchanged because districts spend fewer state and local dollars on teacher salaries in those schools than on salaries in schools serving higher-income students.
''Low-income students need extra support and resources to succeed, but in far too many places, policies for assigning teachers and allocating resources are perpetuating the problem rather than solving it,'' Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in a conference call.
The report, Comparability of State and Local Expenditures Among Schools Within Districts, is based on data collected from 84,000 public schools in districts that had to report salary expenditures to receive emergency federal money under the 2009 economic stimulus law, which channeled $100 billion to public education.
The inequities documented in the report began to accumulate within a few years of the passage of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the main federal law on public schools, which channels money to educate poor children. To prevent them from simply substituting the federal antipoverty dollars for local funds, districts had to show that they were spending at least as much state and local education money in the poor schools getting federal money as they were spending in their more affluent schools.
But a loophole allowed school systems to report educator salaries to Washington using a districtwide pay schedule, thus masking large salary gaps between the higher-paid veteran staffs in middle-class schools and the young teachers earning entry-level pay in poor parts of the district.
A few researchers have documented the problem with statewide data in Florida and some other states, said Cynthia Brown, a vice president at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group. ''But I'm excited because this is the first time that data documenting the problem has ever been collected on a nationwide basis,'' she said. ''Many of us have known for a long time that in some individual districts the high-poverty schools weren't getting their fair share of state and local funds.''
Federal officials estimated that although the inequities were widespread, alleviating them would not be costly.
''Providing low-income schools with comparable spending would cost as little as 1 percent of the average district's total spending,'' but the extra resources ''would make a big impact by adding between 4 percent and 15 percent to the budget'' of schools serving poor students, the department said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Running Dry on the Great Plains

BYLINE: By JULENE BAIR. 
Julene Bair, the author of ''One Degree West: Reflections of a Plainsdaughter,'' is at work on a memoir.

 BODY:
Longmont, Colo.
IMAGINE you are a farmer in the center of the country, where it seldom rains enough. Now imagine that a well driller came to your farm and told you that he could bore a hole deep into the ground, and that forever after you could pump out as much water as you needed to grow your crops. That is exactly what happened on the Great Plains in the mid-20th century. The wondrous resource containing all that water was the Ogallala Aquifer.
The Ogallala underlies portions of eight large states -- 174,000 square miles of crop and range land all the way from South Dakota to Texas. Over the last several months, it became about as famous as a geologic formation can get. With the nation's environmentalists at their side, Nebraska landowners battled ferociously against the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried oil extracted from Canadian tar sands through the environmentally sensitive Nebraska Sand Hills. If the pipeline leaked, they argued, chemicals and oil would seep down into the aquifer, contaminating a precious resource responsible for 27 percent of the nation's irrigated agriculture. 
They won -- for now. President Obama agreed last month to reconsider the pipeline's route. So is the Ogallala now safe? Not quite. Regardless of whether the pipeline was a good or bad idea, it was never the real danger. The true threat is posed by agriculture as it's currently practiced on the Great Plains by the farmers themselves, many of whom opposed the pipeline vehemently. The aquifer is being wasted and polluted. Wasted, that is, on corn, a thirsty crop that requires over 20 inches of irrigation water in parts of the Plains. And polluted with pesticides and nitrogen fertilizers.
It's not that I don't empathize with the Nebraska farmers. I grew up on a Kansas farm. Like them, we called our Ogallala water ''precious'' and bragged that it was the best in the world. But the aquifer's only natural recharge comes from rain and snow. In our Kansas district, less than half an inch of that reached the aquifer in a given year. We were allowed to pump out over 30 times that amount.
When I expressed concern, my father assured me that the government would step in to stop us someday. Until then, he liked to tease, ''I got mine!'' But the government has not stepped in. Controls imposed by local water districts -- run by irrigators themselves -- and by state legislators dependent on the farm vote have been minimal at best.
As a result, in some areas of Kansas and Texas, farmers can no longer pump enough to water their crops. If current withdrawal rates continue, usable water in most areas will be gone by the end of this century.
The aquifer in the Nebraska Sand Hills gets more recharge than elsewhere, because rain and snowmelt seep quickly through sand. Opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline argued that this characteristic made that part of the aquifer particularly susceptible to contamination. They were right. But contaminants are already there. According to a report by the United States Geological Survey in 2009, 90 percent of samples taken from shallow groundwater in Nebraska portions of the Ogallala contained nitrate from fertilizers.
The Ogallala is a geologic formation, not an underground lake that can be widely contaminated by a localized spill. Water fills the spaces between sandstone, gravel, clay and other sediments, which slow the water's lateral travel. A pipeline leak would have been minor compared to the damage that chemically dependent agriculture causes.
Chemicals trickle inexorably downward with each rainfall or application of irrigation water, creating a situation that the Geological Survey has referred to as ''creeping normalcy.'' Over the coming decades, it warned, contaminants will continue to creep down into the aquifer, and more wells will exceed federal safety levels.
Already, 14 percent of all Ogallala irrigation wells tested contained one pesticide or more. Most common was Atrazine. This herbicide, used ubiquitously in cornfields, is a known hormone disruptor and is suspected of, among other things, retarding fetal development. Five percent of the irrigation wells contained nitrate levels equal to or in excess of safety standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency. Excess nitrate levels in drinking water can impair the blood's ability to deliver oxygen in infants, causing ''blue baby syndrome.''
Why haven't viable environmental groups formed to protect the Ogallala? Because corn contributes so much to the economy that its reign is seldom questioned. Federal subsidy payments to corn growers and the federal mandate to produce ethanol underwrite the waste and pollution.
These subsidies should end. When the farm bill comes up for reauthorization next year, Congress should instead pay farmers to reduce their dependence on irrigation and chemicals. The eastern Nebraska climate is moist enough to grow corn without irrigation. That is how the University of Nebraska football team came to be the Cornhuskers. And the more arid High Plains to the west are known as the nation's breadbasket because wheat, a drought-tolerant crop, thrives there.
The Keystone XL pipeline posed a potential threat to a limited region. But agricultural waste and pollution are damaging the entire Ogallala Aquifer right now. In an era of growing population and advancing drought, we cannot afford complacency in the face of ''creeping normalcy.''

HEADLINE: As Economy Lags, Cuomo Reconsiders Tax Position

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
Faced with a worsening financial climate, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Wednesday that he was contemplating whether to propose changes to the state tax code, and he did not rule out the possibility that he would seek to raise taxes on wealthy New Yorkers.
In a pair of radio appearances, Mr. Cuomo offered no details on what he was considering. But he suggested that changing how the state taxed its residents and businesses could be a way to promote economic growth. 
''What I'm looking at is, what do you do with the tax code, and how can you use the tax code to stimulate the creation of private-sector jobs,'' Mr. Cuomo said in an interview on the Albany radio station WGDJ-AM. He made essentially the same point on ''Capitol Pressroom,'' a program carried by several stations.
As a candidate for governor last year, Mr. Cuomo said, ''Raising taxes is not an option - period,'' and he made similar pledges at his inauguration and in his State of the State address.
But since that time, the state's financial condition has worsened, and many of Mr. Cuomo's fellow Democrats, reinforced by the Occupy Wall Street movement, have urged him to reconsider his decision to allow an income tax surcharge on high earners, a so-called millionaires' tax, to lapse this month.
On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo affirmed his opposition to a state millionaires' tax, but declined to say that he would not seek any tax increases in the legislative session that begins in January.
''I am in discussions, I have ideas, people have ideas, but we have no decisions,'' Mr. Cuomo said, noting that his budget proposal would be unveiled in a month and a half.
Mr. Cuomo has spoken several times in recent weeks about his desire to ensure ''fairness'' in the tax code.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that he was considering a proposal that would alter the state's personal income tax brackets to raise additional revenue from the highest-earning New Yorkers while also providing new tax breaks, possibly aimed at the middle class.
The governor criticized that report as ''breathless,'' but he did not say it was inaccurate.
Mr. Cuomo added that he had been talking to economists to get their advice on how to confront the state's difficult financial condition and the chronic challenge of creating jobs, and that ''many of the suggestions have to do with the tax code.''
Any proposal to change the tax brackets would come with political risks for Mr. Cuomo, who has frequently proclaimed that under his watch, New York would no longer be ''the tax capital of the nation.'' The State Senate is controlled by Republicans, who have opposed extending the millionaires' tax.
''Our position is clear,'' said Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican. ''We support cutting taxes, not raising them.''
But Mr. Cuomo's comments drew praise from one Republican state senator.
''If the governor forced the discussion about actually aggressively going back and redoing the tax code with a complete overhaul, that'd be extremely helpful, especially in creating a more hospitable environment for working families and the real job creators,'' the senator, Gregory R. Ball of Putnam County, said.
Democrats in the State Assembly have pushed for Mr. Cuomo to seek the extension of the tax surcharge on high earners, saying an extension would be an obvious way to address the $3 billion to $3.5 billion budget gap projected for next year.
In a recent interview , the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said he would be receptive to any proposal from Mr. Cuomo to alter the state's tax brackets.
''We have to make it fairer,'' Mr. Silver said. ''People who make $50,000 can't be paying the same tax rate as people making $5 million. It's not right.''
In his radio interviews, Mr. Cuomo also lamented what he described as the gridlock that has plagued Washington in recent months. He said he was determined to avoid similar dysfunction in Albany in the budget season that begins next month.
''I'm going to be about coming up with a plan that I believe can forge consensus and compromise and can get passed,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Gimme Guide

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
IT may be better to give than to receive, but it sure is getting harder.
As social scientists and etiquette experts report -- and aggrieved lovers, irritable spouses and harried parents can confirm -- those who receive are an increasingly difficult cohort, picky and imperious to boot. They are treating loved ones like catalogs or department stores, brandishing lengthy wish lists, demanding gift cards or boldly asking for cash.
In fact, for the last five years, gift cards have been the most requested gift, according to surveys by the National Retail Foundation.
''It's no longer about this special delightful something from me to you,'' said Kit Yarrow, a consumer research psychologist and a co-author of ''Generation Buy: How Tweens, Teens and Twentysomethings Are Revolutionizing Retail.'' ''More and more people have gotten mercenary about the whole thing.'' 
This phenomenon has lately been documented in academic studies like ''Give Them What They Want: The Benefits of Explicitness in Gift-Exchange,'' by Francis J. Flynn, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and Francesca Gino, at the Harvard Business School, published in March in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology.
In five experiments, this study demonstrated that people accrued more pleasure from a gift (and were more appreciative of it) if it was something they had requested. What's more, the study's subjects rated givers as more thoughtful if they gave from a wish list.
Yet the givers (poor saps) wrongly imagined that their giftees would be equally appreciative of gifts that hadn't been solicited. They were also mistaken in believing a gift of cash would be less welcome.
How did we become so entitled? Or to put it a nicer way, so discerning?
''It's not just the recession,'' Dr. Yarrow said. Pointing to the rafts of stuff in our homes, she suggested that we are hoping not just to dam the flow but also to make sure that whatever objects we do acquire or receive match our taste, style and identity.
''We are pickier because we have become more 'surface,' '' she said. ''And by that I don't mean shallow. I mean the objects we display, the objects we use to communicate with each other, have become more and more important because there is just so much choice. When we started getting cheap clothes and other stuff from China, quality declined, and people had to be more discriminating.''
And because we are living in a Facebook world, in a fast-paced, highly visual society, Dr. Yarrow added, people ''increasingly rely on visual cues to bond -- and judge -- other people.''
Time spent online, she reasoned, has only amplified these tendencies. ''Phones, shoes, appliances have always been lifestyle cues, but never more so than now.''
What she meant is this: If you assume people will be judging you, or ''knowing you,'' as she put it, by what you wear and what your furniture wears, you can't just drape over the sofa any old afghan knitted by Mom.
Heaven forbid it should misrepresent your story.
Judith Martin, otherwise known as Miss Manners, is less forgiving, and much testier, than her sisters and brothers in the social sciences.
''Blatant greed,'' she'll tell you fiercely, ''is the No. 1 etiquette problem today.'' Ms. Martin blames bad etiquette training and the widespread idea that being honest means expressing your every wish.
''Most of my mail boils down to that,'' she said, meaning greed. ''It's either from people who think there is a polite way to go begging, or victims who feel they have to comply.''
''They are getting other people to do their shopping for them,'' she continued. ''They are exchanging shopping lists and paying for the milestones of life.''
And that is not, she added emphatically, ''what the ancient and noble practice of gift giving is supposed to be about, where you notice a person's interests and think about what they might like and you try to please them. Remember when people used to say, 'It's the thought that counts'? Now the thought is dreaded. Now it's, 'Let me tell you what I want,' or better yet, 'Give me the money and I'll get it myself.' ''
And don't get Ms. Martin started on the gift card, which she sees as just another way to exchange money.
Her advice for the hapless gift giver? ''You don't have to do as they ask.''
It is true that we are living in particularly venal times, but gift giving has always been something of a fraught endeavor, the gift (good or bad) a figure entered on the balance sheet of a relationship.
Between nations, of course, the exchange of gifts has long been a sign of allegiance and a measure of the strength of an alliance. Remember the trouble President Obama got into his first year in office when he gave Gordon Brown a boxed set of DVDs of classic American movies? (The DVDs turned out to be incompatible with the British system.) His gift to the queen of an iPod was similarly derided as being both tone deaf, and not quite up to snuff (her Majesty already had an iPod, it was reported).
Last May, on his second visit to Buckingham Palace, the president seemed to have worked harder on his choices. For the queen, there was a collection of memorabilia and photographs of her parents' visit to the United States in 1939; for Prince Philip, Fell Pony bits and shanks (we're not sure what those are, but we intuit the prince is an equestrian), along with a horseshoe worn by a famous horse. Prince Charles received a selection of plants, seedlings and seeds from Monticello, Mount Vernon and the White House. Someone had done his homework.
While acknowledging the difficulty of the president's assignment, as well as your own struggles in this arena, it is soothing and clarifying to use history, particularly ancient history, as a reality check. If you think our consumer culture and selfish habits have perverted the gift exchange, consider the ancients, whose giving habits make ours seem positively Amish. In Cleopatra's day, for example, her subjects regaled their queen with extravagant offerings that were part bribery, part tax, as Stacy Schiff, her biographer, noted.
''You tried to outdo your fellow courtiers,'' Ms. Schiff said. ''To prove yourself as first friend.''
The bar was sky high, since Cleopatra, no slouch in the gift department, was likely to send you home with a horse if you came to dinner. She lavished the Romans in particular with sumptuous swag, gifts of ''shimmering fabrics, cinnamon, gold beakers, mosaics, wild animals,'' Ms. Schiff said. ''She had an image to uphold and every reason to advertise her wealth.''
For most of history, she pointed out, people gifted up, to the crown. ''Now we tend to give down, to the hair cutter or the baby sitter, none of whom is giving mea gift.''
Last year, with her family at least, Ms. Schiff circumvented the holiday quandary with a novel approach: fantasy gifts, described on slips of paper and tucked under each person's plate one night at dinner. The givers were anonymous, and the recipients had to guess who had given what. One child received a hockey team; another, an invisibility cloak. There were also two admissions letters to Hogwarts. And for Ms. Schiff, a Pulitzer-winning author of four books?
''I got the ability to write a decent sentence,'' she said. ''Someone is a comedian.''
This season, you might try her family's tactic. Or you could choose from the objects assembled here by Rima Suqi and Tim McKeough. Their suggestions are stylish enough for the Cleopatras in your life, and personal enough to satisfy Miss Manners.
Good luck, in any case. This year, you'll need it.

HEADLINE: Literary Cubs

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
REBECCA CHAPMAN, who has a master of arts in English and comparative literature from Columbia University, hit bottom professionally last summer when she could not even get a job that did not pay. Vying for an internship at a boutique literary agency in Manhattan, Ms. Chapman, 25, had gone on three separate interviews with three people on three different days. ''They couldn't even send me an e-mail telling me I didn't get it,'' she said.
It's a story familiar to anyone seeking to break into the New York publishing world. Willie Osterweil, 25, an aspiring novelist who graduated magna cum laude from Cornell in 2009, found himself sweeping Brooklyn movie theaters for $7.25 an hour. And the closest that Helena Fitzgerald, a recent Columbia graduate, got was an interview at a top magazine, during which the editor dismissed her literary career dreams, telling her, ''C'mon, that's not realistic.''
Which explains, in a way, how they all ended up on a crisp November night, huddled together at an invitation-only party at a cramped, bookshelved apartment on the Upper East Side. 
It was the weekly meeting of The New Inquiry, a scrappy online journal and roving clubhouse that functions as an Intellectuals Anonymous of sorts for desperate members of the city's literary underclass barred from the publishing establishment. Fueled by B.Y.O.B. bourbon, impressive degrees and the angst that comes with being young and unmoored, members spend their hours filling the air with talk of Edmund Wilson and poststructuralism.
Lately, they have been catching the eye of the literary elite, earning praise that sounds as extravagantly brainy as the thesis-like articles that The New Inquiry uploads every few days.
''They're the precursor of this kind of synthesis of extrainstitutional intellectualism, native to the Internet, native to the city dweller,'' said the novelist Jonathan Lethem, an early champion.
''They're not trapped within an old paradigm,'' he added. ''They're just making it their own.''
The New Inquiry is edited by Rachel Rosenfelt, 26, who graduated from Barnard College in 2009. Though she had some luck finding work, her exposure to the literary establishment left her unimpressed. ''It killed my interest in publishing,'' she said of her internship at The New Yorker during her freshman year. ''It just felt like they had all 'arrived.' It was boring. No one talked. The only real rule was, 'Don't mess this up.' ''
Young, Web-savvy and idealistic, she and two friends -- Jennifer Bernstein and Mary Borkowski -- wanted to create their generation's version of cultural criticism, equally versed in Theodor Adorno and Britney Spears. Finding contributors was easy: their social circle was filled with overeducated, underemployed postgrads willing to work free to be heard on subjects like Kanye West's effect on the proletarian meta-narrative of hip-hop.
After earning a master's and writing on a farm in upstate New York, Ms. Chapman returned to the city uncertain about what to do next.
''I met Rachel on one of my first days back,'' she said, ''and she was like, 'Be our new literary editor.' ''
There was no thought of turning a profit. But who cared? No one was making any money on the traditional path, anyway.
''There's something incredibly liberating,'' Ms. Rosenfelt said, ''when you realize that climbing that ladder is a ladder to nowhere.''
Ms. Chapman added: ''My whole life, I had been doing everything everybody told me. I went to the right school. I got really good grades. I got all the internships. Then, I couldn't do anything.''
Ms. Rosenfelt and her collaborators envisioned a kind of literary salon reminiscent of the Lost Generation of the 1920s. So once a week, about 20 of The New Inquirer's contributors and guests gather at an unmarked clandestine bookstore, a sort of literary speakeasy, in a second-floor, three-room apartment on the Upper East Side.
At 9 p.m. on a recent Thursday, Ms. Rosenfelt, wearing a black sweater, miniskirt and combat boots, appeared behind a blue door in the unimposing prewar apartment building. The door creaked open to reveal a disheveled space that looked like a used-book store in any college town, with shelves of yellowing volumes of Dostoyevsky and Camus reaching to the ceiling and air thick with the musty smell of stale tobacco and old paperbacks.
This space belongs to a bookseller in his 50s, the godfather for The New Inquiry, a man with bushy brows and the affably abstruse mien of a coffeehouse intellectual. (He asked that his name and identifying details not be published because his building prohibits a shop in the space.) He opens only by invitation, when he feels like it.
Ms. Rosenfelt described meeting there as a form of ''urban hacking.''
For the first hour, attendees, most in their mid-20s and many dressed in untucked oxford shirts and off-brand jeans, mingled around a rickety table packed with half-empty Jim Beam bottles.
Despite the fact that everyone was young and attractive, no one seemed to flirt or network. Instead, they traded heady banter about the Situationists and reveled in an atmosphere of warmhearted mutual support; it felt like an oral dissertation mixed with a '70s encounter group.
At one point, a few debated, only half-ironically, whether a new bank in a former Dunkin Donuts nearby was philosophically akin to the French reactionaries' construction of the Sacre Coeur basilica on the site of the Paris Commune's insurrection in 1870.
Then, around 10 p.m., Ms. Rosenfelt called everyone into the main room. The highlight of each salon is a group reading in which each person selects a three-minute reading on the predetermined topic.
''We're reading about 'failed revolutions' tonight,'' Ms. Rosenfelt reminded the crowd. She started with a passage from ''To the Finland Station,'' ''in which Edmund Wilson couches the inevitable failure of Marxism in Edmund Wilson's idea of the national and ethnic identity of Marx.''
The room exploded in vaudeville-style hoots.
Continuing around the circle, Ms. Fitzgerald, the would-be magazine writer, read from ''The Cantos,'' by Ezra Pound. Mr. Osterweil, the frustrated novelist, read from Guy Debord's ''Society of the Spectacle.'' Tim Barker, a junior at Columbia, awkwardly admitted that he, too, had chosen a reading from Debord. (What are the odds?)
One young attendee offered a reading from Gustave Flaubert's ''Sentimental Education.''
''A lot of this book takes place during the revolutions of 1848,'' he explained. ''The part that I think has a good point for revolutionaries is how quickly a failed revolution can descend into careerism.''
The word hung in the air, as noxious as cigarette smoke.
DESPITE its slacker-revolutionary spirit, The New Inquiry is starting to tiptoe toward the publishing mainstream.
With an audience that understands references to consumerism as ''a hedonic treadmill,'' many articles in The New Inquiry make The Paris Review look like a beach read. Arch and often aggressively leftist, the articles dance effortlessly from Jacques Derrida to Lady Gaga.
Recent pieces include a review of Ben Jeffery's ''Anti-Matter''; a critical survey of the novels of the French provocateur Michel Houellebecq; an essay on the class struggle portrayed in ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes''; and a personal piece by Malcolm Harris, a young writer who recalled growing up in the suburbs and finding sanctuary in Borders.
The journal counts cultural savants like Todd Gitlin, Douglas Rushkoff and Mark Greif, a founder of N + 1, as early champions, and articles have been linked on Andrew Sullivan's Daily Beast blog and the National Public Radio Web site. Even barbs by the establishment elicit pride, like when James Wolcott of Vanity Fair called Mr. Osterweil's film criticism ''Maoist'' on Twitter.
On Sunday, the journal is to make a social debut of sorts among the city's literary A-list, organizing -- in partnership with the publisher New Directions, Google and others -- a marathon reading of Frederic Tuten's novel ''The Adventures of Mao on the Long March,'' featuring 60 readers, including writers like A. M. Homes, Kurt Andersen and Oscar Hijuelos, at the Jane hotel in the West Village.
And even though staff members routinely serve up gloomy eulogies over the ''death of print,'' the publication plans to roll out a quarterly print edition next year, along with an iPad magazine for $2 a month. Its breakout stars are even starting to climb publishing's ''ladder to nowhere.''
Atossa Abrahamian, 25, an editor, has written for New York Magazine. Sarah Leonard, 23, is an associate editor at Dissent. Mr. Harris, 22, who was sifting through grad-school rejection notices a year ago, has written for N + 1 and Utne Reader and has been called out by Glenn Beck on television.
This is not to say that the generational angst fueling The New Inquiry is likely to vanish soon. At the most recent salon two weeks ago, Will Canine, the operations director, showed up with 5 o'clock shadow after spending 35 hours in jail following his arrest at the Occupy Wall Street protests.
Tim Barker, a junior at Columbia, said he was drawn to the salons for the chance to ''discuss ideas at an extremely high level, without worrying about status or material support of traditional institutions: publishing houses or universities.'' He added, though, that while he aspires to be a history professor, he was ''extremely conscious of the contraction of job opportunities'' in publishing and academia.
Inside the bookstore, however, the turmoil of the outside world seemed far away. The lights were low, the conversation crackling.
''This is my fantasy: a room full of books, people talking about books -- it smells like books,'' explained Ms. Chapman, the journal's literary editor. ''It's the literary community that I had read about when I was younger. It's Moveable Feast-type stuff.''
Despite her upbeat take on the proceedings, Ms. Chapman admitted she wasn't feeling chipper. It was her birthday. A happy occasion? For most, maybe -- but not, she explained, when you are turning 25, having graduated summa from Cornell, with a master's from Columbia, only to find yourself unemployed and back living at home with your parents.

HEADLINE: Watergate? Whatever Was That?

 BODY:
House Republicans will surely invoke their all-purpose rationale -- deficit savings -- as they try on Thursday to repeal the public financing option for presidential campaigns. This is the highly effective reform enacted after the Watergate scandal. It is revealing that just as a new era of unbridled corporate and special-interest money engulfs the 2012 elections, Republicans are determined to kill off the public financing option. 
For decades, every major candidate opted for the subsidies and the spending limits until Congress failed to increase the federal match to account for campaign inflation. George W. Bush opted out for the primary fight in his 2000 campaign, seeking a larger war chest from private donors. Barack Obama dropped it for both the primary and general elections. He vowed to fix a ''broken'' system -- not now as he enjoys unprecedented private financing.
The cynicism at work in the House is underlined by the fact that even as Republican leaders target the public option, the Republican Party has quietly requested and received a tidy $17.7 million in public money to pay for its presidential convention next year (while offering no righteous outcries that it be offset by budget cutbacks).
Democratic Party leaders are also taking convention money, but at least House Democrats are fighting to repair, not bury, the public option. A strong measure to update donation formulas and campaign subsidies has been submitted by Representatives David Price of North Carolina and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. It has the added virtue of continuing the Election Assistance Commission, set up after the 2000 presidential vote-count crisis to help upgrade state and local voting systems.
Republicans want to shut that down, too, in the name of mission accomplished. Not hardly. More than ever, voters need a robust public presidential option and a continuing Election Assistance Commission.

HEADLINE: On Wall Street, Some Insiders Express Quiet Outrage

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER, PROPUBLICA. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. Email: jesse@propublica.org Twitter: @eisingerj.

 BODY:
Last week, I had a conversation with a man who runs his own trading firm. In the process of fuming about competition from Goldman Sachs, he said with resignation and exasperation: ''The fact that they were bailed out and can borrow for free - it's pretty sickening.''
Though the sentiment is commonplace these days, I later found myself thinking about his outrage. Here is someone who is in the thick of the business, trading every day, and he is being sickened by the inequities and corruption on Wall Street and utterly persuaded that nothing has changed in the years since the financial crisis of 2008. 
Then I realized something odd: I have conversations like this as a matter of routine. I can't go a week without speaking to a hedge fund manager or analyst or even a banker who registers somewhere on the Wall Street Derangement Scale.
That should be a great relief: Some of them are just like us! Just because you are deranged doesn't mean you are irrational, after all. Wall Street is already occupied - from within.
The insiders have a critique similar to that of the outsiders. The financial industry has strayed far from being an intermediary between companies that want to raise capital so they can sell people things they want. Instead, it is a machine to enrich itself, fleecing customers and widening income inequality. When it goes off the rails, it impoverishes the rest of us. When the crises come, as they inevitably do, banks hold the economy hostage, warning that they will shoot us in the head if we don't bail them out.
I won't pretend this is a widespread view in finance - or even a large minority. You don't hear this from the executives running the big Wall Street firms; you don't hear it from the average trader or investment banker. From them, we get self-pity. For every one of the secret Occupy Wall Street sympathizers, there are probably 15 others like Kenneth G. Langone, who, like downtrodden people before him, is trying to reclaim and embrace a pejorative, ''fat cat.''
The critics are more often found on the periphery, running hedge funds or working at independent research shops. They are retired, either voluntarily or not. They are low-level executives who haven't made scrambling up the corporate hierarchy their sole ambition in life. Perhaps their independent status removes the intellectual handcuffs that come with ungodly bonuses. Or perhaps they are able to see Big Money's flaws because they have to compete with the bigger banks for dollars.
Are these ''Wall Streeters''? To civilians, they work on the Street. Bankers at the bulge-bracket firms wouldn't think they are. But that doesn't mean they don't count. They know the financial business intimately.
Sadly, almost none of these closeted occupier-sympathizers go public. But Mike Mayo, a bank analyst with the brokerage firm CLSA, which is majority-owned by the French bank Credit Agricole, has done just that. In his book ''Exile on Wall Street'' (Wiley), Mr. Mayo offers an unvarnished account of the punishments he experienced after denouncing bank excesses. Talking to him, it's hard to tell you aren't interviewing Michael Moore.
Mr. Mayo is particularly outraged over compensation for bank executives. Excessive compensation ''sends a signal that you take what you get and take it however you can,'' he told me. ''That sends another signal to outsiders that the system is rigged. I truly wish the protestors didn't have a leg to stand on, but the unfortunate truth is that they do.''
I asked Richard Kramer, who used to work as a technology analyst at Goldman Sachs until he got fed up with how it did business and now runs his own firm, Arete Research, what was going wrong. He sees it as part of the business model.
''There have been repeated fines and malfeasance at literally all the investment banks, but it doesn't seem to affect their behavior much,'' he said. ''So I have to conclude it is part of strategy as simple cost/benefit analysis, that fines and legal costs are a small price to pay for the profits.''
Last week, in a Bloomberg Television event, both Laurence D. Fink, the chairman and chief executive of the mega-money management firm BlackRock, and Bill Gross, the legendary bond investor, evinced some sympathy for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Over the last several decades, ''money and finance have dominated at the expense of labor and Main Street, and so how can one not sympathize with their predicament?'' Mr. Gross said, speaking of the 99 percent. ''To not have sympathy with Main Street as opposed to Wall Street is to have blinders.''
It's progress that these sentiments now come regularly from people who work in finance. This is an unheralded triumph of the Occupy Wall Street movement. It's also an opportunity to reach out to make common cause with native informants.
It's also a failure. One notable absence in this crisis and its aftermath was a great statesman from the financial industry who would publicly embrace reform that mattered. Instead, mere months after the trillions had flowed from taxpayers and the Federal Reserve, they were back defending their prerogatives and fighting any regulations or changes to their business.
Perhaps a major reason so few in this secret confederacy speak out is that they are as flummoxed about practical solutions as the rest of us. They don't know where to begin.
Over the next year, maybe that will change. Things are going to be tough on Wall Street. Bonuses will be down. Layoffs are coming. Europe seems on the brink of another financial crisis. Maybe from that wreckage, a leader will emerge.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, Losing a Job, Then Sight, but Not Hope

BYLINE: By JED LIPINSKI

 BODY:
In early 2008, Joel Elveson was at the top of his career.
''I was the No. 1 producer at my executive recruiting agency,'' Mr. Elveson, 55, said recently. ''We lived in a three-bedroom apartment in Oceanside, Long Island, with central air-conditioning, a new dishwasher, a washer and dryer. There was even a chandelier over the dining room table.''
But when the recession hit, even job recruiters lost their jobs.
Then, late-onset diabetes took a toll on Mr. Elveson's health. His eyesight suddenly deteriorated, leaving him blind in his right eye. He began having seizures, which doctors believe may be linked to his diabetes, he said. 
During one episode, he collapsed on the sidewalk and suffered a compression fracture in his spine. His ensuing hospital stay cost him his unemployment benefits by default; when his former employer contested them, Mr. Elveson said, he was unable to attend the hearing.
In 2009, Mr. Elveson and his wife of 26 years, Ann Elveson, moved to a more affordable -- if noisy and roach-ridden -- apartment in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. But he could not find commission-based work as a recruiter, and Ms. Elveson's own seizure condition and bipolar disorder made it hard for her to hold a job.
The Elvesons receive a total of $1,348 a month in Social Security disability payments and $240 in food stamps. But they had difficulty making ends meet and fell behind on bills and rent, which was $900 a month.
The couple approached the Edith and Carl Marks Jewish Community House of Bensonhurst, a beneficiary of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In 2010, Marks JCH, as the organization is known, provided them with $123 for utilities and $250 toward their back rent.
Soon after, the couple relocated to a less expensive basement apartment in the neighborhood. Still, they found themselves going hungry toward the end of each month, and the Neediest Cases Fund pitched in an additional $780 over five months.
Mr. Elveson's health problems persist. He is almost entirely blind in the other eye and is unable to leave the house on his own.
''The steps outside just disappeared on me one day,'' he said, clutching a white cane as he sat beside his wife on the living room couch. ''I have cataracts and my corneas are in bad shape.''
Moments later, he suffered a mild seizure as his wife and their 4-year-old rescue cat, Millie, looked on worriedly.
Yet Mr. Elveson is still actively searching for work, his sense of humor intact. ''You know how Tommy Lasorda said he bleeds Dodger blue?'' Mr. Elveson said, citing the retired baseball manager. ''Well, I bleed staffing and recruiting. I was good, and I'm not ashamed to say it.''
Ms. Elveson, 53, said: ''It's true. He placed clients at top firms all over the city. They couldn't thank him enough.''
He said: ''I told them, 'You don't get places by meeting people's expectations. You get places by exceeding their expectations.' ''
This is a lesson he has passed on to his son, Lee, 25. After working for years in a low-wage job at Staples, Lee Elveson joined the Army Reserve. He is training in Missouri and may spend a year in Afghanistan beginning next fall, his parents said.
Mr. Elveson is working with an employment counselor at a vocational and training agency for the blind. Before his eyesight disappeared, he used the computer with the help of ZoomText, a software program that enlarges the type on the screen. Were he to be hired, he said, the State Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped would install special voice dictation software at his office free.
Mr. Elveson was scheduled for cataract surgery last week, but the operation was postponed because of his seizures. Meanwhile, he has kept his spirits up by listening to Motown records and Led Zeppelin. A poster of the band is on his bedroom wall above a printout of a Hebrew prayer thanking God for preserving his faculties and for giving him another day of life.
Despite his recent hardships, Mr. Elveson is eager to start recruiting again.
''I miss my career,'' he said. ''It would mean the world to me to get back to helping other people.''

HEADLINE: American Masculinity, Shown in All Its Angst

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
On Monday night, when Natalie Portman helped introduce the first-ever tie for best feature at the Gotham Independent Film Awards, she noted that the winners, ''Beginners'' and ''The Tree of Life,'' took on the big ideas: ''love, death, human connection.'' She could've added: boyhood, fatherhood and how to look good in a suit. Both ''Beginners,'' an indie, multigenerational romance from the director Mike Mills, and ''The Tree of Life,'' Terrence Malick's sweeping ode to Americana (and earth), are wide shots at the notion of American masculinity, as it is and was. 
Many of the films that have begun to rack up statuettes and nominations on the sometimes gilded, sometimes barbed path to the Oscars (the Gothams traditionally start off the campaigning in New York) deal with the existential crises of men. There are real-life figures grappling with their place in history (Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role of Clint Eastwood's ''J. Edgar''), fictional figures contending with the weight of their cultural forebears (Owen Wilson as a dissatisfied screenwriter in Woody Allen's ''Midnight in Paris'') or classic archetypes facing an uncertain future (the silent screen actor at the advent of sound in ''The Artist''). Guyish morality (and mortality) tales like ''The Descendants,'' Alexander Payne's bittersweet family drama, and ''50/50,'' a comic bromance about a young man with cancer, have been rewarded with good notices from critics and precursor trophy givers, like the Film Independent Spirit Awards.
Other Oscar watchers, like Sasha Stone at Awards Daily, have noted that there's a preponderance of struggling (but hot) single fathers in this year's crop of hopefuls: the ''sexiest men alive'' troika of George Clooney in ''The Descendants,'' who describes himself as the ''backup parent'' to two daughters; Brad Pitt in ''Moneyball,'' who tries to fit his child into his shuffling career as general manager of the Oakland A's; and Matt Damon as the economically floundering but devoted dad in ''We Bought a Zoo.'' Even the nameless hipster-lust object played by Ryan Gosling in ''Drive,'' Nicolas Winding Refn's stylish ode to Los Angeles noir, becomes a father figure to a neighbor's little boy. In ''The Artist,'' which received top honors from the New York Film Critics Circle on Tuesday, the dapper French leading man Jean Dujardin doesn't have a kid, but he does have a scene-stealing little dog. (For movie stars, even retro ones, that's responsibility enough.)
''Take Shelter,'' the writer-director Jeff Nichols's haunting story of a blue-collar family man beset by visions of doom, offers a tight-lipped patriarch who is all the more unsettling for his familiarity. ''It reminds me of a stepfather I had, Big Mike,'' said Michael Shannon, the star of that film. (At some point Mr. Shannon, now a hulking 6 foot 4, was Little Mike.) That his character hides his crippling nightmares from his wife -- played by Jessica Chastain, who, like Mr. Shannon, is earning all the right kudos for the performance -- is not just a plot device. ''I don't think that's an aberration, some sort of malignant behavior,'' Mr. Shannon said. ''I think it's pretty common, actually, for people that are in relationships to withhold certain things from one another.''
Though ''Take Shelter,'' set against rust-belt economic turmoil, has the whiff of something topical, Mr. Shannon said it was a personal project for Mr. Nichols, with whom he has collaborated before. ''Jeff wrote this movie because of the anxiety he was having about starting a family,'' he said. (Mr. Nichols is being promoted for a best original screenplay Oscar.)
Movies typically have too long a development cycle to reflect the latest shifts in American culture, but there are exceptions like ''Margin Call,'' the talky financial thriller in which roomfuls of dudes (and one ''dudette,'' as J. C. Chandor, the writer and director of ''Margin Call,'' described one of the film's stars, Demi Moore) choose how to navigate the imminent demise of their fictional investment bank. Mr. Chandor, the son of a stockbroker, based it loosely on the 2008 fall of Lehman Brothers and labored not to make Wall Street a bogeyman. Audiences leave debating the real-life economic repercussions.
''It's been sort of sad, obviously, for the world and for the country, but the film I think has been taken more seriously,'' Mr. Chandor said of his timing. He is making his feature debut with ''Margin Call,'' which earned the Robert Altman prize for directing, casting and ensemble (the actors include Zachary Quinto, Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons) from the Film Independent Spirit Awards.
Of course the idea that studios (and audiences) would shell out for a good-looking hero (or several) is nothing new; Hollywood has always been a sucker for a struggling -- or stuttering -- conqueror. But in the nearly three years that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has allowed up to 10 best picture nominees -- the same span that I've been chronicling the daily red carpets and cocktail-party chatter of Oscar season in my role as the Carpetbagger -- there have been at least a few movies in the trophy pool that centered on women: ''Black Swan,'' which won Ms. Portman an Oscar last year; ''An Education,'' which introduced Carey Mulligan to the world; ''The Blind Side,'' which demonstrated that mainstream movies could resonate equally with Oprah watchers and Academy voters; and ''Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire,'' which had the blessing of Oprah herself, a producer.
This year's answer to ''The Blind Side'' may be the ''The Help,'' Tate Taylor's adaptation of the best-selling novel about women's work and civil rights in 1960s Mississippi. With strong performances from Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Ms. Chastain, it is considered an Oscar shoo-in for an acting nomination, and maybe more.
This year the Academy revised its rules to allow anywhere from 5 to 10 best picture nominees, so it could still be a brofest -- or not. At this stage guessing is part of the fun. Beside all the celebrity-stylist and gift-bag hoopla, the Oscar race is a conversation: about which films deserve canonization via little gold men, how they might get there and whether they will shape us when they do.
For Mr. Mills, the writer-director of ''Beginners,'' a little-seen and highly personal film poised to make a bigger ripple now, the impact of the early awards attention is to, unexpectedly, amplify everything he wanted to say. He based his movie very closely on his own relationship with his father.
''I started writing it five months after my dad passed away,'' he said. ''And I'm in this crazy grief world, which makes me really brave, and I'm willing to talk about anything that I can to the world, about humanity, which sounds pretentious. But I'm like: 'Why not? What else are we here to talk about? ''

HEADLINE: A Decade of Progress on AIDS

BYLINE: By BONO. 
Bono is the lead singer of the band U2 and a founder of the advocacy group ONE and the (Product)RED campaign.

 BODY:
I'LL tell you the worst part about it, for me.
It was the look in their eyes when the nurses gave them the diagnosis -- H.I.V.-positive -- then said there was no treatment. I saw no anger in their expression. No protest. If anything, just a sort of acquiescence.
The anger came from the nurses, who knew there really was a treatment -- just not for poor people in poor countries. They saw the absurdity in the fact that an accident of geography would deny their patients the two little pills a day that could save their lives. 
This was less than a decade ago. And all of us who witnessed these dedicated African workers issuing death sentence after death sentence still feel fury and shame. AIDS set off an almost existential crisis in the West. It forced us to ask ourselves the big, uncomfortable questions, like whether capitalism, which invented the global village and kept it well stocked with stuff, could also create global solutions. Whether we were interested in charity... or justice.
The wanton loss of so many lives in Africa offended the very idea of America: the idea that everyone is created equal and that your destiny is your own to make. By the late 1990s, AIDS campaigners in the United States and around the world teamed up with scientists and doctors to insist that someone -- anyone -- put the fire out. The odds against this were as extreme as the numbers: in 2002, two million people were dying of AIDS and more than three million were newly infected with H.I.V. Around 50,000 people in the sub-Saharan region had access to treatment.
Yet today, here we are, talking seriously about the ''end'' of this global epidemic. There are now 6.6 million people on life-saving AIDS medicine. But still too many are being infected. New research proves that early antiretroviral treatment, especially for pregnant women, in combination with male circumcision, will slash the rate of new H.I.V. cases by up to 60 percent. This is the tipping point we have been campaigning for. We're nearly there.
How did we get here? America led. I mean really led.
The United States performed the greatest act of heroism since it jumped into World War II. When the history books are written, they will show that millions of people owe their lives to the Yankee tax dollar, to just a fraction of an aid budget that is itself less than 1 percent of the federal budget.
For me, a fan and a pest of America, it's a tale of strange bedfellows: the gay community, evangelicals and scruffy student activists in a weird sort of harmony; military men calling AIDS in Africa a national security issue; the likes of Nancy Pelosi, Barbara Lee and John Kerry in lock step with Bill Frist and Rick Santorum; Jesse Helms, teary-eyed, arriving by walker to pledge support from the right; the big man, Patrick Leahy, offering to punch out a cranky Congressional appropriator; Jeffrey Sachs, George Soros and Bill Gates, backing the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; Rupert Murdoch (yes, him) offering the covers of the News Corporation.
Also: a conservative president, George W. Bush, leading the largest ever response to the pandemic; the same Mr. Bush banging his desk when I complained that the drugs weren't getting there fast enough, me apologizing to Mr. Bush when they did; Bill Clinton, arm-twisting drug companies to drop their prices; Hillary Rodham Clinton, making it policy to eradicate the transmission of H.I.V. from mother to child; President Obama, who is expected to make a game changing announcement this World AIDS Day to finish what his predecessors started -- the beginning of the end of AIDS.
And then there were the everyday, every-stripe Americans. Like a tattooed trucker I met off I-80 in Iowa who, when he heard how many African truck drivers were infected with H.I.V., told me he'd go and drive the pills there himself.
Thanks to them, America led. Really led.
This was smart power. Genius, really. In 2007, 8 out of the 10 countries in the world that viewed the United States most fondly were African. And it can't be a bad thing for America to have friends on a continent that is close to half Muslim and that, by 2025, will surpass China in population.
Activists are a funny lot. When the world suddenly starts marching in step with us, we just point out with (self-)righteous indignation all that remains to be done. But on this World AIDS Day I would like you to stop and consider what America has achieved in this war to defend lives lived far away and sacred principles held closer to home.
The moonshot, I know, is a tired metaphor; I've exhausted it myself. But America's boldest leap of faith is worth recalling. And the thing is, as I see it, the Eagle hasn't landed yet. Budget cuts ... partisan divisions ... these put the outcome in jeopardy just as the science falls into place. To get this far and not plant your flag would be one of the greatest accidental evils of this recession.

HEADLINE: Why It's Getting Harder, and Riskier, to Bet the House

BYLINE: By IAN MOUNT

 BODY:
In March 2008, about nine months after he bought a steel-processing business, Precision Steel Services in Warren, Mich., for some $750,000, Shailesh Kumar went to two banks in search of a $350,000 loan.
He wanted to expand the business and pay off a $290,000 debt he had with the seller, replacing an 8 percent, seven-year debt with a 6.5 percent, 20-year loan. ''It would have made a huge difference in terms of cash flow and growth capital,'' Mr. Kumar said.
But both lenders he was negotiating with demanded that Mr. Kumar put up equity in his own home as collateral. Mr. Kumar hesitated, and then as 2008 wore on, he watched the value of his home fall to $330,000 from $425,000, wiping out all of his equity. Eventually, the banks broke off negotiations. With no cash on hand and revenue down by some 60 percent during the first half of 2009, Mr. Kumar closed Precision Steel in July 2009. Today, he runs an investment advice Web site, Value Stock Guide. 
The collapse of the housing market has highlighted how entrepreneurs are routinely compelled to bet the house on their businesses. For many, taking the risk is tempting because their home may be their largest asset and loans against home equity are easier to find than business loans. Also, such loans come at lower interest rates than most alternatives. They can also allow a business owner to avoid giving equity to investors.
Using data from Barlow Research Associates, a Minneapolis company that conducts quarterly financial surveys, Scott Shane, a professor at Case Western Reserve University, estimated that from 2001 to 2006, the percentage of small business owners who tapped their home equity for business, either by pledging their homes as collateral or by borrowing against home equity, rose to 27.5 percent from 18.4 percent.
Sometimes, owners have no choice. The Small Business Administration's 7(a) loan program, for example, ''requires that if there is collateral available to make a fully secured loan, the bank lender has an obligation to get it as collateral,'' said Steven J. Smits, associate administrator for the office of capital access at the S.B.A. Many lenders require owners to show that they are serious by putting up cash -- often from home equity loans. ''The standard in the industry is lenders want skin in the game,'' Mr. Smits said, ''and 20 percent is a safe rule of thumb.''
These days, however, the drop in home prices means that fewer owners have the home equity option. And while there is no way to determine the precise numbers, that drop has undoubtedly restricted the ability of owners to obtain financing to start, expand or maintain a business.
''The biggest problem is that revenues of the great majority of small businesses have gone down from between 10 percent and 70 percent,'' said George Cloutier, founder of American Management Services, an Orlando, Fla., consulting firm that specializes in financial turnarounds for small and midsize companies. ''In normal times, there would be a movement to use home equity to shore up losses and sagging sales. The problem that has occurred is that no one's doing home equity loans, especially on marginal cases where the owner's business is in trouble.''
Some worry about the impact this inability to raise capital and start businesses and hire employees might have on the economy; others wonder whether it ever makes sense to demand this level of commitment from entrepreneurs.
''Most start-ups in the U.S. economy are not suitable for venture capital finance,'' said David T. Robinson, a professor of finance at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke. ''So it's probably the best system we've got. But it's certainly an inefficient system, because if I have a great idea but no home, and you have a lot of home equity but no ideas,'' the two sides are out of luck.
For many entrepreneurs, risking the house demonstrates a passion to succeed. Zalmi Duchman, 31, took a $100,000 home equity loan on his Surfside, Fla., condo and in 2006 used $5,000 of it to start the Fresh Diet, a gourmet meal-delivery service. (He used the rest for living expenses while building the business.)
About 18 months later he took out an additional $200,000 to match with a $900,000 S.B.A. loan that he used to buy a competitor with operations in Miami and New York. ''I don't think I would have gotten the S.B.A. loan without my condo,'' said Mr. Duchman, who expects the Fresh Diet to bring in $30 million in revenue this year. ''I wouldn't have grown the way I did.''
Others see taking money out of the house as excessively risky. Philip Patrick, founder of PharmaStrat, a pharmaceutical consulting firm in Flemington, N.J., started his company in 2002 with $5,000 and says he has had a profit since its first quarter.
This year, he sold his business, which had annual revenue of $5 million, without ever having borrowed against his house. ''I think some entrepreneurs, when looking for money, pitch that as a positive: 'Look how much faith I have! I'm betting down to the last nickel!' '' he said. ''But I think that's a negative. I don't want to invest in someone who's down to the last nickel.''
Betting the house can be especially uncomfortable for the spouses and families of entrepreneurs. After Rick Sanchez lost his job at a film postproduction house in 2006, he and his wife, Tara Zucker, decided to take $55,000 from a home equity line of credit to buy equipment and start their own postproduction business.
Post Haste Media of North Hollywood, Calif., did well at first, and they were able to pay off half the loan. Then, in 2008, the economy declined and they had to take out more money. ''For me, it was an exciting prospect, though it was scary,'' said Mr. Sanchez, 58. ''For my wife, it was a lot more difficult. She's a lot more conservative with money and worries a lot more about it than I do. It took a lot of working on those issues between the two of us.'' When they paid off the loan in 2010, Mr. Sanchez said, ''it was a great relief.''
Not every loan has a happy ending. In 2001, Linda Frakes, of Cumming, Ga., decided to buy a franchise in the Curves health club chain. By 2004, she owned eight. But Curves began to fall out of favor, and in 2005, Ms. Frakes refinanced her home twice to take out $155,000 in home equity and invest it in keeping the franchises running while she tried to sell them. ''I was having trouble making payroll,'' she said.
Ms. Frakes wound up selling her franchises for far less than the $150,000 to 200,000 she had expected to get for each of them. She eventually closed two locations and sold the remaining six in three sales for a total of $500,000. At the end, she was left with $80,000 in cash.
Laden with about $250,000 in business-related credit card debt on which she was paying $4,000 a month, a $3,500 mortgage payment, and little income, Ms. Frakes held on for about six months before she stopped making mortgage payments in spring 2008. She declared bankruptcy and then lost her home in late 2009. ''I explained to my son the 15-year-old's version of bankruptcy, and his only question was, 'Are we going to have enough money for food?' ''
Now 56, Ms. Frakes wrote a book about her experience and today owns Health Fairs Onsite, a company that puts on health fairs at corporate locations nationwide. It is 100 percent bootstrapped. ''I don't have any credit, you know?'' she said.

HEADLINE: To Understand China, Look Behind Its Laws

BYLINE: By NORM PAGE. 
Norm Page is a partner and the chairman of the China practice at the law firm of Davis Wright Tremaine.

 BODY:
Shanghai
WHENEVER a Western official criticizes China for its record on human rights, the reply comes back that China is a sovereign country and doesn't respond to such finger-pointing. And that is bound to continue for a long time. There are real differences between different countries' interests and values that cannot be wished away.
But there are also many areas where China and the United States face similar social problems and share fundamental interests. In grappling with those similar problems, each country's laws are developing along paths that, although different in some ways, are strikingly similar in others. It is in those areas that the West can certainly begin a dialogue with China that includes political reform and human rights, and builds a common language for such discussions that does not seek to assign blame to either side.
Without a firm understanding of each society's culture and history, discussions of fundamental rights tend to slide toward harsh and automatic conclusions on each side. But when we talk honestly about fundamental concepts like property, punishment of crime and ethnic diversity -- in light of their cultural and historical context -- the differences can at least be seen to have their own internal logic. 
Respecting that logic, we can then begin to talk about how rights under the law might be applied differently.
We also need to remember that good laws in any society don't just lay down rules. They strike a balance among competing interests -- among individuals, and between individuals and their society. So of course there will be differences from one society to another.
I've become acutely aware of this while living in Shanghai for the past four years, practicing law in an American firm and teaching at two Chinese law schools, where an introduction to American law is a required course. My Chinese students include Shanghai natives, but most are from small towns and villages throughout eastern China. There are also Americans in their 20s, living here until more job opportunities open up back home. Each group's members want to know what their counterparts from the other country are thinking, and so the questions of what concepts they share and where they differ come up often.
In the spring semester, I asked my students to choose from a list of several United States Supreme Court cases covering different fundamental rights -- including free speech, free exercise of religion, abortion rights and the right to counsel in criminal cases -- and offer comment. The ones below were the most popular. Judge for yourself whether finger-pointing and lecturing the Chinese would have been the right response to Chinese attitudes.
Kelo v. City of New London (2005)
This is a classic case of balancing private property rights and the public good. The city of New London, Conn., having lost traditional industries, needed economic development to reverse urban decay. But could private companies get rich in the process?
The Supreme Court found that economic development under the city's plan would not violate the Fifth Amendment (which prohibits the taking of private property for public use ''without just compensation'') solely because there was some private gain. My Chinese students, however, would have added another consideration: such private gain and fair compensation would have to be shown to be free from corruption.
Why was that so important? Why could fairness not be taken for granted? It's because hundreds of millions of Chinese are moving from the countryside to the city, and local governments often take rural property to create vast expanses of new urban housing. But many relocated homeowners feel abused, and private developers often get rich in the process.
In both American and Chinese law, ''just compensation'' is required when the government takes property for a public purpose. But under American law, this is fairly straightforward, because the fair-market value of land is relatively easy to determine. In China, by contrast, there was until recently no market at all, and government officials exercise wide discretion and can have inordinate power -- one reason that anger at corrupt government officials has become an organizing principle for common people, and now is a consideration in the way law students think about basic fairness.
Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007)
Can a city school board use race or ethnic identity as a factor in school admittance? I tell my students that if they want to understand modern American society, they should study both the evolving idea of equal protection and the history behind it: slavery, the Civil War, Jim Crow, the 14th Amendment and Brown v. Board of Education. But the concept continues to evolve, as is shown by this case; in it, the Supreme Court, while recognizing that school districts have a compelling interest in diversity, ruled against school district plans that used race as a factor in assigning students to public schools.
China, too, has questions about how to treat its citizens equally, but those issues have different roots. In China, the Han make up about 92 percent of the total population; other large ethnic groups include Zhuang, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, Uighur, Miao and Tibetan, and there are dozens more. The government has been trying to increase the university enrollment of ethnic minority groups, and several of my students have told me that extra points are added to minority students' test scores on the all-important college-entrance exam -- a policy that many Han Chinese resent.
Conflict among these ethnic groups goes back centuries; it was the Manchus who led China's last dynasty, from 1644 until the revolution that ended imperial rule in 1911. Just as young Chinese cannot fully understand equal protection in the United States without studying the history of slavery and Jim Crow, so my young American students have learned that they need to study the historic interaction of these ethnic groups before advising -- or criticizing -- the Chinese on their ethnic policies.
Stanford v. Kentucky (1989 ) and Roper v. Simmons (2005)
Can the death penalty be imposed on a defendant who committed murder as a juvenile? In a 1989 case in Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that executing a juvenile offender did not violate ''common standards of decency,'' or the cruel and unusual punishments clause of the Eighth Amendment. But it reversed this decision in 2005, finding that the standards had evolved to a point at which such executions were unconstitutional. My students were especially interested in the idea that ''evolving standards of decency'' applied to the death penalty -- a punishment that has come under increasing scrutiny around the world since World War II.
China retains the death penalty but is reconsidering the offenses to which it can apply, and there is considerable debate in the Chinese blogosphere about that. In fact, during the years between Stanford and Roper, China rejected the death penalty for juvenile offenders -- a fact that the Roper court noted.
The Chinese Constitution does not expressly forbid cruel and unusual punishment, as the American Constitution does. But the degree of moral culpability required for the death penalty is very much part of the debate here, and my students were surprised (and pleased) to learn that China had been ahead of the United States in abolishing any aspect of capital punishment.
On the other hand, another aspect of this debate -- applying the death penalty for economic crimes like bribery and embezzlement -- often evokes shock among Americans, while many Chinese consider it just another example of how seriously they take the danger of official corruption.
The underlying lesson? By different historical pathways, China and the United States find themselves struggling with many of the same issues.
And those issues deserve a discussion, not a lecture by one side to the other. My students are very respectful of America's constitutional system, but also deeply proud of their own country and its rise in the world. They are prepared to find deep meaning -- and understanding of us -- in studying why their laws often read differently from ours. We should be ready to do the same with them before we criticize.

HEADLINE: Changing How We Pay for Health Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Support Builds for a Plan to Rein In Medicare Costs'' (news article, Nov. 25):
Two things are terribly wrong with the proposal to ''reform'' Medicare by requiring older Americans to buy their own health insurance with the help of a federal subsidy:
First, all Americans since 1965 have paid a percentage of their wages to the government to finance the Medicare services being afforded to their fellow citizens age 65 or over, as have their employers -- so who will pay us back for those years and years of deductions from our paychecks? 
And, second, if the Republicans intend to offer a range of insurance plans from minimal coverage/low premium to full coverage/high premium, senior citizens in good health will choose the low premium plans, while those already in poor health will have to choose the high premium plans -- just as we do now in the Medicare prescription program. That vitiates the basis for meaningful ''insurance,'' pooling both the healthy and the unhealthy in the actuarial mix.
Leaving aside, of course, the question why Americans' health coverage should be outsourced to the for-profit insurance industry in the first place.
PETER FLEMMING Great Barrington, Mass., Nov. 25, 2011
To the Editor:
Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel's column ''Saving by the Bundle'' (Sunday Review, Nov. 20) provides insightful and useful suggestions for bending the health care cost curve but may have pushed the numbers too far. He calculates his $80 billion-a-year savings using Prof. Arnold Milstein's seminal work in which he finds medical home runs -- practices that save money without compromising quality. Unfortunately, the study is based on four practices -- hardly enough to base any sort of national estimate on.
But the lessons learned are noteworthy. Home runs in primary care practice happen when the least costly health worker does a task -- nurse practitioners bat for doctors, registered nurses for nurse practitioners and so on.
Bundled payments will eliminate useless services while encouraging team practice of primary care integrated with hospital care. This combination has the potential to achieve significant savings and help to move us toward an affordable health care system.
RICHARD M. SCHEFFLER Berkeley, Calif., Nov. 22, 2011
The writer is a professor of health economics and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of ''Is There a Doctor in the House? Market Signals and Tomorrow's Supply of Doctors.''
To the Editor:
''Fixing Medicare'' (editorial, Nov. 21) rightly noted the promising policy work being done to wean us away from our expensive fee-for-service health care system. While Medicare is certainly not responsible for the deficit (see tax cuts, recession, wars), action is clearly needed to ensure the solvency of the program in the long run.
Unfortunately, the editorial was conspicuous for what wasn't mentioned: any discussion of new revenues. It's not as if there aren't options, including a small increase in the hospital insurance payroll tax or various ''sin'' taxes.
To leave these out of the political conversation makes it more likely that we will end up with policies that, as you rightly note, would simply shift more costs to vulnerable beneficiaries while also increasing the burden of health care costs on the broader economy.

HEADLINE: A Little Paint Brightens It Up

BYLINE: By SARAH AMELAR

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO
WHEN Raveevarn Choksombatchai, a Thai-born architect and artist, painted her bedroom lime-green and her kitchen tangerine, she didn't worry about how long she would enjoy living with those vibrant colors. ''I'm very intuitive when it comes to color,'' she said. ''But there's also something liberating about living and working in spaces that are not precious, in a place I've planned to demolish.'' 
Ms. Choksombatchai, 50, who prefers to go by the single name Raveevarn, bought the tiny ramshackle 1907 building in the SoMa area of San Francisco as a teardown in 1999, with Ralph Nelson, who was then her husband, paying $345,000. Damaged foundations made a renovation impractical; the couple, founders of the design firm Loom, envisioned replacing it with an architecturally adventurous building to house their home and studio, as well as two residential lofts they hoped to sell and a storefront they planned to rent out.
Their design scheme, inspired by the idea of a partly open suitcase squeezed into the narrow lot, won a Progressive Architecture Award in 2002. But realizing it was another matter.
By the time the building permits were approved, the couple had split up and the recession made financing impossible. So more than a decade later, Raveevarn, who bought her husband's share of the building, still lives and works in the original 2,000-square-foot space, where the ''temporary'' has grown into the long term.
It turns out, though, that living this way suits her creatively. Raveevarn, who teaches architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, and has formed her own design studio, VeeV, explores the boundaries separating art, architecture, landscape and furniture in her work. Similarly, the house is in a continual state of flux, with little separation between living and working.
To reach the studio, you pass through the living-and-dining area, where mock-ups and studies coexist with personal artifacts: vintage seating by Eames, Bertoia, Saarinen and Florence Knoll and quirky midcentury ceramics by Roseville and Russel Wright. Sheer, twisting scrims (prototypes for a 2005 installation at Headlands Center for the Arts, in Sausalito, Calif.) stretch overhead.
The previous owner, the painter Vladimir Nemkoff, who died in 1998, had opened the interior vertically to create a double-height painting area that is now VeeV's studio. Raveevarn retained this and other spatial interventions he made, but ''reinterpreted'' the place, repainting yellowish walls and brown moldings that she said made it ''feel darker and smaller.'' To create a legible sequence of spatial volumes, she gave the walls and ceiling in each room a single color: vermillion for the vestibule, lime-green for the bedroom and deep orange for the kitchen.
The main living area is white, animated by Mr. Nemkoff's checkered linoleum tiles and by reflections of the colors in the bedroom and kitchen, coaxed across the floor by skylights. ''You get glimpses of the other spaces,'' she said, ''and you begin to read the entire sequence.''
Over the years, the scheme has evolved. Raveevarn still hopes to proceed with construction one day, but for now, her experiments roll on.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: 1. The house's previous owner, a painter, opened up the interior to create a double-height studio that is now a combination living area and design workshop for the current owner, Raveevarn Choksombatchai, an architect and artist.
2. The bedroom walls and ceiling are painted a vibrant green (Behr Limeade S-G-420) that is amplified by a skylight in the corner. The wire-frame chair is an original Bertoia Bird Lounge Chair.
3. The basic appliances and fittings in the kitchen are enriched by the orange paint on the walls and ceiling (Behr Mango Madness S-G-280).
4. The vintage Florence Knoll couch ($3,000) and the Bertoia Bird and Diamond chairs are from a now-defunct San Francisco store. The coffee table is made out of fragments of design projects: the top is a remnant of an outdoor installation called ''EEL:
Eliciting Ethereal Light'' and the base is a model for a museum in Thailand.
5. In the dining area, midcentury modern ceramics by Russel Wright and Roseville fill a pair of vintage glass-fronted Globe-Wernicke bookcases bought at a used-furniture store in Connecticut. The double-bowled ceramic piece on the table is an original Roseville Raymor vegetable server.
6. In the bathroom off the kitchen, Raveevarn added a skylight, but kept the old-fashioned linoleum tiles that the previous owner had installed.
7. The ramshackle 1907 building sits on a gritty semi-industrial stretch in the SoMa area of San Francisco. Raveevarn left the exterior virtually unchanged, except for the brightly painted front door (Benjamin Moore Orange 2011-10), the only hint of the wild color palette inside.
8. Old-fashioned checkered linoleum tiles run across the floor and up the low walls. Stretching overhead, behind Raveevarn, is a prototype of ''Story of an Eye,'' a 2005 event installation she did at the Headlands Center for the Arts, in Sausalito, Calif.

HEADLINE: Camps Are Cleared, but '99 Percent' Still Occupies the Lexicon

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
Most of the biggest Occupy Wall Street camps are gone. But their slogan still stands.
Whatever the long-term effects of the Occupy movement, protesters have succeeded in implanting ''We are the 99 percent,'' referring to the vast majority of Americans (and its implied opposite, ''You are the one percent'' referring to the tiny proportion of Americans with a vastly disproportionate share of wealth), into the cultural and political lexicon.
First chanted and blogged about in mid-September in New York, the slogan become a national shorthand for the income disparity. Easily grasped in its simplicity and Twitter-friendly in its brevity, the slogan has practically dared listeners to pick a side.
''We are getting nothing,'' read the Tumblr blog ''We Are the 99 Percent'' that helped popularize the percentages, ''while the other one percent is getting everything.'' 
Within weeks of the first encampment in Zuccotti Park in New York, politicians seized on the phrase. Democrats in Congress began to invoke the ''99 percent'' to press for passage of President Obama's jobs act -- but also to pursue action on mine safety, Internet access rules and voter identification laws, among others. Republicans pushed back, accusing protesters and their supporters of class warfare; Newt Gingrich this week called the ''concept of the 99 and the one'' both divisive and ''un-American.''
Perhaps most important for the movement, there was a sevenfold increase in Google searches for the term ''99 percent'' between September and October and a spike in news stories about income inequality throughout the fall, heaping attention on the issues raised by activists.
''The '99 percent,' and the 'one percent,' too, are part of our vocabulary now,'' said Judith Stein, a professor of history at the City University of New York.
Soon there were income calculators (''What Percent Are You?'' asked The Wall Street Journal), music playlists (an album of Woody Guthrie covers, promoted as a ''soundtrack for the 99 percent'') and cheap lawn signs. And, inevitably, there were ads: a storefront near Union Square peddles ''Gifts for the 99 percent.'' A trailer for a Showtime television series about management consultants, ''House of Lies,'' describes the lead characters as ''the one percent sticking it to the one percent.'' A Craigslist ad for a three-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn has the come-on ''Live Like the One Percent!'' (in this case, in Boerum Hill).
These days, the language of the Occupy movement is being reappropriated in new ways seemingly every day. CBS ran a radio spot last that invited viewers to ''occupy your couch.'' On Thanksgiving, people joked online about occupying the dinner table. Now, on Facebook, holiday revelers are inviting friends to ''one percent parties.''
Slogans have emerged from American protest movements, successful and otherwise, throughout history. The American Revolution furnished the world with ''Give me liberty or give me death'' and the still-popular ''No taxation without representation.'' The equal rights movement in the 1960s used the phrase ''59 cents'' to point out the income disparities between women and men. The civil rights movement embraced the song ''We Shall Overcome'' as a slogan. During the Vietnam War, protesters called on politicians to ''Bring 'em Home'' and ''Stop the Draft.'' More recently, supporters of Mr. Obama shouted ''Yes, we can.''
The idea behind the 99 percent catchphrase has its roots in a decade's worth of reporting about the income gap between the richest Americans and the rest, and more directly in May in a Vanity Fair column by the liberal economist Joseph E. Stiglitz titled ''Of the 1%, by the 1%, for the 1%.'' The slogan that resulted in September identified both a target, the ''one percent,'' and a theoretical constituency, everyone else.
Rhetorically, ''it was really clever,'' said David S. Meyer, a University of California, Irvine, professor who studies social movements. ''Deciding whom to blame is a key task of all politics,'' he wrote in his blog about the phrase.
''It's something that kind of puts your opponents on the defensive,'' he said in an interview.
In some cases even politicians who have been put on the defensive by the movement have resorted to the same rhetoric. When Philadelphia's mayor, Michael A. Nutter, announced last week that the protesters there had to make way for a construction project, he emphasized that the project would be ''built by the 99 percent, for the 99 percent.''
Xeni Jardin, the editor of the influential blog Boing Boing, which has featured the protests every day since they began, praised the slogan for capturing ''a mounting sense of unfairness in America'' and distilling it ''into something very brief.''
But she also called it ''fundamentally unfair'' because within the so-called 99 percent that have slept at occupations across the country, there are many well-to-do college students but just as many, if not more, homeless individuals. ''There are many shades of gray,'' she said.
But attempts to mock or subvert the slogan seem not to have stuck; as Ms. Jardin put it, ''How do you make fun of numbers?'' A Tumblr blog that was set up to compete with ''We Are the 99 Percent,'' called ''We Are the 53%,'' (referring to the estimated percentage of Americans who pay federal income taxes) has not been updated for two weeks.
Ms. Stein at CUNY believes that the 99 percent rallying cry will have limited effect in the future. ''I don't think a good slogan is enough to revivify a movement or our politics,'' she said.
But Mr. Meyer said the catchphrase is a useful one in that it gives continuity and coherence to a movement that is losing some of its camps in major cities across the country. ''Occupy takes its name from the occupation,'' he said. ''If Occupy continues without occupations, what provides continuity with those people in Zuccotti Park? The slogan.''
The slogan was chanted again early on Wednesday morning in Los Angeles and Philadelphia as police there cleared out the Occupy campsites in each city. As they lost physical ground for their local movements, protesters told each other online, ''You can't evict an idea.''

HEADLINE: Beige Book Survey Finds Slow to Moderate Gains

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve said that the economy expanded at a ''moderate'' pace in 11 of 12 districts, led by gains in manufacturing and consumer spending.
''Overall economic activity increased at a slow to moderate pace since the previous report across all Federal Reserve districts except St. Louis, which reported a decline in economic activity,'' the Fed said in its beige book survey released Wednesday. The survey covers October and the first half of November.
The report reinforces the central bank's view that the economy, while strong enough to skirt a recession, remains too weak to bring down an unemployment rate stuck near 9 percent for more than two years. At their last meeting, on Nov. 1-2, some Fed policy makers said the central bank should consider easing policy further, according to minutes of the meeting. 
The beige book said ''wages and salaries remained stable across districts'' and that ''some firms with open positions reported difficulty finding qualified applicants.''
The anecdotal survey, released two weeks before each policy meeting, is based on information gathered by officials at the Fed's 12 regional banks.
The Fed, along with five central banks in Europe, on Wednesday said it would make it cheaper for banks to borrow dollars in emergencies in a global effort to ease Europe's sovereign debt crisis.
The Fed said in its Nov. 2 statement that ''there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets.'' Policy makers have identified the European sovereign debt crisis as one of the risks to the American economy.
Fed banks in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis and Minneapolis reported increasing auto sales, and Cleveland and Chicago said car production increased.
All districts except St. Louis reported that manufacturers had increased orders, shipments and production. St. Louis reported more plant closures than openings or expansions.
''Consumer spending increased modestly, on balance, during the reporting period,'' the report said. Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco said holiday sales were ''expected to be flat or to increase modestly over a year ago.''
Bank lending ''increased slightly since the previous report,'' the Fed said. Philadelphia, Dallas and San Francisco had improving credit quality, while Cleveland, Chicago and St. Louis said it was ''relatively unchanged.''
A separate report showed that companies increased payrolls in November and businesses expanded at the fastest pace in seven months, giving the economy a lift as 2011 draws to a close.
Private employment, which excludes government jobs, climbed 206,000 this month, according to data released Wednesday by ADP Employer Services.
The ADP report may bode well for Friday's job report. A survey by Bloomberg of 82 economists projects that the economy added 125,000 nonfarm jobs in November.
Another index, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago's business barometer, increased to 62.6 in November from 58.4 in the previous month as orders and production strengthened.
A pickup in consumer spending and more business investment at a time when companies are holding fewer inventories may help set the stage for stronger production.
Readings above 50 in the Chicago purchasers' barometer signal growth, and November's figure exceeded the highest estimate in the Bloomberg survey. Economists forecast the gauge would rise to 58.5, according to the median of 56 estimates. Projections ranged from 56 to 60.7.
''Things are shifting in the right direction for a faster pace of growth next year,'' said Carl Riccadonna, a senior United States economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. ''New orders are rising, production is increasing and employment will likely improve.'' In addition, ''central banks are taking the right steps,'' he said.
Stronger job growth in the United States will make it easier to sustain the recent gain in consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy.
''Things are getting better for the economy,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Fact & Opinion Economics in New York. ''It means the news we have on Christmas shopping and on an increase in consumer confidence may have some validity.''

HEADLINE: Buffett in Deal to Buy Omaha Newspaper Company

BYLINE: By TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett's Omaha-based business conglomerate, announced on Wednesday that it would purchase The Omaha World-Herald Company, publisher of Nebraska's principal daily newspaper, The Omaha World-Herald, and six other daily papers, and owner of World Marketing, a direct-mail company.
Mr. Buffett, Berkshire's chairman and chief executive, and Terry Kroeger, the chief executive of the newspaper company, announced the deal at a meeting for shareholders where Mr. Buffett made a surprise appearance. 
According to a report in The World-Herald, Mr. Buffett is buying the company for $200 million, with Berkshire paying ''about $150 million cash'' while the newspaper's $50 million debt will remain with the company.
The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year, pending approval of the 275 Omaha World-Herald shareholders, including current and retired employees. According to The World-Herald, the vote is scheduled for Dec. 20.
Mr. Buffett, who in the past has expressed reservations about the newspaper industry, said in a statement that The World-Herald ''delivers solid profits and is one of the best-run newspapers in America.'' He pledged that the paper would continue to have editorial independence despite being owned by a prominent hometown business.
The World-Herald reported that the paper's management team would remain untouched. Mr. Buffett served for a time on the board of The World-Herald beginning in 1982.
In a statement, Mr. Kroeger said that Mr. Buffett's offer to purchase the company ''presented a unique opportunity to address our long-term capital needs and continue local ownership of The Omaha World-Herald, which is consistent with the legacy left to us by Mr. Kiewit.'' Peter Kiewit, the owner of a construction and mining company based in Omaha, purchased the paper in 1962.
After Mr. Kiewit's death in 1979, employees took ownership of 80 percent of the paper, with the remaining 20 percent being held by the Peter Kiewit Foundation. The paper was founded in 1885 by Gilbert Hitchcock.
According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, The World-Herald has an average weekday circulation of 135,282.
William Grueskin, dean of academic affairs at the Columbia Journalism School, said in an e-mail that the deal made economic sense for the paper, citing its high penetration rate in its community and the fact that the company's smaller papers had little competition.
''My sense is that he's deeply devoted to Omaha as a community - it's his hometown - and still devoted to the newspaper business,'' Mr. Grueskin said of Mr. Buffett. Whether those hometown ties might present conflicts of interest for the paper and Mr. Buffett, Mr. Grueskin said, ''It's hard to see how this is any more a conflict than, say, McClatchy owning The Sacramento Bee.''
Stanford Lipsey, the publisher of The Buffalo News, which has been owned by Berkshire Hathaway since 1977, said Mr. Buffett had never tried to influence the editorial content of the paper. ''They run the paper as if somebody else owns it,'' Mr. Lipsey said. ''Warren's not a factor at all. He doesn't get involved.''
The purchase also makes business sense for Mr. Buffett, said Donna Dudney, an associate professor of finance at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln.
Mr. Buffett ''looks for companies with a durable competitive advantage,'' Ms. Dudney said in an e-mail. ''The World-Herald is in the top 10 newspapers in the country in terms of the percentage of subscribing households in its market, and its digital news site dominates the Omaha market.''
In addition to owning The Buffalo News, Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder in The Washington Post, with about 21 percent of the publicly traded shares. In January, Mr. Buffett left the board of The Washington Post Company.

HEADLINE: Applications to Penn State Remain Steady

BYLINE: By REBECCA R. RUIZ

 BODY:
The abuse scandal at Pennsylvania State University does not appear to have slowed applications to the school's undergraduate programs.
As of Friday, applications to enroll next year at one of the 20 campuses that comprise the Penn State system were up 4 percent when compared with the same period last year, with applications to the system's University Park flagship in State College, Pa., up 2 percent, Anne Rohrbach, executive director for undergraduate admissions, said in an interview Wednesday.
All told, nearly 28,000 students have applied to be undergraduates next year on the University Park campus, compared to 27,370 who had done so last year at this time, Ms. Rohrbach said. Each is vying for one of about 7,200 seats in the freshman class. Though Penn State accepts applications year-round, on a rolling basis, the deadline for so-called ''priority'' applications -- after which some programs will be considered closed out -- was Wednesday. 
That same increase in applications, Ms. Rohrbach said, has continued since the first week in November, when Jerry Sandusky, a former defensive coordinator for the university's football program, was arrested on charges of sexually abusing eight boys, setting off a cascade of events that included the firing of its iconic head football coach, Joe Paterno, and the university president. Since then, University Park has received 12,344 applications, she said, compared to 12,311 during the comparable period last year.
''It's tested us in many ways,'' she said. ''But we've held our applicant pool.''
Which is not to say that the Penn State admissions office, which has its headquarters just a few blocks from Beaver Stadium, has not had to field questions from concerned applicants and their parents.
During that first week after Mr. Sandusky's arrest, Ms. Rohrbach's office received some 50 phone calls related to the events; eight students have since informed Penn State -- most through their parents -- that they wished to withdraw their applications. But, she said, inquires have since calmed, and those students and their families who do raise the issue of the crisis the school has faced have made a point of acknowledging that it was the making of neither the student body nor the admissions staff.
''We kept thinking, 'What are we going to say?''' Ms. Rohrbach said, in reference to the initial wave of campus visits by prospective applicants in the days after Mr. Sandusky's arrest. ''But the people who came were almost empathetic. They didn't want to talk about the story.''
The steady stream of applications in the face of scandal may have something to do with the economics of attending Penn State; for the 2011-2012 academic year, its tuition is listed at $15,124 for in-state residents and $27,206 for out-of-state students, each representing a reduction from the average $28,500 that private four-year colleges charge, according to the College Board.
Ms. Rohrbach also emphasized the constancy of the school's academic standing. ''Our faculty are all the same,'' she said. ''We just feel that the reasons to choose Penn State haven't changed.''
And yet, the full impact on the university's applicant pool will not be known until May 1, the deadline for those accepted by Penn State to inform the institution whether they will attend.
''We've gone through a whole mix of emotions,'' said Ms. Rohrbach, who has worked in Penn State admissions for 23 years. ''But we really will be better and stronger and move ahead. We have to.''
If there are readers of The Choice who are applying to Penn State -- or those who, perhaps, chose not to -- we would like to hear from you. Please use the comment box below to let us know.

HEADLINE: High Stakes, Little Time

 BODY:
At the end of this month, a federal payroll tax cut for all working Americans will expire, as will federal unemployment benefits. If Congress fails to renew both, the effect on the economy would be grim, or worse.
There is broad consensus among economists that letting these two provisions lapse -- taking much-needed spending money out of an already fragile economy -- would sharply reduce growth in 2012 below its already tepid annual rate of 2 percent. Conservatively estimated, that could mean the loss of some 725,000 jobs and a rise in the unemployment rate of almost half-a-percentage point, for a projected rate well above 9 percent next year.
While Congressional Democrats, and President Obama, are eager to move ahead with both, many Republicans have resisted the payroll tax cut extension and are lukewarm about renewing jobless benefits. 
Republicans now say they want to help. But, as ever, they are more concerned about making sure the rich don't have to pay their fair share of taxes. And denying Mr. Obama any ''win'' -- and any claim to helping the economy -- is always at the top of their campaign season to-do list.
To help jump-start the economy, Senate Democrats proposed increasing the size of the tax break for employees and also giving employers a break on their share of the tax. And they proposed to pay for it with a 3.25 percent surtax, starting in 2013, on incomes over $1 million.
There was a brief moment this week when it looked as though Republicans might be ready to put the interests of struggling Americans ahead of the wealthy. Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Pat Roberts of Kansas and Mike Johanns of Nebraska suggested that maybe, just maybe, they would support a plan in which the rich were asked to pay more to help out everyone else. On Wednesday, the full caucus was back to business as usual.
The Republican leadership proposed to offset the cost of the payroll extension mainly by extending a pay freeze on federal workers for an extra year, reducing the federal work force and increasing Medicare premiums for high-income recipients.
Including the federal work force hits at middle-class jobs, reducing pay and, with it, consumer spending and economic security -- at a time when more pay, more spending and more security are needed. As for Medicare premiums, that is a complicated effort best handled in the context of a deficit-reduction plan that balances spending reductions with tax increases.
The glimmer of hope here is that by making a counteroffer, however unworkable, Republicans are acknowledging the need to extend the payroll tax cut. Whether that means they are willing to negotiate in good faith -- and consider compromising -- is by no means clear.
Congress also has to get moving on unemployment benefits. Even a one-month delay in extending those benefits -- $295 a week, on average -- would be devastating, cutting off an estimated 1.8 million unemployed workers in January alone. The right thing to do -- for struggling Americans and for the broader economy -- is to extend both the payroll tax cut and federal jobless benefits.
Asking the rich to help pay the cost is only fair, given that their lavish Bush-era tax cuts last until the end of 2012. It also makes good economic sense. The rich tend to save their tax cuts, while middle- and low-income workers tend to spend them. That helps those workers, and it helps the economy, which needs all the help it can get.

HEADLINE: Outsourcing Giant Finds It Must Be Client, Too

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Sruthi Gottipati contributed reporting from Manesar, India, and Neha Thirani from Mumbai, India.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- Every three months, India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, meets with a special panel assigned the ambitious task of figuring out how to produce 500 million skilled workers over the next two decades.
The panel is a cross section of India's power elite, including many of the usual figures like the education minister, the finance minister and the former chief executive of the country's biggest software outsourcing company. Then there is a more curious choice: Manish Sabharwal.
Mr. Sabharwal runs TeamLease, a Bangalore-based agency that has created thousands of jobs by fielding temporary workers for companies in India that want to expand their work force while skirting India's stringent labor laws, which businesses say discourage the hiring of permanent employees. Many labor leaders and left-leaning politicians accuse him of running the nation's largest illegal business.
He does not completely disagree. 
''We should not exist,'' Mr. Sabharwal, a 40-year-old graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said about his company, which has 60,000 employees. ''The genius of India is to allow us to exist.''
What Mr. Sabharwal calls ''genius'' others would call dysfunction, or at the very least, an elaborate workaround, or temporary fix.
India is known the world over as a prime innovator of outsourcing for foreign companies, which take advantage of its cheap, English-speaking labor force. Less well known is the extent to which Indian companies outsource their own jobs within their own country.
Walk into any of India's shining new shopping malls that sell expensive brands, like Gucci and Satya Paul, and many of the store clerks, janitors and security guards will be on the payrolls of outsourcing companies, not those of the owners of the mall or stores in it, executives say.
The practice highlights a fundamental tension between India's socialist past and a new freewheeling, private sector that is increasingly powering the economy while chafing at what many companies say are laws so protective of workers that they blunt hiring and stifle growth.
Mr. Sabharwal provides a backdoor way around the old system in a manner that is not without controversy. He fills thousands of jobs at a cost that allows many companies to continue to function, and even helps retrain India's large population of young job seekers -- half of Indians are 25 or younger -- who are undereducated and ill prepared to enter the labor force.
In that highly competitive environment for jobs, Mr. Sabharwal supplies workers who are paid as little as half of what permanent employees earn and who usually receive few benefits. Though technically temporary, many of them keep their status at the same companies for years. In India's nascent industrial hubs near New Delhi, autoworkers are increasingly protesting the use and treatment of the kind of contract workers Mr. Sabharwal supplies, who lack job security.
But the reason Mr. Sabharwal has thrived, he and others say, is because India needs him. The nation's complex web of federal and state labor laws intended to protect permanent workers are so onerous that few employers want to hire them, they say.
Those laws cover virtually every aspect of employment -- how workers are hired, what they are paid, how many hours they can work and whether they can be fired. Factories employing 100 or more workers are not allowed to lay off employees without the government's permission.
The laws are unevenly enforced, but many businesses still consider them so cumbersome that they find it worthwhile to have somebody else manage the ''compliance issues,'' which is why TeamLease also employs about 60 people in its regulatory division who do so.
''India, compared to even European countries, has more restrictive labor laws,'' said Sean Dougherty, a senior adviser at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development who has studied India's labor market.
Mr. Sabharwal has provided a way around what many see as those daunting obstacles to growth, at least for now. But even he argues that his workaround business model is not sufficient for India to bolster manufacturing -- still just 16 percent of the economy -- and to create new jobs for the 12 million people who enter the labor force every year.
He is among the first to acknowledge that many workers suffer because the workaround model does not itself create enough good jobs. But it is offering an opportunity for growth where the old model does not.
''For business, labor laws are a thorn in the side, not a dagger in the heart,'' Mr. Sabharwal said. ''People who are hurt the most are people who need to get off farms, labor market outsiders, people from small towns, the less educated, the less skilled.''
An Unlikely Entrepreneur
TeamLease is not the business Mr. Sabharwal set out to open.
During the 1970s, when he and his family spent four years in Washington, a question kept nagging him: ''Americans weren't really smarter than us, but why were they richer than us?''
It was a timely question because India's economy then was turning increasingly socialist and state-directed. Policy makers nationalized large banks, raised the highest tax rate to 97.5 percent and required factories with 300 or more workers to get government permission before layoffs, a threshold later reduced.
Mr. Sabharwal's family of civil servants and teachers believed in India's socialist policies. His father, who worked for a time at the Indian Embassy in Washington, was a solid member of the establishment.
''We had arguments about government versus private sector, growth versus facilities in the government,'' his father, Mahendra, said.
The younger Mr. Sabharwal defended the private sector, which he argued was more effective than the government and the reason for America's greater riches. He became convinced that he could have a bigger impact on India as an entrepreneur than by joining the civil service as his father had done.
He wanted to start a business. But first, he said, he had to learn how a free-market economy worked. So, with his grandparents paying the tuition bill, he went to the Wharton School. ''I wanted to go out and understand how business was done without regulatory connections,'' he said.
At Wharton, professors and friends say, he worked with single-minded focus on a business plan -- not for TeamLease, but for a private insurance company, India Life, which he hoped would take on the state monopoly. But back in India, policy makers were not yet willing to introduce competition in the insurance industry. He hit a brick wall.
Then one day an Indian manager at Siemens, the German company, complained to him about the tedium of processing payroll and benefits paperwork. Mr. Sabharwal decided to turn India Life into an outsourcing company to do that work.
In 2001, Hewitt, an American company, acquired India Life. A year later, Mr. Sabharwal and his partner, Ashok Reddy, started TeamLease to solve another frequent problem clients complained about: hiring and managing employees in the thicket of India's complex labor laws.
Work in the New Economy
Today, one of TeamLease's biggest clients is Whirlpool, the American appliance maker. In 1997, a few years after Whirlpool arrived in India, it hired hundreds of salesmen and sent them to independent retail stores to sell washing machines, refrigerators and air-conditioners to middle-class Indians who had never bought such appliances before. But soon executives were overwhelmed trying to keep abreast of changes in labor laws and various minimum-wage rules in India's 28 states.
So Whirlpool began outsourcing its sales staff, which has since grown to 1,850 people -- first to a staffing agency called Adecco and later to TeamLease. Excluding 250 people who work at the company's own stores, most of its sales workers are employed by TeamLease, which handles their wages, commissions, health care and retirement savings.
Indian executives at Whirlpool, which sells appliances in 130 countries, said India was perhaps one of only a few places where an outside company managed its sales staff.
''Having a guy on your payroll comes with a lot of responsibility,'' said Hardesh Chojher, general manager of marketing at Whirlpool in India. ''For example, each state has its minimum wage, which is revised every three months.''
Many employers in India rely on contract hiring agencies like TeamLease, though many are reluctant to say so publicly. Indeed, foreign companies that come to India often hire law firms and staffing agencies before hiring anyone else.
Nearly one-quarter of India's industrial laborers worked on contracts in 2007, up from just 16 percent in 2000, according to government data. The share of temporary workers in India's large services sector is believed to be even higher, though the government does not collect that data. Even government agencies increasingly rely on temporary employees.
Unlike in the United States, where temporary workers are rotated between job sites, in India contract workers often stay in some jobs for years. Arun Gour, 25, joined Whirlpool's sales team as a contract worker about four years ago in Yamunanagar, a town 120 miles north of New Delhi. After smashing sales records, he was promoted this year to a job at Whirlpool's Indian headquarters in Gurgaon, a booming city just south of New Delhi, where he collects and processes sales data from around the country.
Mr. Gour makes about 18,000 rupees, or $345, a month, a good salary by Indian standards, and he has access to a government-run retirement-savings plan and health insurance. He said he hoped one day to be promoted onto Whirlpool's payroll so he could earn more money and receive better benefits.
''I am very proud that I am providing for my family,'' Mr. Gour said, speaking of his wife and mother, who still live in Yamunanagar. ''I have friends from college who are looking for work. Some of them have master's degrees and they are earning 6,000 or 7,000 a month,'' or about $115 to $134.
A Flawed System
Not everyone is as happy. About 30 miles south of New Delhi along the dusty highway to Jaipur lies Manesar, one of India's new industrial boomtowns. There, more than 100,000 workers -- about 30 percent of them on contracts -- toil in the factories of Indian and multinational companies like Maruti Suzuki, Videocon, Mitsubishi and Honda.
While the factories have been profitable and have provided new jobs, both labor and management are frustrated. Workers complain about the expanding ranks of contract workers who are paid a fraction of what regular employees earn and receive few benefits, and they say that there are not enough jobs to begin with.
Corporate executives say that India's restrictive labor laws force them to hire and train contract workers who feel no loyalty to them, and that finding skilled workers is difficult.
In early October, these frustrations boiled over when 2,000 workers at Maruti Suzuki, India's largest car company, went on strike and shut down a plant that produced as many as 1,200 cars a day. The spark for the strike was that the company had not immediately taken back 1,200 contract workers who supported 1,000 regular employees during a previous dispute, underscoring the vulnerability of the temporary hires.
''Everyone aspires to become a permanent employee,'' Rajbir, a 23-year-old contract worker who only uses one name, said while he camped with other striking workers outside the factory gates. He said he worked on a contract basis because he needed the money and had few other options. ''Wherever we go, there will be similar problems,'' he said.
The chairman of Maruti Suzuki, R. C. Bhargava, disputed the workers' allegations, but he acknowledged that Indian companies hired too many contract workers. He said policy makers should give companies more flexibility in laying off workers and, in exchange, force them to offer workers generous unemployment insurance. ''This conflict situation doesn't help anybody,'' Mr. Bhargava said.
In October, the Indian government proposed letting ailing factories lay off workers if they offered unemployment insurance. But the provision would apply only to companies in a few new manufacturing zones. Analysts say policy makers are unlikely to consider broader reforms in the next few years because there is a deadlock between advocates for change like Prime Minister Singh and lawmakers who believe that any weakening of laws would hurt workers.
In the meantime, many economists assert that India's labor laws will continue to restrict the country's job growth, at least in the formal sector. While that is bad news for India, it is a circumstance that continues to allow Mr. Sabharwal's business to thrive. Last year it grew by 10,000 employees.
His company had $160 million in revenue last year and is growing about 20 percent a year, executives said. Last year, it acquired the Indian Institute of Job Training, which runs 120 centers that provide courses in English, bookkeeping, computer applications and other subjects. TeamLease also plans to build 22 community colleges in the western state of Gujarat.
Mr. Sabharwal said his business could grow even faster if the government changed the labor laws because that would create more jobs and increase demand for job training. But he is not letting government inaction hold him back.
''If you wait for all the lights to be green in India,'' he said, ''you will never leave home.''
India's Way: Articles in this series are exploring the messy and maddening road to progress in India, which has built one of the world's fastest-growing economies in spite of a government that often fails to keep up.

HEADLINE: Romney's New TV Ad Talks About Romney

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's campaign released its second television ad on Wednesday, a spot that is notable for having what the former Massachusetts governor's last ad did not: a positive message. 
The new 30-second spot, titled ''The Right Answer,'' will be broadcast in New Hampshire where Mr. Romney has spent considerable resources in a bet that he can win and catapult himself to the Republican nomination. The New Hampshire primary is Jan. 10.
''I spent my life in the private sector,'' the ad opens in a voice-over from Mr. Romney, which was taken from remarks he made at a CNN debate in September. As he speaks, the words ''Mitt Romney Conservative Businessman'' appear on the screen, an apparent effort to rebut his critics on the right who contend that Mr. Romney lacks true conservative convictions.
''I've learned something about how it is that economies grow. We're not going to balance the budget just by pretending that all you have to do is take out the waste,'' he says. ''The right answer for America is to stop the growth of the federal government, and to start the growth of the private sector.''
In his last ad, which also was only broadcast in New Hampshire, Mr. Romney was criticized as misleading viewers. The ad contained an excerpt from a speech President Obama had given, but left viewers with the impression that the president was saying he could not win if he talked about the economy, when in fact he was quoting something said by an associate of John McCain.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Turkey Moves to Intensify Sanctions Against Syria

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY and ANTHONY SHADID; Dan Bilefsky reported from Istanbul, and Anthony Shadid from Beirut, Lebanon. Reporting was contributed by Sebnem Arsu from Istanbul; Neil MacFarquhar from Damascus, Syria; Nada Bakri from Beirut; and Brian Knowlton from Washington.

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- Turkey took steps on Wednesday to freeze the Syrian government's financial assets, impose a travel ban on senior Syrian officials and cut off transactions with the country's central bank, sharply escalating international pressure on Damascus in response to its continuing violence against civilians.
The latest measures, Turkish officials said, were enacted in concert with the Arab League, which imposed broad trade sanctions on Sunday, and are part of a developing international effort to strangle Syria's economy and severely diminish the power of its government.
Also on Wednesday, the Arab League unveiled a list of 17 senior Syrian officials who could face a ban on travel to other Arab countries, including the ministers of defense and interior. Also on the list are Rami Makhlouf, a millionaire cousin of President Bashar al-Assad who has controlled the mobile phone network; Mr. Assad's younger brother Maher, who heads the elite Fourth Division and the Republican Guard; and members of the state security service, including Maj. Gen. Assef Shawkat, the deputy chief of staff for security affairs, who is married to the president's sister. 
European, American and Turkish officials all said they believed Syria's economic troubles could prove the undoing of Mr. Assad, who to date has managed to maintain the allegiance of Syria's business elite.
Reiterating his calls for Mr. Assad to relinquish power and to stop his brutal assault on his own people, Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said in Ankara that the measures would include an extensive ban on military sales to Damascus and a blockade of weapons deliveries from third countries at Turkey's land and sea borders with Syria. He said Turkey would also stop new transactions with the Commercial Bank of Syria and halt all credit to the Syrian government.
''Every bullet fired, every bombed mosque has taken away the legitimacy of the Syrian leadership and has widened the gap between us,'' Mr. Davutoglu said. ''Syria has wasted the last chance that it was given.''
He said the list of sanctions was a ''first stage'' in the measures against Damascus. The government also stressed that Wednesday's sanctions would not include vital supplies like water and electricity that could harm the Syrian people.
Syria is heavily reliant on Turkey for trade, which more than tripled between the two countries to $2.5 billion in 2009, from $795 million in 2006. Before the recent souring of relations, it was forecast to reach $5 billion by 2013.
The European Union and the United States were the first to impose penalties, and European sanctions, in particular, harmed Syria's oil industry, which once contributed as much as a third of the government's revenue. Though Europe is Syria's biggest overall trading partner, Turkey and Arab states make up four of its next five biggest, and the Syrian leadership, along with those tied to it, has large investments in the Persian Gulf.
The Obama administration commended Turkey for its latest steps, and noted that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had coordinated closely with President Obama. ''The leadership shown by Turkey in response to the brutality and violation of the fundamental rights of the Syrian people will isolate the Assad regime and send a strong message to Assad and his circle that their actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated,'' said a statement issued by a White House spokesman, Tommy Vietor.
An Obama administration official in Washington estimated that the Syrian government had lost more than 40 percent of its revenue, with the oil industry reeling and tourism devastated. The official said that the Assad government was having more trouble than ever supporting the Syrian pound, which residents say has fallen 12 percent in the black market from its official rate and now trades at 56 pounds to the dollar.
The Arab and Turkish sanctions also carry great symbolic weight. Just a year ago, neighboring Turkey was emerging as one of Syria's closest allies, and Damascus has long managed to play on inter-Arab rivalries to maintain a profile that traditionally outstripped its resources or relative strength. Moves by both the league and Turkey have left it as isolated as at any time since Mr. Assad's father, Hafez, seized power four decades ago.
In Syria, some people said they feared the sanctions could embolden government supporters and focus criticism on external forces. ''The sanctions will make the regime supporters even more supportive,'' said Joelle, 25, a graphic designer from Damascus. ''That's the notion I'm getting from people around me. They are blaming Arab nations for what's happening to them, and reminiscing about the old days. They feel that this is an insult to Syria's sovereignty.''
The intensification of pressure by Turkey against Syria is part of a radical about-face in relations between the two countries, as Turkey seeks to assert its leadership in the Muslim world. Only a year ago Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Assad took vacations together and the countries held joint cabinet sessions.
But as the political crisis has churned in Syria for months, with government forces killing at least 3,500 demonstrators, according to the United Nations, Turkey has severed its ties and cast itself as the voice of regional indignation. Mr. Erdogan recently warned Mr. Assad that he might meet the same fate as the late Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, if he did not step down and the killing did not stop.
The violence showed little sign of abating on Wednesday, with at least 15 civilians killed, including 2 women and 2 children, an opposition group, the Local Coordination Committees, said. Security forces shot a majority of the victims in the northwestern province of Idlib; others were in the restive city of Homs in central Syria and in Hama, the opposition group said.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that seven soldiers were killed in an attack on their military vehicles in the southern town of Dael. The attack came as security forces were rounding up opposition activists in the town. The Local Coordination Committees said that at least 100 people were arrested in the raid.
While Turkey has signaled strongly that it views military action as a last resort, Turkish officials said Tuesday that they would consider having their military cross the border to impose a safety zone if the Assad government failed to stop killing citizens demanding democratic change.
Mr. Davutoglu, the foreign minister, said that his government was hopeful that an incursion would be unnecessary, and that Syria would respond to the sanctions imposed Sunday by the Arab League. But the Syrian government has shown no willingness to abide by its neighbors' demands, declaring the Arab League move ''economic war.''
Turkey also decided, given that Mr. Assad continues to ignore the Arab League's calls for peace and political reform, to divert all of its Middle Eastern trade away from routes that traverse Syria, siphoning off yet another source of income for an increasingly isolated government.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. and Democrats Differ on How to Prevent Social Security Payroll Tax Increase

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Republicans in both houses of Congress said Wednesday that they wanted to prevent an increase in Social Security payroll taxes that would otherwise occur in January, but they remained far apart from Democrats on the specifics of how to do it.
A small number of Republican lawmakers indicated that they would be open to the idea of raising additional revenues to offset the cost of extending the payroll tax cut, a break in what has been the party's nearly solid ranks against tax increases. 
Senate Republican leaders introduced a bill that would keep the payroll tax rate at its current level for another year. The cost is roughly $120 billion. Senate Republicans would offset most of the cost by freezing the pay of federal employees through 2015 and gradually reducing the federal work force by 10 percent.
In addition, Senate Republican leaders would go after ''millionaires and billionaires,'' not by raising their taxes but by making them ineligible for unemployment compensation and food stamps and increasing their Medicare premiums. Democrats said that this part of the Republican proposal was not serious, pointing out that high earners were already ineligible to receive food stamps.
The Congressional Budget Office said the Republican bill would reduce federal deficits by $111 billion, mainly because of the pay freeze and the reduction in the federal work force. Senate Democratic leaders want a deeper temporary reduction in Social Security payroll taxes. They would provide payroll tax relief to employers as well as employees. And they would offset the cost with a 3.25 percent surtax on modified adjusted gross income in excess of $1 million.
President Obama, at a campaign-style rally in Scranton, Pa., said Wednesday that if Congress failed to extend the payroll tax cut, it would be ''a massive blow for the economy, because we're not fully out of the recession yet.''
Mr. Obama said Americans should send a message to Congress: ''Don't be a Grinch. Don't vote to raise taxes on working Americans during the holidays. Make sure to renew unemployment insurance during the holidays.'' The Senate is expected to reject the Democratic proposal in the next few days, opening the door to further negotiations with Republicans next week.
Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said: ''We are glad Republicans have seen the light and taken up Democrats' call to pass a middle-class tax cut, just a few days after their leadership indicated they would oppose it. However, Democrats' proposal would put more money in the pockets of middle-class families and create more jobs.'' He said Democrats would work with Republicans ''to negotiate a consensus solution.''
Last December, Congress temporarily reduced the employee's share of the Social Security payroll tax by 2 percentage points, to 4.2 percent of wages. If Congress does nothing, the rate will revert to 6.2 percent in January.
Mr. Obama, Democratic lawmakers and many economists say such a tax increase would take money out of workers' pockets, depressing consumer demand for goods and services and setting back the fragile economic recovery. Speaker John A. Boehner said Wednesday that he was ''interested in working with the president to find common ground'' on the payroll tax cut. He said the tax break must be paid for, but not with a surtax on high income.
Mr. Boehner referred to the surtax as a ''job-crushing tax hike on small businesses'' because some small-business owners report business income on their personal tax returns.
Interviews with rank-and-file House Republicans found ambivalence about the idea of extending the payroll tax cut.
''A payroll tax is a dedicated tax for Social Security,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who voted against a tax package last year that included the payroll tax cut. ''Unless we are willing to have a commensurate change in benefits, then we shouldn't do it. It certainly isn't a supply-side or simulative tax cut. I'm for ending it.''
Representative James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, said that he was open to extending the cut, but had deep concerns and would need convincing. ''I want to be very careful,'' he said. ''If this is going to be a long-term rate, let's set it and resolve long-term issues of Social Security. I am opposed to saying times are tough, let's make it more tough for my kids.''
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said, ''Republicans will put aside their misgivings and support extension'' of the payroll tax if ''it will give some relief to workers'' still struggling in a bad economy.
Senator Mike Johanns, Republican of Nebraska, said Wednesday that he was willing at least to consider a tax increase on high earners as part of a comprehensive deficit reduction package.
''I sense a change in mood,'' Mr. Johanns said. ''It's a little more bipartisan. My position has always been, 'Let's not raise taxes,' but on the other hand I don't want our country to collapse under a mountain of debt. If that means compromise, I am going to do everything to get that done.' '' Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said that she had formulated a plan to pay for extension of the payroll tax cut with a tax increase on high earners that carved out employers, so they would not be hit with higher rates.

HEADLINE: Greeted Quietly, Clinton Arrives in Myanmar to Gauge Progress

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived here on Wednesday to measure the depth of the political and economic opening that the country's autocratic, military-dominated government has unexpectedly begun.
After years of abysmal relations, the Obama administration has promised to respond to progress -- Mrs. Clinton's trip being the most significant reward so far -- even as it presses for more significant steps to end the country's repressive rule and international isolation.
Those steps include freeing hundreds more political prisoners, ending the often violent repression of democracy advocates and ethnic groups, and clarifying the country's illicit cooperation with North Korea on developing ballistic missiles and, possibly, nuclear technologies.
Mrs. Clinton's reception at the airport in this remote, newly built capital was relatively muted. A small delegation led by a deputy foreign minister, U Myo Myint, greeted her without ceremony as she got off her plane. 
By contrast, an enormous red billboard had been set up to welcome Prime Minister Mikhail V. Myasnikovich of Belarus, another autocratic nation at odds with the United States, who is scheduled to arrive here on Thursday.
A spokesman for the Myanmar government, U Ye Htut, welcomed Mrs. Clinton's visit, calling it ''a great chance to normalize relations between the two countries.''
''What we are trying to do is prove we are trying to make improvements in the democratic process,'' Mr. Ye Htut said in a telephone interview. ''We want the United States to understand the situation in our country.''
Mrs. Clinton met with the country's new president, Thein Sein, on Thursday morning. Before the meeting, her aides said she and Mr. Thein Sein would discuss steps each country could take to ease decades of hostility.
In greeting Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Thein Sein called her visit ''a historic milestone'' and said he hoped it would open a ''new chapter in relations.''
Mrs. Clinton responded by saying, ''I am here today because President Obama and myself are encouraged by the steps that you and your government have taken to provide for your people.''
The New Light of Myanmar, the government's newspaper mouthpiece, played down Mrs. Clinton's visit in its Thursday issue. The paper reprinted the ''curriculum vitae'' of the prime minister of Belarus on the front page. News about Mrs. Clinton's arrival was carried in a two-paragraph article on the newspaper's second page.
Mrs. Clinton flew here in the afternoon from South Korea. Before her flight, she said the United States hoped that what Mr. Obama recently called ''flickers of progress'' in Myanmar would ''be ignited into a movement for change that will benefit the people of the country.''
''I'm looking to determine for myself and on behalf of our government what is the intention of the current government with respect to continuing reforms, both political and economic,'' she said.
Myanmar, known before 1989 as Burma and still called that by the United States as a matter of policy, had been visited by a secretary of state only once before, in 1955, when John Foster Dulles tried to woo the country into a regional alliance against China.
An improved relationship with Myanmar could reshape American diplomacy in the region when the Obama administration is trying to shift its geopolitical focus toward Asia and the Pacific, in part to once again manage the dominance of China.
What additional steps, if any, the administration is willing to consider remain to be seen. Lifting the broad range of American sanctions on trade with Myanmar is not yet on the agenda; that would require Congressional approval, which would be hard to obtain without far more sweeping moves toward democracy and freedom here.
Mrs. Clinton could announce smaller steps, like returning an ambassador or putting American support behind international financial aid to help the tentative economic reforms here take root. But officials said no decision would be made until after her meetings with Myanmar officials.
The Obama administration remains wary. A senior administration official noted that initial efforts to engage Myanmar's leaders after Mr. Obama took office in 2009 were ''abysmal failures.''
The administration is disappointed, for example, that the Myanmar government has not freed more of its 1,600 political prisoners; Mr. Thein Sein recently denied their existence.
Another concern is Myanmar's cooperation with North Korea on nuclear matters. The United States has pressed Myanmar to agree to more vigorous inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and officials said the administration originally hoped Myanmar would do so before a meeting of Southeast Asian nations in Indonesia last month, when Mr. Obama announced Mrs. Clinton's visit.
Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, said that resolving any questions about illicit nuclear activity was fundamental to improved relations. ''An early goal of the tentative U.S. re-engagement with Burma should be full disclosure of the extent and intent of the developing Burmese nuclear program,'' Mr. Lugar said in a statement.
Mrs. Clinton's aides said her visit's schedule was dictated partly by logistical issues. For example, the capital's airport is not equipped for night landings. The government imposed no restrictions on her activities, they said, and has been accommodating toward her delegation, which includes dozens of officials, security guards and journalists.
The previous military government began moving the capital in 2005 to Naypyidaw (pronounced nay-pee-DAW), which it had quietly built on a remote patch of farmland 200 miles north of the country's main city, Yangon. Six years later the city retains the feel of a provincial outpost, and is dominated by government buildings and hotels, many still under construction.
After meeting with government leaders and members of Parliament here on Thursday morning, Mrs. Clinton will travel to Yangon and meet the Nobel Peace Prize-winning opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, at the house where she spent years under arrest as a symbol of quiet but determined resistance to military dictatorship. Mrs. Clinton also plans to meet with representatives of Myanmar's long-repressed ethnic minority groups and leaders of nongovernmental organizations.
Some members of Congress have been critical of the decision to send her to Myanmar. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, the Republican chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Tuesday that Mrs. Clinton's trip sent ''the wrong signal'' and was ''a monumental overture to an outlaw regime whose DNA remains fundamentally brutal.''
Administration officials acknowledge that they do not fully understand how the Myanmar government makes decisions and whether the changes seen so far are cosmetic or the beginnings of a genuine opening similar to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika in the Soviet Union. The steps Mr. Thein Sein has taken over the past eight months include relaxing restrictions on the news media, politics and business, but he has not relinquished any of the military's ultimate authority.
The senior Obama administration official said that Mr. Thein Sein, a former general and prime minister, appeared far more open and well traveled than Senior Gen. Than Shwe, the dictator who preceded him.
''He spent an enormous amount of time traveling outside the country in meetings, interacting with others,'' the official said. ''And so it's entirely possible that he had a chance to get a much better sense of what was going on in Southeast Asia, how far behind his country was falling and what was necessary to take steps to at least address some of the challenges.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's trip to Myanmar to measure the depth of the political and economic opening that the country's autocratic, military-dominated government has begun misspelled the name of a government spokesman. He is U Ye Htut, not U Yeh Tut.

HEADLINE: A C.E.O.'s Moral Stand

BYLINE: By D. MICHAEL LINDSAY. 
D. Michael Lindsay, the president of Gordon College, is writing a book about executive leadership.

 BODY:
Wenham, Mass.
IT seems that every week we hear of a C.E.O. who earned millions from a golden parachute after demonstrating poor business judgment or cutting thousands of jobs with no financial downside for executives. These stories feed the fires of the Occupy movement growing all over the world.
But on Tuesday, we heard something different. American Airlines, once the largest airline in the United States, declared bankruptcy. This is not surprising news for the beleaguered airline industry; what is different is what is emerging from the wreckage. Gerard J. Arpey, American's chief executive officer and chairman, resigned and stepped away with no severance package and nearly worthless stock holdings. He split with his employer of 30 years out of a belief that bankruptcy was morally wrong, and that he could not, in good conscience, lead an organization that followed this familiar path. 
Things have been tough for the so-called legacy carriers since the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, as they have been pulled in opposing directions by customer demands for lower fares and labor demands for higher wages. The events of 9/11 further shook up the industry, closely followed by the oil crisis and the recent recession.
Since Congress deregulated the industry, it has been common for airlines to claim bankruptcy and regroup under the temporary shelter provided by Chapter 11. Continental filed in 1983 and 1990, United in 2002, US Airways in 2002 and 2004, and Delta and Northwest in 2005. In each situation, bankruptcy gave the airlines the chance to cancel their debt, get rid of responsibility for employee pensions and renegotiate more favorable contracts with labor unions.
For a long time, Mr. Arpey voiced his opposition to bankruptcy, but the airline struggled because of it. ''Our bankrupt colleagues all made net profits, good net profits last year, and we didn't,'' Mr. Arpey told me a few months ago. ''And you can mathematically pinpoint that to termination of pensions, termination of retiree medical benefits, changes of work rules, changes in the labor contracts. That puts a lot of pressure on our company, not to be ignored.''
Over the last eight years, I have interviewed hundreds of senior executives for a major academic study on leadership, including six airline C.E.O.'s. Mr. Arpey stood out among the 550 people I talked with not because he believed that business had a moral dimension, but because of his firm conviction that the C.E.O. must carefully attend to those considerations, even if doing so blunts financial success or negates organizational expediency. For him, it is an obligation that goes with the corner office.
When we discussed the prospect of bankruptcy at American he spoke with an almost defiant tone of the company's commitment to its employees and holders of its stock and debt. ''I believe it's important to the character of the company and its ultimate long-term success to do your very best to honor those commitments,'' he said. ''It is not good thinking -- either at the corporate level or at the personal level -- to believe you can simply walk away from your circumstances.''
But after being the only major airline with a net loss last year and with dismal prospects ahead, American joined the rest of its major competitors when the board declared bankruptcy. The board requested that Mr. Arpey stay on, but as he wrote to American's employees, ''executing the board's plan will require not only a re-evaluation of every aspect of our business, but also the leadership of a new chairman and C.E.O. who will bring restructuring experience and a different perspective to the process.''
Mr. Arpey may be the only airline C.E.O. who regarded bankruptcy not simply as a financial tool, but more important, as a moral failing. In a day and age of outrageous executive compensation and protest movements justifiably angered at the self-serving nature of the 1 percent, it is refreshing to see a C.E.O. leave a position with honor even as he loses a long-fought battle.
Protesters at Occupy Wall Street are mad because, to them, financial considerations are inherently moral. It is a troubling commentary on American business that perhaps the last C.E.O. who agreed with them no longer calls the shots for one of the nation's most venerable companies.

HEADLINE: Many Consumers Plan to Spend Less This Holiday Season

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: With economic concerns weighing heavily, 42 percent of Americans -- and 49 percent of parents -- say they plan to spend less this holiday season than last year, a recent survey found. 

 BODY:
With economic concerns weighing heavily, 42 percent of Americans --and 49 percent of parents -- say they plan to spend less this holiday season than last year, a recent survey found.
Bankrate.com's NovemberFinancial Security Index poll, released early this week, found that just 10 percent of Americans plan to spend more this year than they did in 2010.
But it remains to be seen if consumers can stick to their budgets. Retailers, for instance, reported strong sales over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.
"While consumers indicate a reluctance to spend more this holiday season, there is a notorious disconnect between how consumers feel and how consumers act, particularly regarding spending," said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst for Bankrate.com, in a statement.
Princeton Survey Research Associates conducted the telephone survey of 1,005 adults in early November. The margin of sampling error is four percentage points.
The index fell to its second-lowest level of the year, as feelings of job security hit a new low. Just 13 percent of Americans feel more secure in their jobs now than they did one year ago, which helped drag down the overall index to 92.5 points, just above the 2011 low of 92.3 recorded in August. (A reading below 100 indicates decreasing levels of financial security compared with 12 months earlier.)
The percentage of Americans reporting higher net worth than one year ago rebounded slightly in November, thanks to the October stock market rally. Feelings on both savings and debt were largely unchanged from October, with only 11 percent of Americans more comfortable with their savings and 20 percent more comfortable with their debt relative to one year ago.
Are you planning to spend less over the holidays this year? How will you make sure you stay within your budget?

HEADLINE: Why Do Foreign Banks Need Dollars?

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: As private investors like money-market mutual funds are pulling back from lending, the Fed is stepping in. 

 BODY:
The announcement Wednesday that the Federal Reserve, working with other central banks, will offer dollars to foreign banks at cut-rate prices surely raises the question: Why do foreign banks need dollars?
The simple answer is that foreign banks really like the things that dollars can buy. They liked investing in American government debt, and lending money to American corporations, and most of all they liked buying American mortgages and all manner of crazy investments derived from those mortgages.
Bank holdings of assets denominated in foreign currencies ballooned from $11 trillion in 2000 to $31 trillion by mid-2007, according to a 2009 report by the Bank for International Settlements. European banks posted the fastest growth, and that growth was concentrated in dollar-denominated assets. By the eve of the crisis, the dollar exposure of European banks exceeded $8 trillion.
Many of these investments were funded on a short-term basis. The paper from the Bank for International Settlements estimates that European banks had a constant need for $1.1 trillion to $1.3 trillion in short-term funding. The banks raised that money mostly by borrowing domestically and then acquiring dollars through foreign-currency swaps. Banks also sold short-term debt to American money-market funds.
The financial crisis happened in large part because investors stopped providing banks with short-term funds. They lost confidence in their ability to discern which banks could repay such loans.

In response, the Fed started offering dollar loans to foreign banks in December 2007. At the peak of the lending program, in December 2008, foreign banks held more than $580 billion provided by the Fed. The European Central Bank accounted for half the peak total, $291 billion. Loans to the Bank of Japan peaked at $123 billion, but most of the rest of the dollars also went to Europe, to the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank and the central banks of Sweden, Norway and Denmark.
An analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, published earlier this year, found that the dollar loans played an important role in stabilizing foreign banks during the financial crisis. (Those banks also borrowed directly from the Fed, in large quantities, through American subsidiaries.)
Forward to the present moment: European banks have tried to reduce their dollar exposure since 2008 by shedding dollar-denominated investments and avoiding new ones. The Bank for International Settlements said in a 2010 paper that the short-term dollar needs of European banks might have declined to as little as $800 billion by the end of 2009. It is likely that banks have made some additional progress over the last two years. But the funding need remains considerable, and once again private investors like money-market mutual funds are pulling back from lending.
And once again the Fed is stepping in, although so far it has lent only $2.4 billion.

HEADLINE: Ducks Look to Boudreau's Softer Touch for More Wins

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER BOTTA


HIGHLIGHT: Bruce Boudreau's break between coaching two different teams was the shortest in N.H.L. history. 

 BODY:
Bruce Boudreau's unemployment lasted all of 65 hours.
Fired Monday by the Capitals, Boudreau was named the new head coach of the Anaheim Ducks late Wednesday night. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Boudreau's mere six-day break between coaching games for two different franchises is the briefest in league history. When he leads his new team Friday against Philadelphia, he'll become just the seventh man to coach two N.H.L. teams in one season.
Boudreau replaces Randy Carlyle, who led Anaheim to the Stanley Cup in 2007 and a victory over Montreal at home Wednesday. But Carlyle's Ducks had lost 16 of 18 games before his final night on the job, prompting General Manager Bob Murray to reluctantly place a call to Boudreau after his sacking in Washington.
"This was an extremely difficult decision," said Murray, thanking his former coach for the Stanley Cup and his work throughout his six-season tenure.
Murray went on to say, "At this time, we simply felt a new voice was needed. Bruce is a proven winner with a great track record, and we are optimistic he can turn this season around."
Just as Boudreau was charged in Washington with maximizing the talents of the Capitals' world-class forwards, he takes over a roster with a highly-skilled first line, but not much depth. The Ducks seem to go only as far as Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry, Bobby Ryan and Teemu Selanne take them. This season, they are in 14th place in the Western Conference.
Murray is following the N.H.L. tradition of replacing a taskmaster in Carlyle with Boudreau's softer touch. The easy-going, offensive-minded Boudreau appears to be the perfect fit for the Ducks. Although Ryan, a three-time 30-goal scorer, is still available in a trade for a package of veterans and prospects, Boudreau will give his star forwards the confidence to freestyle.
Of course, to play run-and-gun, he'll need superior goaltending. Boudreau rarely had it in important games with Washington. Anaheim's top goalie is Jonas Hiller, a Swiss Olympian who has battled the puck all season and has a 3.10 goals against average (28th in the league) and .899 save percentage (33rd). Boudreau can charm Ryan out of his funk and motivate Getzlaf and Perry to dominate more consistently. But if Muller fails to regain his sharpness -- or Murray doesn't make a deal for a reliable goaltender -- it won't matter who is behind the bench.

HEADLINE: A Calculator to See if You'll Be Snared by the A.M.T.

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A new calculator can help you see if you will be affected by the alternative minimum tax. 

 BODY:
Right after the holiday season comes tax season. So to help you with your year-end tax planning, Kiplinger is offering a new calculatorto help you determine if you will fall prey to the dreaded alternative minimum tax.
The A.M.T. was originally created to make sure the wealthiest Americans paid at least some income tax. But because it has never been indexed to account for inflation, it now snags many middle-class taxpayers.
To use the calculator, you'll need a few pieces of information:

        
What you expect your 2011 taxable income will be (you can use line 43 from last year's 1040 if you had no significant changes this year).
        
The number of exemptions you will claim for yourself and your dependents.
        
Whether you choose the standard deduction, or itemize deductions.
        
If you itemize, you will also need to know roughly how much you paid in real estate taxes and state income taxes (or state sales taxes) that you normally deduct on your tax return.
Plug in those numbers-and let us know in the comments if you found the calculator helpful.

HEADLINE: The Life Report: Regina Titus

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS


HIGHLIGHT: The life reports are in. Meet Regina Titus. 

 BODY:
I am 85 years of age. I was born at noon on November 5, 1926. Sadly, I arrived too late for my mother's beloved father's 70th birthday on November 4. After two boys, I was the "treasured" little girl my mother wanted.
I grew up on Long Island, an average, middle class, Catholic child. I was a quiet, obedient little girl. Not a leader. I had little to say. My parents loved and protected me. I needed nothing more. My father had an automobile repair shop and we did not seem to want for anything. Later in life, I found out how hard he struggled to make a living for us. He even gave money to help mother's family during the Depression.
Time, life and World War II went by. Then my high school graduation arrived and with it the huge decision: What was I going to do in life? The nuns in school, as well as my family, said I could be a nun, nurse, teacher, secretary, or get married. I chose to be a secretary because I thought it would get me a job in New York City which would widen my narrow world. And it did.
Wearing a hat, gloves, my only and best dress, no makeup, I landed a job as secretary to the president of a gas company. I was terrified. Very quickly I learned that as a secretary I was a servant. I had to put cold pads on his eyes as he laid on a couch. Then I read to him some financial reports I could not understand or pronounce. I wondered how I would ever get out of this situation and move on to a better type of job. Seemed impossible, no one to help or advise me. I felt stuck. Tried to accept my fate.
Four years later, I began looking for a job on Wall Street. I became secretary to a partner in one of Wall Street's finest investment banking firms. Again, I realized I was a servant. I not only had to have my boss's coffee ready when he arrived, but I had to help him off with his coat and fedora. I did make an observation that these minor jobs led me to interesting, important, well-educated men. It made me realize the importance of education. I knew I lacked a great deal of knowledge.
After fourteen years at the firm, an unbelievably joyous event finally came into my quiet uneventful life. I married the top partner, head of the Wall Street firm. He died six months later.
My world dizzyingly fell completely apart. I was not prepared nor strong enough to live through this terrible shocking tragedy. I could not bear to think about or deal with what was ahead of me. My husband, an extremely wealthy man, died without taking care of me. I had no job, no home, no money and no benefits from working 14 1/2 years--needing 15. I had nothing.
I went back to live with my dear friend with whom I had shared a studio apartment before marrying. I tried to mend the shattered window of my life. Even with the support of my loved ones, I felt so alone. I knew my future depended upon me, but how, where. I was afraid of living. But I had no choice. I had to go on.
I wanted to stop thinking of me and so I began volunteering at New York Hospital, as well as The Foundling Hospital. I wanted to help others, particularly children. It was rewarding.
A friend offered me a job as manager of travel for a scientific university. I found myself working on the staff of the president of the university surrounded by brilliant scientists dedicated to giving us a better world. It was so different from working in the business world. I found it wonderful to be a small part of this world. Very different from the business world where values are different. I began to feel I was worthwhile. I was needed once more. I thought about how my life seemed to take me in the direction of leading men.
I went back to being the little girl from Long Island instead of the widow of a wealthy Wall Street giant. It was something I never spoke about. Dealing with it was hard to do.
In my loneliness, I married a man I had known for years. Three months later, while working at my desk at the university, I received a telephone call from a policeman telling me that he had committed suicide.
I wanted to give up on life. I was overwhelmed. I decided to resign and didn't know what I would do or where I would go. All who loved me gave me the courage to go on. I did not resign. The university gave a party for me when I returned and it was called simply, "we love you." I knew I had to find the strength to live. I needed to find some joy in life again. I needed to find a path up and out of the dark valley I had fallen into.
I had a wonderful doctor who said to me at the time that she wanted "no spots on me" because of the tragedies. She wanted me to remember that all that had happened to me was not my fault and that I should not worry about things that I had no control over. I never forgot her words.
Then my mother came to live with me. I loved her but it changed my life once more. I was the caring one. Mother was the cared for one for fifteen years.
Most of my life I thought about how great it would be to obtain a college degree. It was my dream. I had worked for and admired those who were educated. I thought they had a greater understanding of life and led fuller lives.
I never had the opportunity to go to college. I had to work all the time. But it was an English professor at Marymount Manhattan College who said to me, "you deserve a college degree." He encouraged me for five years.
At 56, while working and studying at nights and on weekends, I obtained a BA degree, Cum Laude, with English honors, from Marymount Manhattan College. Graduation was one of the most joyous, exciting and rewarding times of my life. I had joined the world of college graduates. A dream had come true. If I had been younger, I would have continued and enrolled in law school.
Other happy moments came to me by living with my pet, a miniature wirehaired dachshund, called Count Cognac. He lived for seventeen years, made TV commercials, won dog shows and photography exhibits. Cognac loved to ride through Central Park in the basket of my red bicycle on Sunday mornings, barking and bringing happiness to all in his path.
I continue my pursuit of art, photography, sewing, oil painting, piano, writing, French and genealogy.
My world-wide travel adventures have helped me to love and accept others and their different cultures. Travel is the best of educations.
I keep thinking, but who am I--I don't know--always walking alone.
I grew up believing my father was French. At 14, he left French Algeria to live with his sister in New York City. Seeing his personal papers or discussing his past life was forbidden. It was a mystery I always wanted to solve.
I was about sixteen when a friend of my father said to me, "Isn't life better for you now that your name is different." Years later I learned that this man was the lawyer who changed my father's Italian name to make life easier for him in business. At that time, in early 1900, in New York City, Italians were not accepted. They were treated like the Mexicans are in some of our cities today.
Father's name was Paolillo. His ancestors came from Torre del Greco, Italy, and left to help colonize Algeria. Dad worked in the automobile chassis business on 56 St. and 6th Ave. in New York City with his brother-in-law, Nuncie. Dad's favorite car was the Pierce-Arrow. That influenced him to take the name Pierce as his surname. Never did he or my mother discuss this change of name with me. It became a family secret, which I have kept for years. I did not know how to deal with it. My husbands and friends never knew. I always wondered if they would think less of me if they knew I was Italian and not French.
Dad married Mother, a lovely blond from Brooklyn. She came from an ancestral Irish background. Her father was born in England, and her mother in Scotland. They immigrated to New York City, married and had eight children. Mother was their first daughter after six boys. She was always treated special. I would visit them with my parents, bringing them food, clothing, and cigars and newspapers for gramps. He was always listening to the radio and Father Coughlin's station, known for giving advice on everything. They never went anywhere, had no car, depended on Mother and Dad. They seemed happy and always greeted me with hugs, kisses and big smiles.
All my life I knew I was loved and protected but it did not prepare me for life and what was ahead of me. The tragedies, the disappointments, the challenges and how to live with them were difficult.
At 85, I think about life differently. I can look at my past life like watching an old silent film. I can't change anything but I can remember and wonder and think about what if I was more prepared, stronger, wiser, more experienced. Then something inside of me says "forget it, try to enjoy the rest of your life."
That is what I am trying to do. I don't want to waste precious days still ahead of me.
My lifelong friend lived in Wilmington, Delaware, and I always loved visiting there. I found it very beautiful and peaceful. It reminded me of our family lake house in Pennsylvania where I learned about nature, woodlands, birds, animals, wildflowers, trees, brooks. We called it Timbertop.
I decided to leave New York City and retire to Wilmington. At last, I made a sound and wonderful decision about fifteen years ago.
I have always been a student. I am enrolled in Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, for those over 50, at the University of Delaware. I presently study opera, go to NYC on Met opera buses, 19th century English literature, History of the Crusades, French, genealogy, wine. There are about 2400 students and about 250 courses taught by volunteers. I find it is time well-spent, stimulating and challenging to study something new and attend enjoyable lectures, musical concerts, and theater.
I am a docent in the Delaware Art Museum and enjoy giving tours to children and adults. It is fascinating to watch their joy and interest in art as I guide them through galleries of American art.
As a member of the Women's International Club I interact with women from all over the world who are new to Delaware and need much help in communicating and living in the U.S.A., due to their husbands' jobs. I help by teaching, giving advice and friendship to them. Our membership of about 282 women, of all ages, comes from over 43 countries. We are involved in charities and give food, clothing, Christmas gifts and school tuition to the poor. The club is very much appreciated for its outreach to these women far from home and loved ones who badly need assistance and friendship.
I am a member of the AAUW, as a proud college graduate. We give scholarships to students through funds raised at our annual book sale. Last year we raised around $40,000. It is so rewarding to see poor deserving students receive scholarships year after year to carry them through medical school or other schools and then see them, upon graduating, appreciatively giev back to the club and community with their services.
I attend St. Joseph on the Brandywine Catholic Church. We reach out to the poor in the Delaware community with food, clothing, tuition and gifts to the poor.
In my later life I have found that it is through doing things for others that I find happiness.
I have become more acceptable to life's many challenges, turns, sadnesses.
My Catholic faith has kept me willing to live God's will. I have never felt lucky or given credit to me for my life.
I try hard not to worry or think about what might have been if only....
But there is no denying that:
I did not have the joy of holding my baby in my arms.
I did not have a long and happy marriage.
Did not have money to be a philanthropist and give where there is such need all over the world, particularly for children.
Did not have a top career--always served others.
Did not feel joy of life enough.
I know I made mistakes by being too accepting of whatever happened to me. I did not fight back. Always concerned about my honor and dignity and what others would think about me if I reacted certain ways. How foolish I was.
I realize our youth have a more difficult world than I did growing up. They live in fear and anxiety because of world affairs, our economy, joblessness and so many other things that affect them. Questions like when they graduate will they get jobs, will their parents still have jobs and homes, what about money, tuition, cost of living, health care. It is all so overwhelmingly, consumingly terribly to think about day after day, year after year.
Our younger generation needs to be more involved in making life better for all humanity rather than seeking careers with large salaries. We need more thinkers, scientists, those who care about making life better for all mankind. The future world is theirs to make.
These young people need to be more communicative with loved ones and friends. Not by using computers, emails, twitter, or other technological devices, but by using the telephone, writing notes or cards to be sent by mail.
I want to see a face, hear a voice, receive a note rather than wait for the quiet computer to produce an email "Hi." Personal contact is very meaningful to all ages.
Our technological world has developed the hand and eyes of our young people and forgot about the importance of communications that matter most (as mentioned above). The new generation, of all ages, sit silently at dinner tables, with head caps on backwards, sometimes dressed in torn dirty jeans, hands and eyes busy with electronic gadgets, perhaps not wanting to miss anything, or thinking that what they do or watch is more interesting and important than family conversation. They are like silent ghosts with large eyes and moving fingers, contributing nothing to the art of conversation and communication, one of life's greatest gifts, where opinions can be challenged, ideas exchanged, and minds expanded.
It would be wonderful if our youth would become interested in genealogy. Our ancestors are so important in our lives. Their lives can reveal information about our family history and make us proud of our heritage. We learn where we come from and who we are. Much can now be done on computers with "Ancestry." They have billions of records.
I continue to walk alone, a day at a time, enjoying living a fulfilling life that I have created by keeping busy, giving to others, traveling, studying, and being grateful to all those who loved and nurtured me along my quiet walk of 85 years.
I try to live my life remembering a little poem my mother loved:
Yesterday is history.
Tomorrow is a mystery.
Today is a gift.

HEADLINE: Kindles! iPads! Bid Now! (By Fax or Mail Only!)

BYLINE: CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY


HIGHLIGHT: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's auction site will remind no one of eBay. 

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has tried to keep up with its tech-inclined riders by posting helpful Twitter messages like how to get to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, updating its Facebook page as reliably as some teenagers, and creating a contest to let riders vote on their favorite apps.
But when it comes to its online auctions, the agency will never be confused with eBay.
Kindles, iPods, old-school headphones - all were available in the agency's latest online surplus material auction, along with other things passengers left behind, like clarinets and bicycles, or items the agency no longer uses, like old copiers and a snow blower.
But the auction, which ended Wednesday, offered no last-second bidding frenzy, and no Buy It Now button to hit. There were photos of the items, but little more than that. Customers could not buy just one portable DVD player; they had to buy a lot of seven. And the pictures were not catalog-friendly: the photo of the 10 Kindles and one Nook showed them lying haphazardly on the floor, evoking handbags hawked on a street corner. 
To add insult to cyber shopping injury, the department required bidders to download a submission form. Then the buyer had to fax or send the bid request in by mail.
Michael G. Zacchea, New York City Transit's assistant chief operations officer, who is responsible for getting rid of all unwanted transit property, said the agency lacked the resources to improve its sales process. The transit agency used to hold a formal live auction where buyers bid on items left on subways, like trumpets and jewelry. About five years ago, the department moved the auctions to the Internet to cut costs.
The agency sells items like Kindles in bulk, Mr. Zacchea said, "because we know it's distressed material - it's not going to command a great price."
Mr. Zacchea added that the agency could not run its sales like traditional auction sites because it does not always sell items to the highest bidder and has to monitor who buys what. Since he is also responsible for selling the agency's memorabilia and collectibles, like old subway doors and train seats, he has to make sure some items wind up with buyers who can care for them. For example, he cannot sell an old train car to a buyer who cannot deal with the potential asbestos contamination.
"We take the deal that is best for New York City Transit in terms of economics and when we need to get it off the property," he said.
The unpolished presentation did not keep away shoppers. Kevin Ortiz, a spokesman for the transportation authority, said that by Thursday morning, the agency had multiple offers on all of the items, worth about $18,000. The agency was still determining the winning bidders.
"It's not utilizing the most up-to-date technology," Mr. Ortiz said of the auction. "But we really don't have a problem selling this stuff."

HEADLINE: Carrin Is Fined $10,000 for Conflict Over Architect

BYLINE: ANDY NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The federal housing official and former Bronx borough president hired a designer who was involved in a development that required his approval. 

 BODY:
Adolfo Carrion Jr., the former Bronx borough president and White House official, who is now a federal housing official and is a potential candidate for city comptroller, has been fined $10,000 by the city's Conflicts of Interest Board for using an architect on a personal renovation project who was also involved in a large housing development that required his approval.
The fine stems from events in 2006 and 2007, when Mr. Carrion, then in his second term as borough president, hired the architect, Hugo Subotovsky, to design a porch for his Victorian home on City Island in the Bronx. At the time, Mr. Subotovsky was the architect for Boricua Village, a proposed 679-unit complex in the Melrose neighborhood.
Mr. Carrion, 50, said in settlement papers (see below) that though he did not know at the time of Mr. Subotovsky's involvement in the larger project, he knew that the architect had been involved in other projects that had come before him and that he "should have disclosed that private transaction to the board." 
He said he had hired Mr. Subotovsky at the recommendation of "my friend Peter Fine," the developer behind Boricua Village. Mr. Fine and his colleagues at Atlantic Development Group donated more than $52,000 to Mr. Carrion as the project moved through the system, The Daily News reported in 2009.
In 2007, Mr. Carrion, a Democrat, recommended that the zoning change needed for Boricua Village, one of the largest taxpayer-subsidized developments in the Bronx, be approved.
He did not pay Mr. Subotovsky for his work on the City Island house until March 2009, after The Daily News asked him about it. Shortly after The Daily News published an investigative piece on his relationship with the architect - the hiring "was completely unrelated to my professional activities and entirely proper," Mr. Carrion is quoted as saying in the article - Mr. Carrion received a bill from Mr. Subotovsky for $4,247.50. He said he paid it promptly.
In his settlement with the conflicts board, announced on Thursday, Mr. Carrion concedes that he caused the two-year delay in the billing for the work.
At the time of the Daily News investigation, Mr. Carrion had just been nominated to lead the Obama administration's Office of Urban Affairs. He held the post until May 2010, when he returned to New York as the regional director for New York and New Jersey in the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Recently, Mr. Carrion was reported to be seriously considering a bid for city comptroller. The current comptroller, John C. Liu, has been buffeted by a series of allegations of fund-raising impropriety.

HIGHLIGHT: The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has quietly built a fledgling fraud task force that has entered the front lines to fight insider trading. 

 BODY:
ROCKVILLE, Md. - Last week, when a former Boston Red Sox infielder faced accusations of insider trading, the Securities and Exchange Commission got credit for levying a $100,000 fine. The Department of Justice in May heralded a guilty plea from a one-time senior executive at the Nasdaq Stock Market who traded on secret information. And earlier this year, after a lawyer was accused of stealing insider tidbits, federal prosecutors in New Jersey boasted of the arrest.
But in each case, the federal government was not the first to detect the potential fraud. Rather, the initial alarm bells were sounded by an obscure group of private-sector analysts stationed here in suburban Maryland.
In an office park 20 miles outside Washington, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's nonprofit self-regulator, has quietly built a small army of market police. Since Wall Street's financial crisis in 2008, this fledgling fraud task force has entered the front lines of fighting insider trading, even if the group rarely earns the credit.
Finra's fraud group is akin to being the sous chef to the S.E.C. and other government regulators: the team prepares evidence against America's most-wanted traders, but receives little of the glory when the cases are served.
"We identify the dots so other people can connect them," said Cameron Funkhouser, an executive vice president at Finra and the head of the insider trading group, known in regulatory speak as the Office of Fraud Detection and Market Intelligence. "We're a clearinghouse of regulatory intelligence."
The group has no shortage of cases to pursue. The federal government's renewed crackdown on insider trading is playing out on multiple fronts, prompting a roughly 50 percent rise in S.E.C. enforcement actions over the last two years and 52 criminal convictions in New York.
And now, as the government's purse strings tighten, more and more cases are coming from Finra, a nonprofit watchdog whose coffers are relatively plush. The fraud detection group's roster has ballooned to more than 130 people, a roughly 20 percent jump since late 2009, when the group opened its doors.
"We don't have the bureaucratic baggage of the S.E.C.," Mr. Funkhouser said. "People used to say, 'We don't really regulate that, it's not in our jurisdiction.' We don't care."
The role of aggressive regulator is an unlikely twist on Finra's reputation. It has no subpoena power and, at best, has a spotty track record for detecting fraud.
Born out of the 2007 merger between the National Association of Securities Dealers and the New York Stock Exchange's regulatory arm, Finra has traditionally stuck to monitoring 600,000-plus stockbrokers. It failed, critics say, to detect fraud and wrongdoing in the lead-up to the financial crisis. In 2008, the peak of the crisis, Finra filed 1,073 disciplinary actions, down from 1,204 two years earlier.
After the crisis, Finra's board in October 2009 issued a report rebuking the organization for missing R. Allen Stanford's investment scheme, among other problems. That same day, Finra announced the birth of the fraud detection group.
Finra already had a new whistle-blower unit, but Stephen Luparello, Finra's vice chairman, decided to centralize the efforts into a larger group, paying particular attention to Ponzi schemes and insider trading.
Industry lawyers say the group's expansion has sharpened Finra's regulatory teeth. Last year, the group referred more than 500 potential fraudsters to the S.E.C. or other federal law enforcement agencies. Public Enemy No. 1 - suspected insider traders - made up 244 of the referrals, a record for Finra.
"Cam's widely recognized as having a nose for fraud," said Barry R. Goldsmith, a partner at the law firm Gibson Dunn, who was the senior enforcement official at the National Association of Securities Dealers. Mr. Funkhouser, a tenacious lawyer whose Finra career has spanned nearly three decades, "is an 'I smell a rat' kind of guy," he said.
The group's bread-and-butter inquiries aim at suspicious trading, usually by hedge funds and retail investors, ahead of mergers or startling earnings announcements. Finra opens an investigation after more than 90 percent of mergers.
The sleuthing often begins with a scan of the group's specialized computer software, the Securities Observation News Analysis and Regulation, or Sonar as it's known by the team. The program allows Finra to pinpoint mergers or other news, and then connect the events to an unusual price and volume movement in a stock.
The group then examines who worked on the merger, aiming to trace whether lawyers and bankers carry even minor connections to the traders. To help connect the dots, Finra analysts do what any dogged investigator would do: seek guidance from Facebook and Twitter. Once, Finra caught a former Lehman Brothers trader leaking inside information that he gleaned from his wife, a public relations executive.
The fraud group's office here is replete with a "war room" - a basic conference room where six Finra managers gather every Wednesday to discuss the most promising insider trading cases. Occasionally, Mr. Funkhouser will even answer the group's whistle-blower phone line, a task typically done by junior staff, or give tipsters his personal cellphone number.
While Mr. Funkhouser is the face of the crew, he has a deep, if eclectic, bench.
The head of the whistle-blower unit, Joe Ozag, was a terrorism detective for the United States Capitol Police and a former broker at Morgan Stanley. Anthony Cavallaro and Paul Lane once prosecuted homicides and robberies at the Manhattan district attorney's office. The head of the insider trading group, Sam Draddy, was a high-ranking S.E.C. official in Washington.
The group's sole high-ranking female member, Laura Gansler, co-wrote the book that formed the basis for the movie "North Country," starring Charlize Theron. Mr. Funkhouser calls Ms. Gansler "the brain" of the group.
The group has become a source of pride for Finra, especially after the bruising days of 2008. Richard G. Ketchum, Finra's chief executive, often dispatches e-mails to Mr. Funkhouser's team after the S.E.C. files a case that originated at Finra. "Great win," his notes say.
"It's critical," Mr. Ketchum said in an interview, "for investor protection and it's critical for our reputation."
An earlier version of this article said Laura Gansler wrote the book that formed the basis for the movie "North Country." She co-authored the book with Clara Bingham.

HEADLINE: Negotiations Under Way for Special Session in Albany on Budget Shortfall

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: Lawmakers may be asked to return to vote on cuts to offset a shortfall in tax collections. 

 BODY:
Facing an increasingly worrisome budget outlook, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders are in negotiations to return to Albany for a special session later this month, an official briefed on the negotiations said on Thursday.
Lawmakers would return to vote on ways to offset a shortfall caused by lower-than-expected tax collections, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the negotiations were still in the early stages. In mid-November, Mr. Cuomo's budget office projected that the state would be short $350 million during the current fiscal year, which ends March 31.
It was unclear what spending cuts or other measures might be on the table. In the past, the governor has said that he opposes tax increases to balance this year's spending plan, but this week he left open the possibility that his stance could change for future budgets. 
The official said that one matter being discussed for consideration in the special session was a package of economic incentives aimed at promoting the creation of new jobs. But the details of what such a package would include had not yet been determined.
If lawmakers return to Albany, they would also most likely take up a compromise measure, which is being hammered out, that would make it legal to hail livery cabs on most New York City streets. They would also consider legislation to provide additional relief for communities that sustained damage from flooding caused by Tropical Storms Irene and Lee.
The official said that the negotiations were being conducted by aides, and have not yet directly involved Governor Cuomo; Dean G. Skelos, the Senate majority leader; and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker. 
"These are preliminary discussions in advance of additional revenue numbers coming in next week," the official said.
Lawmakers are not currently scheduled to return to Albany until January, when next year's regular legislative session begins.
 Mr. Cuomo has said that a special session would be necessary before then if the projected shortfall worsened and if it could not be managed without legislative action. He told reporters on Monday that he did not want to call lawmakers back unless he was able to reach an agreement with legislative leaders "on what would be a product from a special session."
"I don't want to call a special session just for the theater of calling a special session," he continued. "It's expensive to bring back the Legislature. It costs taxpayers money. So I don't want to bring them back unless we have an agreed-to agenda and I believe there's at least a likelihood of success."

HEADLINE: Health Care for a Changing Work Force

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: With 42 million independent workers in the United States, the Freelancers Union's health plan may be a model for the future. 

 BODY:
Big institutions are often slow to awaken to major social transformations. Microsoft was famously late to grasp the importance of the Internet. American auto manufacturers were slow to identify the demand for fuel-efficient cars. And today, the United States government is making a similar mistake: it still doesn't seem to recognize that Americans no longer work the way they used to.
Today, some 42 million people - about a third of the United States work force - do not have jobs in the traditional sense. They fall into a catchall category the government calls "contingent" workers. These people - independent contractors, freelancers, temp workers, part-timers, people between jobs - typically work on a project-to-project basis for a variety of clients, and most are outcasts from the traditional system of benefits that provide economic security to Americans. Even as the economy has changed, employment benefits are still based on an outdated industrial-era model in which workers are expected to stay with a single company for years, if not their whole careers.
For most of the 20th century, it was efficient to link benefits to jobs this way. But today, more and more work falls outside the one-to-one, employee-to-employer relationship. Work is decentralized, workers are mobile, and working arrangements are fluid. However, the risks of life haven't gone away: people still need protections. They just need a different system to distribute them. They need benefits that they can carry around, like their laptops. As things stand, millions of independent workers go without health and unemployment insurance, protection against discrimination and unpaid wages, and pension plans. It makes no sense.
One of the social innovators to recognize this problem early and act on it was Sara Horowitz, the founder of the Freelancers Union, which has more than 165,000 members across all 50 states. At Fixes, we highlight practical applications of ideas that have the potential to achieve widespread impact. That means looking at how ideas take root in institutions that become part of the fabric of society.
In the early 20th century, a landscape of new institutions - including the early labor unions and hundreds of civil society organizations like Rotary International, the Boy and Girl Scouts, and the N.A.A.C.P. - reshaped the American landscape. Today, the Freelancers Union offers a glimpse of the kind of social enterprise - mission-driven and pragmatic, market-savvy and cooperative - that is likely to proliferate in the coming years to meet the needs of a fast-changing work force and society.
Horowitz had been a labor lawyer and union organizer when, in the early 1990s, she recognized that the number of people turning to independent work was on the rise. It was also clear that institutions had not yet been built to represent them in any meaningful way. (On one occasion, Horowitz found herself misclassified by an employer as an independent contractor - and quickly discovered that she received no job benefits.) Horowitz had the idea to create an organization to bring freelancers together so they could wield their power in the marketplace and in the political arena, much like AARP does for retirees.
She quickly discovered that their biggest concern was the cost of health insurance. But there were other problems, too. Unlike traditional workers who receive unemployment benefits, independent contractors have to rely on their own resources to get through hard times. In 2009, Freelancers Union surveyed 3,000 members and found that more than 80 percent had gone jobless or underemployed during the year. More than 60 percent had used their credit cards or borrowed from friends and family to make ends meet, and 12 percent had to turn to food stamps. Close to 40 percent had given up, or downgraded, their health insurance protection.
Another problem was getting paid. Some companies, like Time Inc., actually charge freelancers penalties if they request payment within 25 days. Freelancers Union found that 77 percent of its members had been cheated by a client during their careers and 40 percent had had trouble getting paid in 2009. The average wage loss was $6,000. The Department of Labor protects traditional workers from unpaid wages, but freelancers have no equivalent recourse. Then there were difficulties obtaining mortgages, the lack of access to 401(k) plans, and other issues.
Horowitz saw that she could attract a large membership if she could figure out how to provide health insurance at lower cost. Health insurance companies don't have much love for freelancers. They prefer to serve large groups because it's easier to deal with one corporate benefits manager than a multitude of individuals. And because insurers often lack reliable information about independent workers, they tend to assume that they are risky. As a result, premiums in the open marketplace for health insurance are higher and more volatile than those for employees. (The Affordable Care Act is designed to address this problem beginning in 2014 by subsidizing private insurance, but it applies only to people with low and moderate incomes.)
Horowitz got the idea of grouping freelancers in New York State so they could purchase their health insurance together. It made sense in theory, but it had never been done. She worked closely with officials in Albany, notably Assemblyman Sheldon Silver, who was a strong ally, and Gregory Serio, the former superintendent of insurance for New York State, who had the authority to grant approval for "discretionary" insurance groups.
"A lot of health insurers have looked at individual and sole proprietors as very expensive and risky to underwrite," explained Serio. "Sara was able to foresee a trend [in the rise of independent work] before a lot of other people did. She went and found out that these people were not bad risks. Her creativity was in using existing concepts of insurance risk sharing and applying it to a community that has been ignored by the marketplace and, in fact, almost vilified by the marketplace."
Serio and Horowitz made an interesting team. "I was a conservative Republican from Nassau County working for George Pataki," he told me. "And she was my liberal friend from Brooklyn." But Serio found the idea of protecting freelancers appealing because his father had been a dentist who operated out of a second-floor walk-up office on Jamaica Avenue, in Woodhaven, Queens. "I grew up in a sole proprietor household," he said. "If my father didn't work, he didn't get paid. And I knew what it was like seeing health insurance rates go up and up."
Today, the Freelancers Insurance Company (F.I.C.), which is wholly owned by the Freelancers Union (a nonprofit), has revenues of roughly $100 million and covers 25,000 independent workers and their family members in New York State, offering them premiums that the company calculates are more than a third below the open market rate. Close to 60 percent of its clients were previously uninsured or on COBRA (a temporary extension of their previous insurance). The renewal rate last year was 97 percent. (Disclosure: I have purchased health insurance from F.I.C. for a number of years.) The company was financed with $17 million in loans and grants from social investors, including the Rockefeller Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the New York City Investment Fund. "Our freelancers have access to the best doctors and hospitals," says Horowitz. "We have skilled human resource people, just like Fortune 500 companies. We're able to watch out for our members."
How can the F.I.C. undercut market rates and still be a viable enterprise? The key is that while it seeks to be profitable, it does not seek to profits. Its executives receive salaries that are below industry averages, and it has only one shareholder (the Freelancers Union) to satisfy. Those are fundamental differences. Silver, who is the speaker of the State Assembly, notes that the success of the F.I.C. makes it more difficult for traditional insurers to contend that they can't deliver insurance at lower cost. "Duplicating the model and showing the ability of [the F.I.C.] to keep costs under control is something that we will be looking at," he adds.
Like many social goods, health insurance is often seen through a binary lens: either it must be handled by the government or it must be handled by the free market. But the F.I.C. is demonstrating that a middle way can work, too, and that it may be preferable to provide vital services like insurance through social-benefit companies, at least to certain customer groups. In fact, the Affordable Care Act has a provision to finance a new type of nonprofit health insurance company that would be run by its customers. It would be called a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP). The Freelancers Union has proposed to establish CO-OPs in Florida, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington.
Because the F.I.C. has a close connection with freelancers, it can be more effective helping its members make good health care decisions. "We're moving away from fee-for-service medicine to one where a primary care doctor aggressively coordinates care," explains Horowitz. "We're also trying to innovate with alternative care - promoting meditation, yoga, and nutrition which can have long-term beneficial effects." In 2012, the organization will be opening up the Brooklyn Freelancers Medical Practice, a health center modeled on the medical-home approach and designed in partnership with a physician named Rushika Fernandopulle, who pioneered a team-based model of care that is attracting attention across the country.
For now, the United States government doesn't keep an accurate count of the independent work force. This is an oversight. It appears likely that this way of working will continue to grow. In cities with concentrations of knowledge workers, you find a proliferation of co-working spaces designed specifically for freelancers. And online marketplaces for freelancers like Etsy, oDesk and Elance are expanding rapidly.
It's not just hipsters who work like this. Forty-five percent of Freelancers Union members are over 40 years old. Not all follow this path by choice. Many freelancers are former employees, like journalists, who lost jobs. Recent college graduates, discovering that a degree is far from a job guarantee, are forced to be more entrepreneurial. And many companies, seeking to hold costs down, engage freelancers rather than hire full-time workers. All of these workers deserve the same protections accorded to others.
"The industrial workers of the 20th century helped bring about the New Deal," says Horowitz. "But the New Deal hasn't evolved to include independent workers. I think this work force will help bring about the New Deal - a framework of economic security that is parallel in its goals but led by a network of new institutions."
"The government can't replace civil society," she added. "So if the civil society organizations have control, it will be harder to have your benefits taken away - if you happen to lose an election."
On Wednesday, I'll report on some of the other ways the Freelancers Union is helping to make independent work more secure. In the meantime, if you are a freelancer, or know someone who works this way, let us know about your experiences.

HEADLINE: The Huntsman Alternative

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Among leading government officials and presidential candidates, only Jon Huntsman seems prepared to speak out against the excesses of major banks, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The euro zone financial situation continues to worsen. The latest idea from the euro group of finance ministers is apparently to have the European Central Bank make a huge loan to the International Monetary Fund, which would then turn around and lend to countries like Italy. This is a bizarre notion. 
If the monetary fund takes the credit risk of a megaloan to Italy - e.g., an amount around $600 billion, greater than the fund's current lending capacity - this would represent an unprecedented and unacceptable risk to the fund's shareholders, which include the American taxpayer. If the monetary fund does not take this credit risk, what's the point? 
The European Central Bank should provide financial support directly to Italy, if that is the goal.
But that goal increasingly seems to be both the only idea of officials and the last failed notion of a fading era. More bailouts and the reinforcement of moral hazard - protecting bankers and other creditors against the downside of their mistakes - is the last thing that the world's financial system needs. 
Yet this is also the main idea of the Obama administration. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told The Fiscal Times this week that European leaders "are going to have to move more quickly to put in place a strong firewall to help protect countries that are undertaking reforms" - meaning more bailouts. And the new swap lines of easier credit provided by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, announced Wednesday, appear to be just another way to shore up European (and perhaps American) banks with no strings attached.

This week we also learned more about the underhanded and undemocratic ways in which the Federal Reserve saved big banks last time around. (You should read Ron Suskind's book, "Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington, and the Education of a President." To understand Mr. Geithner's philosophy of unconditional bailouts, remember that he was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York before becoming Treasury secretary.)
Is there really no alternative to pouring good money after bad?
In a policy statement released this week, Jon Huntsman, the former governor of Utah who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, articulates a coherent alternative approach to the financial sector, which begins with a diagnosis of our current problem: too-big-to-fail banks:
To protect taxpayers from future bailouts and stabilize America's economic foundation, Jon Huntsman will end too-big-to-fail. Today we can already begin to see the outlines of the next financial crisis and bailouts. More than three years after the crisis and the accompanying bailouts, the six largest U.S. financial institutions are significantly bigger than they were before the crisis, having been encouraged by regulators to snap up Bear Stearns and other competitors at bargain prices.
Mr. Geithner feared the collapse of big banks in 2008-9, but his policies have made them bigger. This makes no sense. 
Every opportunity should be taken to make the megabanks smaller, and plenty of tools are available, including hard size caps and a punitive tax on excessive size and leverage (with any proceeds from this tax used to reduce the tax burden on the nonfinancial sector, which will otherwise be crushed by the big banks' continued dangerous behavior).
The goal is simple, as Mr. Huntsman said in his recent Wall Street Journal opinion piece: make the banks small enough and simple enough to fail. "Hedge funds and private equity funds go out of business all the time when they make big mistakes, to the notice of few, because they are not too big to fail," he wrote. "There is no reason why banks cannot live with the same reality."
The path we are on leads to more state ownership of banks in Europe - not a good idea - and, in the United States, huge open-ended subsidies to private banks. Executives in those banks get the upside and American taxpayers and workers get the downside - a huge recession, damage to millions of lives and a huge run-up in government debt because of lost tax revenue.
Everything else Mr. Huntsman wants is also eminently sensible, including full transparency in the derivatives market. Who will argue with that proposal as we watch the European financial sector spiral downwards - driven partly by the fear of what lurks in prominent opaque transactions and balance sheets?
Mr. Huntsman has also spotted the fatal flaw in Basel III: "The Basel III Accord primes the pump for the next financial crisis by putting its thumb on the scale of sovereign debt, making it less expensive for banks to invest in those instruments without making a realistic risk assessment." Again, in the light of recent developments in Europe, who can dispute this?
These are not fringe or unproven ideas. When I talk with sensible people in and around the financial sector, these are exactly their views. These are also natural Republican ideas - what we have now is not a market but a huge, unfair and dangerous subsidy scheme. 
Such points are made by top academics like Gene Fama (University of Chicago) and Alan Meltzer (Carnegie Mellon), by the former Treasury Secretaries Nicholas Brady and George Shultz, and by top Federal Reserve officials, like Richard Fisher (president of the Dallas Fed) and Tom Hoenig (recently retired from being president of the Kansas City Fed and currently nominated for the No. 2 post at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). (See my coverage of this strong current of Republican thinking in past Economix columns.)
Only Theodore Roosevelt could take on the industrial and railroad monopolies in 1901, only Richard Nixon could go to China in 1972, and only Jon Huntsman seems prepared to face down the too-big-to-fail banks today.

HEADLINE: Socit Gnrale Is Said to Be Planning New York Job Cuts

BYLINE: DAVID JOLLY


HIGHLIGHT: Societe Generale is said to be planning to eliminate a number of jobs in New York, as the financial crisis and a changing global regulatory environment put pressure on its businesses. 

 BODY:
PARIS -- Societe Generale is planning to eliminate a number of jobs in New York, as the financial crisis and a changing global regulatory environment put pressure on its businesses there, a person with direct knowledge of the bank's plans said Thursday.
The bank, one of the top lenders in France, is scaling back its aircraft, shipping, real estate and leveraged finance businesses, the person said.
''It's premature to give more information about the headcount,'' said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the layoffs had not been finalized.
Wall Street banks, whose profits have been flagging amid global market turmoil and regulatory uncertainty, have been culling their ranks. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup and others have announced thousands of jobs cuts. Their European counterparts, including UBS and Societe Generale, have been making similar reductions.
 Like other European lenders, Societe Generale has begun reducing its dollar-financed businesses, after American money-market investors began over the summer to cut their exposure to European banks amid fears over the euro.
Bloomberg News quoted Naseem Haffar, the United States head of loan sales and trading at Societe Generale, as saying he was one of those who would be getting the ax. The bank is ''going through some changes right now because of the European situation and as part of that they are cutting down on some businesses,'' Mr. Haffar said to Bloomberg. ''I feel frustrated because I built a very good team and it just feels that the bank should look in the long run as opposed to the short run.''
In response to a request for comment, the bank said Thursday in a statement: ''As announced in September, Societe Generale is in the process of scaling down a certain number of corporate and investment banking businesses adversely affected by regulation, structural changes or with low cross selling potential. Therefore the bank is adjusting its international set up accordingly"

HEADLINE: From the Wreckage, Flying Jimmy Elvis Emerges, Victorious

BYLINE: STEVEN COLE SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: At the Crash-A-Rama in Orlando, Fla., a stuntman earns instant credibility by crashing a momentarily airborne Lincoln Town Car limousine. 

 BODY:
BITHLO, Fla. -- Flying Jimmy Elvis hopes to add his name, which he admits does not appear on his driver's license, to a list of illustrious auto-show daredevils that includes "Tricky" Travelstead, Doug Danger, Tommy Trubble, Spanky Spangler, Tom "Creepo the Clown" Chapman and "Insane" Arno Selberg.
He is a featured performer at Crash-A-Rama, the most prominent of a crop of shows descended from the traveling auto-stunt spectacles of the 1930s and '40s. The contemporary shows feature more explosions, however.
Despite their provenance, events like Crash-A-Rama do not belong to any American motoring tradition involving sun hats and ascots. The marquee attraction during last year's Thanksgiving weekend Crash-A-Rama at Orlando Speed World was the self-styled blue-collar comic Larry the Cable Guy.
The 2011 show, a four-hour extravaganza of demolition derbies, figure-eight school bus races and airborne automobiles, was opened by Flying Jimmy Elvis, whose success in launching a Lincoln Town Car super-stretch limousine off a ramp and into a 14 foot by 65 foot mobile home set the tone for the rest of the evening.
But before the successful jump, Mr. Elvis -- who during the week may or may not be James Gnojek, a mild-mannered landscaper from Orchard Park, N.Y. -- said in an interview that his stomach was tied in knots. Despite his evocative name, the stuntman forgoes a fringed and sequined white jumpsuit for an off-the-rack, black and white fire suit. He has been in the stunt business for only five years, a mere apprentice in a trade where performers may last decades if they are good, hours if they are not.
Crash-A-Rama is the creation of Robert Hart, the owner of Orlando Speed World. In an interview after the event, Mr. Hart attributed the rise in Crash-A-Rama-type spectacles to the decline in attendance at local stock car tracks, which were battling a sagging economy as well as an increase in televised nighttime races that were keeping fans at home. For a weekly stock car show at the track, the crowd seldom would top 400, he said, but at the Thanksgiving edition Crash-A-Rama, roughly 6,500 fans paid $20 each to see the show.
"But I don't know if I made any money tonight or not," Mr. Hart said. "I'll have to pay the bills from the rest of the year and see."
Before his attempt, Mr. Elvis climbed into a white Lincoln Town Car that appeared to be in frighteningly good condition, a model from the early '90s that stretched roughly 10 feet. A member of the track crew said he had heard that it was most recently used by a local gentlemen's club.
"If only this limo could talk," he said. To this, another crewman added, "Yeah, this one's last words would probably be, 'Help!'"
Inside, Flying Jimmy Elvis was strapped into the driver's seat. He had outfitted the limo with a steel roll cage and placed a steel grate over his half of the windshield. His plan called for driving the car around the track once, then steering onto a steeply angled 15-foot ramp. The limousine would launch into the air, level off, then plunge into the mobile home, drop through its roof like a three-ton hailstone, and drive out the far end.
Mr. Elvis said he had knocked down some of the walls of the mobile home and had checked for squatters, but otherwise, there was no preparation, nor was there any rehearsal.
He figured that he needed to hit the ramp at 52 miles per hour, a speed computed by nonscientific methods ("It seems about right," he said). He had never jumped a limousine.
With white "ELVIS" signs glowing and the 4.6-liter V-8 purring, he drove the Lincoln around the speedway. Just beyond the midway point on the front straight, he steered toward the ramp. As he hit it, there were fireworks and a blinding explosion -- the pyrotechnician hired by Mr. Elvis had done his job -- and the limousine emerged from a cloud of smoke, in lazy flight, 30 feet off the ground. The nose touched down into the top of the mobile home about 20 feet from the far end. Aluminum, pink insulation, wood paneling and shag carpeting flew as the Lincoln smashed back onto the grass infield, traveling another 150 feet or so before coming to a stop.
Except for a shattered windshield and the fact that the front of the Lincoln, from the windshield forward, was tilted up about 30 degrees, the car survived with surprisingly little damage.
Flying Jimmy Elvis emerged, victorious, from his 37th jump with nothing more than bruises, cuts and sore fingers. He walked back to the pits, to an ovation from the audience.
"I was worried about that one," he said afterward. "I looked down and I was running out of mobile home. I thought I was going to clear it completely and land on the ground, and that would have hurt."

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
Television is transforming the campaign trail in such a way that the in-person candidate who stops by living rooms and local cafes has become an endangered species, replaced by the studio candidate who is more likely to appear on news shows and in televised debates, a phenomenon Jeff Zeleny calls the "Fox News effect." Exhibit A: the Republican front-runner Newt Gingrich.
Democrats and Republicans in Congress remain far apart over how to extend the payroll tax cuts that expires at the end of the year but a gaggle of Republicans have indicated that they would consider raising additional revenues to offset the cost of extending the tax breaks, Jennifer Steinhauer and Robert Pear report.
As he encouraged students at Ohio State University on Wednesday with his refrain, "Don't Give Up!" Herman Cain appeared defiant despite the questions about his sexual conduct that threaten to sink his campaign, Susan Saulny and Jeff Zeleny write.
For now, President Obama will not offer formal condolences to Pakistan for a NATO air strike that killed two dozen soldiers, Helene Cooper writes. The administration may reconsider the decision after an investigation into what went wrong is finished.
After American troops withdraw from Iraq at the end of the year, some could return to train Iraqi forces, a reality that Mark Landler says underscores "that the United States is likely to be involved in this country's security even after the last soldiers depart in the coming weeks."
For more than three decades, California has proved impervious to tax increases. But Adam Nagourney writes that it could change next year when voters will be asked to support thigher taxes to help the state grapple with steep budget cuts and gaping deficits.
Carolyn Ryan looks at what made Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, stand out over 30 years as a member of Congress--"his blazing intellect, his being gay, his liberal passion." Mr. Frank announced on Monday that he will not seek re-election.
Around the Web:
So-called "super-PACs" aren't just for presidential candidates anymore. According to The Washington Post, incumbent members of Congress are attracting the political action committees to support their re-election efforts, taking advantage of their ability to work parallel to the campaigns raising and spending gargantuan sums of money on candidates.
Happening in Washington:
Economic reports set for release on Thursday include weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., October construction spending at 10, and weekly mortgage rates at 10.
At 10 a.m., Mr. Obama, former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush and others are scheduled to participate in a panel discussion on AIDS at George Washington University.
At 5 p.m., Mr. Obama will participate in the lighting of the National Christmas Tree on the ellipse in President's Park. Drivers should take heed of police alerts about the rush-hour traffic jams that inevitably accompany this annual holiday observance.

HEADLINE: Romney Starting to Advertise in Iowa

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The campaign of Mitt Romney is going up with its first advertisement in Iowa as the former Massachusetts governor steps up his efforts to compete in the state's Jan. 3 caucuses. 

 BODY:
1:36 a.m. | Updated 
Mitt Romney's campaign went on the air in Iowa on Wednesday with its first television advertisement in the state, which plays a crucial, early role in the 2012 nominating process.
THE SCRIPT "I spent my life in the private sector. I've competed with companies around the world. I've learned something about how it is that economies grow. We're not going to balance the budget just by pretending that all they have to do is take out the waste. We're going to have to cut spending. And I'm in favor of cutting spending, capping federal spending as a percentage of G.D.P. at 20 percent or less, and having a balanced budget amendment. The right answer for America is to stop the growth of the federal government, and to start the growth of the private sector. I'm Mitt Romney, and I approve this message."
ON THE SCREEN As the 30-second spot begins, the words "Mitt Romney Conservative Businessman" flash across a still image of Mr. Romney against a dark background. The rest of the ad includes video of Mr. Romney speaking against a blue backdrop during a recent debate, as well as photographs of him campaigning in Iowa - speaking and greeting voters at the Iowa State Fair, and bending down to shake hands with a little boy. 
ACCURACY The ad, which is centered on a response Mr. Romney gave at a CNN debate in September, is fairly straightforward. Though Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, first ran for public office in 1994, he did spend more than two decades working in the private sector - the majority of it at Bain Capital, as well as his time running the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
SCORECARD Unlike Mr. Romney's debut television ad, which attacked President Obama and took some of his words out of context, this spot is notable for having what the first one did not: a positive message. The ad seems geared toward introducing Mr. Romney, and his views on spending, to Iowa voters, without disparaging anyone else. Voters generally do not like negative ads, and this ad is certainly sunnier. And the words "Mitt Romney Conservative Businessman" seem intended to burnish his conservative credentials, which are still viewed skeptically by some on the right. ASHLEY PARKER

HEADLINE: Montclair Film Festival Gains Directors, and a Cheerleader Named Stephen Colbert

BYLINE: DAVE ITZKOFF


HIGHLIGHT: Raphaela Neihausen and Thom Powers, who run the Stranger Than Fiction documentary series and the DOC NYC festival, will oversee programming for the first Montclair International Film Festival next year. In the meantime, Mr. Colbert, who sits on the Montclair festival's board, is happy to talk up the event. 

 BODY:
Cannes. Toronto. Park City, Utah. If these cities can each be the home of a great film festival, then why not Montclair, N.J.? Isn't it entitled to a little bit of that cinematic luster, too?
"Is it entitled to it?" Stephen Colbert, the late-night comedian and Montclair resident, asked rhetorically. "I think every town is entitled to anything that they want to do." He added: "Small communities that dream big like this, I think they should be encouraged to. Everything that people are willing to come together to work hard on and create, they can."
The event that has Mr. Colbert, who plays the satirically stubborn host of Comedy Central's "Colbert Report," in an inspirational mood is the Montclair International Film Festival, a celebration of fiction and documentary moviemaking that will be held for the first time from May 2 through 6.
The festival, whose board of directors includes Mr. Colbert and his wife, Evelyn McGee-Colbert, took another step closer to fruition with the announcement that it had hired Raphaela Neihausen and Thom Powers to oversee its programming lineup. Mr. Powers and Ms. Neihausen, a who run the Stranger Than Fiction documentary series and the DOC NYC festival at the IFC Center in New York, are expected to help select about 25 features for the inaugural Montclair festival. Their appointment is to be officially announced on Friday at a benefit event at the Wellmont Theater, where Mr. Colbert will be interviewed by the journalist Jonathan Alter. 
Mr. Powers said in a telephone interview that the Traverse City Film Festival, which is held annually in Michigan and whose founders include Michael Moore, would serve as a model for the Montclair event.
"We've watched as that festival has grown and transformed that community. It's had an incredible effect on their economy and their spirit," Mr. Powers said. "It engages over 1,000 volunteers each year and brings films that otherwise wouldn't be shown there."
Mr. Powers said the Montclair festival also hoped to include a comedy competition that would feature around six films.
Mr. Colbert said he would be serving primarily as a cheerleader for the Montclair festival ("If I can find the right outfit and work on my round off"), which evoked his memories of growing up in Charleston, S.C., which established the Spoleto Festival USA in 1977, when he was 13. It was there that he appeared a few years later in his first-ever professional theatrical production: "I played a gay leper," Mr. Colbert said. "Total typecasting."
Once a full lineup for the Montclair film festival is decided, Mr. Colbert said it was likely that he would host or participate in festival events and help recruit other talented people.
He made no promises, however, that he would be able to draft Stephen Sondheim, the legendary Broadway composer and lyricist who has become a recurring guest on "The Colbert Report." "He already got me into 'Company,'" Mr. Colbert said, "and I'm eternally grateful for him getting me in that much trouble."
Referring to the production of that Sondheim musical that he performed in at Avery Fisher Hall last April, Mr. Colbert vowed that that was a one-time-only event.
"I got a lovely note from Mr. Sondheim asking me to do it," he said, "and my wife said: 'Look, no one, let alone Stephen Sondheim, is ever going to ask you to do Sondheim. You've got to say yes.' That's why I did it. It was a ton of fun."

HEADLINE: Bob the Builder Goes to Haiti

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Outside groups are trying to break the cycle of dependency in Haiti with "durable development." 

 BODY:
Some good news from Haiti, or at least some glimmers: International investors and donors are attending an investment forum in the capital, Port-au-Prince, sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank. As The Miami Herald reported, President Michel Martelly, Prime Minister Garry Cornille, former President Bill Clinton and the head of the I.D.B., Luis Alberto Moreno, have spent the last few days cutting ribbons and making speeches, all to emphasize the idea that reconstruction is gaining momentum and that Haiti is open for business.
Lawrence Downes, who covers Haiti for the editorial board, says highlights from the forum include:
 *The inauguration of the newly paved Route National 1, the main highway connecting the capital, Port-au-Prince, with the northern city of Cap Haitien.
 
 *A cornerstone-laying ceremony for a $300 million, 65-acre industrial park north of the capital, where a Korean garment company, Sae-A, will eventually hire about 20,000 people, and 5,000 new homes will be built.
 
 *The announcement of a new Marriott hotel in Port-au-Prince, scheduled for 2014. After the earthquake, there are only about 500 hotel rooms in the entire city, about as many as one good-sized airport Hilton. The 173-room Marriott will be built by Digicel, Haiti's largest telecom company, whose owner, Denis O'Brien, said: "Today is Bob the Builder day in Haiti."
 
Haiti can use such corny optimism. At the industrial park, President Martelly said that this is what they call "durable development."
He was alluding to Haiti's notorious non-durable development-its vicious cycle of ineffectual aid, where all too often projects open with fanfare then go to ruin for lack of money and maintenance. Haiti's reliance on charity from nongovernmental organizations long ago gave it the derisive but sadly apt nickname: "the Republic of N.G.O.'s."
Some outside groups are trying to break the cycle of dependency. Partners in Health, an acclaimed Boston-based nonprofit, is building a teaching hospital in the countryside, that will be staffed with Haitian doctors and nurses, to help build health-care infrastructure from the bottom up.
To make a difference, private businesses, too, will have to hire and empower Haitians - not just as low-wage workers but as managers, and at all levels in between.
"Haitians don't want a gift," Mr. Martelly said. "They want work."

HEADLINE: In Advertising, MDC Names Its First Woman as Managing Director

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: MDC Partners, which owns agencies like Crispin Porter &#038; Bogusky, has hired Anne Bologna for the post. She is leaving the independent agency, Cramer-Krasseltas. 

 BODY:
MDC Partners, which owns advertising agencies like Crispin Porter & Bogusky, is hiring its first woman to be managing director.
The new managing director, Anne Bologna, is joining MDC, which is based in New York, from the New York office of Cramer-Krasselt, a leading independent agency. She had served there since May 2010 as executive vice president and general manager. To succeed Ms. Bologna in New York, Cramer-Krasselt, which is based in Chicago, is, in a twist, bringing back her predecessor in the post, Jeff Johnson.
"I just couldn't pass this up," Ms. Bologna, 54, said in a phone interview on Thursday afternoon. "Miles has an evolved vision for a holding company."
Her reference was to Miles S. Nadal, chairman and chief executive of MDC, which also owns and has large stakes in agencies like 72andSunny, Vitro, Anomaly and Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners.

"It's an opportunity to join the team" at MDC, Ms. Bologna said, "and do what they do, fuel great talent in entrepreneurial agencies, which is what I'm wired to do."
Ms. Bologna's arrival at MDC also represents a reunion of her and David Dabill, who joined MDC in July as chief administrative officer. The two worked together for 14 years, Ms. Bologna said, at agencies like Toy New York and Fallon Worldwide.
Ms. Bologna will be based in the New York office of MDC and supervise a portfolio of MDC's advertising, branding and research agencies.
Managing partner is one of the top executive posts at MDC; there is one other managing partner, Gavin Swartzman. Ms. Bologna will report to Mr. Dabill.
Ms. Bologna joined Cramer-Krasselt New York shortly after the closing of Toy New York in early 2010. She succeeded Mr. Johnson. He and the agency said at the time that he was leaving to pursue a career outside advertising as, among other things, an author.
Indeed, Mr. Johnson said in a phone interview on Thursday morning, he will have a book published in April, a "dog humor book called 'Things Your Dog Doesn't Want You to Know.'" (It will be his second book.)
Mr. Johnson, 59, said he was enjoying his non-ad pursuits, which also included work with a theater in Key West, Fla.
"But I found that I missed the advertising business and I loved" working at the Cramer-Krasselt New York office, he said.
So when he heard from Peter Krivkovich, president and chief executive of Cramer-Krasselt, about the potential opening in the New York office, Mr. Johnson said, he was quite interested.
"I'm ready and rejuvenated to come back to a great job," he added.

HEADLINE: Don't Worry About Social Security

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: Senator Joe Manchin, as well as many Times readers, worry that a payroll tax cut extension could hurt workers over the long term. 

 BODY:
It was surprising this morning to hear Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, denounce President Obama's proposal to extend the payroll tax cut. Mr. Manchin, one of the very few Democrats to break with the president on this issue, said it would jeopardize the future of Social Security.
Many Times readers have expressed the same concern. In response to my Tuesday blog post on Mr. Obama's plan, one commenter wrote: "Cutting these Payroll Taxes is defunding FICA (Social Security). The very same people who will benefit in the short run, will be hurt eventually."
In fact, despite fears on both the right and left, from lawmakers and blog-readers, it will have no effect on Social Security.
For one thing, both Democrats and Republicans agree that the proposed cut to the payroll tax (which funds Social Security) must be paid for, so its effect on the budget would be neutral. The Democrats want to pay for it with a tax surcharge on millionaires; Republicans want to freeze the pay of federal workers and reduce the federal workforce by 10 percent.
But even if the tax cut were not paid for - and the one currently in effect was not - it would still not affect Social Security. Federal law requires the treasury to reimburse any shortfall in the account used to pay retirement benefits . So while an unpaid-for payroll tax cut would raise the general deficit and lead to more borrowing, just like any other tax cut, it would not change Social Security benefits or damage the program's future.
Of course, the payroll tax cut is only intended as a temporary measure to prevent economic growth from faltering next year. Once it has had its effect, the tax needs to be returned to its old level. If the treasury continues to subsidize Social Security for years and years, it will make it easier for the program's critics to say it is unsustainable. But in the short term, the economic effect of the payroll tax cut more than justifies a brief hit to the deficit.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths MILLER, CHARLES D

 BODY:
MILLER--Charles D. Avery Dennison Corp. mourns the passing of Charles D. "Chuck" Miller, visionary business builder and civic leader, who died November 23, 2011 at the age of 83. In his 47-year association with Avery Dennison, Chuck was instrumental in transforming the company from a U.S.-based manufacturer into a global Fortune 500 market leader in pressure-sensitive labeling materials and office products. As chairman for 17 years and CEO for 21, he drove the company's growth with creativity, courage and confidence, and every aspect of the business -- from vision to strategy to execution to culture -- was shaped for the better by his passion and imagination. Corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California bears his name in recognition of his impact. 
Chuck translated the qualities that made him such an exceptional businessman into a deep commitment to civic leadership. Among the many roles he filled with distinction were: chairman of the board of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, director of numerous Southern California companies, chairman of United Way of Greater Los Angeles, and co-created with Peter Mullin the Mullin-Miller Million Dollar Match Fund to encourage giving to the United Way Pathways Out of Poverty Plan during the recent severe recession. He also supported a wide range of medical institutions, including Operation Walk, which provides total hip and knee replacements to the impoverished and which he personally nurtured from a local into an international organization. A lifelong lover of athletics, he was one of the first members of the organizing committee that brought the 1984 Olympic Games to Los Angeles, and helped establish the Los Angeles Sports Council and the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles (today the LA84 Foundation). He provided extensive support to the U.S. Lacrosse and personally funded the women's varsity lacrosse program at Occidental College, which today is a national power in the sport. A deep believer in liberal arts education, Chuck was especially devoted to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University. He served as university trustee and presidential counselor, endowing the Charles D. Miller Professorship in the humanities at the Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and creating the Vision Fund, a scholarship program for arts and sciences undergraduates and summer students of the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth. In 1998, he received the Heritage Award in recognition of his outstanding service to Johns Hopkins. He also had a long association with Occidental College, serving as a trustee from 1977 to 1998 and continuing thereafter as a trustee emeritus. He remained an active businessman, civic leader and philanthropist after retiring from Avery Dennison. He invested in real estate and owned and operated a wine company, the noted Jackson Hole restaurant Koshu, and a highly successful stable of thoroughbred horses. At the time of his death, he was a member of the executive board of the Rose Bowl Legacy Campaign for the renovation and preservation of the Rose Bowl, a member of the advisory board of the Autry Museum of Western Heritage and a trustee of Southern California Public Radio. The company expresses its deepest condolences to his wife, Carolyn; his daughters Amanda Daly Miller, Candice Louise Miller, Katherine Ann Miller, Susie Cherrill Otten and Charlotte Juanita Miller; and his grandchildren Laura, David, Eric and John Otten, and Harper, Juliet and Zander Branch. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service is planned for December 12 at 11am at The Langham Huntington, 1401 South Oak Knoll Avenue, Pasadena, and a memorial website: CharlesDMiller.org, is now live. In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory can be made to: Charles D. Miller Legacy Fund United Way of Greater Los Angeles, 1150 South Olive Street, Los Angeles, California 90015. UnitedWayLA.org and Charles D. Miller Rose Bowl Legacy Fund 505 East Colorado Blvd., Suite 201 Pasadena, CA, 91101. RoseBowlLegacy.org

HEADLINE: In Virginia, Big Uranium Deposit, and Big Debate on Wisdom of Mining It

BYLINE: By THEO EMERY

 BODY:
CHATHAM, Va. -- Atop Coles Hill, a crown of oak trees encircle an old plantation house from which generations of Coles have looked down gently sloping lawns to fields that once grew tobacco.
Today, enormous uranium deposits below the estate's rolling hills and pastures have set off a bitter fight over mining in this community 30 miles north of the North Carolina border.
The battle lines over Coles Hill were first drawn three decades ago, but now a long-awaited report from the National Academy of Sciences on the safety of uranium mining is expected to rekindle that debate. Its release in early December will mark the start of a crucial new stage in Virginia's debate over whether to end the state's 1982 moratorium on mining uranium, which is used as reactor fuel. 
The moratorium remained in place after interest in the deposit waned. A separate report this week from a consulting company retained by the state found that a mine could support more than 1,000 jobs and have a net economic impact of about $135 million in economic benefits annually. But the study also warned that a mine could bring a stigma. And environmentalists worry about possible contamination of the state's water supply.
The deposit -- which could yield an estimated 119 million pounds of so-called yellowcake -- has been described by experts as the nation's richest untapped source of uranium oxide. If the mine goes forward in Chatham, it will be the only uranium mine in the eastern United States.
The proposal is expected to be one of the most contentious issues in next year's session of the state legislature, thrusting Virginia into a national debate over energy security, nuclear power and the environment.
''The country needs uranium,'' said Walter Coles, 73, standing in a cow pasture atop one of two deposits on the property. ''We need it for our ships, we need it for our nuclear power utilities. It's better that we exploit our own natural resources as opposed to importing it.''
Mr. Coles's company, Virginia Uranium Inc., has pressed a muscular campaign to overturn the moratorium, spending more than a half million dollars on lobbying and public relations since 2007, according to state records and the Virginia Public Access Project, which tracks money in politics. It has made its case at festivals and craft shows, and flown lawmakers to mine sites in France and Canada.
Residents and environmental groups have also campaigned vigorously, but to keep the moratorium in place. Antimining signs pepper the roads that wind through Pittsylvania County, as well as lawns and pastures.
''This is going to affect everybody that lives in these communities,'' said Phillip Lovelace, 60, a ninth-generation farmer who paced and chain-smoked as he spilled facts and figures about the project. ''This is a no-brainer. This is something you leave alone.''
A geologist first detected uranium at the site in the 1950s, Mr. Coles said. In the 1970s, the Marline Uranium Corporation leased the land, and in 1982 it formed a partnership with Union Carbide to mine it.
But the General Assembly passed the moratorium that year, and the pall from the Three Mile Island nuclear accident doomed the project. The mineral rights then reverted to the Coles family.
Interest flared anew as uranium prices soared several years ago. Mr. Coles formed Virginia Uranium in 2007; he is a majority owner with his neighbor Henry Bowen, and Canadian investors hold a minority stake. The company owns about 2,300 acres around the 1,200-acre family estate.
Once a top uranium producer, the United States had only about nine operating uranium mines in 2010, and it imports more than 90 percent of the yellowcake for the nation's 104 nuclear power reactors. The estimated two million pounds of uranium that would be mined annually at Coles Hill over 35 years would be a significant increase in domestic production, experts say.
But opponents say that lifting the moratorium would endanger the environment and health, threaten the livelihood of farmers and open up the state to mining outside of Pittsylvania County.
''The record here in the United States -- mostly in the western United States -- has been a long and tragic legacy of environmental contamination,'' said Caleb A. Jaffe, senior lawyer for the Southern Environmental Law Center.
A top concern is the milling that produces yellowcake. After the ore is removed, the process of crushing the rocks and extracting uranium produces radioactive debris called tailings, which are stored nearby.
Critics worry that tailings could contaminate waterways, and that heavy rainfall, storms or even tornados increase that danger. The Coles Hill watershed eventually drains into the drinking water supply for coastal cities.
Virginia Beach conducted a study concluding that a catastrophic storm or flood could result in contamination of its water. Company officials dispute the findings, saying the study is based on flawed assumptions.
Another concern is that if the moratorium ends, mines could proliferate around the state, including in northern Virginia. Mr. Coles said his company had no interest in mining elsewhere.
The $1.4 million National Academy study, which the Coleses' company paid for, will not make recommendations about the specific site but will provide a broad overview on uranium mining and its potential implications for Virginia. For mining to occur, the state would have to both lift the moratorium and approve a regulatory framework. Federal agencies would also have an oversight and licensing role.
Byron D. Motley, 53, whose family farm is near the site, said he did not believe the uranium could be extracted safely. The proposal has divided families and split congregations, he said, and he is worried that he may have to one day vacate the farm.
''It's going to destroy us, I think,'' he said. ''It's going to eat us alive.''
Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, has expressed qualified support for uranium mining. State Senator John C. Watkins, a Republican on the legislature's uranium subcommittee, said he was inclined to support an end to the moratorium. But if the National Academy study suggests that the uranium cannot be mined safely, he said, ''that's going to give me pause.''

HEADLINE: Poor Economy Leaves More Children at Risk

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CARDONA. 
ccardona@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Judge Darlene Byrne sat on the bench one Monday in November hearing the 28th case of the day on her Child Protective Services docket. The young woman before her was pregnant with her ninth child and wanted to reunite with her other eight children who were scattered among various homes.
The otherwise patient and soft-spoken judge raised her voice. 
''These children did not make this mess; the adults in this room made this mess,'' she said to the mother, whose name has been withheld to protect her and her children's identities. ''Love does not feed or shelter or clothe or take your kids to the doctor. Love's a good thing, but it's not enough to raise a kid.''
More children are living in poverty than ever in Texas. About 1.7 million Texas children -- 26 percent of the total population -- live below the federal poverty level, according to United States census data released this week. And experts speculate that a key factor in the increase in reports of child abuse and neglect is the struggling economy; the number of reported cases of abuse has gone up 6 percent in Texas since 2008, before the recession.
In Travis County, the number of new cases opened with Child Protective Services rose 36 percent from 2008 to 2011.
''In an economic downturn, when you're losing your job, it pushes you over the edge in terms of the resources you have both internally and externally to care for your kid,'' said Jane Burstain, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a liberal research group.
Texas lawmakers have worked in recent years to keep children in their homes or with relatives instead of moving them to foster care. In Judge Byrne's 126th Judicial District Civil Court chambers in Austin, the goal is to reunite children with their families. But in many cases, like that of the pregnant mother she saw in November, it does not work.
''The thought that that's even appropriate is staggering to me, that we've got another child on the way and Mom and Dad can't even take care of these,'' Judge Byrne said. (Judge Byrne is a donor to The Texas Tribune.)
The foster-care system is overwhelmed, and Child Protective Services, like most state agencies, was hit with severe cuts during the 2011 legislative session.
Financing to prevent child abuse was slashed 44 percent. And because the Legislative Budget Board did not increase money for caseload growth or to support family services or relative caregivers, the agency will continue to operate on a budget designed in 2009. Shelters and facilities that care for children and provide services like domestic-violence prevention are struggling to find ways to serve more families with far fewer dollars.
The Austin Children's Shelter receives about 30 percent of its money from the state and relies on private donations and grants to make up the rest.
The number of teenagers in the shelter's emergency program has risen 23 percent since 2010, and the number of teenagers in the shelter has grown by 27 percent. More people are also staying longer, including two children who have stayed for two years.
Kelly White, the shelter's chief executive, said it has seen a surge in the number of children who require serious treatment.
''We're doing everything we can to not have it affect care,'' said Ms. White, who has laid off two employees. ''Some things we've done to save money we realized were not good for kids, so we're having to figure out other ways to do that.''
Ms. White said the larger number of older youths coming in is most likely a result of the economy. ''All of those things create the fertile ground that can create more abuse situations,'' she said.
The average stay has nearly doubled, to 62 days in 2011 from 32 days in 2008. And many youths who have aged out of foster care end up back in the shelter, Ms. White said, often because they cannot find jobs.
In Austin, SafePlace, which provides services to victims of domestic violence and to children accompanied by family members, has seen the number of people who have children in the Child Protective Services system increase to 60 percent.
''I don't think that a bad economy causes violence,'' said Julia Spann, executive director of SafePlace. ''The precursors are already there, and then you add all the stressors and it gets worse. Then it's harder to get help, and for shelters it's harder because people don't even have the means to leave the shelter because they can't get jobs.''
To keep children in foster programs connected with their families or communities, the Department of Family and Protective Services is working on a plan to restructure how the state pays for foster care so that children can stay close to home and quickly move out of the system into permanent homes.
The program, which will award a contract in 2012, aims to help children who bounce around between multiple foster homes, as was the case with one Austin Children's Shelter client who had lived in 32 foster homes by the time he was 16.
Although Ms. White said the overhaul is necessary, the new program will most likely reduce the amount of state money the shelter and other care facilities around Texas receive because it could result in lower reimbursement rates for services.
''I hate talking about kids where you get down to a rate,'' Ms. White said, ''but unfortunately we have to make sure that we also pay our bills.''
Patrick Crimmins, a spokesman for the Department of Family and Protective Services, said that with no end in sight to the recession, the agency is reallocating resources statewide to have as many caseworkers as possible working directly with families. It is also constantly monitoring caseloads, he said, to ensure they are manageable.
''It is, admittedly, a big job,'' he said, ''but we are up to it.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 9, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Friday about the increase in reports of child abuse and neglect because of the struggling economy, and the effect on shelters in Texas, incorrectly stated the increase in the percentage of parents who receive services from SafePlace, a shelter, and who have children in the Child Protective Services program. The number has increased to 60 percent; there was not a 60 percent increase.

HEADLINE: Kindles! iPods! Bid Now! (Fax or Mail Only)

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has tried to keep up with its tech-inclined riders by posting helpful Twitter messages like how to get to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, updating its Facebook page as reliably as some teenagers, and creating a contest to let riders vote on their favorite apps. 
But when it comes to its online auctions, the agency will never be confused with eBay.
Kindles, iPods, old-school headphones - all were available in the agency's latest online surplus material auction, along with other things passengers left behind, like clarinets and bicycles, or items the agency no longer uses, like old copiers and a snow blower.
But the auction, which ended Wednesday, offered no last-second bidding frenzy, and no Buy It Now button to hit. There were photos of the items, but little more than that. Customers could not buy just one portable DVD player; they had to buy a lot of seven. And the pictures were not catalog-friendly: the photo of the 10 Kindles and one Nook showed them lying haphazardly on the floor, evoking handbags hawked on a street corner.
To add insult to cyber shopping injury, the department required bidders to download a submission form. Then the buyer had to fax or send the bid request in by mail.
Michael G. Zacchea, New York City Transit's assistant chief operations officer, who is responsible for getting rid of all unwanted transit property, said the agency lacked the resources to improve its sales process. The transit agency used to hold a formal live auction where buyers bid on items left on subways, like trumpets and jewelry. About five years ago, the department moved the auctions to the Internet to cut costs.
The agency sells items like Kindles in bulk, Mr. Zacchea said, ''because we know it's distressed material - it's not going to command a great price.''
Mr. Zacchea added that the agency could not run its sales like traditional auction sites because it does not always sell items to the highest bidder and has to monitor who buys what. Since he is also responsible for selling the agency's memorabilia and collectibles, like old subway doors and train seats, he has to make sure some items wind up with buyers who can care for them. For example, he cannot sell an old train car to a buyer who cannot deal with the potential asbestos contamination.
''We take the deal that is best for New York City Transit in terms of economics and when we need to get it off the property,'' he said.
The unpolished presentation did not keep away shoppers. Kevin Ortiz, a spokesman for the transportation authority, said that by Thursday morning, the agency had multiple offers on all of the items, worth about $18,000. The agency was still determining the winning bidders.
''It's not utilizing the most up-to-date technology,'' Mr. Ortiz said of the auction. ''But we really don't have a problem selling this stuff.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Rising Generation of Artistic Resistance

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Nearly three years ago they were ''Younger Than Jesus.'' Now that generation of emerging artists (born between the mid-1970s and the mid-'80s) is being called ''The Ungovernables,'' at least by curators at the New Museum, organizing its second Triennial.
''I wanted a title that has more than one side,'' said Eungie Joo, the New Museum's director and curator of education and public programs, who has organized the 2012 Triennial. ''It's a term inspired by the 1976 student uprisings in South Africa,'' Ms. Joo said. ''It could be defined as chaotic or anarchic, but it could also refer to an organized resistance.'' The word ungovernable came to define an official strategy of the African National Congress in 1986, she added.
The exhibition will run from Feb. 15 to April 22. It will take up the museum's entire building, on the Bowery between Stanton and Rivington Streets on the Lower East Side, and include more than 50 participants, or about 34 artists, artist groups and temporary collectives. 
The show is a result of two years, hundreds of studio visits and travel to more than 20 countries. ''I wanted to go places where there is an international cultural scene,'' Ms. Joo said. In her journeys -- to Hong Kong, Johannesburg, Buenos Aires, Stockholm and other cities -- some common threads appeared, including issues of economic turbulence and political commentary. ''The subtlety of the work is important,'' Ms. Joo said. ''There is no overt or confrontational agenda, but rather these artists are making comments that are of their time in a particularly pragmatic way.''
Lisa Phillips, director of the New Museum, said that many of the recent biennials in places like Shanghai and Sao Paulo have had an international influence on art and by extension on the Triennial. ''While these artists are deeply sensitive to the political landscape, we're not seeing the kind of strident doctrinaire views that we've seen in previous generations,'' she said
In addition to installations, videos and conceptual pieces -- the most popular art forms for this generation -- there will be more traditional paintings, drawings and sculptures.
Drawings, Ms. Joo said, will be present more than is usually the case in sprawling survey shows. Rita Ponce de Leon, a Peruvian who lives and works in Mexico City, for instance, will be showing about 120 tiny ink drawings. The drawings depict dreams and memories from some of her friends and family.
Iman Issa, an Egyptian-born artist living in Cairo and New York, has created a series of sculptures that are about the essence of monuments. The Vietnamese-born Danh Vo, who works in Berlin, is also thinking about monuments, but in a different way. When he learned that the Statue of Liberty was simply a steel armature covered by a copper skin the thickness of two pennies, he researched the hammering process that gave her shape, then employed craftsmen to replicate the statue's skin for his work ''We the People.''
''It's really about what those monuments have come to represent,'' Ms. Joo said, ''and the way their meanings change over time.''
A MANET FOR THE GETTY
When Manet showed a woman known only as Madame Brunet a portrait he had painted of her, she reportedly burst into tears and ''left the studio with her husband, never wanting to see the portrait again,'' according to Theodore Duret, a French art critic of the time. So the artist kept the portrait for two decades, until his death in 1883.
As distasteful as the likeness was to the sitter, officials at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles had quite the opposite reaction. The painting is their latest acquisition and an important one, said Scott Schaefer, senior curator of paintings at the Getty, because until now the museum had had only one Manet, and it was a later work, from 1878, an urban street scene. The new acquisition will allow the museum to illustrate two very different sides of that artist's work.
''I really wanted a Manet that showed his Spanish influence,'' Mr. Schaefer said. The portrait depicts Madame Brunet in a black coat over a white crinoline dress with bands of black lace, a detail that reflects the fashions of the Spanish-born empress of France, Eugenie. It was painted between 1860 and 1863 and reworked in 1867.
''This was a painting that was offered to us in 1984 and again in 1995-96, but the timing was never right,'' Mr. Schaefer said. Several well-known collectors have owned the portrait, including Joan Whitney Payson, the philanthropist and former owner of the New York Mets, and the financier Henry Kravis and his wife, Marie-Josee Kravis, who is president of the Museum of Modern Art.
While Mr. Schaefer would say only that the Getty bought the painting from Luhring Augustine, the Chelsea dealer, which was selling it for an anonymous client, art experts say the gallery was selling it for the Kravises, whose collecting tastes have become more contemporary in recent years.
The ''Portrait of Madame Brunet'' goes on view at the Getty Dec. 13.
REALLY BIG BUCKS
At a time when Occupy Wall Street protesters are rattling cages outside auction houses and art fairs, the 80-year-old Los Angeles artist John Baldessari is also thinking about money, or a lack of it. On Friday his latest work, a billboard 75 feet by 25 feet that is a giant image of a $100,000 bill, will be installed on 10th Avenue and West 18th Street in Manhattan, next to the High Line, where it can be seen from both the elevated pathway and the street.
The image is a blown-up photograph of a real $100,000 bill, the largest denomination the United States government ever printed. (That bill, with an image of Woodrow Wilson, was printed between late 1934 and early 1935 in the throes of the Depression. The government printed only 42,000 of these bills, technically gold certificates, which were never circulated among the public.)
Mr. Baldessari is calling his work ''The First $100,000 I Ever Made,'' and it is one of his classic comments on the value of art as well as the current economic crisis, Pop Art style.
''It's a roadside attraction,'' said Cecilia Alemani, the new director and curator of the High Line's art program, who explained that the linear park has use of the billboard every other month. The image of the $100,000 bill will be on view there until Dec. 30.
That bill, with inflation, Ms. Alemani said, would now be worth more than $1.6 million.

HEADLINE: $10,000 Fine by Conflicts Board For Ex-Borough Chief in Bronx

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
Adolfo Carrion Jr., the former Bronx borough president and White House official, who is now a federal housing official and is a potential candidate for city comptroller, has been fined $10,000 by the city's Conflicts of Interest Board for using an architect on a personal renovation project who was also involved in a large housing development that required his approval. 
The fine stems from events in 2006 and 2007, when Mr. Carrion, then in his second term as borough president, hired the architect, Hugo Subotovsky, to design a porch for his Victorian home on City Island in the Bronx. At the time, Mr. Subotovsky was the architect for Boricua Village, a proposed 679-unit complex in the Melrose neighborhood.
Mr. Carrion, 50, said in settlement papers (see below) that though he did not know at the time of Mr. Subotovsky's involvement in the larger project, he knew that the architect had been involved in other projects that had come before him and that he ''should have disclosed that private transaction to the board.''
He said he had hired Mr. Subotovsky at the recommendation of ''my friend Peter Fine,'' the developer behind Boricua Village.
In 2007, Mr. Carrion, a Democrat, recommended that the zoning change needed for Boricua Village, one of the largest taxpayer-subsidized developments in the Bronx, be approved.
He did not pay Mr. Subotovsky for his work on the City Island house until March 2009, after The Daily News asked him about it. Shortly after The Daily News published an investigative piece on his relationship with the architect - the hiring ''was completely unrelated to my professional activities and entirely proper,'' Mr. Carrion is quoted as saying in the article - Mr. Carrion received a bill from Mr. Subotovsky for $4,247.50. He said he paid it promptly.
In his settlement with the conflicts board, announced on Thursday, Mr. Carrion concedes that he caused the two-year delay in the billing for the work.
At the time of the Daily News investigation, Mr. Carrion had just been nominated to lead the Obama administration's Office of Urban Affairs. He held the post until May 2010, when he returned to New York as the regional director for New York and New Jersey in the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Recently, Mr. Carrion was reported to be seriously considering a bid for city comptroller. The current comptroller, John C. Liu, has been buffeted by a series of allegations of fund-raising impropriety.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Craigslist Used in Deadly Ploy to Lure Victims in Ohio

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE

 BODY:
AKRON, Ohio -- They were men thrown hard against the rocks of bad fortune -- out of work, their marriages broken, their youth, with its possibilities, behind them.
To their eyes, the advertisement on Craigslist, offering $300 a week, a free trailer and unlimited fishing to ''watch over a 688 acre patch of hilly farmland and feed a few cows,'' may have seemed like a sign that their luck was finally turning.
Instead, in a scheme so macabre that residents here are already speculating on when it will be turned into a movie script, three of the four men, one from Virginia, one from the Akron area and one still unidentified, were lured to their deaths, their bodies buried in shallow graves. The fourth man, from South Carolina, who was hired and driven to the property in rural southern Ohio, was shot in the arm but escaped and alerted the authorities. The ''farm'' was in fact land owned by a coal company.
More bodies may still be found, as the bogus advertisement, which was picked up by online job aggregators, drew more than 100 responses from Ohio and other states. 
In Ohio, hit hard by the recession, the abundance of eager applicants pulled in by the advertisement has surprised no one, stirring talk about the lengths that people will go these days to find employment. ''People here are desperate for work,'' said a clerk at a motel in Akron, whose employer did not want him to give his name.
The police have suggested robbery as a motive, but other theories have also circulated, including identity theft and, perhaps more chilling, simply a desire to kill. The perpetrators appeared to be looking for loners who would not be missed.
Law enforcement officials have arrested two suspects, Richard J. Beasley, 52, of Akron and Brogan Rafferty, 16, a high school student from nearby Stow. Mr. Beasley, who has a long criminal record, has not been charged in connection with the killings yet but is being held on other charges, including 15 counts of promoting prostitution and also selling the painkiller OxyContin. On Thursday, sources said that the federal government had filed kidnapping and wire fraud charges in connection with the Craigslist case. (The F.B.I. would confirm only that it had issued a hold to keep Mr. Beasley incarcerated.)
Mr. Beasley appeared in court on the drug charge on Thursday, and on Friday he is to be arraigned on the prostitution charges.
Mr. Rafferty has been charged with the attempted murder of Scott Davis, 48, of South Carolina, the aggravated murder of David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Va., and two counts of complicity in those crimes. Prosecutors want the teenager, a tall youth who towered over the police officers escorting him from the courthouse in Caldwell this week, to be tried as an adult, something that is virtually routine in Ohio for crimes this serious. Judge John W. Nau of Noble County Common Pleas Court has issued a gag order in the case; he will take up the issue on Dec. 15.
Neither suspect has been charged in the murders of the other victims, Timothy Kern, 47, of Massillon, Ohio, whose body was found last week buried near a mall in Akron, and the unidentified man, whose body was found on the rural property in Noble County, where officials also found Mr. Pauley's body on Nov. 14.
In a phone interview, Carol Beasley, Mr. Beasley's mother, insisted that her son was innocent, and said that he had spent hundreds of hours in charitable work, like taking food to the poor, and had taken Mr. Rafferty -- ''a nice young man'' -- under his wing. ''We never saw anything in Richard that was violent,'' said Ms. Beasley, a retired secretary at Buchtel High School in Akron. ''I hope the courts will see the truth.''
Yvette Rafferty, Mr. Rafferty's mother, has said that if he was involved, he must have been in thrall to Mr. Beasley, a family friend. Ms. Rafferty, a striking woman, tall and rail thin, paced in front of the courthouse in Caldwell on Tuesday, waiting for a chance to talk to her son.
''All I know is he would not hurt anyone in the world unless he was threatened,'' she said.
One applicant who was rejected, Ron Sanson, 58, a former construction worker, said he was interviewed by Mr. Beasley, who was dining on Chinese food, in the food court of a mall.
Mr. Sanson, who is divorced, said he had been in and out of work since fracturing his leg in 2006. He said potential employers balked at his age, even for jobs shoveling snow. ''You're not going to be out there shoveling snow in the middle of the night,'' he was told.
He said he had good antennae for trouble, but picked up nothing strange about Mr. Beasley, who, he said, looked like a farmer, with ''a scraggly beard'' and a red, white and blue baseball cap.
''He seemed all right with me,'' Mr. Sanson said.
He did not get the job; the fact that he had gone to college and been in the Navy may have put Mr. Beasley off, he speculated.
Less fortunate were Mr. Pauley, who had driven from Virginia with all his belongings, and Mr. Kern, who was struggling to support his three children.
Erin Sendejas, who worked with Mr. Kern for five years at a Domino's Pizza, said that he quit his job as a delivery man several months ago because his car was breaking down and he could not make enough money after paying for repairs.
''He was just trying to find any job,'' she said. ''When he was here, all he talked about was his kids. He just felt that they were priorities in his life.''
Mr. Kern had been missing since Nov. 13, and his body might never have been found were it not for Mr. Davis, the man from South Carolina who escaped.
Before the gag order was issued, Sheriff Stephen S. Hannum of Noble County had said that his office had responded to a call on Nov. 6 and found ''a white middle-aged man'' with a gunshot wound to the arm and a story about answering an advertisement on Craigslist.
Mr. Davis told the sheriff that he had met two people for breakfast in Marietta, Ohio, and after leaving his car in Caldwell, was driven to the nearby ''farm.''
While walking through the wooded area, Mr. Davis reported, he ''heard what he thought was a gun being cocked. He turned to see a gun pointed at his head. He deflected the gun and ran,'' hiding in the woods and finally seeking help at a house two miles away.
A search of the property revealed a hand-dug grave, the sheriff said. On Nov. 11, a woman in Boston called the sheriff's office to say that her twin brother, David Pauley, was missing and that he had answered the same advertisement on Craigslist.
Ms. Beasley said she had met with her son at the Summit County Jail, where he is being held on the prostitution and drug charges. ''We prayed for Brogan and this whole situation,'' she said.
Jon Platek, the Akron campus pastor at The Chapel, where the Beasleys attended church and often brought Brogan Rafferty, said that Mr. Beasley had attended only very sporadically in recent years. He said that Mr. Beasley used to come with his family, even as a child, and church members remembered him wearing cowboy boots and a big belt buckle, unusual attire in Akron in the 1960s and 1970s.
The crimes have deeply affected the congregation, Pastor Platek said. ''It's one thing to do something out of passion, but it's another to do something at this level,'' he said. ''I sit with a lot of deeply troubled people that don't do this.''

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Sues 5 Major Banks Over Foreclosure Practices

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Citing extensive abuses of troubled borrowers across Massachusetts, the state's attorney general sued the nation's five largest mortgage lenders on Thursday, seeking relief for consumers hurt by what she called unfair and deceptive business practices.
In addition to creating a new and significant legal headache for the banks named in the suit -- Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and GMAC Mortgage -- the Massachusetts action diminishes the likelihood of a comprehensive settlement between the banks and federal and state officials to resolve foreclosure improprieties.
Also named as a defendant in the Massachusetts suit was the electronic mortgage registry known as MERS, an entity set up by lenders to speed property transfers by circumventing local land recording officials. 
The attorney general, Martha Coakley, and her investigators contend that the banks improperly foreclosed on troubled borrowers by relying on fraudulent legal documentation or by failing to modify loans for homeowners after promising to do so. The suit also contends that the banks' use of MERS ''corrupted'' the state's public land recording system by not registering legal transfers properly.
''There is no question that the deceptive and unlawful conduct by Wall Street and the large banks played a central role in this crisis through predatory lending and securitization of those loans,'' Ms. Coakley said at a news conference announcing the lawsuit. ''The banks may think they are too big to fail or too big to care about the impact of their actions, but we believe they are not too big to have to obey the law.''
Ms. Coakley has been among the most aggressive state regulators in her pursuit of financial institutions involved in the credit crisis. In addition to her inquiry into foreclosure improprieties in Massachusetts, she has also conducted far-reaching investigations into predatory lending and securitization abuses.
Since 2009, Ms. Coakley has extracted more than $600 million in restitution and penalties from lawsuits against mortgage originators like Option One and Fremont Investment and Loan and Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which bundled loans into mortgage securities.
Officials at all of the banks issued statements saying they would fight the suit. Most of them also indicated dismay that Massachusetts had taken action during negotiations to reach a settlement over the types of practices highlighted in the case.
''We are disappointed that Massachusetts would take this action now,'' said Tom Kelly, a Chase spokesman, ''when negotiations are ongoing with the attorneys general and the federal government on a broader settlement that could bring immediate relief to Massachusetts borrowers rather than years of contested legal proceedings.''
Lawrence Grayson, a Bank of America spokesman, said: ''We continue to believe that collaborative resolution rather than continued litigation will most quickly heal the housing market and help drive economic recovery.''
And Vickee Adams of Wells Fargo said, ''Regrettably, the action announced in Massachusetts today will do little to help Massachusetts homeowners or the recovery of the housing economy in the Commonwealth.''
But as Ms. Coakley made clear during the news conference, her office had come to view as unacceptable the negotiating stance taken by the banks in the protracted settlement talks.
''When those negotiations began over a year ago, I was hopeful that we would be able to reach a strong and effective solution,'' she said. ''It is over a year later and I believe the banks have failed to offer meaningful relief to homeowners.''
Delaware, Nevada and New York have also objected to the direction the settlement negotiations were taking.
Kurt Eggert, a professor at Chapman University School of Law in California who is an expert in mortgages and securitization, said the Massachusetts lawsuit was a significant step because it opened the banks' practices to far greater scrutiny than they had been subject to.
''So far the servicers have escaped any real review or punishment for their bad practices because federal regulators have by and large given them a pass on whether they followed the law in foreclosures,'' Mr. Eggert said. ''This lawsuit argues that they haven't followed the law and that they can't just fix all their problems after the fact.''
Among the misconduct cited in the Massachusetts complaint were 14 cases of foreclosures by institutions that had not shown proof that they had the legal right to seize the underlying properties when they did so. All the banks also deceived troubled borrowers, the complaint said, about the loan modification process. For example, some banks incorrectly advised borrowers that they would receive priority treatment if they were more than 90 days delinquent on their loans. Other borrowers were misled when told that they must be more than two months' delinquent to receive a loan modification, it said.
Although Mr. Eggert said that the banks were likely to argue that a state like Massachusetts had no right to bring such a case against federally regulated institutions, he said that the Dodd-Frank legislation restricted the ability of federal authorities to bar states from acting in such cases.
''If the state can go forward and do real discovery, it will be the first time that anyone has really dug into the servicers' files to see what they have done,'' he added. ''The feds conducted an investigation where they looked at very few files, and here the state could demand to see a lot.''

HEADLINE: A Few Temporary Stores or a Neighborhood

BYLINE: By JESSE HIRSCH and REYHAN HARMANCI. 
rharmanci@baycitizen.org; hirsch.jesse@gmail.com

 BODY:
To Alfonso Dominguez, calling his project to populate a mostly vacant stretch of downtown Oakland with locally minded retailers Popuphood is both literal (''The stores are popping up!'') and a bit of a tease.
Although the six stores, including a furniture company to be housed in a shipping container, will operate under a six-month arrangement of free rent, he hopes the shops will sign long-term leases. 
''I know people have an idea that oh, it's temporary and it leaves,'' Mr. Dominguez said, referring to the pop-up concept. ''But what we're doing is making an incubator for the new economy, rethinking the way retail works as a way to survive.''
Mr. Dominguez's experiment, which has been created with Sarah Filley, an urban planner, officially opens on Dec. 9. It is one of dozens of local iterations on the pop-up concept springing up during the holiday season. And like Popuphood, many of the newest entrants to the pop-up world are pushing the concept farther from its origins as a creative use of vacant storefront space.
These days, a pop-up experience can mean anything from a seasonal Toys ''R'' Us store to a $60 one-time-only meal prepared by a guest chef at a high-end restaurant to a makeshift art gallery in an alley. Some pop-ups mix big corporations with independent operations -- like the SFMade pop-up of locally made goods currently ensconced in the Banana Republic flagship store in San Francisco.
Cultural institutions of all types have also adopted the concept: this week, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art announced that while its building is closed for expansion sometime in the next few years, it will host pop-up exhibits.
Even the pop-up's temporary nature is open to interpretation. One high-profile project, Proxy, a two-block land parcel in Hayes Valley being developed as a pop-up by Envelope Architecture and Design, a local firm, plans to operate until 2015.
''It's gotten hard to know what people are even talking about when they say 'pop-up,' '' said Daniel Patterson, the chef and restaurateur whose Coi in San Francisco and Plum in Oakland have recently played host to riffs on the genre.
For business owners, an uncertain economy has driven the form. Pop-ups frequently function as trial balloons for brick-and-mortar businesses, testing concepts with less financial risk.
Michael Mauschbaugh, an aspiring chef, ''had a very clear vision'' of the food he wanted to make but found the process for opening a traditional restaurant arduous. In March, he responded to an ad on Craigslist that offered the use of a tiny kitchen in the Sugarlump coffee shop. Soon enough, Sous Beurre Kitchen was popping up six nights a week, offering sweetbreads and mussels alongside Sugarlump's lattes and scones.
Though Mr. Mauschbaugh's bistro is a regular fixture at Sugarlump, he calls it a pop-up because it operates in someone else's space, offering a completely different dining experience.
Pop-up ''is kind of an umbrella term,'' Mr. Mauschbaugh said. ''It captures the weirdness of eating rustic French cuisine next to some punk with headphones surfing the Net.''
The large number of entrepreneurs who are looking for permitted locations for their businesses has created a kind of trickle-down pop-up economy -- another reason for their persistent popularity.
A few blocks from Sugarlump is La Victoria, a 62-year-old Mexican bakery owned by Jaime Maldonado. For years, Mr. Maldonado has exchanged kitchen and dining space to pop-ups for a cut of their gross income, a strategy that helped save his business in 2008.
''The Mission has changed so much, I'd say 50 percent of the people who live here have no idea about my bakery,'' Mr. Maldonado said. ''Pop-ups bring me that young, skinny jeans-wearing crowd that would otherwise walk right by.''
Scott Cameron created a company in Oakland exclusively to provide venues for pop-ups. He opened Guest Chef in October, which rents out a fully equipped restaurant space for two-week stints.
Pop-ups are perfectly in sync with the current social and economic concerns, said Lizzie Wallack, project architect for Proxy, which will introduce its rotating cast of eight retail shops this spring.
''It's the nature of our culture,'' she said, ''We're interested in the immediate and the next thing.''
But pop-ups can't rely only on novelty value, said Henry Mason, of Trendwatching.com, a Web site and research company that first used the term in a 2004 report. Toys ''R'' Us, for instance, cut down from last year's record-setting 600 holiday pop-ups.
''Given the amazing success of the pop-up phenomenon, certainly the element of surprise and excitement is somewhat diminished,'' Mr. Mason said, ''So the challenge for any aspiring pop-up is now that 'temporary' on its own is not enough. What else can you offer people?''
For Sunde White, proprietor of Pie Fridays, the answer is baked into the product. She rolls a bright red hand-painted food cart out on weekend evenings.
''People love to bring their out-of-town parents to 'that adorable little secret pie cart' and get their picture taken with me for Facebook,'' Ms. White said. ''But that's just the hook. If my pie wasn't good, people wouldn't keep coming back.''

HEADLINE: Pessimism Precedes A Crucial Jobs Report

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks were mostly lower on Thursday as better-than-forecast manufacturing growth and a rally in French and Spanish bonds were not enough to extend a three-day gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
Financial stocks fell the most among 10 industries in the S.& P. 500, dropping 1 percent, as Massachusetts sued some of the largest lenders over foreclosure practices. Alcoa lost 2.1 percent as commodities retreated. Kohl's slumped 6.4 percent after November sales missed estimates.
The S.& P. 500 slid 2.38 points, or 0.19 percent, to 1,244.58. The index rallied 4.3 percent on Wednesday as six central banks took action on Europe's debt crisis by making it cheaper for lenders to borrow in dollars. The Dow Jones industrial average decreased 25.65 points, or 0.21 percent, to 12,020.03. The Nasdaq composite average rose 5.86 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,626,20.
''Pressures on the financials are still out there,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer of the Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, N.Y. ''The economic data was positive, but Europe is still a concern. The coordinated central bank action is not a solution. It buys them some time.''
Stocks rose in early trading as Spain and France sold 8.1 billion euros ($10.9 billion) of bonds, sending yields lower across Europe. In the United States, manufacturing expanded in November at the fastest rate in five months.
Equities reversed gains as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup were among five banks sued by Massachusetts on the grounds of conducting unlawful foreclosures and deceiving homeowners.
Gauges of commodity shares in the S.& P. 500 fell at least 0.6 percent as news of contraction in China's manufacturing sector fed concern that Europe's crisis was damaging the global economy. There were also worries that Wednesday's move by central banks was only a temporary fix. Alcoa, the largest aluminum producer in the United States, dropped 2.1 percent to $9.81.
Kohl's fell the most in the S.& P. 500, erasing 6.4 percent to close at $50.37. The department store chain said sales at stores open at least one year decreased 6.2 percent in November. Analysts on average estimated an increase of 2.1 percent.
Barnes & Noble, the bookstore chain, fell 16 percent, to $14.59 after it reported second-quarter sales that missed the average analyst estimate by 4.3 percent, according to Bloomberg data.
Stocks did little in the afternoon as investors awaited Friday's jobs report.

HEADLINE: For Wall Street Watchdog, All Grunt Work, Little Glory

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
ROCKVILLE, Md. - Last week, when a former Boston Red Sox infielder faced accusations of insider trading, the Securities and Exchange Commission got credit for levying a $100,000 fine. The Department of Justice in May heralded a guilty plea from a one-time senior executive at the Nasdaq Stock Market who traded on secret information. And earlier this year, after a lawyer was accused of stealing insider tidbits, federal prosecutors in New Jersey boasted of the arrest.
But in each case, the federal government was not the first to detect the potential fraud. Rather, the initial alarm bells were sounded by an obscure group of private-sector analysts stationed here in suburban Maryland.
In an office park 20 miles outside Washington, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's nonprofit self-regulator, has quietly built a small army of market police. Since Wall Street's financial crisis in 2008, this fledgling fraud task force has entered the front lines of fighting insider trading, even if the group rarely earns the credit. 
Finra's fraud group is akin to being the sous chef to the S.E.C. and other government regulators: the team prepares evidence against America's most-wanted traders, but receives little of the glory when the cases are served.
''We identify the dots so other people can connect them,'' said Cameron Funkhouser, an executive vice president at Finra and the head of the insider trading group, known in regulatory speak as the Office of Fraud Detection and Market Intelligence. ''We're a clearinghouse of regulatory intelligence.''
The group has no shortage of cases to pursue. The federal government's renewed crackdown on insider trading is playing out on multiple fronts, prompting a roughly 50 percent rise in S.E.C. enforcement actions over the last two years and 52 criminal convictions in New York.
And now, as the government's purse strings tighten, more and more cases are coming from Finra, a nonprofit watchdog whose coffers are relatively plush. The fraud detection group's roster has ballooned to more than 130 people, a roughly 20 percent jump since late 2009, when the group opened its doors.
''We don't have the bureaucratic baggage of the S.E.C.,'' Mr. Funkhouser said. ''People used to say, 'We don't really regulate that, it's not in our jurisdiction.' We don't care.''
The role of aggressive regulator is an unlikely twist on Finra's reputation. It has no subpoena power and, at best, has a spotty track record for detecting fraud.
Born out of the 2007 merger between the National Association of Securities Dealers and the New York Stock Exchange's regulatory arm, Finra has traditionally stuck to monitoring 600,000-plus stockbrokers. It failed, critics say, to detect fraud and wrongdoing in the lead-up to the financial crisis. In 2008, the peak of the crisis, Finra filed 1,073 disciplinary actions, down from 1,204 two years earlier.
After the crisis, Finra's board in October 2009 issued a report rebuking the organization for missing R. Allen Stanford's investment scheme, among other problems. That same day, Finra announced the birth of the fraud detection group.
Finra already had a new whistle-blower unit, but Stephen Luparello, Finra's vice chairman, decided to centralize the efforts into a larger group, paying particular attention to Ponzi schemes and insider trading.
Industry lawyers say the group's expansion has sharpened Finra's regulatory teeth. Last year, the group referred more than 500 potential fraudsters to the S.E.C. or other federal law enforcement agencies. Public Enemy No. 1 - suspected insider traders - made up 244 of the referrals, a record for Finra.
''Cam's widely recognized as having a nose for fraud,'' said Barry R. Goldsmith, a partner at the law firm Gibson Dunn, who was the senior enforcement official at the National Association of Securities Dealers. Mr. Funkhouser, a tenacious lawyer whose Finra career has spanned nearly three decades, ''is an 'I smell a rat' kind of guy,'' he said.
The group's bread-and-butter inquiries aim at suspicious trading, usually by hedge funds and retail investors, ahead of mergers or startling earnings announcements. Finra opens an investigation after more than 90 percent of mergers.
The sleuthing often begins with a scan of the group's specialized computer software, the Securities Observation News Analysis and Regulation, or Sonar as it's known by the team. The program allows Finra to pinpoint mergers or other news, and then connect the events to an unusual price and volume movement in a stock.
The group then examines who worked on the merger, aiming to trace whether lawyers and bankers carry even minor connections to the traders. To help connect the dots, Finra analysts do what any dogged investigator would do: seek guidance from Facebook and Twitter. Once, Finra caught a former Lehman Brothers trader leaking inside information that he gleaned from his wife, a public relations executive.
The fraud group's office here is replete with a ''war room'' - a basic conference room where six Finra managers gather every Wednesday to discuss the most promising insider trading cases. Occasionally, Mr. Funkhouser will even answer the group's whistle-blower phone line, a task typically done by junior staff, or give tipsters his personal cellphone number.
While Mr. Funkhouser is the face of the crew, he has a deep, if eclectic, bench.
The head of the whistle-blower unit, Joe Ozag, was a terrorism detective for the United States Capitol Police and a former broker at Morgan Stanley. Anthony Cavallaro and Paul Lane once prosecuted homicides and robberies at the Manhattan district attorney's office. The head of the insider trading group, Sam Draddy, was a high-ranking S.E.C. official in Washington.
The group's sole high-ranking female member, Laura Gansler, co-wrote the book that formed the basis for the movie ''North Country,'' starring Charlize Theron. Mr. Funkhouser calls Ms. Gansler ''the brain'' of the group.
The group has become a source of pride for Finra, especially after the bruising days of 2008. Richard G. Ketchum, Finra's chief executive, often dispatches e-mails to Mr. Funkhouser's team after the S.E.C. files a case that originated at Finra. ''Great win,'' his notes say.
''It's critical,'' Mr. Ketchum said in an interview, ''for investor protection and it's critical for our reputation.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 3, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on the DealBook page on Friday, about a fraud task force at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, erroneously attributed a distinction to a task force member, Laura Gansler. Ms. Gansler was a co-author, with Clara Bingham, of ''Class Action,'' on which the movie ''North Country'' was based; she was not the sole author.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Armed And Amorous, Committing Cold-Blooded Musical

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
That Clyde Barrow is such a cutup. Why, the boy will do most anything to stir up his sluggish fellow Americans: slap at them, tickle them, shoot them in cold blood. He'll even punch his fist clean through a wall and drive a big old car right onto the stage, just to try to get a rise out of somebody. But Clyde, honey, t'ain't nothing you can do to raise the pulse of something that's as near to dead as the show you're in.
''Bonnie & Clyde,'' which opened on Thursday night at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, is a modest, mildly tuneful musical biography of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, the kissin' outlaws from Texas who hijacked the American imagination during the Great Depression. It portrays its title characters (played by Laura Osnes and Jeremy Jordan) as restless, libido-charged young 'uns who are about to suffocate from the grayness of their dreary lives. 
So they quarrel a lot (their favorite form of foreplay) and then have sex (offstage, just in case you want to bring the children). They stick up banks, leave a trail of dead bodies and drive real fast (also offstage, since a $6 million budget can only stretch so far). But they just can't seem to shake the torpor that makes every day in their lives -- and every scene in this production from the composer Frank Wildhorn, with a book by Ivan Menchell and lyrics by Don Black -- feel like the one that came before it.
Remember the advertising tag line from the much acclaimed, much-reviled 1967 movie that was also called ''Bonnie and Clyde'' and starred Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty? It went, ''They're young, they're in love, they kill people.'' That pretty much sums up what goes on in this show too. There's even a fair amount of onstage bloodletting, as there was in Arthur Penn's film.
That movie's carnage factor -- and especially the visual poetry it brought to such violence -- was what most raised the hackles of old-guard critics. Somehow, though, when blood geysers out of a body in this version, all you're likely to think is, ''Well, who's going to clean up that mess?'' Directed and (sort of) choreographed by Jeff Calhoun, ''Bonnie & Clyde'' manages to make that triple-threat lure of sex, youth and violence seem about as glamorous as -- and a lot less dangerous than -- Black Friday at Wal-Mart.
Making multiple murders feel like just another manifestation of mortal ennui can be a conscious artistic choice of course. (Think of ''Badlands,'' Terrence Malick's 1973 movie about a numbed-out serial killer.) I doubt that's what the creative team here is going for, though Clyde does make some grim existential statements about the randomness of life and death.
Instead, this show has repackaged the tale of Bonnie and Clyde as a Story for Our Time, with implicit parallels between the lost ideals of one American era of privation and unemployment and our own. ''This country's had its day,'' Clyde snarls. That pronouncement is reflected in Tobin Ost's weathered wooden sets, overlaid with Aaron Rhyne's video projections, which summon the Dust Bowl images of photographers like Dorothea Lange. There is even -- heaven help us -- a breadline tableau, in silhouette, somewhere along the way. (There are also projected pictures of the real Bonnie and Clyde, a bad idea, since they bristle with a gritty individuality that no one onstage possesses.)
You can understand then why Clyde, the son of a sharecropper, and Bonnie, a two-bit waitress with movie-star fantasies, might want to break away and go wild. (We meet their childhood selves, played by Kelsey Fowler and Talon Ackerman, who show up to remind them of the dreams they once dreamed.) And it makes sense that members of a down-and-out public would see Bonnie and Clyde as radiant and exciting creatures.
Whether theatergoers will share that vision is another question. Mr. Jordan, a rising musical star who won terrific notices for the Broadway-bound Disney musical ''Newsies,'' has a great baby-gangster face that brings to mind a dewier John Garfield or perhaps all the Dead End Kids rolled into one. He exudes a naturally intense presence, and he works hard at making Clyde seem both wholesome and menacing.
But for all their semiclad spooning and sparking and aspiringly fiery fights, this Bonnie and Clyde don't seem convincingly hot for each other or for the thrill of being on the run. Ms. Osnes is a lovely young woman of fashion-model proportions and an instinctive, accessible elegance that reads Ingenue. (She was perfect as the romantic lead in the current revival of ''Anything Goes.'')
I don't think ingenue was what Bonnie Parker was about. Ms. Osnes brings to mind a Bennington girl slumming with rough trade on her semester off. And while she has in past performances proved herself an incisive and expressive dancer (it's her foremost tool in defining character), here she's allowed nary a step.
She does get to sing the show's most classically Wildhornesque number, a second-act pump-up-the-volume soul barer called ''Dyin' Ain't So Bad.'' For the most part, though, Mr. Wildhorn -- who is best known for hard-sell power ballads in shows that include ''Jekyll and Hyde,'' ''Dracula'' and last season's short-lived ''Wonderland'' -- is politely restrained for a production that you might have expected to bring out his most lurid side.
His musical template is humbly of the people this time, which means a little bit gospel, a little bit ragtime, a little bit country-western. But the numbers -- even the kind of evangelical call-and-response song that usually gets audiences whooping and clapping along -- all seem to flat-line in the end. Tellingly the show's best song is a slender, shimmering hymn to small and ordinary pleasures, nicely performed by Melissa van der Schyff as Blanche, the pious wife of Clyde's brother, Buck (Claybourne Elder, sweet and empty).
Partly because Mr. Calhoun's staging (with the help of Michael Gilliam's lighting) tries to approximate cinematic crosscutting, you find yourself thinking of Penn's movie and the incisive characterizations provided by a cast that included Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons as Buck and Blanche. Such comparisons are definitely not to this musical's advantage.
To its credit this show's criminal renegades are not presented as misunderstood kids, victims of a dream-squelching society. Mr. Jordan's Clyde and Ms. Osnes's Bonnie are, it is made clear, serious egomaniacs, who regularly quarrel (in one of the script's limp running jokes) about who should get top billing in news accounts of their crimes. Like so many young folks today, they just want to be stars.
If only the Bravo network had been around then to meet Bonnie and Clyde's special needs by coming up with a series for them -- ''Real White Trash of West Dallas,'' maybe. Think of all the lives that might have been spared.

HEADLINE: Raids Don't Keep Tunnel City From Humming Underground

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
TIJUANA, Mexico -- Squatting and sweating inside the latest drug tunnel found here in this Pacific border city, it was easy to understand the amazement expressed by Mexican and American officials. This one was a stunner.
The tunnel ran for almost half a mile, with wooden planks holding off the earth on all sides. Energy-saving light bulbs illuminated the route. A motorized cart on metal rails ensured quick passage, while a steel elevator hidden beneath the floor tiles in a warehouse made the 40-foot descent to the tunnel's entrance feel like the slow drop into an unregulated mine shaft.
And yet, here is the simple fact obscured by superlatives like ''the most elaborate'' and ''the most sophisticated,'' which officials seem to lather on each new find. 
Tunnels are Tijuana. They have become an inevitable, always-under-construction or always-operating part of city life, as entrenched as cheap pharmacies and strip clubs.
Residents now shrug them off. ''If you have a lot of money, you can do anything,'' said Blanca Samaniego, 36, as she walked by the warehouse where Mexican officials unveiled the tunnel on Wednesday. ''It will never change. It will never stop.''
The ground beneath her neighborhood in the hills -- near the airport and the upgraded, shimmering border fence patrolled 24/7 by American agents -- has been punched full of holes for years. Almost every kind of building has been used to hide a logistical operation that is as much about the American taste for a high as it is about the low-down removal of dirt.
Just a few weeks ago, below a more rudimentary warehouse nearby, the authorities found a different tunnel with an elaborate ventilation system. A few blocks from that, there sits an empty flophouse, where thick concrete now caps a passageway discovered by the authorities last year. Farther east, residents note a tunnel found in 2008, and just past the next major intersection, there are two more: one under a small home and the other below a bodega across from a factory.
Other tunnels have been found downtown, near the main border crossing. Wherever there is a border fence climbing high, there seems to have been an attempt to burrow below, usually to a parking lot in California where drugs can be hauled through a manhole cover, or to a business that almost looks legitimate.
In the latest case, the tunnel ran to Hernandez Produce Warehouse, a fruit and vegetable company in California whose only product seemed to be green and best when smoked.
Luis Ituarte, 69, an artist who runs a gallery here called La Casa del Tunel -- where a tunnel was found about decade ago -- said that Tijuana officials would be smart to move beyond publicizing their subterranean finds and then shutting them down. He argued that Tijuana should capitalize on its historic identity as a city that has been serving up vice since 1907, when President Porfirio Diaz legalized gambling, or 1920, when the United States made alcohol illegal.
''Las Vegas, Tijuana and Havana were all built by the same kind of people,'' Mr. Ituarte said. ''Only Vegas has taken on its bad reputation.''
Not that this is the direction things are heading. The mayor here recently rejected demands from cultural groups asking to take over La Ocho, a notorious prison that had been decommissioned.
Mexican Army officials, during a tour of this week's elaborate tunnel, mostly focused on the triumph of the discovery.
''These are achievements that increase public security,'' said Gen. Gilberto Landeros, standing at the tunnel entrance as local reporters took snapshots of one another in front of the long, dim hole. ''We're pounding at the economy of narcotrafficking.''
At the very least, he had a lot of marijuana to point to. Hefty bricks of the stuff, wrapped tightly in orange and green plastic, surrounded him when he announced the discovery of the tunnel inside the empty warehouse here in Tijuana. The total haul, from both sides and a truck driven from the site in San Diego, was 32.4 tons, with a street value of about $65 million -- a new record for a tunnel-related seizure, according to American officials.
Harder to see, unmentioned, but easy to imagine: how many tons moved across before that load was found.
The evidence around the tunnel -- worn-out soccer cleats, dusty oscillating fans, empty water bottles -- suggested that the operation had been going for months, a supposition Mexican officials did not deny. At that rate, hundreds of tons of marijuana worth hundreds of millions of dollars would have moved through this one tunnel during its life span.
Most likely somewhere nearby, in another tunnel, the flow continues. The next announcement and news tour may be only weeks away.

HEADLINE: Freight Railroads Avoid Work Stoppage and Agree to More Talks

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's freight railroad industry averted a potentially costly strike on Thursday after resolving differences with two of its unions and agreeing to extend talks with a third. 
The National Railway Labor Conference, which represents the railroads in bargaining talks, said its negotiators would try to reach an agreement with the final union before Feb. 8.
Without the agreements, the railway unions could have begun striking as early as Tuesday, when a federal ''cooling off'' period was set to expire. Retailers warned that a rail strike would cost businesses and consumers $2 billion a day.
The agreements late Thursday with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the American Train Dispatchers Association came just hours after Republican House leaders said they would move to vote Friday on emergency legislation to prevent a work stoppage.
The group of more than 30 railroads, including the Union Pacific Corporation, the CSX Corporation and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, has been trying for more than a year to reach collective bargaining agreements with 13 unions representing about 132,000 workers.
With the help of federal mediators, the railroads have now settled with 12 of the 13 unions in the current bargaining round. The only unsettled union is the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, which has about 25,000 workers.
''Everyone wins when we reach voluntary agreements,'' said Kenneth Gradia, chairman of the National Carriers' Conference Committee, which bargains on behalf of the railroads. ''In a tough economy, these agreements offer a terrific deal for rail employees. They lock in well-above-market wage increases of more than 20 percent over six years, far exceeding recent union settlements in other industries.''

PERSON: Louis Silverstein 

HEADLINE: Louis Silverstein, Who Gave a Bolder and Airier Look to The Times, Dies at 92

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
When The New York Times began publishing on Sept. 18, 1851, it was the New-York Daily Times. -- without a ''The'' but with a period. When the newspaper took its present name six years later, the hyphen stayed (until 1896), and so did the period, until 1967. That was the year that Louis Silverstein, with the nervous approval of his tradition-minded superiors, got rid of it, ending more than a decade of debate.
It was just one among many changes to the newspaper that Mr. Silverstein, who died on Thursday at 92, made as art director, some of them far more consequential than the deletion of a dot.
In 1976, he helped devise a bigger, more visually expansive and, to many, more appealing New York Times (retaining the ''The'' it had since acquired). It was a rethinking of the paper that was as important to its future then as the Internet is today, and one that influenced newspaper design nationwide. 
In a 1984 survey in the magazine Advertising Age, graphics experts ranked The Times as the best-designed paper in the country. Two years later, The Los Angeles Times said Mr. Silverstein had influenced the redesign of newspapers from coast to coast, winning accolades as the ''godfather'' of modern newspaper design. Tom Bodkin, the current art director and an assistant managing editor of The Times, said Mr. Silverstein elevated newspaper design from a trade to a profession.
Mr. Silverstein died of cardiac arrest in a hospital in Brooklyn, his daughter, Anne Silverstein, said. He also lived in Brooklyn.
Mr. Silverstein's original mission at The Times was to help attract a younger, more affluent readership at a time when television and an economic downturn were eroding newspapers' influence and profitability. The Times, Mr. Silverstein understood, had to modernize. ''The Gray Lady,'' as it was unflatteringly called, with its tightly packed columns of dense type relieved only sparingly by a photograph or map, would no longer do.
Arthur Gelb, a former managing editor of The Times, said Mr. Silverstein responded with a vision for opening up the design, making more creative use of typefaces, enlarging photographs, adding explanatory graphics and running fewer stories on a page.
''He wanted the paper to breathe,'' Mr. Gelb said.
Many of Mr. Silverstein's contributions remain evident. He enlarged the typeface to make it more comfortable to read. He engineered the reconfiguration of the front page to six columns from eight in 1976, a change that New York magazine likened to tinkering with the ''Stradivarius of journalism.''
When The Times, under the executive editor A. M. Rosenthal, expanded to four daily sections from two, adding SportsMonday, Science Times, Living, Home and Weekend, Mr. Silverstein envisioned and nurtured their look. Separate sections for metropolitan and business news were also created. ''Every time you pick up the paper, you have in your hands a reflection of Lou's sparkling talent,'' Mr. Rosenthal once said.
Mr. Silverstein was typically brought in to design the front page when a story of historic dimensions came along, like the first man on the moon. The front page was given over entirely to that event, complete with a poem for the occasion by Archibald MacLeish and, at the time, the biggest banner headline in The Times's history: ''Men Walk on Moon.''
Before becoming the paper's design director, Mr. Silverstein was an abstract painter, an art director for advertising agencies and the corporate art director for The New York Times Company. Promoting the paper's classified ads, he dreamed up the well-known slogan ''I got my job through The New York Times.''
He had a fresh, magazinelike sensibility that the publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, hoped to tap when he sent him to the newsroom to challenge traditional newspaper practices.
When Mr. Silverstein was inducted into the Art Directors Hall of Fame in 1984, the designer Massimo Vignelli said, ''By changing The Times and so many newspapers, we are indebted to him for improving the quality of our lives.''
Louis Silverstein was born on Oct. 10, 1919, in Brooklyn, where his parents owned a grocery store. Neighbors admired his chalk drawings on the sidewalk, though a few jaws dropped over his Michelangelo-inspired nudes. He graduated from Boys High School and earned a fine arts degree from Pratt Institute. He went to work in advertising and did graphic design while serving in the Army Air Forces. After World War II he studied at the Institute of Design in Chicago, where he threw himself into avant-garde design.
He worked for labor unions, an ad agency and the State Department, where he was art director for Amerika, a Russian-language magazine distributed in the Soviet Union. He joined The Times in the promotion department in 1952, becoming its director the next year.
Mr. Silverstein made an early foray into newspaper design in 1967, when he effected the first change in The Times's typeface in a quarter-century, shifting from 8-point Ideal to 8 1/2-point Imperial. This was the year he enlarged and sharpened the front page logotype and dropped the period. (Its removal saved the paper $45 a year in ink.)
Mr. Silverstein was named art director for The New York Times Company, the parent corporation, in 1969; the next year he added art direction of the newspaper to his portfolio.
An early assignment was to develop a look for the Op-Ed page, which first appeared in 1970. He came up with an expansive design using a new form of editorial art -- not a standard political cartoon, not an illustration, but rather an artwork that used metaphor, allegory or literary allusion to complement a text.
One example was a monster dinosaur threatening a figure carrying an oil drum, suggesting the revenge of the fossil fuels. Another was of Easter Island-type monoliths with Nixon-like visages. Here the suggestion was that the Watergate scandal would one day seem as remote historically as the South Pacific island sculptures are geographically.
In 1976, Mr. Silverstein huddled with the publisher and the top editors to start two Sunday regional sections, New Jersey and Long Island, hoping to tap an affluent market by offering local news and ads. Westchester and Connecticut followed in 1977.
Then came the new daily sections: SportsMonday, Science Times on Tuesdays, Living on Wednesdays, Home on Thursdays and Weekend on Fridays. Their large illustrations and photos and bold typefaces lent a magazine-style sweep to broadsheet newsprint. Their banners were larger than the New York Times nameplate on the front page.
In 1976, Mr. Silverstein was promoted to assistant managing editor, a position no one from the art department had ever achieved. In 1980, The Times nominated him for a special Pulitzer Prize for his design of the feature sections; it was the first time an art director at the paper was so honored. And in 1988, the Cooper Union in Manhattan had an exhibition of his page designs.
In addition to his daughter, Mr. Silverstein is survived by his wife of 60 years, the former Helen Becker, and two grandsons. His son, Jamie, died in 1972 at 16.
After he retired on Jan. 1, 1985, Mr. Silverstein stayed on as a Times consultant, redesigning 35 of the company's regional newspapers. He also redesigned newspapers in Kenya, Brazil and Spain.
For all his visual innovations, Mr. Silverstein battled stubborn opposition to even the tiniest changes to The Times. Traditionalists complained that the snappy new ''soft news'' sections devoured newsprint that might have been given over to ''hard news.'' They joked that the paper was going to unveil another new section and call it ''News.''
Mr. Silverstein's answer came in the success of the new sections, at a time when The Times was desperate for a turnaround. When the newspaper introduced its first new section, Weekend, on a Friday, it sold 70,000 extra copies.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 3, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
An obituary on Friday about Louis Silverstein, the former art director of The New York Times, misstated the year when his son, Jamie, died, and his son's age at death. Though, as the obituary said, Jamie Silverstein was hit by a car and suffered a severe brain injury in 1964, shortly before his ninth birthday, he died in 1972 at age 16.

He oversaw the look of new daily sections, like Home, and designed the front page after men walked on the moon. It was, at the time, the biggest banner headline in The Times's history.

HEADLINE: Americans Flock to Car Showrooms With Wallets Open

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Auto sales in the United States climbed 14 percent in November as lower gas prices and a wider availability of Japanese models helped the industry achieve its highest selling rate in more than two years, automakers and analysts said Thursday.
With analysts projecting that December will be even better, the industry is closing the year strong despite continued sluggishness in the nation's economy. Consumers and businesses are finding they can no longer put off replacing their vehicles, which are now an average of almost 11 years old, a record. 
Chrysler said sales for all its brands surged 45 percent in the United States compared with November 2010. Sales of its passenger cars more than doubled, and the Chrysler brand, which has been advertising heavily, reported a 92 percent increase. Sales of Jeeps climbed 50 percent for that brand's best November since 2003.
Sales were up 13 percent for the Ford Motor Company. It sold 26 percent more trucks and sport utility vehicles but 9 percent fewer cars. Demand for the Ford Explorer S.U.V. more than tripled.
General Motors said its sales rose 7 percent. Sales of G.M.'s compact and subcompact cars, including the Chevrolet Cruze, were 54 percent higher, and it sold 31 percent more full-size pickup trucks.
''We are seeing a broad spectrum of customers return to the market,'' Don Johnson, G.M.'s vice president of United States sales operations, said in a statement. ''Truck sales showed a very solid increase, as we expected, but the momentum building behind our most fuel-efficient vehicles was even stronger.''
One automaker that did not report a gain was Honda, whose sales fell 6 percent. Honda's operations were the most disrupted by the March earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the company is still working to fully rebuild its inventories. Toyota, which also experienced a sales downturn for much of the year, said it sold 7 percent more cars and trucks in November.
Nissan reported a 19 percent gain, led by higher demand for its Versa and Sentra small cars.
Many consumers who held off buying a new vehicle because of the uncertain economy, or because of inventory shortages that caused prices to jump, are now making a purchase. The result is a ''mini-bubble'' that will end in early 2012, said Edmunds.com, a Web site for automotive information.
The industry's annualized selling rate, seasonally adjusted, climbed in November to 13.63 million vehicles, the highest since the government's cash-for-clunkers program in August 2009. In June, the selling rate was 11.45 million.
Automakers are on track to sell at least 12.7 million vehicles this year, about 10 percent more than last year.
''People are now returning to the marketplace, and that's what's driving the sales increases over the last couple of months,'' said Jeremy Anwyl, the chief executive of Edmunds. ''But the idea that there's a sustained turnaround under way and that this will continue is probably overstating things.''
But Ford executives said they expected the market to keep growing steadily, and they increased fourth-quarter production by 2 percent from the company's previous forecast.
''The industry sales rate has exceeded 13 million in each of the last three months,'' said Ken Czubay, Ford's vice president for United States marketing, sales and service, said in a statement. ''This suggests the current momentum is not an aberration. We believe replacement demand will continue to support stronger levels in 2012.''
November was the best month so far for G.M.'s plug-in hybrid car, the Chevrolet Volt. It sold 1,139 Volts, bringing the year's total to 6,142. G.M. officials acknowledged Thursday for the first time that the company would not achieve its goal of selling 10,000 Volts this year after federal safety regulators said they were opening an investigation into the car's 400-pound lithium-ion battery pack.
G.M. has since sent letters to all Volt owners to reassure them of the car's safety, and it offered to lend anyone who was concerned about the issue a replacement vehicle free. It also has offered to buy back cars from dissatisfied owners.
Sales of the Volt's primary competition, the Nissan Leaf, were 672 in November, for a total of 8,720 this year. Both cars were introduced in late 2010.

HEADLINE: Teacher Evaluations

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Many of us were disappointed to see Michael Winerip give voice only to those opposing Tennessee's new teacher evaluation system (''In Tennessee, Following the Rules for Evaluations Off a Cliff,'' On Education column, Nov. 7). It's not particularly difficult to find excellent educators who support the change. Both the state's teacher and superintendent of the year have provided public testimony. 
Carrying out any new system is a challenge, but it pales in comparison to the challenge created by years of poor academic results. As Tennessee's national ranking continues to slip, poor students are approximately a full grade level behind in math compared with their economically challenged peers in neighboring states.
Tennessee must get serious about developing an educated work force to compete in the global economy. Clinging to the ineffective practices of the past won't help. Bold action is needed, and your readers should have heard from at least one of the many teachers who are up for the challenge.

HEADLINE: Bank Chief Hints Help For Europe Is Possible

BYLINE: By JACK EWING; David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, laid the groundwork for a more aggressive response to the debt crisis Thursday, suggesting that the bank could increase its support for the European economy if political leaders took more radical steps to enforce spending discipline among members.
In the run-up to a meeting of European leaders late next week, Mr. Draghi's remarks seemed to be part of a larger effort by the bank and the region's biggest economic powers -- Germany and France -- to lay the foundation for a broader rescue without seeming to compromise their principles.
Later in the day Thursday, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy -- acknowledging the region's debt crisis -- announced that he and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, would meet in Paris on Monday ''to make French-German propositions to guarantee the future of Europe.'' 
Last weekend, Germany and France began floating a plan to hold member nations of the euro currency union more financially accountable to their fellow members by giving European Union officials the power to vet and approve their national budgets. Euro zone agreement to such a proposal is seen as a possible precondition to increased financing by the central bank, to which Germany and France are the biggest contributors.
Mr. Draghi, in the manner of central bankers, made no explicit promises on Thursday. And the quid pro quo he offered governments was indirect. But his remarks illuminated how the bank might answer increasingly desperate calls for the bank to escalate its intervention in bond markets without violating its own mandate or alienating Germany, where opposition to a central bank bailout of Greece or Italy continues to run deep.
Speaking to the European Parliament in Brussels, Mr. Draghi stopped well short of offering a European version of the sort of large securities purchases that the United States Federal Reserve has used to try stimulating the American economy.
But he seemed to be saying that the bank would use its virtually unlimited resources to keep financial markets at bay, if government leaders in the euro region agreed to do their part by addressing the structural flaws that had allowed the debt problems of Greece to mutate into a threat to the global economy.
''What I believe our economic and monetary union needs is a new fiscal compact,'' Mr. Draghi said. ''It is time to adapt the euro area design with a set of institutions, rules and processes that is commensurate with the requirements of monetary union.''
After government leaders take steps to improve the way the euro area is managed, ''other elements might follow,'' Mr. Draghi said. European leaders will hold a summit meeting on Dec. 9, which is now seen as the latest deadline -- there have been many during the nearly two-year debt struggle -- for stemming the crisis.
Europe appeared to have bought a bit more time on Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve, the central bank and four other national central banks agreed to free up more dollar lending to European banks. But the stock market rally that followed that move did not carry over to Thursday -- although successful government bond auctions in Spain and France did indicate at least a temporary calm in the debt storm.
By insisting that greater action would depend on rules to enforce spending discipline among euro members, Mr. Draghi might at least partly address German concerns that greater central bank action would reward countries that have mismanaged their finances and violate a prohibition against financing governments.
''Mr. Draghi appeared to be holding up the possibility of a greater degree of E.C.B. intervention if euro area governments were to commit, at next week's key E.U. summit, to a tougher set of fiscal rules,'' analysts at Barclays Capital said in a research note.
After insisting for weeks that the central bank is not authorized, under the European Union treaty, to bail out national governments, Mr. Draghi on Thursday hinted at how the treaty mandate might nonetheless let the central bank to do just that. He noted that the mandate required it to ensure price stability ''in either direction.''
Typically, the bank has seen its main job as keeping a lid on inflation. But ''either direction'' might mean that if inflation fell below the central bank's official target of about 2 percent, it would be required to take action to prevent deflation. That would be justification for the central bank to do what so many experts have been urging: buy government bonds on the open market in greater amounts. That would effectively ease the debt crisis for those governments, while also stimulating the euro zone economy by pumping hundreds of billions of euros into it -- printing money, as economists call it.
Although the current annual rate of inflation in the euro zone is 3 percent, Mr. Draghi gave a gloomy assessment of the economy and said inflationary pressures were easing. A survey released by the bank Thursday showed that small- and medium-size business were having increasing trouble obtaining bank loans. ''This autumn, tensions in financial markets have intensified again with very adverse effects on financing conditions and confidence,'' Mr. Draghi said.
To be sure, Mr. Draghi would probably still face an outcry from Germany if the bank appeared to be printing money. Reflecting that country's deep aversion to inflation, Mrs. Merkel and Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank, have rejected any big increase in the central bank's relatively modest purchases of government bonds.
Germans account for just two of the 23 members of the bank's governing council, which makes most decisions by majority vote. But though the Germans could easily be overruled, other members of the council would be taking a huge political risk if they alienated the euro area's largest and richest country.
As a first step, many analysts expect the bank's governing council to cut interest rates when it meets on Dec. 8, the day before the summit meeting. In addition, there is speculation that it may expand its emergency lending to commercial banks, which are having trouble raising money through usual channels. Wednesday's deal with the Fed and other banks to offer more low-cost dollar loans to the central bank should help it lend more liberally to European banks.
Mr. Draghi cautioned that its market interventions were limited and temporary, suggesting that the central bank was unlikely to buy securities on the same scale as the Fed, which since it began its easy-money campaign of so-called quantitative easing following the 2008 financial crisis, has bought up more than $2 trillion in government debt and mortgage-backed securities.
Bond purchases by the central bank, begun in May 2010, so far amount to only about 200 billion euros ($269 billion). Some proponents of greater bond-buying have suggested that the central bank should stand ready to buy as much as 1 trillion euros' worth.
Whether the bank would agree to intervene at anything close to that scale remains to be seen.
But Mr. Draghi made it clear that any action after that would depend on commitments from governments.
''The sequencing matters,'' he said. ''And it is first and foremost important to get a commonly shared fiscal compact right. Confidence works backwards. If there is an anchor in the long term, it is easier to maintain trust in the short term.''

HEADLINE: Leaders in Talks for Special Legislative Session on Budget Woes

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
Facing an increasingly worrisome budget outlook, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders are in negotiations to return to Albany for a special session later this month, an official briefed on the negotiations said on Thursday. 
Lawmakers would return to vote on ways to offset a shortfall caused by lower-than-expected tax collections, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the negotiations were still in the early stages. In mid-November, Mr. Cuomo's budget office projected that the state would be short $350 million during the current fiscal year, which ends March 31.
It was unclear what spending cuts or other measures might be on the table. In the past, the governor has said that he opposes tax increases to balance this year's spending plan, but this week he left open the possibility that his stance could change for future budgets.
The official said that one matter being discussed for consideration in the special session was a package of economic incentives aimed at promoting the creation of new jobs. But the details of what such a package would include had not yet been determined.
If lawmakers return to Albany, they would also most likely take up a compromise measure, which is being hammered out, that would make it legal to hail livery cabs on most New York City streets. They would also consider legislation to provide additional relief for communities that sustained damage from flooding caused by Tropical Storms Irene and Lee.
The official said that the negotiations were being conducted by aides, and have not yet directly involved Governor Cuomo; Dean G. Skelos, the Senate majority leader; and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker.
''These are preliminary discussions in advance of additional revenue numbers coming in next week,'' the official said.
Lawmakers are not currently scheduled to return to Albany until January, when next year's regular legislative session begins.
Mr. Cuomo has said that a special session would be necessary before then if the projected shortfall worsened and if it could not be managed without legislative action. He told reporters on Monday that he did not want to call lawmakers back unless he was able to reach an agreement with legislative leaders ''on what would be a product from a special session.''
''I don't want to call a special session just for the theater of calling a special session,'' he continued. ''It's expensive to bring back the Legislature. It costs taxpayers money. So I don't want to bring them back unless we have an agreed-to agenda and I believe there's at least a likelihood of success.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

'Hugh Jackman: Back on Broadway' This impossibly talented, impossibly energetic actor practices safe sex like nobody else.

'The Mountaintop' Katori Hall's surprisingly thin drama, which won the 2010 Olivier Award, depicts the last night in the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (Samuel L. Jackson) and his encounter with a feisty motel maid (Angela Bassett). Perhaps best regarded as a comfort play, a nursery-room fable for grownups (1:40). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Other Desert Cities' Jon Robin Baitz's family drama is so good that you may not even realize how good it is while you're watching it. Joe Mantello directs a sublime cast that expertly elicits the pain and the comfort of blood ties: Stockard Channing, Rachel Griffiths, Stacy Keach, Judith Light and, starting on Monday, Matthew Risch (2:15). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' The 1994 movie about Australian drag queens in the outback becomes a hyperactively splashy karaoke musical so desperate to show the audience a gaudy good time that the results are mostly enervating. Tony Sheldon brings some warmth as the transsexual Bernadette, but the show is mostly a riot of spangles, sequins and silly costumes (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Private Lives' Richard Eyre's larky (if unnecessary) revival of Noel Coward's comedy of connubial fisticuffs makes a convincing case for both the pliable talents of Kim Cattrall and the bubbly pleasures forever on tap in this play. Paul Gross is excellent as Ms. Cattrall's partner in domestic demolition (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Relatively Speaking' This slight but mostly enjoyable trio of short plays by Ethan Coen, Elaine May and Woody Allen won't do much to burnish their established reputations, but the show is chock full of nifty shtick. Marlo Thomas delights as a pampered princess with a dead husband in Ms. May's contribution (2:15). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Seminar' Alan Rickman is a virtuoso of disdain in Theresa Rebeck's shiny, facile comedy about an ego-shredding writing teacher. Full of efficiently mapped reversals, the play feels as if it were written according to the literary equivalent of a GPS device. Sam Gold directs a bright cast that includes Lily Rabe and Hamish Linklater (1:40). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Sister Act' When the good sisters of the Church of Philly Soul are rocking to raise the gothic rafters, led by the radiant Patina Miller, all is right with this stage adaptation of the hit movie about a club singer hiding out as a nun. Otherwise, this story of a bad girl teaching some good ones how to get down is innocuous but generic musical theater (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' This retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It's just a bore. Recommended for less-than-precocious children with a hundred dollars to burn (2:45). Foxwoods Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (800) 745-3000, spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com. (Brantley)
- 'Venus in Fur' The incandescent Nina Arianda recreates her dazzling turn as an actress auditioning for the role of a 19th-century dominatrix in David Ives's seriously funny sex comedy about power games at an audition. Hugh Dancy holds his own as the writer-director who may be discovering more than he wants to know about the destabilizing nature of desire (1:45). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'War Horse' This imported British weepie, adapted from Michael Morpurgo's children's book about a cavalry horse in World War I, has the most charismatic matinee idol seen in ages: that's Joey, the title character, a puppet brought to life-size life with ineffably theatrical magic (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, (800) 432-7250, lincolncenter.org. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
'Asuncion' Jesse Eisenberg plays a confirmed slacker in a bromance with his former African studies professor (Justin Bartha) in this genial wisp of a comedy written by Mr. Eisenberg (1:40). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, rattlestick.org. (Isherwood)
'The Berenstain Bears Live! In Family Matters, the Musical' The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are now onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children's book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it's rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55). Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 5 West 63rd Street, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com. (Laurel Graeber)
- 'Blood and Gifts' J. T. Rogers's drama gives a remarkably lucid and compelling account of how the American and British view of Afghanistan as a vital front in the cold war shaped the calamitous recent history of the country. Directed with a steady hand by Bartlett Sher and featuring a first-rate cast, including Jefferson Mays as a British agent right out of a Graham Greene novel (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Burning' Thomas Bradshaw's repellent, magnetic play -- about rampaging erotic impulses among untalented show people in New York and neo-Nazis in Berlin -- tramples the lines that divide the good, the bad and the plug ugly in art and in life. Scott Elliott directs a brave if uneven cast in an X-rated production guaranteed to divide audiences (2:45). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Cymbeline' The Fiasco Theater's charming production brings lucidity, credibility and gentle magic to Shakespeare's bulky, convoluted tale of star-crossed lovers and schemers in old Britannia, with a multifarious cast of six on a naked stage. Directed by Noah Brody and Ben Steinfeld (2:40). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'Dancing at Lughnasa' Charlotte Moore's production falls a little short on atmosphere but works where it counts most, in the spirited performances of the five women playing the poor, unmarriageable Mundy sisters in the fictional Donegal town of Ballybeg in late summer 1936. Two decades after it was first seen, this transporting Tony-winning memory play by the Irish dramatist Brian Friel has lost none of its humanity or delicacy (2:05). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Rooney)
'The Devil's Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith' Miche Braden plays the bawdy-talking, hooch-swilling Bessie Smith in this show that mixes Smith's songs with talk about her life, loves and career. That format seems a bit tired, but Ms. Braden gives it her all (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Hand to God' The Devil is a sock puppet in this foul-mouthed, fun-packed play by Robert Askins about the urges that drive good men (and women, and boys) to dirty deeds. Exuberantly performed by a great cast, led by Steven Boyer as a troubled teenager at odds with his id (1:45). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Horsedreams' Dael Orlandersmith's new play about addiction is harrowing, direct and modest (1:20). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Jason Zinoman)
'Rent' Maybe they should call it ''Sublet.'' The young cast members who inhabit this premature revival of Jonathan Larson's watershed rock opera from 1996, directed by Michael Greif, never seem to feel truly at home. It is as if they're reluctant to make this show their own (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Richard II' Sean McNall gives a sharply etched performance as Shakespeare's silver-tongued but lead-footed ruler. But the production falls into its protagonist's woozy rhythms, ruminating when it should be marching forward (2:50). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Eric Grode)
'Silence! The Musical' A silly, coarse musical spin on ''The Silence of the Lambs'' as pitched to obsessive fans (1:30). 9th Space Theater at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, silencethemusical.com. (Zinoman)
'Sistas: The Musical' The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic's good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs. From ''Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do'' to ''Single Ladies,'' you could do a lot worse (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Sleep No More' Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths' career as a movable orgy. The result suggests what might have happened if Stanley Kubrick (of ''The Shining'') had designed the Haunted Mansion at Disney World (2:00).

- 'Sons of the Prophet' Stephen Karam's wonderful new play is a comedy about how we endure the unendurable. Santino Fontana leads a flawless cast in a kaleidoscopic portrait of the woes that befall a family of Lebanese extraction and the people in their orbit. As smart and funny as it is deeply compassionate (1:45). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org.

'Traces' An energizing evening of acrobatics from the Montreal troupe Seven Fingers. Think of it as cirque du cabaret, in which a group of distinctive talents get to show off the physical equivalents of individual song stylings (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Voca People' This show features space aliens, but it's really all about a cappella music. The visitors have crash-landed on Earth in a ship powered by music, and lots of singing must be done to refuel their ship. The eight singers sound pretty good, despite some overamplification. But most of the show consists of fragments of songs, which becomes annoying; only when the cast is allowed to cut loose and deliver an entire song -- the Doors' ''People Are Strange'' is a highlight -- do things reach their full potential (1:30). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Wild Animals You Should Know' This sticky, licorice-black comedy from Thomas Higgins takes a group of Boy Scouts and their chaperones into the woods to lose and possibly find themselves. The sitcom rhythms of this confused production, directed by Trip Cullman, are undercut by its aspirational tug of moral seriousness (1:40).

'Big Apple Circus: Dream Big' This one-ring circus may not offer big cats, but it does have large rodents -- a capybara and an African crested porcupine, no less -- in its new show.

HEADLINE: German Fears About Inflation Stall Bold Steps in Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Norbert Schulze was not yet born when the hyperinflation of the 1920s deeply scarred the German psyche. But he still remembers the Reichsmark notes denominated in millions and billions that years later were tucked into a box with the family's old black-and-white photographs.
Now, Mr. Schulze, a 56-year-old auto mechanic, says runaway inflation looms again, threatening to decimate his savings and turn his carefully planned retirement into abject poverty. It is not so much the ghost of the 1920s that he fears, but the vocal demands around Europe and abroad for a ''big bazooka'' of public money to reassure markets and help European countries in heavy debt.
''I'm worried about my pension and my savings and the problems we're facing right now,'' Mr. Schulze said. 
Many economists say aggressive purchases of the sovereign bonds of heavily indebted states by the European Central Bank are the quickest and surest path to stabilizing the crisis. On Thursday, Mario Draghi, the bank's president, laid the groundwork for bolder intervention in markets if certain conditions were met.
To German ears those bond purchases, or anything that smacks of printing money, sound like a recipe for skyrocketing prices. German leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel and her former economic adviser, Jens Weidmann, now head of the German Bundesbank, have strongly discouraged any such move by the European Central Bank, stalling the rescue of the euro zone in the view of critics.
The prospect of a dim historical memory -- the antique photograph of the wheelbarrow full of nearly worthless bills -- helping to drive the world off the economic precipice and into another deep recession may seem like the height of irrationality and even irresponsibility.
But the German obsession with inflation has been difficult to overcome because Germans perceive themselves as more vulnerable to inflation today than their neighbors are. It is a force they believe could reduce or wipe out the competitive and financial edge they have labored to build.
By robbing a currency of its value, inflation wipes the slate clean for debtors and savers alike. Germans say they like the slate the way it is because they are on the plus side of the ledger.
Consumer debt, whether credit cards or in many cases even home mortgages, is frowned upon here. According to figures of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the German savings rate was more than 10 percent every year between 2003 and 2009, while during the same period it bottomed out at 1.5 percent in the United States, and never rose above 6.2 percent. As a result German households had net savings of $4.3 trillion, according to the Bundesbank, in a country of fewer than 82 million people.
Germans own homes at a lower rate, 41.6 percent, than the 66.3 percent of Americans who do. And most people do not invest in the stock market here.
''For the average American, inflation means the home price is increasing and the value of debt is going down,'' said Peter Bofinger, a prominent economist on Mrs. Merkel's independent council of economic advisers, ''whereas the German invested in life insurance and sitting in an apartment he rented is much more vulnerable to inflation.''
Fear of inflation is a deep and broad consensus in Germany, but one that Sebastian Dullien, an economist and senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said had worsened appreciably in recent years. ''It is not about the 1920s,'' Mr. Dullien said. ''The fear of inflation went up when wages stopped going up.''
In an effort to regain lost competitiveness over the past decade, Germany went through a period of wage restraint and labor-market reforms that made the hiring and firing of workers easier and welfare benefits less generous. While countries on Europe's southern edge, including Greece and Portugal, were enjoying the cheap money that came with membership in the euro, Germans were developing a newfound sense of economic insecurity, one that paired all too effectively with an old dread.
That has real policy consequences. Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, has argued that the euro zone needs higher inflation of between 4 percent and 6 percent, well above the European Central Bank's fixed target of 2 percent. ''German leaders have told me they have a lot of leeway in a lot of dimensions, but the hot-button issue they cannot touch is inflation,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''Inflation is poison to them.''
German magazines and newspapers regularly go to press with covers featuring euro coins and bills that are melting or in flames. This week's Spiegel magazine shows a one-euro coin cracked in two halves under dark storm clouds with the words ''And now?'' Its competitor, the magazine Focus, has a 13-page feature on rising prices since the euro currency was introduced to consumers a decade ago.
''If I believed everything I read I would have to take a rope and hang myself,'' said Helga Matthes, 59, a retired Lufthansa flight attendant. ''My 85-year-old mother reads the newspaper every morning and has pains in her stomach. She tells me, 'We're going to lose everything again.' ''
Woven together with historical memories and the German obsession with stability and safety, the mental block on inflation can be hard to slip. In the collective consciousness, hyperinflation stands as an important milepost in the slide to total catastrophe culminating with the total defeat of the Nazis in 1945.
But Adolf Hitler came to power in the wake of deflation, not inflation. The German economy shrank 7.7 percent in 1931 and 7.5 percent in 1932 under the watch of Heinrich Bruning, known as the hunger chancellor, who enacted harsh austerity measures that deepened the depression.
Economists who favor stimulus policies, and in particular action by the European Central Bank, say the German focus on inflation is woefully misplaced during a time of little or no growth and severe market turmoil. They say there are too many similarities between the cuts made by Mr. Bruning and those Mrs. Merkel has demanded of euro zone partners.
''There are historic parallels between deflation and the 1930s and what's going on today, none with hyperinflation,'' said Fabian Lindner, an economist at the Macroeconomic Policy Institute in Dusseldorf. Mr. Lindner pointed out that it was the middle class, with carefully gathered nest eggs to lose, more than the working class that lost out in the hyperinflation, searing the memory in the minds of an entire generation of teachers, academics and journalists who in turn would pass it on.
Under Hitler, the Nazi rearmament and jobs programs, including highway construction, quickly led to full employment. A second period of significant inflation was covered up by rationing and price controls until after the war, when the Reichsmark was exchanged for the Deutsche mark at roughly 10 to 1 in 1948, the second time savings were wiped out in a quarter century.
''Inflation, you see it, you almost smell it,'' said Tobias Straumann, an economic historian at the University of Zurich. ''People don't understand that deflation is monetary stuff. They think it's bad luck, a development that can't be explained.''
As the current crisis has deepened and the reality has begun to hit home that a breakup of the euro is a possibility, the German news media have begun to confront the considerable costs, and risks, that would come with a breakup of the currency union, raising hopes that a solution is within reach.
Mr. Schulze, who after his heart attack sold the family auto-repair business where he now works as an employee, said that for all his concerns about inflation, ''There is no other way other than to try to rescue the euro. Whether or not it works. ...'' he said, his words trailing off, the sentence unfinished.

HEADLINE: For Jobless, Little Hope Of Restoring Better Days

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
People across the working spectrum suffered job losses in recent years: bricklayers and bookkeepers as well as workers in manufacturing and marketing.
But only a select few workers have fully regained their footing during the slow recovery.
Katie O'Brien Mowery is one of the lucky ones. After losing her job in the marketing department of a luxury resort in Santa Barbara, Calif., in early 2010, she eventually found a position with better benefits and the promise of a brighter future.
''I wished that it happened sooner than it did,'' said Ms. Mowery, who is in her mid-30s, referring to her nearly yearlong job search. ''But looking back, my new position wouldn't have been available when I was laid off, and now I'm very happy.''
Even though the Labor Department is expected to report on Friday that employers added more than 100,000 jobs in November, a new study shows just how rare people like Ms. Mowery are. According to the study, to be released Friday by the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers, just 7 percent of those who lost jobs after the financial crisis have returned to or exceeded their previous financial position and maintained their lifestyles. 
The vast majority say they have diminished lifestyles, and about 15 percent say the reduction in their incomes has been drastic and will probably be permanent.
Bill Loftis is one of the unfortunate ones. He is without a college degree or specialized skills and also worked in an industry, manufacturing, that has added back only about 13 percent of the jobs that it lost during the recession.
After 22 years on the job, Mr. Loftis, 44, was laid off from a company that produces air filters and valves in Sterling Heights, Mich., three years ago. Managers ''looked me dead in the eye,'' he recalled, ''and said, 'We're laying you off, but don't worry, we're calling you back.' ''
He has heard nothing since. Despite applying for more than 100 jobs, he has been unable to find work. He has drained most of his 401(k) retirement fund, amassed credit card debt, and is about to sell his car, a 2006 Dodge Charger. ''It's looking hopeless,'' he said.
According to the Rutgers study, those with less education were the most ravaged by job loss during the recession. Even among those who found work, many made much less than before the downturn.
''The news is strikingly bad,'' said Cliff Zukin, a professor of public policy and political science at Rutgers who compiled the study, which was based on surveys of a random sample of Americans who were unemployed at some point from August 2008 to August 2009. The numbers represent ''a tremendous impression of dislocation and pain and wasted talent,'' he said.
More than two years after the recovery officially began, American employers have reinstated less than a quarter of the jobs lost during the downturn, according to Labor Department figures. Of the 13.1 million people still searching for work, more than 42 percent have been unemployed for six months or longer. About 8.9 million more are working part time because they cannot find full-time work.
While health care and some energy-related jobs have boomed throughout in recent years, the other winners have mostly been in skilled professions like computer systems design, management consulting and accounting, where employers have added back as many or more jobs than were cut during the downturn.
Companies like Ernst & Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offer accounting and other business advisory services, as well as management consulting firms like Bain & Company, have returned to peak hiring levels. Many Silicon Valley firms are aggressively recruiting. Google, for example, announced that it has hired more people in 2011 than in any previous year.
Other employers are adding back jobs that were cut, though not yet enough to reach prerecession peaks. What is more, these jobs are in areas like retail, hospitality and home health care, categories that pay low wages and are unlikely to give workers much economic security.
The sectors that have been slowest to recover are those that endured the most acute job losses, like construction and state and local government. Construction workers are among the biggest sufferers, stung by a housing collapse that led to the loss of two million jobs. Since the recovery began, the industry has added just 47,000 jobs.
Even manufacturing, which has shown a relatively healthy pace of job creation during the recovery, has added just over a tenth of the 2.3 million jobs that disappeared in the downturn.
''This recovery is really not a fair and balanced recovery,'' said Scot Melland, chief executive of Dice Holdings, an online job search service. ''There are certain sectors that have done well, and others that haven't done well at all. If you're in one of the losing sectors, it's very tough.''
Based on previous recessions, employers would have been expected to fill more jobs at this point in the recovery. But the kinds of jobs that typically return first have lagged this time around. ''Construction is usually one of the earlier sectors to come back,'' said Harry J. Holzer, an economist at Georgetown University and the Urban Institute.
Because she had a college degree, it never occurred to Ms. Mowery that she would not eventually find a job. While collecting unemployment benefits, she tapped her network of friends and sought out the services of a unit of Randstad Holdings, a job placement firm. To brush up on her skills, she took online tutorials in software programs like Photoshop and InDesign.
When she landed a new marketing job last December at a company that resells networking equipment, she started at the same salary she had earned before, but with improved health and retirement benefits and more opportunities for promotion.
''I didn't want to just take a job, but make a career move,'' she said. ''I was pretty confident. Things have a way of working out.''
Others are more desperate. Some of them are sending out scattershot applications for jobs for which they are overqualified. Jaison Abel, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said there was ''some evidence that people who, in a different time, would have been entering the work force in midskilled jobs are now entering into the lower-skilled jobs.''
Some are trying for slots even if they do not meet basic qualifications. PricewaterhouseCoopers received more than 250,000 applications through its Web site over the last year, but it has hired only 1 percent from that pool, said Holly Paul, its United States recruiting leader. She said a house painter with no qualifications beyond high school had applied for 10 different openings that required college degrees and accounting certification.
''It's definitely an eye-opener for me because it gives you an idea of what unfortunately is happening in the economy,'' said Ms. Paul.
Even many of those who have managed to find a job are struggling to restore financial stability. ''They have had to take pay cuts or benefit cuts or maybe they don't get any vacation,'' said David Elliot, communications director for USAction, a coalition of grass-roots groups that will release a report on Friday about the experiences of unemployed and underemployed workers.
Mr. Loftis stays at his home in Michigan with his 4-year-old twins and looks for ways to shave costs. He and his wife, who has returned to work in a $10-an-hour factory job, canceled their cable service and no longer travel to see her family in the Philippines or relatives in Florida or Tennessee.
As he continues to apply for work, Mr. Loftis said employers have told him he has been out of a job for too long. ''It's just hard,'' he said. ''What can you do to get back on track, you know?''

BEARING FRUIT Financial regulators have long relied on outsiders to generate tips about potential fraud at hedge funds. Now, the Securities and Exchange Commission is ferreting out wrongdoing in a new way.
A new ''analytics'' division of the S.E.C., tasked with mining hedge fund data, announced actions on Thursday against six individuals and three hedge fund firms for alleged fraud. ''We're using risk analytics and unconventional methods to help achieve the holy grail of securities law enforcement -- earlier detection and prevention,'' said Robert Khuzami, above, director of the S.E.C.'s Division of Enforcement.

HEADLINE: West Tightens Iran Sanctions After Embassy Attack

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE and NICHOLAS KULISH; Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London, Stephen Castle from Brussels and Artin Afkhami from Boston.

 BODY:
Galvanized by the pillaging of Britain's Embassy in Tehran, Western nations moved Thursday to significantly tighten sanctions against Iran over its suspect nuclear program, with the European Union expanding an Iranian blacklist and the United States Senate passing a measure that could severely disrupt Iran's oil income.
The European Union added 180 names to a roster of Iranian officials and companies whose assets have been frozen and are banned from travel to member states. While that action fell short of demands by Britain and France for an embargo on oil purchases from Iran, one of the world's leading producers, ministers meeting in Brussels said they would consider such a restriction in coming weeks. 
The possibility of a more onerous measure confronted Iran in Washington, where senators voted, 100 to 0, to penalize any foreign bank that does business with Iran's Central Bank, the conduit for Iran's receipts from oil sales.
The provision, an amendment to a defense authorization bill, is designed to dissuade foreign customers of Iran's oil for fear of losing access to the United States market.
Whether the provision becomes part of the final bill depends on whether it survives a House-Senate conference that will be needed to reconcile their different versions of the overall defense bill.
The support for the amendment came despite pleas for restraint by Obama administration officials, who said the recently strengthened regimen of sanctions against Iran was working. They also said any step that disrupted oil sales could alienate American allies and have the unintended consequence of sharply raising world oil prices, aggravating the economic struggles in the United States and Europe.
David S. Cohen, the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, told lawmakers in Washington that any new sanctions that affected the Iranian Central Bank must be done in concert with other countries ''to ensure that we deliver strong and well-targeted pressure on Iran.''
He also said the accumulated effects of sanctions had disrupted Iranian banks and their access to international financing, ''impeding their ability to facilitate Iran's illicit activities and creating unprecedented financial and commercial isolation for Iran.''
Meanwhile, new details emerged regarding the scale of destruction at the British Embassy and a British diplomatic residence in Tehran on Tuesday by Iranian protesters, apparently aligned with the government-controlled Basij militia, angry over the West's economic sanctions.
Reuters reported from Tehran that Western diplomats who had toured the British outposts 24 hours after the assault reported ''devastating'' damage and said the ambassador's residence had been ''systematically destroyed.''
Britain's government withdrew its diplomats from Iran on Wednesday, ordered Iran to close its embassy in London and gave Iranian diplomats a 48-hour deadline to leave Britain, officially downgrading relations with Iran to the lowest possible, short of a formal break.
British leaders also accused Iran's Islamic hierarchy of approving the assault, which evoked images of the Iranian takeover of the American Embassy there more than 30 years ago. At least four other European countries have closed their Tehran embassies since Tuesday as a precaution.
According to a statement released by the Council of the European Union, the foreign ministers meeting in Brussels said the tightened sanctions ''target entities and individuals directly involved in Iran's nuclear activities, which are in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.''
The statement also said the ministers would look at additional ways in coming weeks to broaden sanctions aimed at Iran's financial system, transportation and energy sectors and the Revolutionary Guard, a segment of the Iran armed forces that Western nations suspect oversees a clandestine nuclear weapons program.
The group of foreign ministers also condemned the attack on the British Embassy and residence in Tehran, saying that the council ''considers these actions taken against the U.K. as actions against the European Union as a whole. The E.U. is taking appropriate measures in response.''
Iran has insisted its nuclear energy program is peaceful and has denounced a report issued last month by the International Atomic Energy Agency that said Iran might be working on a nuclear weapon and missile delivery system. It says the report is a pretext for a pre-emptive military strike on its nuclear facilities by the United States or Israel.
The report by the atomic energy agency, a monitoring arm of the United Nations, became the basis for a new round of sanctions against Iran announced Nov. 21 by Britain, the United States, Canada and a few days later by the European Union.
Israel has sent mixed signals about its intentions regarding Iran's nuclear program. Speaking to Israel Radio on Thursday, Defense Minister Ehud Barak said: ''We have no intention, at the moment, of taking action, but the state of Israel is far from being paralyzed by fear. It must act calmly and quietly -- we don't need big wars.''
In Germany, law enforcement officials said Thursday that they were investigating possible plans for Iranian attacks on American military installations in the event of an attack against Iran.
''We have begun investigative proceedings and are taking operational measures,'' Harald Range, the federal prosecutor general, said in Karlsruhe, according to the DPA news service.
In Iran, where leaders have portrayed the embassy attackers as justifiably motivated by British arrogance, the semiofficial Fars news agency said 11 students detained for storming the buildings had been released.
The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the Iranian judiciary chief, Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, as saying the West's imposition of sanctions reflected ''their policy of intimidation.''

HEADLINE: Reuniting Lincoln and Luxury

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DEARBORN, Mich. -- Every successful luxury car needs an identity for which consumers will pay a premium. Mercedes has its classic looks. Lexus epitomizes creature comforts. For BMW, performance is important.
The Lincoln division of the Ford Motor Company? If nothing particular comes to mind, you are not alone.
But Ford is hoping it soon will be high-tech features married with elegant designs masterminded by a 39-year-old Australian hired away last year from Cadillac.
''When do you ever get an opportunity like this?'' the designer, Max Wolff, said in an interview. ''Our goal is to make Lincoln look like nothing else that's out there.'' 
Mr. Wolff has been given a free hand to revamp Lincoln, starting with a new version of its midsize MKZ sedan to be revealed at the Detroit auto show in January. Viewed recently at the company's design studio, the car has a sleek, tapered silhouette, a retractable glass roof and a center console that rises like a ramp off the floor directly into the instrument panel. Even the traditional vertical lines of the grille have been turned horizontally.
''He is pushing them in a totally different direction,'' said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with the research firm IHS Automotive, who got a sneak preview. ''I almost fell over when I saw it.''
Detroit's comeback so far has been built on shifting from big trucks and S.U.V.'s to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. But to cement the turnaround, the American automakers need the profit margins and prestige that higher-priced luxury models can generate.
General Motors is investing heavily in its Cadillac division, and last month unveiled a new flagship sedan, the XTS, at the Los Angeles auto show. Chrysler is not known for upscale products, but has had some success in promoting its 300 model as a quasi-luxury car that is more affordable than European competitors.
Lincoln, however, has been stuck in the unenviable spot of catering to older, less affluent consumers with a lineup of vehicles derived from its mainstream Ford models. The must-have value? Not much, except possibly for die-hard fans of the roomy interiors and flashy chrome of its discontinued Town Cars and Continentals, best known for limo rides to the airport. Lincoln's glory days date back 20 years.
''They have a long way to go from a perception standpoint,'' Ms. Lindland said. ''Ford needs Lincoln so that the Ford buyer has a luxury alternative when they want to move up.''
Analysts like Ms. Lindland say remaking Lincoln is crucial to Ford's reputation and financial results in the future, but its 77,000 sales in the United States so far this year place it a distant eighth among luxury divisions. Lincoln trails perennial leaders like BMW and Mercedes, but also Honda's Acura brand and Nissan's Infiniti models. While Lincoln accounts for 4 percent of the cars that Ford sold in the United States this year; Cadillac is about 6 percent for G.M.; Honda's Acura brand is 10 percent, and Toyota's Lexus division is 12 percent.
Since Alan R. Mulally took over as chief executive in 2006, Ford has sold off its foreign luxury brands -- Jaguar, Land Rover, Volvo -- and concentrated on improving the quality and appearance of its core lineup of Ford cars, S.U.V.'s and pickups.
That strategy has paid off with steadily improving profits and sales. The next step in Ford's turnaround is injecting some sizzle into Lincoln. ''We need the same type of focus, commitment and capital resources we brought to the Ford brand,'' Derrick Kuzak, Ford's global product chief, said in an interview.
The company plans to introduce seven new or upgraded Lincoln models over the next four years. The first of those were on display at the Los Angeles show, when the full-size MKS sedan and MKT crossover were unveiled with new front ends, slicker interiors and suspension systems that automatically adjust for different driving conditions.
But bigger changes are yet to come, primarily from the design studio headed by Mr. Wolff, Lincoln's design director.
Mr. Wolff's design team has already toned down some signature features of past models -- the boxy dimensions and gaudy grilles, for example -- in the refreshed Lincolns that go on sale next year. But there is more work to do, he said.
The look of one competitor, Cadillac, has changed radically in recent years. The brand's sharp creases and angular dimensions are polarizing to some consumers, but the edgy designs have helped Cadillac stand out from the rest of the luxury crowd. Ford is seeking a softer, more sumptuous design for its Lincolns that grabs similar attention.
The MKZ reflects the direction Lincoln is heading.
As he showed off the car in the studio, Mr. Wolff homed in on its aesthetic touches: scooped-out door handles, tail lamps that extend the width of the car and unusual side mirrors set on flat pedestals. ''They're meant to be like beautiful little pieces of sculpture,'' he said. ''We want customers who appreciate that unexpected attention to detail.''
Mr. Kuzak said the mechanics of the new Lincolns were aimed toward the ''progressive luxury customer.'' Fuel economy, he said, will be critical, along with better handling, braking and all-wheel-drive and hybrid options.
The changes are, in fact, long overdue. Lincoln's typical buyer is 65 years old, compared with the industry's luxury car average of 53. And the competition is getting more fierce in the segment, where entry-level models cost upward of $40,000 and consumers expect distinctive style and the latest technology.
Lincoln's vehicles are priced somewhat lower than those of its chief foreign rivals. The MKS sedan, for example, costs about $42,000, compared with $50,000 for a Mercedes E-class or $47,000 for a Lexus GS. But those competitors are rear-wheel-drive models traditionally favored by luxury buyers as opposed to the front-wheel-driven MKS, and carry a cachet that Lincoln can't match yet.
Younger buyers do not consider Lincolns to be cutting edge, said Randall Rosales, a 22-year-old law student in Orlando, Fla., who recently bought a used Infiniti. ''Even my mom thinks Lincoln is a little boring,'' he said.
And even older consumers often view Lincoln as a less expensive alternative to the latest European models. ''A BMW or Mercedes may have more prestige, but there is a lot of value in this car,'' said Gary Burkhart, a 68-year-old investment adviser in Birmingham, Mich., who just leased a Lincoln MKZ.
Changing those perceptions will take time, Ford executives say. But after watching Lincoln stagnate while competitors like Audi and Cadillac gain market share, Ford can't afford to wait.
''We had to take the next step and make the big investment in people and dollars,'' Mr. Kuzak said. ''We need to provide something totally different to get today's luxury buyer.''

HEADLINE: Exam Cheating On Long Island Hardly a Secret

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON and PETER APPLEBOME; Reporting was contributed by Robbie Brown from Atlanta, and Marcelle Fischler, Anna M. Phillips and Noah Rosenberg from Great Neck.

 BODY:
GREAT NECK, N.Y. -- The suspected test takers came from prominent, respected families, some of them in financial distress -- among the five facing felony charges were the sons of a well-known lawyer, the president of the local library board and a wealthy philanthropic family.
The youths who are accused of paying them as much as $3,600 to take SAT and ACT tests were largely undistinguished students willing to cut corners to strengthen their modest resumes.
The combination yielded one of the most conspicuous cheating scandals in memory, a telling reflection on the college admissions rat race -- and, perhaps, contemporary ethics more broadly. According to prosecutors, principals, parents and teenagers here on Long Island's Gold Coast, it was common knowledge at some of the nation's most prestigious high schools that if you had the money, you could find someone with a sharper vocabulary and a surer grasp of geometry to fill in the blanks for you. 
One 2011 graduate of Great Neck North, the center of the scandal, matter-of-factly acknowledged having asked his parents whether they would pay to hire an SAT stand-in. ''They said, 'No way,' '' he recalled one recent afternoon.
People briefed on the investigation said that Samuel Eshaghoff, a 2010 Great Neck North graduate, scored in the 2,100 range (out of 2,400) on his own SATs; he is accused of taking tests for at least 15 people over three years, and the people briefed on the inquiry said he obtained scores for them between 2,170 and 2,220 on the SAT and as high as 33 out of 36 on the ACT.
He was proficient at making fake identification cards, they said, and allowed clients to pay in installments and based on what they could afford.
That two of the people for whom he is accused of taking the tests after showing a fake ID were girls only raises further concerns about testing security.
Mr. Eshaghoff, 19, has pleaded not guilty to the charges of scheming to defraud, criminal impersonation and falsifying business records. Soon after his Sept. 27 arrest on Long Island, Mr. Eshaghoff was arrested in Arizona, and accused of possession and use of drug paraphernalia and having a fake ID, according to the Maricopa County sheriff's office, though charges were never filed.
In a brief interview this week at Emory University, where he is a sophomore economics major, Mr. Eshaghoff said he had flown home three times to deal with the charges, and was now cramming for exams -- his own. ''I'm trying to focus on school,'' he said. ''I'm missing classes. That's obviously tough.''
In Great Neck, a place where the high-achieving schools are the center of public life, and where high-priced tutors and admissions consultants are routine advantages for the wealthy, educators and parents are mortified that the community's reputation could be muddied by the SAT scandal. But while it is clear that only a tiny proportion of students at the schools cheated, the scheme came to light only because it was widespread and well known enough that officials at North got wind of it.
''It's almost like drugs,'' said Jill Madenberg, a former guidance counselor at nearby New Hyde Park High School, and now an independent college consultant in Great Neck. ''You know it's out there, but do I want to do it?''
So far, 20 teenagers at five schools in Nassau County -- Great Neck North, Great Neck South, Roslyn High School, the North Shore Hebrew Academy and St. Mary's High School in Manhasset -- have been arrested: the five suspected of taking the tests were charged with felonies, while the 15 accused of paying them $500 to $3,600 to do so face misdemeanor charges.
Kathleen M. Rice, the Nassau County district attorney, said that she had evidence against 20 others, but that they could not be pursued because of the two-year statute of limitations regarding misdemeanors, or the absence of testing records.
Of course, cheating on the SAT did not begin last year and is not limited to the North Shore of Long Island. One parent in Roslyn confided that back in the 1960s, his brother took the test for at least two friends, charging $25 and guaranteeing a 1,200 out of 1,600. According to the Educational Testing Service, which administers the exam for the College Board, about 3,000 scores are canceled each year because of suspected cheating, 150 involving impersonation.
But the current scandal is remarkable for the prominence of the community, the commitment of the prosecutors and the decision of the principal who went public despite the risks it posed to his school's carefully cultivated reputation.
Great Neck, the setting for ''The Great Gatsby,'' has long defined a certain slice of affluent, education-obsessed suburbia. Recently, it has attracted many Asian-Americans and wealthy Iranian Jews.
Even in today's hard times, a Porsche Panamera 4-S and Mercedes, Range Rovers and Audis mingled with more plebeian vehicles in the parking lot of Great Neck North.
Bernard Kaplan, the school's principal, said it was ''on par with any private school in the country.'' Seniors who earn A's and B's get a personal note from him: there are 146 of them stacked on his desk.
When he came to the school in 1993, Mr. Kaplan said, students typically took one Advanced Placement course -- now it is often five or six. With that increased intensity has come pressure to cheat -- and technologies making it easier to do so. Bringing that to light, he said, has been positive, if painful.
''The right things were done, and people had to pay the consequences,'' he said.
Mr. Eshaghoff, whose mother is a lawyer and president of the Great Neck Library Board, became known around Great Neck North for having done well on the SAT and being willing to cheat on that exam as well as school tests -- for a price, students and people involved in the investigation said. Prosecutors said he even flew home from college last year to take the SAT for two students in one weekend, exploiting the Sunday proctoring usually reserved for students with religious conflicts.
While prosecutors say they do not believe that Mr. Eshaghoff was running a ring of test-takers, one person briefed on the investigation said that for a fee, he showed at least one other test-taker at another school how to make fake IDs.
Joshua Chefec, a 2009 graduate of Great Neck North who is now a senior studying business at Tulane University in New Orleans, was apparently a more reluctant SAT impersonator. In 2008, said two people briefed on the investigation, Mr. Chefec, a smart and serious student whose parents were divorcing, was offered cash to take the test by a more popular student. Eager to impress, and perhaps get closer to the other student's friends, he agreed, officials said; later, he scored a 31 on the ACT under the same student's name.
Mr. Chefec has also pleaded not guilty, and his lawyer, Brian Griffin, said the case should have been handled by the schools, not the courts. ''Using pretrial publicity to try and wake up the College Board on the backs of these children is wrong,'' he said.
But Ms. Rice, the district attorney, said, ''We have to put accountability into the system, and there is none right now.''
''If we can't teach 16-, 17- and 18-year-olds that cheating is wrong,'' she added, ''shame on us.''
The others accused of test-taking for money, who have also pleaded not guilty, are Adam Justin, whose father, David, is a former president of a local synagogue and part of a prominent real estate family; George Trane, a Great Neck South graduate who now attends SUNY College at Stony Brook; and Michael Pomerantz, who went to Great Neck North but never graduated.
Ms. Rice said there was no evidence showing parents were aware of the scheme. But Alan Gensler, a parent of a Roslyn High School junior, said he could not ''imagine that my child would be able to do that and come up with $1,000 or $2,000 and me not know about it.''
The scheme began to fall apart in late 2010, according to a person briefed on the investigation, after a student confided to a college counselor at Great Neck North that someone was accepting money to take the SAT for other students.
The guidance department and the principal compared SAT scores with student grade-point averages, prosecutors said. Where SAT scores seemed high, they looked at where the tests had been taken and found that some of the widest discrepancies were with those who had opted to take the test off-site, where they would not be recognized. School officials at some point contacted E.T.S., which conducted a handwriting analysis.
The analysis determined in April 2011 that one person had taken multiple tests.
Throughout the spring, according to people involved in the case, a group of Great Neck North students faced hearings with the schools superintendent.
Several people said the students were told that if they admitted having paid others to take exams on their behalf, the matter would stay in the school. When asked about this, however, Mr. Kaplan adamantly said: ''We didn't make any such promise. We have a moral and legal obligation to report any criminal activity beyond the scope of the school to the proper authorities.''
In any case, according to people briefed on the investigation, those who confessed were suspended, forced to retake the SAT, forbidden from attending prom and required to do community service.
Then school officials alerted the authorities, who followed the trail to the other Long Island schools, and had the authority to punish those, like Mr. Eshaghoff, who had already graduated.
Mr. Eshaghoff spent freshman year at the University of Michigan, but transferred -- for financial reasons, he said in an interview on Tuesday. ''It was an expensive school,'' he said. ''Emory was better with financial aid.''
He lives on campus in the Phi Delta Theta house, in a cluttered room with a bunk bed, a wooden desk, and posters of musicians including Bob Marley. He said he planned to pledge the fraternity next semester.
The day before Thanksgiving, Mr. Eshaghoff, whose parents are also divorced, was spotted outside Great Neck North, his alma mater, with his father and a television news crew that was filming him.
Officials involved in the investigation said they would not seek jail time for any of those arrested, including Mr. Eshaghoff. Community service is a more likely outcome -- perhaps tutoring poor students for the SAT.

HEADLINE: In Apartment Hunt, Looking Isn't Free

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.; sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
When Divanny Lamas decided to move to San Francisco from Silicon Valley, she knew the hunt for an apartment would be competitive -- but it was far worse than she imagined.
At a ''nice'' $3,500-per-month loft in the Mission, ''80 people showed up for the open house,'' said Ms. Lamas, 23, who recently began working at a tech company in SoMa. ''And the landlord said to me that he'd gotten 250 applications.''
The cost of applying was $40, so if the landlord wasn't exaggerating, he grossed $10,000 in application fees. 
Call it a deposit with no return.
Two years ago, during the recession, landlords had to lure applicants with deals, like a free month's rent. Today fees just to apply have become part of the city's overheated rental climate, where dubious behavior -- by both landlords and renters -- appears to be increasing.
Ms. Lamas searched hundreds of vacancy listings and ultimately visited 20 apartments, many charging an application fee. After four months, she finally secured a $2,500-per-month, 600-square-foot, one-bedroom in the Mission.
''Everything was overpriced,'' she said.
In a city with a chronic housing shortage, a confluence of recent trends has created one of the tightest rental markets in years. The vacancy rate is just 3.7 percent, and the average rent has skyrocketed to $2,572.
Experts cite various factors: a population increase of nearly 30,000 since 2000; an influx of affluent tech workers; traditional buyers becoming renters due to housing prices and financing uncertainties; and a surge in apartments converted into vacation rentals to skirt rent control laws.
Andrew Poon, 30, said that 15 out of 20 apartments he visited during his apartment hunt this summer charged application fees. ''Some of them required a fee outright and charged it immediately,'' he said. Others asked for a fee only if he became a finalist.
Determining the exact prevalence of application fees is difficult, since few landlords and brokers are transparent about the charges in their advertising.
A Bay Citizen analysis of recent listings on Craigslist -- the city's leading rental listing resource -- showed that only 4 percent of apartment rental ads (80 of 2,053) disclosed a fee and the amount required. Charges ranged from $20 to $45, averaging $32. (The analysis was conducted Nov. 9 of listings from Nov. 2 to 9.)
Only 3 of 2,053 listings specifically stated there was no application fee.
Janan New, director of the San Francisco Apartment Association, a group representing landlords, said landlords were allowed to charge fees to cover processing costs and for credit and background checks. When asked about charging fees to dozens or hundreds of applicants when only a few would be genuine finalists, Ms. New said, ''We discourage that.''
The competition for apartments has also led to bid-up prices. Mr. Poon eventually rented a 600-square-foot, one-bedroom near Duboce Triangle after offering $100 over the original $1,750-per-month price. ''There were 40 applicants,'' he said.
But as landlords push for more, some renters are pushing back.
Marc Levinson, a Realtor in the city since 1991, said that in recent weeks some frustrated renters had apparently figured out how to remove listings after reading them on Craigslist by misusing the Web site's system for deleting inappropriate content. Presumably, their goal is to prevent others from seeing the ads -- and to reduce potential competition.
''There's so much anger at the rental market,'' Mr. Levinson said.
To thwart this tactic, Mr. Levinson's listings now instruct applicants to call for open-house details. On Monday, a listing he placed at 9:20 a.m. had generated 40 calls in two hours.
Mr. Levinson expressed concern about the explosion in application fees, and said landlords and brokers should charge only finalists -- and limit the fee to the actual cost of a professional credit report, about $20. Applicants should ask for copies of their reports, he said, to be sure they had not been exploited.
For those who feel cheated it is unclear what steps to take. The city's Rent Board, which otherwise vigorously defends tenants' rights, has no jurisdiction and could not recommend a course of action.
Scott Wiener, a city supervisor who serves on the Land Use and Economic Development Committee, which oversees housing matters, agreed that application fees should be charged only to finalists.
Mr. Wiener said the fees were symptomatic of a larger issue: a dearth of affordable housing to meet growing demand.
''We have a very, very tiny amount of land,'' he said, ''and it's the best city on the planet.''
Indeed, despite the frustrations and expense, those who have prevailed in the latest rental machinations feel victorious.
''Ultimately,'' Ms. Lamas said, ''it was all worth it.''

HEADLINE: Factories Are Busier, But Hiring Is Lagging

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- New economic data released on Thursday showed that factory output grew last month at the fastest rate since June, construction spending increased for a third consecutive month, and retail and auto sales rose in November. 
But the number of people applying for unemployment benefits is still too high to signal strong hiring.
The reports offered a mixed picture for the economy a day before the government reports on November job growth. And manufacturers could face strains overseas in important export markets, especially if Europe's debt crisis worsens and leads the Continent into another recession.
For now, manufacturing is growing. The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, said Thursday that its manufacturing index rose to 52.7 in November, from 50.8 in October. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion. Factory output has grown for the last 28 months.
Bradley J. Holcomb, chairman of the institute's survey committee, said manufacturers were ''cautiously more optimistic about the next few months based on lower raw materials pricing and favorable levels of new orders.''
Still, companies have tempered their outlook with concerns about future economic growth, government regulation and the debt crisis in Europe, he added.
New orders rose to a seven-month high and production increased, according to separate indexes in the report.
Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, said the gains suggested that factory output would expand at an even faster rate next month.
''The economy seems finally to be developing real momentum; growth is accelerating,'' he said in a note to clients.
But a measure of factory employment fell. The drop indicates manufacturers are still hiring, but at a slower pace than the month before.
''Manufacturers are trying to meet demand without significantly increasing their work force,'' said Ryan Wang, an economist at HSBC Securities.
Workers in the United States increased their productivity in the July-September quarter by the most in 18 months, while labor costs fell, the government said Wednesday.
A more productive and less costly work force can increase corporate profits. But unless companies see more demand, they are unlikely to step up hiring.
And manufacturers could soon see less demand overseas. Most economists expect Europe's financial crisis to tip that region into recession next year. About 20 percent of exports from the United States are shipped to Europe.
China, the world's second-largest economy, is also slowing. Manufacturing in China contracted in November for the first time in nearly three years, according to business surveys released Thursday.
Separately, the Labor Department said the number of people who applied for unemployment benefits last week rose above 400,000 for the first time in four weeks. The increase comes after applications had drifted lower over the last two months.
About seven million people are still receiving benefits. House Republicans said they were drafting legislation to continue an extended benefits program set to expire at the end of this year. That program provides up to 99 weeks of aid in states with the highest unemployment rates.
Another report showed that builders in the United States spent more in October on new homes, offices and shopping centers. Construction spending rose for a third month in a row, the Commerce Department said. Despite the gains, overall construction spending remained depressed.

HEADLINE: North Korea: U.S. Aid Delayed Over Misappropriation Concerns

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- The United States needs more time to decide on possible aid for North Korea because it is not sure humanitarian assistance would reach the people in need, the top American aid official said on Thursday. 
Rajiv Shah, the head of the United States Agency for International Development, made the comment amid growing appeals from American and United Nations relief agencies, which have recently called for urgent aid for the most vulnerable of the North Korean population, especially its children.
''Our goal is to identify and complete an assessment of whether food aid assistance can effectively be provided in a manner that is transparent and targeted and reaches intended beneficiaries and avoids the risk of graft and misappropriation,'' Mr. Shah said in an interview.
In recent weeks, Mercy Corps and four other American relief organizations operating in North Korea have charged that by delaying a decision on aid, Washington was playing politics with humanitarian aid for children.
After a trip to North Korea in October, Valerie Amos, the United Nations's top relief coordinator, called for urgent relief for children suffering from widespread malnutrition. After an assessment trip to the North last month, the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization made a similar appeal.
Mr. Shah blamed the North Korean government.
''We are all frustrated with what is the immense personal suffering that takes place when countries don't create the conditions for effective humanitarian assistance and support,'' he said. ''That's why we are working hard to establish those conditions as a significant prerequisite for engaging in food aid in North Korea this time.''
Both Washington and the government in Seoul deny linking aid to political issues. But North Korea's continued nuclear weapons program and its military provocations against South Korea have helped curtail donor contributions. Potential donors also feared that the regime may be diverting aid for its military, although relief agencies have recently reported improvements in monitoring.
Washington is dealing with food crises worse than the one in North Korea. In those crises too, Mr. Shah said, his agency was striving for unimpeded access to the people in need. He cited southern Somalia, where the Shabab, an Islamic militant group, has restricted the activities of international aid groups.
''Throughout the Horn of Africa, 13.3 million people go to bed hungry,'' he said. ''There have been more than 30,000 children under the age of 5 that have died already in Somalia.''
Mr. Shah was in South Korea to attend an international forum on aid effectiveness in Busan, a port city in southern South Korea where American aid used to arrive. On Thursday, he gave a lecture at the Korea Development Institute, a top government economic research group in Seoul that was started in 1971 with the help of American aid.
He called South Korea an exemplary success story illustrating the effectiveness of American aid. An estimated $18.7 billion in aid was sent to South Korea from 1952 to 1980 and helped the country's transformation from one of the world's poorest nations to a global export powerhouse. Its gross domestic product per capita rose to $27,000 in 2009 from $1,420 in 1960.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Fed and the Euro

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's move on Wednesday to make it easier for European banks to acquire dollars shows that American policy makers understand the gravity of Europe's turmoil and will do what they can to prevent a financial collapse across the Atlantic. European leaders, however, seem paralyzed and, even at this point, fail to share the Fed's sense of urgency. 
The Fed's extraordinary intervention should impress upon the European Central Bank, as well as its paymasters in Germany, that it is high time it stopped sitting on its hands. Only aggressive action by the bank can arrest the government debt crisis that is spreading across the Continent and threatening the very survival of the euro.
The Fed offered to swap dollars for euros at a low interest rate with the E.C.B., which would allow it to offer cheap dollars to European banks. That became necessary when American money market funds and other financial institutions started cutting off financing to banks in Europe, which own piles of risky government bonds.
Absent an alternative source of dollars, Europe's banks could have been forced into a fire sale of dollar-denominated bonds and other assets, which would have spread the crisis to American financial institutions. But, while it was necessary, the Fed's move does not address the root of Europe's immediate dilemma: investors are demanding high interest rates to buy the bonds of weak euro-area economies, which are burdened by big piles of debt and are unable to devalue their currencies to become more competitive.
The European leaders' failure over the past two years to assemble a credible bailout plan to restore financial stability to the weak economies like Greece has pushed the crisis to Italy, the euro zone's third-biggest economy, which owes $2.5 trillion and must refinance $530 billion of that debt next year. This week, Italy issued new debt at interest of nearly 8 percent, a rate that, if sustained, could force the country to default. The euro could not survive such an event.
This is why it is urgent for the E.C.B. -- which can print euros at will -- to act immediately by promising to purchase as many bonds of stricken countries as is necessary to reduce their interest rates to affordable levels.
Until now, the central bank has refused to intervene on a substantial scale. Leaders in Germany, the strongest European economy, argue that allowing the central bank to turn on the printing press would foster profligacy by taking weak nations off the hook. And it says it fears inflation, an implausible concern for economies that are slipping into recession.
On Thursday, Mario Draghi, the president of the E.C.B., made a veiled suggestion that the bank might buy more bonds if nations in the euro zone could agree to establish a ''fiscal compact'' that set credible rules and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that budget deficits are pared. This would be good news if the central bank started buying bonds right after the European summit meeting next week. But if it waits until euro-zone countries agree to give the central bank or the European Commission control over their budgets, the euro is probably doomed.

HEADLINE: Coach's Plan to Rouse Ovechkin Produces Little

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Two games into the new regime here, anxiety about the decline of the Capitals star Alex Ovechkin has yet to subside. On Thursday, Washington lost, 2-1, to Sidney Crosby and the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Capitals' eighth defeat in their last 10 games.
The score was close, but the game really wasn't. The Capitals were outshot by 35-17, and by 10-2 in the third period. They held Crosby without a point and limited him to three shots on goal -- ''They kept a pretty tight seal on things,'' Crosby said -- but Ovechkin managed only one shot. 
He made a great show of returning to the human-cannonball form that characterized the Ovechkin of old and was credited with 10 hits, but the constant threat of scoring that really defined Ovechkin was absent, as it has been for most of this season. He gave the puck away to the Penguins in his own zone at least three times and managed to mount only one real threat, in the second period when he set up Nicklas Backstrom in front of the Pittsburgh net.
Backstrom hit the crossbar.
Afterward, Ovechkin and the rest of the Capitals tried to put their best spin on things, as did their new coach, Dale Hunter, who has now lost both of his games behind the Washington bench by the same score.
''I think it was a great game today,'' Ovechkin said. ''It was a big battle for us and a great test for us. We didn't score our chances that we had -- we hit the post, and their goalie made great saves a couple times.
''It's not frustrating,'' he continued. ''It's nothing. If we're going to play like this, it's going to turn around.''
It was the first time Ovechkin and Crosby had met since the Winter Classic on New Year's night in Pittsburgh, when Crosby received the first of two hits to the head that led to a concussion that sidelined him for more than 10 months.
Naturally, this game was billed as the renewal of the rivalry between the undisputed two best players in hockey.
While Crosby has re-established his primacy since returning Nov. 21 -- he has 11 points in six games, despite going scoreless for only the second time since coming back -- Ovechkin is in a funk so profound it helped get his coach fired earlier this week.
''I'm 26, he's 24 -- we're not young anymore,'' Ovechkin said before the game when asked yet again about being compared with Crosby. ''We're in different positions, different teams.
''I don't pay attention.''
Ovechkin, who averaged 50 goals in his first six N.H.L. seasons, has only one goal in his last 10 games and 18 points in 24 games this season. His play had seemed so indifferent that his ice time was reduced by the former coach, Bruce Boudreau, from his customary 22 minutes a game to less than 19.
Boudreau was fired Monday amid denials from him and Ovechkin that the two were at odds. ''I tried every trick that I knew'' to revive the slumping Capitals, Boudreau told reporters Wednesday morning. That afternoon Boudreau flew to Southern California to take over as coach of the Anaheim Ducks, having been unemployed less than 66 hours.
Hunter, the Capitals' new coach, helped the London Knights set a record for the most victories in junior hockey in 11 years as their coach, and has the Ontario Hockey League's highest career winning percentage. After Thursday's morning skate, Hunter said he had a plan to jump-start his dormant superstar.
''He's going to forecheck harder tonight and play more aggressive in their end,'' Hunter said. ''He's got to shoot the puck -- he's got a great shot, but he's got to get open to do it. He's going to go to the net hard.''
Those were all the things Ovechkin used to do. And while Ovechkin threw his body at the Penguins with abandon Thursday night, he did not shoot, nor did he get open to shoot, nor did he go to the net hard in 19 minutes 22 seconds of ice time.
The score was tied through two periods. But after Pittsburgh's Chris Kunitz scored the go-ahead goal 2:36 into the third, the Capitals did not come close to responding. Only their goalie, Tomas Vokoun, prevented a worse defeat.

HEADLINE: In Ailing Detroit, a Show of Unity in an Effort to Prevent a State Takeover

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
Facing mounting pressure from Michigan's governor to solve Detroit's financial crisis, Mayor Dave Bing on Thursday stood beside union representatives and City Council members in a public show of unity, a last-ditch effort to keep the state's largest city out of state control. 
''This is our city,'' Mr. Bing said defiantly during a news conference called to respond to suggestions that Gov. Rick Snyder might soon intervene. ''Detroit needs to be run by Detroit,'' he said, adding, ''We know what needs to be done, and we stand ready to do it.''
The mayor's appearance suggested a new sense of urgency and collaboration on the part of the city's leaders, who had bickered openly in recent days over the solution to Detroit's finances. But it also provided no concrete agreements between labor unions and the city about how Detroit will cut spending to save itself from running out of cash by next spring and how it will avoid falling $45 million short by the middle of next year.
Late Thursday, Mr. Snyder, a Republican, was still assessing whether to call for a review of the city's finances, a step that can, in some cases, be the first move toward appointing an outside, emergency manager to take control of the city's financial operations.
''The timeline is getting tighter and tougher because of the severity and the urgency of this,'' said Sara Wurfel, the governor's spokeswoman. ''It's imminent if the city and the mayor cannot come up with something.''
Five Michigan governmental entities, including Detroit's school system and the cities of Flint and Benton Harbor, have been deemed in dire financial circumstances and placed under control of outside managers, who, under a new state law, have broader reach than ever, including the ability to toss out union contracts.
Detroit, with a population of about 713,000, has faced financial crises before but has never had such a manager, state officials said.
Mr. Bing, who said he received a call from Mr. Snyder on Wednesday suggesting that an official review might be ordered in a matter of days, indicated that a firm plan for sparing the city should come soon. Last month, Mr. Bing proposed cutting 1,000 city jobs and getting concessions from other workers, but some City Council members said the cuts needed to go far deeper -- with twice as many layoffs, for instance -- to truly solve the problem.
On Thursday, though, Mr. Bing said there was newfound agreement. Or at least newfound conversation. ''We're talking,'' he said. ''We're talking.''
Of the union leaders who appeared, he said, ''I think we're now at the table.''

HEADLINE: My Kind of Town, and Now Maybe Your Kind of Domain Name

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
If Amy Rule needs a Hanukkah present for her spouse-mayor, I have a loving idea: buy him an e-mail address, rahm@chicago.com
It will soon be available. But so will barack@chicago.com, forrest@chicago.com, aviva@chicago.com, zambrano@chicago.com, kogan@chicago.com, mellody@chicago.com and a conservative estimate of 25,000 other first names and 88,000 surnames in the Chicago area.
What will the market be? The answer may interweave intriguing notions of scarcity, status and the extent to which self-identity is tied to location. 
The person most interested sat in a Bridgeport cafe Wednesday morning, discussing the imminent transformation of a prized piece of digital real estate: chicago.com.
Josh Metnick, 38, is a bright and self-effacing north suburban native, a techie and an Internet entrepreneur who was writing computer code for a game called Mario's Pizza by age 9 and cutting seven-figure deals by 24. During his senior year at the University of Illinois, where he majored in finance, he started an Internet service provider with three friends, including Jared Polis, who is now a Colorado congressman.
He and two others invested $5,000 each, while Mr. Polis invested $40,000. They sold it four years later for $20 million.
In 2001 Mr. Metnick beat out The Tribune Company and bought chicago.com for $500,000 from Karl Swartz, a California man who had acquired it for nothing from the nonprofit group that administers the domain system. Mr. Swartz used it as a home page, replete with photos of his dog, and Mr. Metnick has since spurned many offers to sell.
He makes money off it, but it's limited and utilitarian, like many such city sites. Most owners coast on inherently potent brands and don't invest much. And while Mr. Metnick is not a content producer, possibilities for enhancing chicago.com would seem ample.
Now his four-person operation is retooling the site to offer e-mail addresses with chicago.com domains.
He has sold a few names to friends and prominent businessmen whose identities I agreed not to disclose. Businesses include Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, the restaurant chain, which bought lettuce@chicago.com, and Seyfarth Shaw L.L.P., a big law firm, which got seyfarth@chicago.com, and he's in talks with Microsoft.
As a result, Mr. Metnick believes that individuals and companies may be willing to spend substantial sums. Initial pricing for individuals' names will be $295 for a year, $735 for three years, $975 for five years and $1,750 for 10 years. A buyer will have right of first refusal when its time expires.
Just as many people crave vanity license plates -- Mr. Metnick prefers the word ''identity'' to ''vanity'' -- they may desire a personalized chicago.com address. As for the maximum 26 addresses using a letter of the alphabet, he thinks they could fetch $250,000 each.
Regardless, you can imagine the business potential of smartly exploiting subject addresses like @hotels.com if you're a hotel chain or @ford.com if you're a local dealership. Maintaining a relationship with an addressee would be crucial.
When I mentioned Thorstein Veblen, Mr. Metnick smiled. He knows well the economist-sociologist (and University of Chicago professor) Veblen's ''Theory of the Leisure Class,'' which proffered the notion of ''conspicuous consumption,'' a link between status and the products we buy or associate with.
Forces shaping a person's identity, Veblen said, may often be genetic, cultural and social, but they can also include the surrounding physical environment. We may see ourselves as a city or country person or specifically, say, as a Chicagoan.
Mr. Metnick attended Glenbrook North High School and has just moved to Israel -- he owns illinois.com as well as telaviv.com -- and is typical of his world. There have been other successes, like selling guitar.com, but far more failures. He has spearheaded a worldwide association of city sites too, though the joint sales effort he envisioned sputtered and is split into two groups.
''The reason I love Josh is that he is the living embodiment of iteration,'' said Howard Tullman, a Chicago lawyer turned entrepreneur who is Mr. Metnick's friend and mentor.
Mr. Tullman runs Tribeca Flashpoint Media Arts Academy, a two-year for-profit vocational school for digital production and design.
''He's never at rest and is always asking how can this be cooler, faster, easier, etc.,'' Mr. Tullman said. ''Whatever 'this' is.''
And if you buy an address, Mr. Metnick will ask one thing in return: the name of your favorite Chicagoan.
It will tell him a bit about you and prompt a monthly communication -- and, he hopes, ''the start of a lifelong relationship.''

HEADLINE: New Air Quality Rules for Power Plants in Dispute

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration said Thursday that a series of new air pollution rules for power plants would not cause power shortages, although the expert panel designated by the government to ensure electricity reliability warns that compliance with these rules could strain generating capacity.
The Environmental Protection Agency, under fire from the utility industry and from Republicans in Congress for what they call excessive regulation, has sent signals that it will be flexible in applying the new rules and may grant extensions or exemptions to make sure the lights stay on. 
The Department of Energy said Thursday that under two major E.P.A. air quality rules that are supposed to be made final in the next few weeks, the amount of generating capacity would still be adequate if power companies and regulators were ''prompt'' in seeking replacements for plants shuttered because they could not meet the new pollution standards.
House Republicans are seeking delays in some of the rules, which affect both air pollutants and power plant cooling water. This year, in the face of political opposition and high cost estimates, the White House backed off on new smog rules, which would also have affected power plants.
In a conference call with reporters on Thursday, an assistant administrator of the E.P.A. took the unusual step of casting doubt on the work of the group designated by the government to enforce rules on the power grid, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, for saying that a water rule still under development could force enough plant closings to cause power shortages in Texas and New England.
The E.P.A. official, Gina McCarthy, head of the agency's office of air and radiation, said the group's report assumed a stricter standard than the one her office was planning to issue.
''We don't take reliability issues lightly,'' she said. ''In the 40-year history of the Clean Air Act, E.P.A. rules have not let the lights go out, and we won't let it happen going forward.''
But Republicans are still threatening to block the new rules. ''In these tough economic times, we cannot afford to be reckless with regulation,'' said Representative Ed Whitfield, the Kentucky Republican who is chairman of the House Energy and Power Subcommittee.
Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate to stop the regulations; last month, the Senate voted 41 to 57 against a resolution to delay one of them, the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. But the issue could become a bargaining chip in future negotiations on other legislation.
Ms. McCarthy said that the cross-state rule would be made final in January and that a rule on emissions of mercury and airborne toxic materials would be finalized on Dec. 16 ''or sooner.''
Meanwhile, environmental organizations are trying to hold the White House's feet to the fire, emphasizing an E.P.A. estimate that the new rules will eliminate tens of thousands of premature deaths from dirty air.
The rules divide the electric companies. Some have old, dirty coal plants and favor a delay. Others have newer, cleaner fleets and anticipate getting more work out of them if their competitors' coal plants are either retired or have their operations limited; they favor the new rules.
State public service commissions are also divided; commissions in Alabama, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas have submitted comments in the federal rulemaking process in which they fret over the costs to consumers and reliability problems. In Texas, which has its own grid, the operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, has said that generating reserves would fall short of the minimum amount needed to assure reliability next summer, partly because of power plant retirements. Pollution rules are one reason for such retirements.

HEADLINE: Clinton Says U.S. Will Relax Some Restrictions on Myanmar

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
YANGON, Myanmar -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said on Thursday that the United States would loosen some restrictions on international financial assistance and development programs in Myanmar, in response to a nascent political and economic opening in the country.
The United States and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, also agreed to discuss upgrading diplomatic relations -- which were suspended for two decades -- and exchanging ambassadors, a step that could transform American diplomacy in Southeast Asia. 
Mrs. Clinton met the country's new president, U Thein Sein, on Thursday morning and its main opposition leader, the Nobel peace laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, later in the day, underscoring the Obama administration's cautious efforts to nurture a thaw in one of the world's most isolated and repressive nations. In each meeting, Mrs. Clinton delivered a letter from President Obama, expressing support for the democratization of Myanmar.
''For decades, the choices of this country's leaders kept it apart from the global economy and the community of nations,'' Mrs. Clinton said after meeting Mr. Thein Sein in Naypyidaw, Myanmar's remote new capital. ''Today, the United States is prepared to respond to reforms with measured steps to lessen its isolation and improve the lives of citizens.''
Mrs. Clinton met Mr. Thein Sein at the monumental presidential palace, erected along with the rest of the city only six years ago on what had been an obscure stretch of farmland about 200 miles north of Yangon, the country's largest city. Mr. Thein Sein, a former general and prime minister in the previous military government, greeted Mrs. Clinton cordially, calling her visit as ''a historic milestone'' that he hoped would ''open a new chapter in relations.''
Where that new chapter will lead depends on whether Mr. Thein Sein's government takes additional steps to open up the country's politics, release political prisoners and end the violent repression of minority ethnic groups in some of the world's longest civil conflicts.
A senior Obama administration official said late Thursday that there was not yet any specific timetable for actions by either country, and that a full restoration of diplomatic relations appeared to be months away, at a minimum.
In her meetings and public statements, Mrs. Clinton said she raised a number of issues that have divided the United States and Myanmar since 1990, when the ruling military junta refused to acknowledge the results of elections won by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy. Mrs. Clinton also called on Myanmar to ''sever illicit ties to North Korea'' that officials say has included work on ballistic missiles and, possibly, nuclear technology.
Even so, she sought to welcome and encourage the steps taken since Mr. Thein Sein became president in March, including lifting the ban on the National League for Democracy.
''It is also encouraging that Aung San Suu Kyi is now free to take part in the political process,'' she said, ''but that too will be insufficient unless all political parties can open offices throughout the country and compete in free, fair and credible elections.''
In a video conference with the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Wednesday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi acknowledged that her re-entry into the political process -- like the American engagement -- entailed risk.
She said that she trusted Mr. Thein Sein personally. But she added, ''I cannot say that everybody in the government feels as he does.''
Asked if she agreed with that view, Mrs. Clinton demurred, though she said she understood that there were a variety of views within the government.
In two and a half hours of meetings with Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Thein Sein offered important signals of his intentions, senior administration officials said. He discussed legal steps for releasing additional political prisoners, for example, despite his recent public remarks asserting that the country did not have any.
There was little fanfare in the capital for Mrs. Clinton's visit, the first by a secretary of state since 1955, and the broad boulevards her motorcade passed through were all but deserted.
The government newspaper, The New Light of Myanmar, reported Mrs. Clinton's visit in a two-paragraph article on Page 2, while printing on its front page the entire resume of the prime minister of Belarus, who arrived for a visit on Thursday.
In the far more bustling metropolis of Yangon, Mrs. Clinton toured the ancient golden Shwedagon Pagoda, one of the most sacred Buddhist shrines in the country. Visitors there applauded on two occasions as a guide led her through the site, where she took part in rituals like the ringing of a giant bell and pouring water 11 times over a statue of Buddha.
She then met privately with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi over dinner at the lakeside residence of the senior American diplomat in Myanmar. It was their first meeting, though they had previously spoken by telephone, and the two women greeted each other warmly. Mrs. Clinton recalled a signed poster from a women's conference in Beijing when she was first lady, which Madeleine K. Albright, the secretary of state at the time, sent to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. She responded that the poster remained on the wall of one of her offices. ''I am very happy to meet you, finally,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
The steps Mrs. Clinton announced on Thursday were modest in scale but important symbolically. While the United States is not yet considering lifting the sweeping sanctions that ban most imports from Myanmar, she said, Washington will no longer block the World Bank and International Monetary Fund from carrying out assessment programs, and will support the expansion of United Nations development grants for health care and small businesses in Myanmar.
She also invited Myanmar to join the Lower Mekong Initiative, an American-sponsored regional association devoted to water issues, which already includes Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand. And she said she raised the possibility of joint missions to recover the remains of about 600 American soldiers who died in the country during World War II, similar to the effort to locate missing Americans in Vietnam.
''So we're not at the point yet that we can consider lifting sanctions that we have in place, because of our ongoing concerns about policies that have to be reversed,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''But any steps that the government takes will be carefully considered and will be, as I said, matched, because we want to see political and economic reform take hold.''

HEADLINE: Romney Plays Up Business Dealings

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's campaign went on the air in Iowa on Wednesday with its first television advertisement in the state, which plays a crucial, early role in the 2012 nominating process. 
THE SCRIPT ''I spent my life in the private sector. I've competed with companies around the world. I've learned something about how it is that economies grow. We're not going to balance the budget just by pretending that all they have to do is take out the waste. We're going to have to cut spending. And I'm in favor of cutting spending, capping federal spending as a percentage of G.D.P. at 20 percent or less, and having a balanced budget amendment. The right answer for America is to stop the growth of the federal government, and to start the growth of the private sector. I'm Mitt Romney, and I approve this message.''
ON THE SCREEN As the 30-second spot begins, the words ''Mitt Romney Conservative Businessman'' flash across a still image of Mr. Romney against a dark background. The rest of the ad includes video of Mr. Romney speaking against a blue backdrop during a recent debate, as well as photographs of him campaigning in Iowa -- speaking and greeting voters at the Iowa State Fair, and bending down to shake hands with a little boy.
ACCURACY The ad, which is centered on a response Mr. Romney gave at a CNN debate in September, is fairly straightforward. Though Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, first ran for public office in 1994, he did spend more than two decades working in the private sector -- the majority of it at Bain Capital, as well as his time running the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
SCORECARD Unlike Mr. Romney's debut television ad, which attacked President Obama and took some of his words out of context, this spot is notable for having what the first one did not: a positive message. The ad seems geared toward introducing Mr. Romney, and his views on spending, to Iowa voters, without disparaging anyone else. Voters generally do not like negative ads, and this ad is certainly sunnier. And the words ''Mitt Romney Conservative Businessman'' seem intended to burnish his conservative credentials, which are still viewed skeptically by some on the right. ASHLEY PARKER

HEADLINE: Democrats Look To Payroll Issue For Upper Hand

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Robert Pear and Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After struggling all year for an economic message that resonates broadly with Americans in hard times, President Obama and Congressional Democrats have settled on one they believe can carry through next year's election as they use a fight over payroll taxes to portray Republicans as defenders of the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.
With Mr. Obama leading the charge in Washington and political swing states, Senate Democrats have put proudly antitax Republicans in the position of opposing a tax cut for more than 160 million mostly middle-class Americans because they object that it includes a tax on about 350,000 people, those with more than $1 million in annual taxable income.
Votes late on Thursday left the issue at an impasse. The Senate voted 51 to 49 for Democrats' measure to further reduce Social Security payroll taxes next year for both workers and employers and to impose the surtax, but the tally was short of the 60 votes needed. One moderate Republican, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, supported it. A Republican alternative, which would have extended the current more modest tax cut and slashed the federal payroll to pay for it, was rejected 78 to 20, with more than half of Republicans opposed. 
The maneuvering suggests that the parties will agree to some continued relief before the current payroll tax cut expires on Dec. 31. But how much of a cut and how -- or if -- it will be paid for remain to be settled, with some in both parties saying that the tax break would further weaken the Social Security system's financing.
But politically, Democrats believe that they have already won this latest skirmish in the message wars. And some exasperated Republicans acknowledge that they are losing the exchange; party leaders have worked this week to bring the rank and file in line behind the tax cut.
Democrats have concluded from the payroll tax debate that Republicans are vulnerable over their opposition to any new taxes on the wealthy in a way they were not when Democrats proposed such taxes for deficit reduction. So they have reprised an old message -- that Democrats fight for the middle class, Republicans for the rich -- and are likely to sound it through 2012, in hopes of blunting the headwinds they face as unemployment remains high.
''Tonight, Senate Republicans chose to raise taxes on nearly 160 million hard-working Americans because they refused to ask a few hundred thousand millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement after the first Senate vote.
It was the same message he delivered on Wednesday, in anticipation of the Senate action, both in speeches to a crowd in blue-collar Scranton, Pa., and later to affluent donors in New York. In Scranton, speaking as if to Republicans, he asked, ''Are you willing to fight as hard for middle-class families as you do for those who are most fortunate? What's it going to be?''
Mr. Obama, in setting this debate in motion in September, when he introduced his job-creation plan, has tapped into the widespread sense of income inequality -- fighting for ''the 99 percent'' -- that gave rise to the Occupy Wall Street movement. But Democrats would not be in their current strong position but for the fact that Republicans, for the first time in memory, contested a tax cut and then insisted that the reductions be paid for.
''This would have been unheard of even six months ago,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''But we are changing the debate, and the public is with us.''
Mr. Schumer read to reporters from RedState.com, a Web site popular among conservatives, where a blogger, Erick Erickson, wrote, ''I never thought I would see the day, but Democrats are outmaneuvering Republicans on a tax cut.''
''Like clockwork, the G.O.P. is throwing the ball into the Democrats' basket for them,'' Mr. Erickson said.
Republican leaders' struggle this week to find a strategy that could unite their party reflected the political bind it is in. Nearly 7 in 10 Americans said the policies of Republicans in Congress favored the rich, a New York Times/CBS News poll found in October.
In a memo to Senate Democrats last week, the party pollster Geoff Garin cited other recent surveys to argue that concern about income inequality and the perceived decline of the middle class is trumping the antigovernment fervor that defined last year's Congressional midterm election and allowed Republicans to take control of the House. He said that sets up a 2012 election that is fundamentally different.
''There is very broad support in the electorate for having millionaires pay more in taxes to help address the country's needs,'' Mr. Garin said. ''The bottom line is, Republicans are on the wrong side of public opinion.''
But David Winston, a Republican pollster who advises House leaders, noted that Mr. Obama continued to get low ratings for his handling of the economy.
''How does this create jobs and grow the economy?'' he said. ''That's the question people want answered. So whatever it is they're saying, they need to think through, is it answering that question?''
The answer is yes in the case of the payroll tax cut, Democrats say, citing economic forecasters.
Reducing the employee's share of payroll taxes from its current 4.2 percent to 3.1 percent -- the tax is usually 6.2 percent -- and extending it to employers would spur enough new consumer spending to add about 750,000 jobs, according to Moody's Analytics. That assumes the tax cut is offset by the proposed surtax on millionaires, beginning in 2013.
The one-year payroll tax cut and a separate tax credit that Democrats have proposed for small businesses that add workers would cost $265 billion, according to Congressional analysts. The surtax would raise $267.5 billion over 10 years.
As the week began, Republicans opposed extending a payroll tax cut, according to Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the Senate's No. 2 Republican leader. ''The payroll tax holiday has not stimulated job creation,'' he said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''We don't think that is a good way to do it.''
But by Tuesday, with some Republicans publicly taking issue with that stance, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said his party would support an extension of the payroll tax cut -- but not an expansion or small business credit and definitely not a surtax on millionaires. On Wednesday Republicans proposed to offset the $121.2 billion cost by freezing pay for federal civilian workers through 2015 and cutting the federal work force by 10 percent.
''There's no reason folks should suffer even more than they already are from the president's failure to turn this jobs crisis around,'' Mr. McConnell said.
He and other Republicans say the surtax would hurt many ''job creators'' among small businesses. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, citing a Treasury study, said less than 1 percent of taxpayers who would pay the surtax were small businesses.

HEADLINE: U.N. Official Likens Unrest in Syria to Civil War, and Death Toll Is Said to Pass 4,000

BYLINE: By NADA BAKRI

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The United Nations declared Thursday that Syria was in a state of civil war, as the death toll from nearly nine months of bloodshed rose to more than 4,000 people and more soldiers were reported to have defected from the army to join an armed uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. 
The comments by the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, came as the Local Coordination Committees, an opposition group, said security forces killed at least 24 people across the country on Thursday.
''We are placing the figure at 4,000, but the information coming to us is that it's much more,'' Ms. Pillay said at a news conference in Geneva. ''As soon as there were more and more defectors threatening to take up arms, I said this in August before the Security Council, that there's going to be a civil war. And at the moment that's how I am characterizing this.''
Her declaration came amid rising international pressure on Mr. Assad's government, with the Arab League, the European Union, Turkey and the United States all taking measures to further constrict the Syrian economy. In past months, the Syrian pound has faltered, and the country's two major sources of revenue -- tourism and oil -- have been crippled by sanctions.
The United Nations has taken a tough line on Syrian abuses. An independent commission of inquiry sponsored by the United Nations, which was not granted access to travel to Syria, said on Monday that Syrian forces had committed crimes against humanity, including the killing and torture of children. It said the security forces were taking orders from the highest levels of Mr. Assad's government.
Members of the commission based their investigation on testimony from 233 victims of torture and imprisonment, as well as witnesses.
On Thursday, the news agency Interfax reported that Russia had delivered antiship cruise missiles to Syria, according to Reuters.
European, American and Turkish officials have deemed Syria's economic weakness the greatest threat to Mr. Assad's endurance. Unlike in the early months of the uprising, when Europe and the United States were alone in imposing restrictions, a growing international consensus has emerged to take action against interests there. The pressure has intensified frustration in cities like Damascus and Aleppo, which have so far largely stayed out of the fray of the increasingly bloody revolt.
On Thursday, the European Union imposed economic sanctions against 12 Syrian individuals and 11 companies. The United States announced sanctions as well against a top Syrian general and an uncle of Mr. Assad whom the Treasury Department described as a significant financial adviser to the president. The American sanctions also included a Defense Ministry business and Syria's real estate bank, which the Treasury said administers the government's borrowing.

HEADLINE: Montclair Film Festival Receives Lift From Colbert

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
Cannes. Toronto. Park City, Utah. If these cities can each be the home of a great film festival, then why not Montclair, N.J.? Isn't it entitled to a little bit of that cinematic luster, too?
''Is it entitled to it?'' Stephen Colbert, the late-night comedian and Montclair resident, asked rhetorically. ''I think every town is entitled to anything that they want to do.'' He added: ''Small communities that dream big like this, I think they should be encouraged to. Everything that people are willing to come together to work hard on and create, they can.''
The event that has Mr. Colbert, who plays the satirically stubborn host of Comedy Central's ''Colbert Report,'' in an inspirational mood is the Montclair International Film Festival, a celebration of fiction and documentary moviemaking that will be held for the first time from May 2 through 6. 
The festival, whose board of directors includes Mr. Colbert and his wife, Evelyn McGee-Colbert, took another step closer to fruition with the announcement that it had hired Raphaela Neihausen and Thom Powers to oversee its programming lineup. Mr. Powers and Ms. Neihausen, a who run the Stranger Than Fiction documentary series and the DOC NYC festival at the IFC Center in New York, are expected to help select about 25 features for the inaugural Montclair festival. Their appointment is to be officially announced on Friday at a benefit event at the Wellmont Theater, where Mr. Colbert will be interviewed by the journalist Jonathan Alter.
Mr. Powers said in a telephone interview that the Traverse City Film Festival, which is held annually in Michigan and whose founders include Michael Moore, would serve as a model for the Montclair event.
''We've watched as that festival has grown and transformed that community. It's had an incredible effect on their economy and their spirit,'' Mr. Powers said. ''It engages over 1,000 volunteers each year and brings films that otherwise wouldn't be shown there.''
Mr. Powers said the Montclair festival also hoped to include a comedy competition that would feature around six films.
Mr. Colbert said he would be serving primarily as a cheerleader for the Montclair festival (''If I can find the right outfit and work on my round off''), which evoked his memories of growing up in Charleston, S.C., which established the Spoleto Festival USA in 1977, when he was 13. It was there that he appeared a few years later in his first-ever professional theatrical production: ''I played a gay leper,'' Mr. Colbert said. ''Total typecasting.''
Once a full lineup for the Montclair film festival is decided, Mr. Colbert said it was likely that he would host or participate in festival events and help recruit other talented people.
He made no promises, however, that he would be able to draft Stephen Sondheim, the legendary Broadway composer and lyricist who has become a recurring guest on ''The Colbert Report.'' ''He already got me into 'Company,''' Mr. Colbert said, ''and I'm eternally grateful for him getting me in that much trouble.''
Referring to the production of that Sondheim musical that he performed in at Avery Fisher Hall last April, Mr. Colbert vowed that that was a one-time-only event.
''I got a lovely note from Mr. Sondheim asking me to do it,'' he said, ''and my wife said: 'Look, no one, let alone Stephen Sondheim, is ever going to ask you to do Sondheim. You've got to say yes.' That's why I did it. It was a ton of fun.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Leaders Still Seem Torn About Romney

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Republican leaders remain bullish about their party's chances of winning the White House, but after spending much of this year unsuccessfully trying to recruit new candidates, they are coming to the conclusion that their eventual nominee will carry substantial flaws into the general election.
A month before the first round of voting begins, with the top of the field seeming to take shape, many Republicans remain torn over whether to back Mitt Romney and still want to see how Newt Gingrich or another alternative develops.
The desire to defeat President Obama is high, but a vast majority of Republican governors, members of Congress and other party elders are content for now to watch from the sidelines, undercutting Mr. Romney's effort to create an air of inevitability and reflecting broader indecision among conservatives even as the time to choose draws close. 
''Republicans recognize this is the highest-stakes presidential race in their lifetime, and they want to take all the time they need to be sure to pick the person who has the best chance to beat Obama -- not just win the nomination,'' said Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, who was among the Republicans who decided against a presidential bid. ''I still don't think it's clear.''
Republicans continue to have many factors working in their favor, starting with the weak economy and Mr. Obama's tepid job-approval numbers. But the 2012 quandary for party leaders has grown in recent weeks as Mr. Romney has failed to capitalize on the woes of his Republican rivals, allowing Mr. Gingrich another shot at challenging him. The two candidates are now weighing whether to define each other in ways that could expose their general election flaws, diminish conservative enthusiasm or both.
The rise of Mr. Gingrich, the latest in a dizzying series of candidates who have emerged as a leading contender, could provide the last test before the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 3 of whether the various strains of conservatives can unite around an alternative to Mr. Romney.
Mr. Gingrich carries considerable baggage, from his three marriages and occasional departures from conservative orthodoxy to his current lack of an extensive campaign organization, but several party leaders said that his debate performances had been impressive and that Mr. Romney had not yet proven he was the stronger candidate.
''If people think he's the strongest nominee, he'll win the nomination,'' said Mr. Barbour, referring to Mr. Romney. ''I'm not sure people think that yet.''
Even though the candidates have spent months -- or in the cases of Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich, years -- introducing themselves, there is a palpable lack of passion for their candidacies. It is an intense yearning to defeat Mr. Obama that creates the enthusiasm, rather than the notion of one of the candidates serving in the Oval Office.
The unsettled Republican nominating contest -- and the emerging duel between Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich -- was a subject of discussion here in Florida as the party's governors convened for their annual meeting. Only six of the 29 Republican governors have endorsed a candidate -- three for Mr. Romney, three for Gov. Rick Perry of Texas -- a number that many governors said was far lower than other years.
''We've all been waiting for that perfect candidate to emerge as the clear knight in shining armor,'' said Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association. ''There is an intense desire to win. We want to have the absolute right candidate.''
For months, Mr. Romney has benefited from a slow-and-steady approach focused relentlessly on the economy. But with the candidacy of Mr. Gingrich suddenly rising, Mr. Romney is trying not to lose his moment. His campaign is waiting for other candidates to engage Mr. Gingrich, but if voters have not turned from Mr. Gingrich in the next two weeks, Mr. Romney is prepared to pounce.
While Mr. Gingrich questioned Mr. Romney's conservative credentials while campaigning this week in South Carolina, he seemed to take a new tone on Thursday and advised his staff not to instigate or respond to any attacks. His candidacy has flourished, in part, because of his civility at the debates. In an appeal for donations, he said he would not use any ''attack ads against my friends who are also seeking the Republican nomination.''
Mr. Gingrich remains politically vulnerable for his work on behalf of Freddie Mac, as reports emerged Thursday night in The Wall Street Journal and USA Today on how he had argued in a 2007 interview about being ''very cautious about fundamentally changing'' the role of the government-sponsored mortgage agency.
Mr. Romney, a former chairman of the Republican Governors Association, has struggled to win widespread endorsements from the party establishment. He is courting Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, who said she will choose a candidate this month. He has intensified campaign efforts to send a signal that he is fighting for the nomination, including kicking off a new volunteer drive this weekend called Earn It With Mitt.
Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, which is among the critical battleground states in the general election, said that ''short of a major scandal'' he believes Mr. Romney would be the nominee because of his fluency on economic issues. But he said Mr. Romney's support might grow if he spoke more conversationally.
''Mitt has a 59-point economic plan. I'd like to see that boiled down,'' Mr. Walker said. ''Not that he should get rid of it, but boil it done to three or five core things, because politically it's more understandable, and it's also easier to hold people accountable.''
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who announced his support for Mr. Romney after declining entreaties to seek the Republican nomination himself, dismissed suggestions that the low number of endorsements carried a broader meaning or was reason for alarm. To make his point, he bluntly said he was not twisting arms to recruit people to join the campaign.
''I'm not sitting here with my Mitt button on, trying to bring everybody into the fold,'' said Mr. Christie, the vice chairman of the governors association. ''It's not my job. It's his job.''
But as Republicans gathered here this week at a resort on the edge of Walt Disney World, where governors were joined by scores of strategists, donors and lobbyists, a question driving the conversation was whether Mr. Romney could muster enthusiasm and unite the party if he won the nomination.
Gov. David Heineman of Nebraska, who was the first governor to endorse Mr. Romney, said a competitive primary was good for the party and Republicans would rally behind Mr. Romney.
''You hear a lot of people say, 'Well, maybe my first choice is Michele Bachmann or Newt Gingrich, but I'm not uncomfortable with Mitt,' '' Mr. Heineman said. ''Everybody's been looking for the perfect candidate, but there is no such thing.''
Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana, who also decided against declaring his presidential candidacy, said the path for Republicans to win the White House rested on speaking candidly about the deficit and offering specific solutions to the nation's unsustainable entitlement programs. He said a campaign that only criticized Mr. Obama would not be sufficient.
''I just hope Republicans won't bank on that, as promising as it is, electorally,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''We need to campaign to govern. That means leveling with the American people -- who are fully prepared to be leveled with -- and explain it in an encouraging and a constructive way.''
Mr. Daniels acknowledged there was not a groundswell of enthusiasm among conservatives for Mr. Romney, saying: ''More is better, but I'm not particularly troubled right now.''

HEADLINE: To Revive Economy, Rescue Housing

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
It's housing, stupid. More precisely, it's housing finance.
As the Obama administration seeks ways to revive the economy, not to mention win an election, it is becoming clear that the biggest mistake officials made when they took office nearly three years ago was to underestimate the continuing damage to the economy from the mortgage crisis.
''There is widespread agreement among economists that housing debt is at the heart of the slow recovery,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, the Harvard economist, ''and that finding a way to bring it down faster would accelerate the recovery.''
The administration has sought to encourage mortgage modifications by making it easier for homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth to nonetheless refinance their mortgages. But the success of that effort seems to have been limited, and calls are growing for more action. 
Interestingly, it is Federal Reserve officials, who normally seek to avoid commenting on specific government policies outside the range of monetary policies, who have been sounding the alarm with increasing regularity. They have made clear that they fear monetary policy will not be enough to get the economy moving, and that they need help from Congress and the White House.
''We at the Federal Reserve are moving vigorously to promote a stronger economic recovery,'' said Janet Yellin, the Fed's vice chairman, in a speech in San Francisco this week. ''However, monetary policy is not a panacea, and it is essential for other policy makers to also do their part. In particular, there is a strong case for additional measures to address the dysfunctional housing market.''
William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, laid out a housing agenda when he spoke at West Point last month. He said action was needed to make it easier for more people to qualify for mortgage loans, and also broached an idea for something that so far has gotten little political support but probably will be necessary: reducing the amount that many borrowers owe while letting them keep their homes.
He suggested that borrowers who were under water on their loans -- that is, they owe more than their houses were worth -- but were still making their payments should be able ''to earn accelerated principal reduction over time.''
Any such plan risks infuriating homeowners who were responsible and did not borrow more than they could afford to pay. One way to improve the perceived fairness of a plan to allow principal reductions would be to tie such reductions to a structure that would give the lenders a share in any recovery in property values when the homes were eventually sold.
To many Republicans, the answer is simply to let the markets sort it out. That prescription seems to be based more on ideology than on any actual analysis of how the housing market is functioning, and it seems to infuriate Fed officials.
''Regardless of how we got here, we, as a nation, currently have a housing market that is so severely out of balance that it is hampering our economic recovery,'' said Elizabeth A. Duke, a Fed governor, in a speech in September.
Mr. Dudley, the New York Fed president, also denounced the way the market was functioning. ''In contrast to the efficient mechanisms in place in the commercial property market to work out troubled debt,'' he said in his speech at West Point, ''the infrastructure of the residential mortgage market is wholly inadequate to deal with a systemic shock to the housing market. Left alone, this flawed structure will destroy much more value in housing than is necessary.''
First impressions can be misleading, and nowhere is that more true than in understanding the housing mess. The first symptoms of trouble came in the subprime market, and it was the problems of that market that were first put under a microscope. We found loans that had been made to unqualified borrowers on terms that were, in some cases, outrageous. We found fraud. We found that credit had become far too easy to get.
And we found private-label mortgage securitizations that were stuffed with horrid loans that never should have been made, rubber-stamped by rating agencies, guaranteed by insurance companies and purchased by institutional investors without anyone in the chain doing any real due diligence. We found securitizations that were managed so haphazardly that papers proving who owns mortgages had disappeared.
All that was true, but focusing on such outrages can obscure what needs to be done. By now we should understand that the problems went far beyond the subprime market. There are many prime loans, made to responsible borrowers with good credit, that are in deep trouble. Property values did not collapse only in the neighborhoods where dubious loans were being made.
The bulk of those troubled prime loans now are owned by the United States government -- or, to be more specific, by its wards, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That is highly regrettable in some ways, but it gave the Obama administration an opportunity to take steps to change things without Congressional action.
It did that this fall when it changed the rules for the mortgage modification program, starting Thursday, to allow homeowners who were under water on their mortgage obligations to nonetheless refinance their loans -- and thus get the benefit of the lower interest rates that the Fed's monetary policy has produced.
That makes sense because Fannie and Freddie already have the credit risk on the underwater loans. Allowing the borrower to refinance -- and thus owe lower monthly payments -- reduces the risk of the loan, at least by a little.
Fannie and Freddie financed many of the loans by selling mortgage-backed securities to investors who collect the interest until the loans are repaid, and then get the principal back. If there were large numbers of refinancings, the owners of those securities would be the losers.
In normal times, old securities with relatively high interest rates would have virtually disappeared as owners refinanced, paid off the old mortgages and took out loans at lower rates. But these are not normal times, and speculators now are profiting from the woes of homeowners who cannot refinance but have not defaulted. Because Fannie and Freddie guarantee the loans, buyers of those securities are sure to recover the amounts lent.
Prices of high-coupon mortgage securities rose to unprecedented heights earlier this year as investors concluded that those who had not refinanced by then would never be able to do so, and that owners of the securities would be able to collect above-market interest rates for a long time. Those prices have declined, but not by very much, since the administration announced its refinancing plan.
Christopher J. Mayer, a professor at Columbia Business School who had been pushing to allow refinancings by underwater owners, says more is needed. He would like to see rule changes that would encourage competition for issuing such mortgages, rather than leaving it up to the bank that issued the original mortgage and that is still collecting fees from servicing it.
There are other things the government should be trying to do. Mr. Dudley says ways should be found to reduce foreclosures by providing ''bridge financing for borrowers with proven ability to service their debts who lose their jobs and may take longer than normal to find new jobs in today's weak labor market.''
Mr. Dudley and other Fed officials have pushed for efforts to reduce the supply of homes for sale by turning some foreclosed properties into rental properties. The administration has asked for proposals on how that could be done, but has not announced any decisions.
Given the current imbalance in supply and demand for homes, and relatively strong rental markets, such an idea seems obvious. But there seems to be no precedent. While there are of course large apartment complexes that are managed and rented by a single company, there is no business model that has been used to allow one manager to own and rent out a large number of homes. It would be particularly hard to do if the homes were spread over a large area.
But there are neighborhoods where Fannie and Freddie own large numbers of foreclosed homes. It is at least conceivable they could package them and sell them in bulk to a company that could manage them efficiently.
It was, in part, unquestioning belief in the wisdom of markets that led the Fed, under Alan Greenspan, to refuse to take action that could have at least retarded the growth of the housing bubble. It would be unfortunate if such beliefs kept the government from heeding the pleas now coming from the Fed.
''Over the medium term,'' said Ben Bernanke, Mr. Greenspan's successor as Fed chairman, in his August address to the annual Jackson Hole conference of central bankers, ''housing activity will stabilize and begin to grow again, if for no other reason than that ongoing population growth and household formation will ultimately demand it.
''Good, proactive housing policies,'' he added, ''could help speed that process.''

HEADLINE: As Tax Receipts Lag, Another Hole Opens in Budget

BYLINE: By DAN MIHALOPOULOS. 
dmihalopoulos@chicagonews coop.org

 BODY:
Like any government budget, Mayor Rahm Emanuel's first annual fiscal plan projects exactly how much the administration expects to reap in 2012 from the recently approved tax and fee increases, including the municipal tax on every hotel room stay.
But this week Mr. Emanuel received a stark and expensive reminder of how forecasting revenue streams -- especially those that rise and fall with the economic climate -- is as much art as science, and even conservative estimates can prove optimistic and spoil the grandest of plans. 
A recent audit of the city-state stadium authority's books revealed that for the first time, hotel tax revenues are not yielding the amount needed to pay off the debt that the agency took on 10 years ago to rebuild Soldier Field.
The shortfall means that Chicago's bottom line, which is already sagging, will take yet another hit, because the city is required to come up with the money under the Soldier Field deal.
Officials for the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority said Thursday that the shortfall would not be as bad as it was first feared and should not be repeated next year. Still, one of Mr. Emanuel's new appointees to the authority's board looked at the debt service payments due in the next 20 years and expressed concern that the problem could get far worse, even if tourism revived and hotel tax revenues rose again.
''The city has to begin to plan for some significant outlays,'' said Jim Reynolds, an investment manager and new member of the board, who was attending his first agency board meeting since Mr. Emanuel replaced the three hold-over mayoral appointees on the seven-member panel.
Thursday's meeting took place in the agency's offices at U.S. Cellular Field, built on the South Side more than 20 years ago to keep the White Sox from moving to Florida. State lawmakers created the I.S.F.A. to guide the ballpark's $150 million construction and then to operate the facility.
The new fiscal problem for City Hall, however, stems from the Soldier Field deal and represents another time bomb that Mr. Emanuel inherited from Mayor Richard M. Daley. To keep the Bears in Chicago, Mr. Daley pushed successfully for the authority to issue almost $400 million in bonds for the $606 million Soldier Field renovation.
A 2 percent increase in the hotel tax was instituted to back the bonds. At the time, proponents of the deal calculated that revenues from the tax would have to grow by an average of 5.5 percent a year over the next three decades to meet the debt obligations.
In order to win support for the arrangement from downstate lawmakers, the city had to agree to make up any shortfall, said Emil Jones, the retired State Senate president whom Gov. Pat Quinn selected recently to be the new chairman of the sports facilities authority.
As the bonds were issued in 2001, Mr. Daley said he was ''absolutely confident that taxpayers are not at risk for any part of this project.''
City taxpayers took a hit of more than $1.1 million for the fiscal year that ended June 30, according to the audit obtained this week by The Chicago News Cooperative. The agency's chief financial officer told the new board members Thursday, however, that state officials had informed her this week of an accounting mistake, so the real shortfall should be only $185,000.
But Mr. Reynolds appeared worried as he looked at a table showing that the debt obligations would rise steadily to $88.5 million in 2032 from $30.2 million in 2012.
The top White Sox official in the boardroom suggested that the baseball franchise was in no position to give the authority more help. The team agreed to pay higher rent three years ago, and Howard Pizer, the executive vice president of the White Sox, said the front office had then invested profits into bolstering the roster.
Mr. Pizer told the board members that the success of player signings was as difficult to predict as future hotel tax revenues, and he buttressed that point by making a joke at the expense of the team's underperforming, high-priced designated hitter: ''You could quibble with whether we spent wisely on Adam Dunn.''

HEADLINE: Clinton Says U.S. Will Relax Some Restrictions on Myanmar

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
YANGON, Myanmar -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said on Thursday that the United States would loosen some restrictions on international financial assistance and development programs in Myanmar, in response to a nascent political and economic opening in the country.
The United States and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, also agreed to discuss upgrading diplomatic relations -- which were suspended for two decades -- and exchanging ambassadors, a step that could transform American diplomacy in Southeast Asia.
Mrs. Clinton met the country's new president, U Thein Sein, on Thursday morning and its main opposition leader, the Nobel peace laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, later in the day, underscoring the Obama administration's cautious efforts to nurture a thaw in one of the world's most isolated and repressive nations. In each meeting, Mrs. Clinton delivered a letter from President Obama, expressing support for the democratization of Myanmar.
''For decades, the choices of this country's leaders kept it apart from the global economy and the community of nations,'' Mrs. Clinton said after meeting Mr. Thein Sein in Naypyidaw, Myanmar's remote new capital. ''Today, the United States is prepared to respond to reforms with measured steps to lessen its isolation and improve the lives of citizens.'' 
Mrs. Clinton met Mr. Thein Sein at the monumental presidential palace, erected along with the rest of the city only six years ago on what had been an obscure stretch of farmland about 200 miles north of Yangon, the country's largest city. Mr. Thein Sein, a former general and prime minister in the previous military government, greeted Mrs. Clinton cordially, calling her visit as ''a historic milestone'' that he hoped would ''open a new chapter in relations.''
Where that new chapter will lead depends on whether Mr. Thein Sein's government takes additional steps to open up the country's politics, release political prisoners and end the violent repression of minority ethnic groups in some of the world's longest civil conflicts.
A senior Obama administration official said late Thursday that there was not yet any specific timetable for actions by either country, and that a full restoration of diplomatic relations appeared to be months away, at a minimum.
In her meetings and public statements, Mrs. Clinton said she raised a number of issues that have divided the United States and Myanmar since 1990, when the ruling military junta refused to acknowledge the results of elections won by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy. Mrs. Clinton also called on Myanmar to ''sever illicit ties to North Korea'' that officials say has included work on ballistic missiles and, possibly, nuclear technology.
Even so, she sought to welcome and encourage the steps taken since Mr. Thein Sein became president in March, including lifting the ban on the National League for Democracy.
''It is also encouraging that Aung San Suu Kyi is now free to take part in the political process,'' she said, ''but that too will be insufficient unless all political parties can open offices throughout the country and compete in free, fair and credible elections.''
In a video conference with the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington on Wednesday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi acknowledged that her re-entry into the political process -- like the American engagement -- entailed risk.
She said that she trusted Mr. Thein Sein personally. But she added, ''I cannot say that everybody in the government feels as he does.''
Asked if she agreed with that view, Mrs. Clinton demurred, though she said she understood that there were a variety of views within the government.
In two and a half hours of meetings with Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Thein Sein offered important signals of his intentions, senior administration officials said. He discussed legal steps for releasing additional political prisoners, for example, despite his recent public remarks asserting that the country did not have any.
There was little fanfare in the capital for Mrs. Clinton's visit, the first by a secretary of state since 1955, and the broad boulevards her motorcade passed through were all but deserted.
The government newspaper, The New Light of Myanmar, reported Mrs. Clinton's visit in a two-paragraph article on Page 2, while printing on its front page the entire resume of the prime minister of Belarus, who arrived for a visit on Thursday.
In the far more bustling metropolis of Yangon, Mrs. Clinton toured the ancient golden Shwedagon Pagoda, one of the most sacred Buddhist shrines in the country. Visitors there applauded on two occasions as a guide led her through the site, where she took part in rituals like the ringing of a giant bell and pouring water 11 times over a statue of Buddha.
She then met privately with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi over dinner at the lakeside residence of the senior American diplomat in Myanmar. It was their first meeting, though they had previously spoken by telephone, and the two women greeted each other warmly. Mrs. Clinton recalled a signed poster from a women's conference in Beijing when she was first lady, which Madeleine K. Albright, the American ambassador to the United Nations at the time, sent to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. She responded that the poster remained on the wall of one of her offices. ''I am very happy to meet you, finally,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
The steps Mrs. Clinton announced on Thursday were modest in scale but important symbolically. While the United States is not yet considering lifting the sweeping sanctions that ban most imports from Myanmar, she said, Washington will no longer block the World Bank and International Monetary Fund from carrying out assessment programs, and will support the expansion of United Nations development grants for health care and small businesses in Myanmar.
She also invited Myanmar to join the Lower Mekong Initiative, an American-sponsored regional association devoted to water issues, which already includes Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand. And she said she raised the possibility of joint missions to recover the remains of about 600 American soldiers who died in the country during World War II, similar to the effort to locate missing Americans in Vietnam.
''So we're not at the point yet that we can consider lifting sanctions that we have in place, because of our ongoing concerns about policies that have to be reversed,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''But any steps that the government takes will be carefully considered and will be, as I said, matched, because we want to see political and economic reform take hold.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's visit to Myanmar, where she met Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader and Nobel laureate, misstated the title of Madeleine K. Albright at the time she had sent a poster from a 1995 women's conference in Beijing autographed by Mrs. Clinton, then the First Lady, to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. Ms. Albright was the American ambassador to the United Nations; she had not yet become the Secretary of State. (That happened on Jan. 23, 1997, when she was sworn in, the first woman to hold the office.) The article also misidentified the location of the video conference with the Council on Foreign Relations. It was Washington, not New York.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Dec. 2 about Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's visit to Myanmar, where she met the opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, misstated the location of a Nov. 30 video conference on Myanmar held by the Council on Foreign Relations in which Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi had participated. It was in Washington, not in New York.

HEADLINE: Dec. 2, 1954 | Anti-Communist Senator McCarthy Is Condemned

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On Dec. 2, 1954, the United States Senate voted, 67-22, to condemn Senator Joseph R. McCarthy on two counts for conduct that "tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute." 

 BODY:
On Dec. 2, 1954, the United States Senate voted, 67-22, to condemn Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, a Republican from Wisconsin, on two counts for conduct that "tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute." The New York Times explained that he was condemned for "contempt of a Senate Elections subcommittee that investigated his conduct and financial affairs, for abuse of its members, and for his insults to the Senate itself during the censure proceeding."

The Senate's resolution used the word "condemn" rather than the traditional "censure," which sparked a debate over whether Mr. McCarthy had actually been censured -- one senator went so far as to read from Webster's Dictionary. The Times reported that, when asked if he thought he had been censured, Mr. McCarthy replied, "Well, it wasn't exactly a vote of confidence."
The condemnation was one of the final chapters in Mr. McCarthy's political career. He rose to prominence in 1950, when he declared that he had a list of names of Communists in the State Department. He spent the following years fervently trying to root out Communists in the government through Senate hearings. His tactic of making unproven accusations against political opponents, by questioning their allegiance to the United States and saying their Communist ideology or sympathy, became known as "McCarthyism."
Mr. McCarthy became one of the most powerful and feared men in Washington, but in 1954 he was forced to defend himself against charges that he had sought special privileges from the Army, which he had accused of harboring communists, on behalf of a former aide. Before Senate hearings on the matter, the CBS News journalist Edward R. Murrow hosted a program that presented Mr. McCarthy in a negative light, contributing to a public turn against the senator.
During the televised hearings, Mr. McCarthy struggled to defend himself, frequently made ad hominem attacks against his fellow senators and came across to the television audience as bullying and ill-mannered. The hearings are most remembered for an exchange between Mr. McCarthy and an Army lawyer, Joseph Welch, who said: "Have you no sense of decency sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?"
Mr. McCarthy's credibility and popularity diminished greatly as a result of the hearings. His condemnation represented a final stake in his political career. He continued serving as a senator for three years after the condemnation, but he had little power in the Senate. He died in 1957 of liver failure.
Connect to Today:
Arthur Miller's 1953 play "The Crucible" used the 17th century witch hunts in Massachusetts as an allegory for Senator McCarthy's investigations and interrogations at the time. The term "McCarthyism" is still used to describe the practice of making political or social accusations without evidence.
Consider some modern references to McCarthy and witch hunts, like the debate over the Birther movement and the criticism of the media's haste to link Representative Gabrielle Giffords's shooter to the political right.
Do you think these examples echo the McCarthy era? Why or why not? Can you think of other examples of "McCarthyism" in recent years?

HEADLINE: Week 13 Matchups: We Don't Want to Brag

BYLINE: MIKE TANIER


HIGHLIGHT: In an N.F.L. that has become increasingly self-critical, the Packers are at least daring enough to at least occasionally express pride. 

 BODY:
Packers (11-0) at Giants (6-5)
Aaron Rodgers threw for 299 yards and 3 touchdowns in a winning effort a few weeks ago, but he was not satisfied with his performance. "I didn't throw the ball very well," he said after the game, a 35-26 win over Tampa Bay on Nov. 20. "I'm not trying to be ridiculously humble right now. I'm just frustrated."
Rodgers's quotation shines a light on a major problem gripping the N.F.L.: ridiculous humility, the absurd self-denigration to which great players succumb when they avoid expressing satisfaction or joy at achieving anything short of seven straight Super Bowl championships. We have grown so used to hearing Tom Brady-types say "we still have a lot of work to do" after 38-20 victories that we fail to notice that it has transcended professionalism or constructive criticism, becoming a pantomime of masochistic self denial. With Rodgers at least addressing the ridiculous humility phenomenon and Charles Woodson acknowledging last month that an undefeated season is a desirable goal, the Packers now represent the vanguard of football honesty: the one team daring enough to occasionally express pride.
Rodgers should throw for 400 yards against a Giants defense full of rookies and backups. He may still feel frustrated after the game. Imagine how Tom Coughlin will feel. Pick: Packers.
Falcons (7-4) at Texans (8-3)
Things are falling apart in Houston, where center Chris Myers does not hold, but he does cut block. The Falcons heard the falconer and won two straight games. Multiple quarterback injuries have loosed anarchy upon the Texans, who turn to W.\x80\xAEB. Yeats - oops, T.\x80\xAEJ. Yates - to stem the blood-dimmed tide. The losses of Matt Schaub and Matt Leinart have caused the second coming of Jake Delhomme, who slouched off to Houston to sign a new contract Tuesday. Delhomme is full of passionate intensity, and he is not quite the worst: Brett Favre, with his gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, was also mentioned as a possible replacement.
A third-string quarterback has little hope against the balanced, efficient Falcons. Gary Kubiak must prepare Yates and Delhomme for an upcoming slate of winnable games against the Colts and Panthers so the Texans can clinch their division and avoid another century of stony sleep.
(Between Yates and the early-season Mike Kafka references, my editors have heroically decided to burn the office copy of "The Norton Anthology of World Literature." We promise this will not happen again.) Pick: Falcons.
Colts (0-11) at Patriots (8-3)
In what can only be interpreted as a "Producers"-like effort to be as terrible as possible, the Colts acquired their third former member of the winless 2008 Lions this week. Fullback Jerome Felton joins Dan Orlovsky - now the starting quarterback - and Ernie Sims to give the Colts a noncoincidental cluster of players who know just how an 0-16 season works. They also fired the defensive coordinator Larry Coyer for the crime of running the same defense he has run for the last two years but without being spotted 30 points by the offense. The linebackers coach Mike Murphy takes over, but only because Franz Liebkind was not available.
On top of all of their other woes, the Colts have the worst special teams in the N.F.L. Their punt returners average just 2.2 yards per return; factor in 14 fair catches, and that average drops to 1.3 yards. The primary return man, Blair White, is 2.06 yards tall, so he would be better off catching punts and falling straight forward than doing whatever he currently does. The punter-kickoff specialist Pat McAfee, meanwhile, leads the team in special teams tackles. It is good to know that one Colts player has not yet quit. Pick: Patriots.
Lions (7-4) at Saints (8-3)
The former Lions coach Steve Mariucci believes that someone besides the current coach Jim Schwartz should be assigned to discipline Ndamukong Suh, who is suspended for this game after treating a Packers lineman like a cigarette butt on Thanksgiving. Who is up to such a challenge? Supernanny? Sister Mary Stigmata from "The Blues Brothers"? If last month's heart-to-heart talk with Roger Goodell had no impact on Suh, it may be time for the "Clockwork Orange" treatment: in the event of a late hit, simply play "Ode to Joy" over the loudspeakers and watch Suh curl into the fetal position.
With Suh, the Lions had the potential to bring pressure up the middle and force Drew Brees to move out of the pocket. Without him, Brees will only suffer from his usual "which wide-open receiver should I throw to" anxiety. Pick: Saints.
Bengals (7-4) at Steelers (8-3)
Come for the division rivalry and the hard hits; stay for the wire fu. Bengals receiver Jerome Simpson paid homage to Hong Kong cinema last week when a Browns defender brushed against him after a play. Simpson flew backward about 5 yards, and the theatrics had the desired effect: the defender was penalized for unnecessary roughness. The move was so amazing that Simpson's Wikipedia page was updated with an "Acting Career" category, and the Wachowski brothers are developing a Bengals highlight project.
The Steelers get defenders LaMarr Woodley and Troy Polamalu back this week, and the Bengals must do whatever it takes to prove they can win at least once against the A.F.C. North superpowers, even if it means using the Steelers' hard-hitting reputation against them. Do not be surprised if this game descends into a production of Crouching Bengal, Hidden Steeler. Pick: Steelers.
Ravens (8-3) at Browns (4-7)
The Ravens have followed every "statement" win this season with a loss to an inferior opponent: losses to the Seahawks, the Titans and the Jaguars followed big wins against the Steelers (twice) and the Texans. So avoiding a letdown was a major topic of conversation for the Ravens after beating the 49ers on Thanksgiving. "We've got to conquer a demon in Cleveland," John Harbaugh said.
Perhaps that is why Joe Flacco now sports a Fu Manchu mustache: goofy facial hair has been known to ward off evil spirits (and women). Flacco said the new mustache was an effort to "get everybody to get on the bandwagon here on our offense. It's kind of tough convincing everybody." The Ravens' offense has never had a bandwagon, and if it did, no one would get on board with a bunch of guys who look like Mike Piazza circa 1993. Pick: Ravens.
Titans (6-5) at Bills (5-6)
If he scores a touchdown this week, Steve Johnson will lampoon the injured Titans receiver Kenny Britt with an end zone dance interpretation of a two-hour wait in the violations line of New Jersey's Motor Vehicle Commission branch in Bayonne. He will also spoof Nate Washington if he can discover anything noteworthy about Nate Washington. Bob Costas will chide Johnson for his antics and all of us for watching them, and the Titans will win after Johnson drops three easy touchdown passes and Matt Hasselbeck sets up Rod Bironas for a game-winning field goal with his longest pass of the day: a 4-yard screen to Javon Ringer. Pick: Titans.
Jets (6-5) at Redskins (4-7)
Last week Mark Sanchez became the fourth N.F.L. quarterback to throw four touchdown passes in a fourth-quarter comeback victory yet still pass for fewer than 200 yards. He was also the first quarterback since Tommy Kramer in 1979 to throw four touchdown passes in a comeback victory while completing fewer than 50 percent of his passes. (Thanks to the statistical researcher Scott Kacsmar for the data.) Whether you consider these feats proof that Sanchez is great or terrible has everything to do with your preconceptions of Sanchez, whose performances have a knack for being both a vase and two faces. Redskins quarterback Rex Grossman spent his Bears career proving that a team with a good defense can endure some pretty erratic quarterbacking, and Sanchez is determined to provide further evidence. Polarized arguments about Sanchez's merits ultimately serve only one useful purpose: they give Eli Manning a break. Pick: Jets.
Panthers (3-8) at Buccaneers (4-7)
The Desert Eagle semiautomatic handgun can produce nearly 1,800 foot-pounds of muzzle energy when fired, enough energy to blast a hole clean through the Buccaneers' playoff hopes. Quarterback Josh Freeman severely cut his finger while spending some quality time with his weapon of choice at a firing range in late October. There is nothing wrong with obliterating a few targets unless, like Freeman, you are recovering from a sprain of the same finger, prefer a weapon known for its severe recoil and need your right hand in peak condition to do your job properly. Freeman played through the finger injury, but his accuracy was off, and now he also has a shoulder injury. The backup Josh Johnson took most of the passing snaps with the first team, with Freeman limited to handoffs. If Johnson starts against Cam Newton, the two speedy quarterbacks should forget football and hold a track meet. Meanwhile, Freeman can pamper his sore shoulder by launching a few rocket-propelled grenades. Pick: Panthers.
Chiefs (4-7) at Bears (7-4)
In this edition of Overengineered Solutions to Simple Problems, we will explore various methods of designing a game plan for a backup quarterback with limited talent. The Todd Haley Method: abandon the downfield passing game entirely and install a Wildcat-like package with a backup cornerback taking snaps from center. The Mike Martz Method: cram the game plan with elaborate, complicated screen passes, then use your best running back as a deep receiver instead of just handing him the ball. The Common Sense Method - employing better backups than Tyler Palko and Caleb Hanie in the first place, then showing a little confidence in them while scaling the game plan back slightly - is too simplistic and effective for the modern N.F.L. offensive guru. Pick: Bears. 
Raiders (7-4) at Dolphins (3-8)
The Raiders are 7-4 for the first time since 2002, the last season they went to the Super Bowl. Isn't that great news, cornerback Stanford Routt? "Seven-and-four is also a gift and a curse. Right now we're still leading the division. If we go in and pee down our leg and wind up finishing second in the division, it's going to be an embarrassment." Buddy, the Chargers are way ahead of you in that department. The surprising point spread is the result of Raiders injuries: running back Darren McFadden and several receivers are hobbled, forcing the Raiders to try to win with defense, special teams and Routt's lukewarm brand of optimism. Pick: Dolphins.
Broncos (6-5) at Vikings (2-9)
The Vikings were facing a midweek blackout: 3,000 tickets remained for this game on Wednesday, despite a visit from the football equivalent of Justin Bieber. The Vikings are trying to float a stadium referendum, but if fans will not pay to see Tim Tebow, what hope does the team have of selling them on Christian Ponder? The Vikings ended up purchasing the tickets themselves, and the 3,000 fans who received them will be asked to either try out as long snappers so Jared Allen can stop doing it or form a human chain to try to stop Von Miller. Pick: Broncos.
Rams (2-9) at 49ers (9-2)

The 49ers clinch the N.F.C. West with a win, but that does not mean Jim Harbaugh will start resting starters. "We've got five games to play and they'll all be critical," he said Tuesday. Also, taking a full month off is not resting, it's unemployment. Instead of spending December mall-hopping, the 49ers must work on their pass protection: Alex Smith was sacked nine times by the Ravens, and Harbaugh broke the sacks down into a 3-by-3 matrix of miscues. "Three of them we got beat on the protection call," he said, adding, "Three other times we got physically beat. And then maybe there were two other ones Alex could've gotten rid of it quicker." That is only eight, but N.F.L. coaches do not like to quibble about statistics. Pick: 49ers.
Cowboys (7-4) at Cardinals (4-7)
Kevin Kolb is expected to return for the Cardinals, and not a moment too soon. The team succumbed to the latest N.F.L. Wildcat neurosis, the cornerback-as-quarterback phenomenon, when Patrick Peterson lined up to take a shotgun snap last week. He fumbled it. "Right when I was securing the ball into my right hand, my knee hit the tail end of the ball and that kind of popped it out," he said. "But, man, if I had the opportunity to hang on to that ball, I believe I was going the distance." Yes, it would have been huge, had the ball not bounced off his knee and dribbled four yards downfield. In his official statistics, Peterson gets credit for recovering the fumble, but not for forcing it. Pick: Cowboys.
Chargers (4-7) at Jaguars (3-8)
The Jaguars fired Jack Del Rio, announced the sale of their franchise, and extended the contract of General Manager Gene Smith in the course of about six hours Tuesday. It was as if they were trying to get three years' worth of headlines out of the way in one morning so we could all go back to ignoring them. The lesson from Del Rio's firing: it is better to accept responsibility for your late-game decisions, no matter how mind-bogglingly foolish, than to blame them on your offensive coordinator. Norv Turner is living, gainfully-employed proof. Pick: Chargers.

A recent article by Vikas Bajaj about India's labor market has sparked a fierce debate about the difference between American and the Indian capitalism. We would like to know what you think and invite you to pose questions to Manish Sabharwal, the chairman of TeamLease, the company profiled in the article.
Mr. Sabharwal, whom some politicians and labor unions accuse of running "the nation's largest illegal business," employs 60,000 temporary workers who have become an increasingly vital part of India's fast-growth industries, from manufacturing to hospitality to sales. Temporary employment helps businesses avoid India's cumbersome labor laws, which can make it difficult to manage, pay and lay off workers. But the contract-employment workaround often leaves workers without benefits or job security. 
We would like to know what you think about this part of the Indian economy: Do you think labor laws have an impact on job creation? Or do you believe that businesses have improperly subverted them? If you have worked as a contract worker or side-by-side with one or more, what are your impressions of the current system? What three or five changes would you recommend for the Indian labor market?
Leave your comments and questions below. You can also send your questions directly to us at IndiaInk@nytimes.com We'll post responses starting on Monday.

HEADLINE: Now Reading | 'DarkMarket'

BYLINE: STEPHEN HEYMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Misha Glenny staked out the profane, male-dominated Internet underworld, where cybercriminals take credit card fraud to new heights. 

 BODY:
If style, per Gore Vidal, is about not giving a damn, then one might say cybercriminals have lots of style. "DarkMarket" (Knopf, $27), the new book by the T contributor Misha Glenny, disturbingly catalogs the capabilities of these nefarious Internet trolls - imagine, as Glenny does, that they could not only clog your in-box and steal your financial identity but attack your government, cripple your power grid or disable your national banking system. Still, the most common illicit activity on the Interwebs - pornography aside - seems to be some form of personal credit card fraud. In fact, Glenny's title, "DarkMarket," comes from the name of a Web site where thousands of hackers coordinated the cloning and selling of credit card numbers and pins, often culled from illegally placed "skimmers" in A.T.M.'s and card machines. The site was infiltrated by an F.B.I. agent and taken down in 2008, resulting in many arrests.
Glenny tells the story not just of DarkMarket's undoing but of its genesis, its pathbreaking precursors and its intriguing bedfellows (among them, the purveyors of other dark digital arts, like cyberwarfare and cyberespionage). Commingling politics, economics and culture, his book goes from cruddy Internet cafes in London to sleek restaurants in Istanbul, from the high-tech corporate campuses around Pittsburgh to the garishly luxe Odessa Hotel on the Black Sea.
In some ways, the cyberthieves Glenny finds at the ends of the earth conform to your image of sniveling, amoral nerds. Ninety-six percent of them are male. "Your average cybercriminal has the manners of a chimpanzee and the tongue of a Sicilian fishwife," Glenny writes. One notorious Polish spammer took on the nom de guerre Master Splyntr, a "typically adolescent reference to the rat who trained the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." Since the hackers can literally make money out of thin air, many of them become spendthrifts. Glenny tells of a gaggle of Swedish cybercriminals who set upon Monte Carlo with a dozen cloned American Express Centurion cards, collectively withdrawing $400,000 in a single weekend. "Nobody challenged us once," says one of the Swedes. "You got the feeling that people did this sort of thing all the time."
RedBrigade, the handle of a hacker who split his time between a tony Upper East Side apartment and hotels like the Four Seasons, tells Glenny that in a period of about two weeks he took his cloned bank cards to several branches of Washington Mutual and withdrew over $300,000 in cash. "Just as well," Glenny writes, "because his average weekly outgoings were in the region of $70,000. First-class travel was axiomatic. He thought as much about purchasing a $10,000 Breitling watch as we might before buying a newspaper." Many of these hackers view their crimes as victimless - individual cardholders are often not liable if their accounts are compromised - but Glenny justly notes that "such sentimental, populist twaddle conveniently overlooks how banks pass on the costs of fraud to their customers," often in the form of more and higher fees.
Though their crimes are often brazen, many in this strange new breed take cover in one of the Internet's earliest temptations: the ease of masking true identities. ("This was by no means restricted to the criminal world," Glenny writes. "Dating sites were already home to some of the most sustained and intense mendacity in history.") Take the case of the "fiendish Devilman," who in chat logs would project himself as a "young fast-living ladeez' man" but upon his arrest, in the English town of Doncaster, was revealed to be be John McHugh, a man in his early 60s who, before being taken away in shackles, asked the police, "Would you mind if I go and put my dentures in first?"

TOP STORIES 
Zynga Aims to Raise $1 Billion | Zynga, the online gaming company, has set the price range for its initial public offering at $8.50 to $10 a share, a highly anticipated debut that could value the company at $7 billion
At the top end of that range, the four-year-old company is on track to raise $1 billion, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. Its underwriters also have the option to sell an additional 15 million shares if demand is strong.
Zynga, which is set to sell 100 million shares, or 14.3 percent of its total, is offering a bigger stake than many Internet companies that have gone public this year. Several start-ups, like Groupon and LinkedIn, have sold less than 10 percent of total shares in their I.P.O.s. That strategy of constrained supply has allowed many to soar on their first day of trading, but it has also increased volatility.

For Wall Street Watchdog, All Grunt Work, Little Glory | In an office park 20 miles outside Washington, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's nonprofit self-regulator, has quietly built a small army of market police. Since Wall Street's financial crisis in 2008, this fledgling fraud task force has entered the front lines of fighting insider trading, even if the group rarely earns the credit.
Finra's fraud group is akin to being the sous chef to the Securities and Exchange Commission and other government regulators: the team prepares evidence against America's most-wanted traders, but receives little of the glory when the cases are served.
"We identify the dots so other people can connect them," said Cameron Funkhouser, an executive vice president at Finra and the head of the insider trading group, known in regulatory speak as the Office of Fraud Detection and Market Intelligence. "We're a clearinghouse of regulatory intelligence."

The Fed Gets 'Daily Show' Treatment | Jon Stewart on "The Daily Show" took a look at the recent Bloomberg News report that banks earned an estimated $13 billion on secret, low-interest loans from the Federal Reserve as the financial crisis unfolded.

"Where is this window? Because when I go to the bank, I have to use the inexplicable fee window," he said. "Our government," he added, "is the world's dumbest loan shark."

HEADLINE: Wall St. Groups Sue Regulator to Challenge New Trading Rule

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association contend that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission failed to evaluate the economic impact of its position limits rule. 

 BODY:
9:06 p.m. | Updated 
Wall Street sought to deliver another blow to the financial regulatory overhaul on Friday, as two industry trade groups sued a federal regulator over a new rule restricting speculative trading.
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association filed a lawsuit challenging the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's so-called position limits rule.
The agency adopted the rule in October to cap the number of contracts a trader can hold on 28 commodities. The vote was an important step in the Obama administration's effort to enforce the Dodd-Frank overhaul.
But in the complaint filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, Sifma and I.S.D.A. argue that the commission erred when it completed the rule, contending that it failed to evaluate the rule's economic impact on Wall Street.
"The evidence is overwhelming that position limits are, at best, unnecessary and may, at worst, negatively impact commodity markets and users," Conrad Voldstad, the I.S.D.A. chief executive, said in a statement. A joint statement by Mr. Voldstad and T. Timothy Ryan Jr., Sifma's leader, called the rule "poorly crafted" and based on "an incorrect reading of the law."
It is unclear what will be the next step in the legal battle. A spokesman for the commodities commission declined to comment though Congressional supporters of Dodd-Frank chided the industry groups for bringing the lawsuit. "The financial industry tried to water down Dodd-Frank before it was enacted, has been trying to chip away at it since it became law, and is continuing that effort with this lawsuit," Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said in a statement.
The lawsuit is the latest indication that Wall Street is shifting fronts in the battle over Dodd-Frank, moving from backroom lobbying to the courtroom. A federal appeals court in July struck down the Securities and Exchange Commission's so-called proxy access rule, a Dodd-Frank policy that would have made it easier for shareholders to nominate company directors. The court ruled that the S.E.C.'s cost-benefit analysis on the rule was inadequate.
The decision incited fear among regulators, and even caused several agencies to re-examine their Dodd-Frank rules. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, mindful of possible legal challenges, delayed voting on its position limits rule on multiple occasions. The agency also agreed to delay the enforcement of many new position limits for at least a year.
But Wall Street lobbyists say the rule did not improve with time. The I.S.D.A. and Sifma note that Dodd-Frank leaves it to regulators to enforce position limits only "as appropriate." The groups pushed regulators to interpret the fine print to mean that in essence, no limits were appropriate.
Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the agency who is the chief advocate of the position limits rule, aimed to rebut those claims earlier this year. Mr. Chilton, in a speech in September at a United Nations panel, argued that Wall Street was "trying to dance on the head of a legal pin."
Still, the lawsuit filed Friday accused the agency of writing an inadequate cost-benefit analysis and not allowing the industry to adequately comment on the rule proposal. The commission was inundated with letters about the position limits plan - about 15,000 comments.
The rule's supporters promote the rule as the nation's best hope for protecting consumers from speculative commodities trading. Over the last few years, the financial industry has increased its speculation in the futures market. At the same time, the prices of the underlying commodities have fluctuated wildly, driving up energy costs and food prices. The rule would set limits on traders accumulating position in commodities, including energy products and metals, like oil and gold. Previously, the limits covered only nine agricultural commodities, including corn.
The decision to challenge the rule in the courts, while significant, is hardly surprising. Over the last year, several financial trade groups have issued thinly veiled threats of legal action. In March, the Futures Industry Association urged the commission to drop its position limits plan, saying it "may be legally infirm."
When the commission voted on the rule in October, the agency was fiercely divided, with three Democratic commissioners voting for the crackdown and its two Republicans voting against it.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Eulogizes Aide Who Led Office for Disabled

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: The mayor praised Matthew P. Sapolin's accomplishments during his nine years leading the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities. Mr. Sapolin helped develop guidelines for architects to build accessible spaces and led an effort to freeze rents for some disabled New Yorkers. 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg paid tribute on Friday to a close aide, Matthew P. Sapolin, his disabilities commissioner, who died of cancer on Tuesday at age 41. At a funeral at St. Patrick's Cathedral, the mayor praised Mr. Sapolin, who was blind from the age of 5 as a result of his cancer, as someone who refused to feel sorry for himself and who fought up until the end of his life to improve the lives of disabled New Yorkers.
With a nod to the death of his own father when Mr. Bloomberg was 21, the mayor told Mr. Sapolin's children, Trevor and Toscany, that their father would want them "to continue living your lives to the fullest."
"Have a smile on your face, tell jokes, have a good time, be a little bit serious about work as well, but he would not want you to feel sorry for him,'' the mayor continued, his voice sounding choked with emotion. "He'd want you to remember the good things and go out and make him proud." 
The crowd gathered in the soaring cathedral on Fifth Avenue included a number of city officials, among them Deputy Mayor Caswell F. Holloway and several commissioners; as they exited, many of them were red-eyed. The service was led by the cathedral's rector, Msgr. Robert T. Ritchie. An interpreter translated all the speakers' remarks - as well as the hymns - into sign language.
The mayor said that Mr. Sapolin refused to accept limitations, starting his own band when his teachers prevented him from trying out for his school's percussion ensemble, and captaining the wrestling team at New York University after his junior high school would not allow him to wrestle. 
"He took the events or conditions that you and I might consider impediments and didn't shy away from them - he owned them and marshaled them to his advantage," Mr. Bloomberg said. "Nothing could stop him."
The mayor praised Mr. Sapolin's accomplishments during his nine years leading the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities. Mr. Sapolin helped develop guidelines for architects to build accessible spaces and led an effort to freeze rents for some disabled New Yorkers.
The mayor directed his most personal comments to Mr. Sapolin's children, his mother, Miriam, and his wife, Candra.
Noting that Ms. Sapolin used to call Mr. Sapolin her "personal GPS" because he could always direct her when she was driving and lost, the mayor told her that her husband was "still here guiding you."
"He's still here guiding us all - with, presumably, his old friend Compass at his side," the mayor said, again sounding slightly overcome as he referred to Mr. Sapolin's longtime seeing-eye dog, who had died previously.
Rebounding with a joke, the mayor added: "Compass shed more than any dog I ever met in my life. You could walk in a room with Compass and right away be covered."

HEADLINE: Podcast: Econometrics, Bailouts, Jobs and Mankiw

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen. 

 BODY:
The economics profession has been blamed for failing to predict the global financial crisis, much less prepare for it or resolve it.
Thomas J. Sargent and Christopher A. Sims, who are to receive the Nobel prize in economics in Stockholm on Dec. 10, have been thrust into the spotlight at a very awkward time. 
In a discussion with David Gillen on the new Weekend Business podcast, I explain how the two men rose to their current eminence and what their contribution to economics has been.
As I write in an article on the cover of Sunday Business, neither economist favors giving simple prescriptive advice about complex problems. But both have influenced the thinking of policy makers in governments and the central banks, and they have helped advance the technical ability of econometricians. They've also been embraced by conservatives, although they say they are actually lifelong Democrats.
In a separate conversation, Gretchen Morgenson discusses new information about bank bailouts during the financial crisis, the subject of a report by Bloomberg News, and of her column in Sunday Business.

Catherine Rampell talks about a drop in the unemployment rate in the United States, from 9.0 to 8.6 percent in October. Much of the reduction appears to be a result of people leaving the labor force, although 120,000 new jobs were created during the month.
And Greg Mankiw, the Harvard economist, writes about being a target of an Occupy demonstration. Students walked out of his lecture class, protesting what they considered a conservative bias in his teaching. He explains his thinking about economics and about the protest, and invites those students who are still missing to return.
 You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Catherine Rampell on the jobs report (29:25); news headlines (25:33); Jeff Sommer and David Gillen on the Nobel laureates (22:26); Gretchen Morgenson on bank bailouts (12:27); Greg Mankiw on the Occupy movement (6:44); the week ahead (1:18).

HEADLINE: The State of the Union Is Bad

BYLINE: TED WIDMER


HIGHLIGHT: Lincoln, in his first "annual message" to the nation 150 years ago, found some hope amid the grimness. 

 BODY:
On Dec. 3, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln delivered his first Annual Message, the equivalent of our modern State of the Union. In the 19th century, presidents summarized progress at the end of the year rather than the beginning, which gives a little more perspective on things. The phrase "the State of the Union" dates from 1934, when Franklin D. Roosevelt used it for the first time. Nor was it spoken, as it has been, generally, since Woodrow Wilson chose to travel down Pennsylvania Avenue and deliver his message verbally in 1913. (Jimmy Carter sent his in in 1981, a confession that things had not gone so well.) Instead, Lincoln composed a long written document, and sent it to Congress. 
The delivery of the Annual Message of 1861 may have lacked the pomp and circumstance we have come to expect - it was simply read and entered into the record by a clerk. But Lincoln had turned in another remarkable effort, the longest product of his pen since the Special Message of July 4. It lacks the crystalline perfection of the Gettysburg Address, the moral grandeur of the Second Inaugural, the legal impact of the Emancipation Proclamation. It is what it is - a long government document, reporting dutifully from the executive branch to the legislative, on the year that had just passed. But the Annual Message was instantly noteworthy for two reasons: 1861 wasthe worst year in American history, and the author was Abraham Lincoln. 
There have been other dismal years; 1929 and 2001 were awful in their way. But 1861 was an by any measure. Eleven states had seceded and were in open rebellion. The mighty Union forces had inflicted little damage on the Confederacy, and scattered ignominiously at Bull Run. The Trent affair was poisoning relations with Britain. Congress was making noise about asserting control over a war that was not going well. Lincoln's challenge was the same that has confronted all presidents before and since; how to report honestly, while avoiding gloom and finding kernels of inspiration here and there. But what is the state of the union when the union barely exists? 
Setting out to answer that question, Lincoln began solemnly, using the language of a preacher, expressing "great gratitude to God for unusual good health, and most abundant harvests." Then he stated the case plainly: "A disloyal portion of the American people have, during the whole year, been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union." 
From there, he surveyed the horizon, beginning with foreign policy. He expressed relief that other nations had not openly supported the Confederacy (which he never called by that name). Witheringly, he condemned the South's assumption that its economic strength would bring alliances, as if nations have no "higher principles" than making money. 
Then he went into a long list of recommendations and announcements for Congress. 
 He asked for help protecting America's borders from "foreign dangers."
 He asked that railroads be quickly built connecting sympathetic sections of middle states - East Tennessee and western North Carolina - to the rest of the union.
 He took advantage of the relative absence of Southerners to propose a modest-sounding change that was revolutionary - sending U.S. diplomats to Haiti and Liberia, where they would presumably have to enter into normal social relations with their counterparts, and by so doing, acknowledge people of African descent as their equals. With veiled sarcasm, Lincoln wrote, "If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it." For over 50 years, the United States had refused to recognize Haiti.
 He reported on a balanced budget - revenues ($86,835,900.27) exceeded expenditures ($84,578,834.47) for the previous fiscal year.
 He proposed some improvements in the system of circuit courts, which varied widely from one state to another
 He proposed that a department of agriculture be created, to represent "the largest interest of the nation"
 He announced the successful organization of the territories of Colorado, Dakota and Nevada
 He voiced sympathy for a plan by which recently freed slaves would form a colony, perhaps in a newly acquired territory
 He neither embraced nor rejected recent murmurs in Congress that the slaves should be quickly emancipated, but retained his right to do so in the fullness of time. Specifically, Lincoln wrote, "The Union must be preserved, and hence, all indispensable means must be employed. We should not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are indispensable." That was classic Lincoln - too slow for some, but on his way to the Emancipation Proclamation when circumstances were favorable.
Having worked through his litany of good governance, Lincoln changed his tone. In the voice of a historian, he remembered his entry into the presidency, and the extraordinary events since then, recounting the story of a year that had changed everything. 
"What was painfully uncertain then, is much better defined and more distinct now," he began, and told of setbacks, and the slow stirring of unionism in crucial places like "noble little Delaware," Maryland, Missouri, Kentucky and western Virginia, where "winter closes in on the Union people," leaving them "masters of their own country." 
Discussing his generals, Lincoln thanked Winfield Scott for his long service, and ominously praised his new commander in chief, George McClellan, by saying, "it has been said that one bad general is better than two good ones." (Thanks for the recommendation!)
A normal president would have ended the Annual Message with a few platitudes. But Lincoln was stirred to higher reflection, and in so doing, he was almost certainly answering Jefferson Davis, who had written a "President's Message" of his own on Nov. 18. 
Davis had taken a hysterical tone, accusing the Union forces of rape, arson and plunder, and turned the contest into something of a personal struggle between him and Lincoln: 
"Our people now look with contemptible astonishment on those with whom they had been so recently associated. They shrink with aversion from the very idea of renewing such a connection. When they see a President making war without the assent of Congress; when they behold judges threatened because they maintain the writ of habeas corpus so sacred to freemen; when they see justice and law trampled under the armed heel of military authority, and upright men and innocent women dragged to distant dungeons upon the mere edict of a despot they believe that there must be some radical incompatibility between such a people and themselves." 
There were inconsistencies in the Davis message; at one point, he insisted that the South would develop a "steadily increasing capacity" to provide its own needs, at another, he disdained "the industrial system of the world, which may carry suffering to other lands as well as to our own." Of course, the greatest inconsistency was that he claimed to be fighting for "Liberty," "self-government" and "the unconquerable will to be free." 
Lincoln could not let that challenge go unheeded. In response, he concluded his message with a few paragraphs on the dignity of labor. If his earlier comments on the balanced budget held out inspiration for today's Tea Party, here was some red meat for Occupy Wall Street: 
"Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between labor and capital, producing mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that relation." 
Davis had made the contest personal; now Lincoln answered in a deeply personal way; not by attacking Davis, but by remembering his own poverty. If we can wonder why this Southern-born politician developed such a powerful hostility to slavery, we need only listen to him on the value of working for oneself: 
"Many independent men everywhere in these States, a few years back in their lives, were hired laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the world, labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself; then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just, and generous, and prosperous system, which opens the way to all - gives hope to all, and consequent energy, and progress, and improvement of condition to all. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty - none less inclined to take, or touch, aught which they have not honestly earned." 
Having finished his labor, Lincoln closed, remembering that they were fighting not only for the United States of 1861, but for a "vast future" when the population would be 250 million - in other words, for the America of roughly 1992. Eight days later, he would shore up his relationship with Congress by visiting the Senate chamber in person - one congressman estimated that it had been 25 years since the last presidential visit. That, too, hinted at the future, and the day when presidents would travel down Pennsylvania Avenue to bring their news to the American people. 
Historians haven't paid too much attention to this long and often tedious speech (David Donald called it "perfunctory"). But once again, Lincoln had found something worth fighting for. By reporting honestly on a bad year, and restating that nations do indeed have higher principles, he planted a few seeds of hope before winter set in.

HEADLINE: Can We Get Serious?

BYLINE: GIL TROY


HIGHLIGHT: The recipe for a substantial presidential campaign is hard to follow. 

 BODY:
To select someone worthy of sitting in George Washington's chair, sleeping in Abraham Lincoln's bed and governing from Franklin Roosevelt's desk, Americans crave a substantial presidential campaign, as long as they don't have to endure too many boring speeches. Like every human decision-making process, presidential campaigns seesaw between the serious and the silly. 
Recent breakthroughs in neuroscience, political science and the dismal science demonstrate what we know intuitively, that human decision-making involves our heads and our hearts. We are neither fully rational nor totally emotional. Similarly, campaigns fluctuate between profound policy exchanges and trivial personality clashes, between significant indicators of future presidential performance and serious idiocy.
A substantial campaign is most likely when history conspires to offer high stakes with stark choices or an incumbent seeks reelection (and it helps if the candidates avoid defining gaffes or temper tantrums). Re-election campaigns in particular are usually well-focused, because at least one nominee presents a defined track record.
The 2012 campaign seems primed to be portentous, with an embattled incumbent confronting an opponent from an ideologically-charged party amid economic turmoil. But every campaign, no matter how high-minded, flirts daily with farce. "Unfortunately, when you run for the presidency your wife's hair or your hair or something else always becomes of major significance," John F. Kennedy said, when Walter Cronkite asked about his forelock. "I don't think it's a great issue, though, in 1960." Actually, the Kennedys' good looks brought John Kennedy great political luck.
The first substantial presidential campaign - which brought about America's first transition from a ruling party to the opposition - also teetered between frivolity and philosophy. An ugly brawl between two founding fathers preceded the great deadlock of 1800, which you may remember hearing about during the election standoff in 2000. Federalists called Vice President Thomas Jefferson an atheist, a libertine, a traitor, "the infidel." Democratic-Republicans called the short, fat pompous president, John Adams, "His Rotundity." But the election also contrasted Adams' centralized government championing industrial development against Jefferson's vision of limited government with limited growth.
The 1800 election was the first to show how presidential re-election campaigns crystallize issues and polarize positions. A challenger need not be as doctrinaire as Barry Goldwater to offer "a choice not an echo," when pitting boundless hopes against a first-term president's adjustments to reality. Running for re-election in 1936, Franklin Roosevelt admitted there would be only one issue: "It's myself, and people must either be for me or against me." Running a referendum on Roosevelt, the Republican candidate, Alfred M. Landon, called himself "the direct antithesis of the present executive."
Winners beware, though. The binary choice most American elections offer frequently overstates differences and oversimplifies results, especially when presidents win re-election. Most of the twentieth-century's most lopsided wins kept incumbents like Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan in power, but frequently helped spawn the dreaded second-term curse.
Even landslides do not offer the political equivalent of a blank check, however much it might feel that way. Roosevelt overstepped during his second term, especially when he tried packing the Supreme Court. He wrongly interpreted his 523-8 electoral-vote triumph as a more sweeping mandate for his New Deal than voters intended. Lyndon Johnson went from feeling, "for the first time in all my life," truly "loved by the American people," marveling at "millions upon millions of people, each one marking my name on their ballot, each one wanting me as their president," to being hounded out of office.
Sometimes campaigns turn serious by coinciding with serious trouble, especially impending wars, ongoing hostilities or economic busts. Voters in 1860, in choosing Abraham Lincoln, knew that they were empowering abolitionists and risking war. Four years later, a worried President Lincoln needed battlefield victories to woo voters who were doubting him and his war. Ultimately, bullets swayed the ballots as General William T. Sherman's conquest of Atlanta two months before Election Day helped vindicate Lincoln's war strategy, leading to his re-election.
While wartime campaigns often become votes of confidence - or no confidence - regarding the incumbent, the downswing in an American business cycle often yields an upswing in surprisingly theoretical, intensely polemical, debates about American capitalism. During a recession, suddenly everyone is an economics major - or a philosopher. The Panic of 1893 triggered 1896's "Battle of the Standards." Americans escalated arcane questions about valuing paper money, silver coins and gold into a searing philosophical divide that stirred fears of civil war. The major parties nominated candidates with contrasting stands. Converting from currency to morality, William McKinley, the Republican goldbug, said "The American people hold the financial honor of our country as sacred as our flag." And catapulting from economics to metaphysics, William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic-Populist silverbug defending "the producing masses of this nation and the world" famously cried: "You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold." One Republican, John Hay, moaned: "The whole country has been set to talking about coinage - a matter utterly unfit for public discussion."
Still, good intentions and clear visions do not guarantee Solomonic deliberations. In 1964, insisting that "I'm not one of those baby-kissing, hand-shaking, blintz-eating candidates," Senator Barry Goldwater envisioned a "lofty, rational presentation of contending beliefs" against President Lyndon Johnson. Goldwater loved his campaign slogan: "In your heart, you know he's right." But with Democrats sneering "In your guts, you know he's nuts," and his numbers tanking, Goldwater retaliated. By October he was snarling "Would you buy a used car from Lyndon?" and saying all Johnson did was "lie and lie and lie" - although the patriotic senator recoiled when crowds, riled by his rhetoric, booed the president. Time magazine deemed the 1964 campaign "disappointing."
Just as ideologues can end up mudslinging, moderates do not necessarily sling mush. Mocking moderates is a great American tradition. Some, like Lewis Cass, the Democrats' compromise nominee in 1848, earn the contempt. As Americans polarized over slavery, Cass ran as a "doughface," a Northern man who molded his politics to satisfy Southerners, impressing few, alienating many. "And he who still for Cass can be," one Whig wrote, "he is a Cass without the C."
America also enjoys a rich tradition of muscular moderates. Barack Obama has already shown he can run an exciting, crisp campaign from the center. In 2008, both parties nominated centrist senators seeking the swing voters who could sway the election. These crucial voters, like the Reagan Democrats and the Clinton soccer moms before them, made a clear choice, this time for Obama. Interesingtly, even though both Obama and John McCain played to the center, they clashed on foreign affairs, economic policy and governing philosophy, and in the process they offered voters two quite distinct alternatives.
The history of presidential campaigning reveals the ingredients that yield substantial campaigns, including a charged historical context, clashing world views and coherent candidacies. Still, every candidate remains one slip of the tongue, one gotcha question, one feeding frenzy, away from the chaos that overwhelms so many campaigns. Americans genuinely yearn for an ideal democratic exercise, one-part university seminar, one-part town hall. Yet the blood rushes, the pulse quickens, interest peaks, when campaigning turns ugly, emotional, personal. The contradictions of popular politics, meaning mass democratic decision-making, don't just mirror but magnify our all-too-human contradictions as personal decision-makers.

HIGHLIGHT: Though the outcome on the payroll tax battle is yet to be determined by Congress, Democrats are counting it a success in the message war. 

 BODY:
Today's Times:

        
Casting around for an economic message that resonates, Democrats have seized on the payroll tax fightto depict the Republicans as more interested in putting the wealthy first, Jackie Calmes reports. While the outcome remains to be seen, Democrats are already counting this message battle as a victory.

        
A month before primary season begins, many Republicans are torn over whether to support Mitt Romney or wait and see if a strong alternative develops.

HEADLINE: Opinion Report: Ted Stevens

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A summary of what's on today's editorial page. 

 BODY:
Olga Bloom, who created one of the city's premier venues for chamber music, Bargemusic, died on Thanksgiving Day at the age of 92.
The elections in Egypt this week drew millions to the polls--proof that Egytians have no interest in swapping Mubarak's secular dictatorship for a religious one.
The Federal Reserve's offer to swap dollars for euros at low interest rates indicates that American policy makers understand the gravity of Europe's turmoil. Germany, however, continues to delay action, which could doom the currency union.

An inquiry into the 2008 trial of Senator Ted Stevens has found "serious, widespread and at times intentional" concealment of evidence by the Justice Department that could have helped the senator prove his innocence.
A Washington Post editorial also discusses the newly released Ted Stevens inquiry, focusing on whether "punishment will befall the prosecutors who committed these egregious violations." Because the presiding judge "did not issue an order directing the prosecutors to abide by the law," they will likely avoid charges for criminal contempt of court. There are other ways, however, to hold the "wrongdoers" accountable: The state bar associations that licensed these lawyers should consider disbarment.

HEADLINE: New Pollution Rules for Boilers and Incinerators

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: The E.P.A. announces a slight watering down of proposed rules on toxic air pollution that were significantly scaled back earlier this year. 

 BODY:
 The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday released its much-delayed and oft-revised . The proposal is a modest refashioning of boiler rules unveiled earlier this year, which were themselves a major revision of a 2010 plan by the agency that drew heavy political and industry opposition.
 The E.P.A. has been recalibrating its approach to pollution regulation in recent months after President Obama made it clear that he was going to give close scrutiny to rules that impose heavy compliance costs on businesses and local governments. In September, he rejected a major E.P.A. proposal on smog-causing pollutants, saying the cost was too high in a fragile economy.
 Gina McCarthy, head of the E.P.A.'s office of air and radiation, said Friday that the new rules for boilers and incinerators were written to minimize costs and maximize benefits. She noted that the costs of putting the rules into effect would be 50 percent lower than the original plan that was issued last year and then pulled back after a broad bipartisan outcry.

 She said that 99 percent of the 1.5 million boilers in the United States would be exempt from the new rules or could meet them simply by performing routine maintenance and tune-ups. Only a fraction of the 14,000 boilers that are major sources of mercury, soot and other pollutants will be required to install abatement equipment, she said.
The E.P.A. had previously estimated the cost of compliance at about $2 billion a year, with health and other benefits of $27 billion to $67 billion.
 "With this action, E.P.A. is applying the right standards to the right boilers," Ms. McCarthy said in a press release. "Gathering the latest and best real-world information is leading to practical, affordable air pollution safeguards that will provide the vital and overdue health protection that Americans deserve."
 She said the new standards would prevent as many as 8,100 premature deaths, 5,100 heart attacks and 52,000 asthma attacks a year by 2015.
 The American Lung Association encouraged the E.P.A. to move forward with the proposal as written, with no further delay or dilution. "It is past time to move forward with these lifesaving standards," the association said in a statement. "For the past two decades, the cleanup of toxic air pollution from boilers has been delayed, allowing these industries to pollute communities across the nation."
The American Lung Association encourages the E.P.A. to uphold its responsibility as required by the Clean Air Act and clean up toxic air pollution from these boilers to protect public health from mercury and other dangerous air toxics," it said.
 The agency will take public comment on the proposed rule for 60 days and expects to finalize the regulation in April 2012.

HEADLINE: Trump to Moderate Republican Debate

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: Donald Trump will moderate a Republican presidential debate in Iowa next month sponsored by Newsmax, the conservative magazine and Web site. 

 BODY:
It's officially a reality television Republican primary now.
Donald Trump is pairing up with Newsmax, the conservative magazine and news Web site, to moderate a presidential debate in Des Moines on Dec. 27.
"Our readers and the grass roots really love Trump," said Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media. "They may not agree with
him on everything, but they don't see him as owned by the Washington establishment, the media establishment."

Mr. Trump's role in the debate, which will be broadcast on the cable network Ion Television, is sure to be one of the more memorable moments in a primary season that has already delivered its fair share of circus-like spectacle.
Mr. Trump's own flirtation with running for president this year seems almost quaint (whose birth certificate was he all worked up about?) compared with more recent distractions - like allegations of adultery and sexual harassment, gaffes that seemed scripted from a late-night comedy show, and a six-figure line of credit at Tiffany & Co.
But despite being derided by liberals - President Obama likened Mr. Trump to a "carnival barker" for his repeated assertions that the president was actually foreign-born - the real estate mogul is seriously influential in many Republican Party circles. And that sway seems especially deep with the party's conservative base, which will be a decisive factor in the early primaries that are likely to determine the nominee. The debate, which unlike many recent ones will not be limited to a specific topic like national security or the economy, is set to happen just a week before the Iowa caucuses.
Newsmax sent candidates the invitation on Friday afternoon. It began, "We are pleased to cordially invite you to "The Newsmax Ion Television 2012 Presidential Debate," moderated by a truly great American, Mr. Donald J. Trump." Spokesmen for several candidates did not immediately respond to questions from The New York Times about whether they would accept.
Though presidential candidates may initially balk at the idea of appearing in a debate where Mr. Trump - with his bombast and The Hair - is the one posing the questions, they may ultimately see it as an invitation they can't refuse. In fact many of the candidates have already met with him, some more publicly than others. Representative Michele Bachmann has sat down with Mr. Trump several times this year. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas had dinner with him at Jean Georges, the posh Manhattan restaurant. And Mitt Romney paid a visit but carefully avoided being photographed.
And Newsmax is a powerful player itself. It has a broad reach into the conservative base, with monthly Web traffic second only to Fox News among sites with conservative-leaning audiences.
Mr. Trump has been a popular attraction at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual gathering in Washington. He was such a successful presence in the eyes of Fox News executives that they added a special weekly segment to their morning show "Fox and Friends" for him called "Mondays With Trump."
Whether his professed presidential ambitions are genuine or merely a publicity stunt seems not to matter in terms of the news media attention Mr. Trump can command. His highly publicized flirtation with running this year coincided with a Trump-branded product that stood to benefit from all the attention - a new season of his highly rated NBC show "Celebrity Apprentice."
The arc of his noncampaign was similar in 1987 and 1999 - when Mr. Trump also said that he was considering running for president, episodes that are often forgotten.
His book ''Trump: The Art of the Deal'' was published in November 1987 and reached The New York Times best-seller list by December. But by the time the Republican National Convention rolled around in August 1988, he had opted out.
''Everybody wants me to do it,'' he declared then. ''But I have no interest in doing it.''
And in late 1999, just before his book ''The America We Deserve'' went on sale, he began courting support as a candidate on the Reform Party ticket. He even toured the country with his girlfriend, Melania Knauss, now his wife. The outcome? You guessed it.

HEADLINE: DealBook's Week in Review

BYLINE: ERIC OWLES


HIGHLIGHT: A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance. 

 BODY:
 A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance.
Mergers & Acquisitions
DEALBOOK COLUMN Andrew Ross Sorkin reports that AT&T has been secretly working on an 11th-hour plan to salvage a deal with T-Mobile. "If the Leap deal sounds a bit like a Hail Mary pass, that is because it is," Mr. Sorkin says. "Putting aside the antitrust laws, AT&T clearly missed the shifting mood in Washington."
SEEKING YAHOO Yahoo has received proposals for a minority investment of roughly 20 percent.

        
"A consortium of investors led by the private equity firm Silver Lake and Microsoft is one of several parties that will be submitting a plan to take a minority stake in Yahoo," Michael J. de la Merced and Evelyn M. Rusli report.
        
"Yahoo's directors are leaning toward selling a minority stake in the company to an investor group instead of selling the business outright."
BUFFETT TO BUY NEWSPAPER Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett's Omaha-based business conglomerate, announced that it would purchase the publisher of Nebraska's principal daily newspaper, The Omaha World-Herald, Tanzina Vega reports.
BP TO SELL NATURAL GAS UNIT The company agreed "to sell a Canadian business to Plains All American Pipeline for $1.67 billion in cash as BP continues to streamline its operations and bolster its balance sheet," Julia Werdigier reports.
Investment Banking
$254 MILLION LOTTERY Timothy C. Davidson, Brandon E. Lacoff and Gregory H. Skidmore, three executives at Belpointe Asset Management, an investment firm based in Greenwich, Conn., won the largest jackpot in the state's history, Kevin Roose reports.
OCCUPY WALL STREET The antibank animus has seeped onto college campuses, Mr. Roose reports. "At some schools, anger at big banks has turned the on-campus recruiting process into a crucible of controversy."
THE TRADE Jesse Eisinger of ProPublica writes that "I can't go a week without speaking to a hedge fund manager or analyst or even a banker who registers somewhere on the Wall Street Derangement Scale."
CREDIT RATINGS Standard & Poor's downgraded Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase, "another blow to an industry that continues to struggle three years after the darkest hours of the financial crisis," Susanne Craig, Ben Protess and Neslon D. Schwartz report.
UBS SHAKE-UP The Swiss bank said its chief risk officer had departed after less than a year in the job. Maureen Miskovic, who joined UBS in January as head of risk, was succeeded by her predecessor, Philip J. Lofts, Ms. Werdigier reports.
Hedge Funds
WALL STREET SMACKDOWN Carl C. Icahn and William A. Ackman battled for seven years in multiple courts, over a relatively paltry $4.5 million, Azam Ahmed reports. "This battle, it turns out, was more about big egos than big money - and it has left both men spitting expletives. The scrape finally ended this month, with Mr. Ackman victorious."
A BREAK FROM WORRY John A. Paulson, a member of the 92nd St. Y's board, has guaranteed he will cover the organization for any losses it incurs in his funds, Peter Lattman and Jenny Anderson report. The arrangement raises "an issue that has long been debated in philanthropy circles: Should members of a nonprofit's board be managing its money, regardless of any special deals they cut for the organization?"
I.P.O./Offerings
ZYNGA RISKS TALENT DRAIN Zynga's employees log long hours, managers relentlessly track progress, and the weak links are demoted or let go, Ms. Rusli reports. The discord may jeopardize the company's ability to retain top talent and hamper deal-making.

        
The fast-growing online game maker plans to value itself at up to $10 billion in its initial public offering.
DEAL PROFESSOR "The coming months are shaping up to be a bad time to undertake an I.P.O.," Steven M. Davidoff writes. "Still, Facebook will almost certainly have to go public during this time whether it wants to or not - and whether or not it can get a valuation of $100 billion or more in doing so."
THAT OR THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE "Want to buy a piece of the Empire State Building? Interested investors are one step closer," Peter Lattman and Charles V. Bagli report. "The Malkin family disclosed plans to create a publicly traded real estate company that would include the 102-story skyscraper at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street."
Legal/Regulatory
DODD-FRANK REGULATION Some in Congress are trying to "thwart one of the worthier aims of the Dodd-Frank financial regulation: to bring transparency to the huge market for instruments known as swaps," Gretchen Morgenson reports.
CITIGROUP SETTLEMENT Judge Jed S. Rakoff of United States District Court in Manhattan rejected a $285 million settlement between Citigroup and the Securities and Exchange Commission "taking a broad swipe at the [S.E.C.'s] practice of allowing companies to settle cases without admitting that they had done anything wrong," Edward Wyatt reports.
MF GLOBAL INQUIRY The hunt continues for the missing funds in the failed brokerage that was led by Jon S. Corzine.

        
About $200 million in customer money that vanished from the broker is believed to have surfaced at JPMorgan Chase in Britain, Mr. Protess and Mr. Ahmed report. 
        
"After MF Global discovered a nearly $1 billion shortfall in customer money in the early hours of Oct. 31, the brokerage firm lined up a last-ditch - but ultimately unsuccessful - effort to fill the hole," reports Mr. Protess and Mr. de la Merced.
        
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission are considering a flurry of new rules for the brokerage industry after MF Global's collapse and the revelation that customer money is missing from the firm, Gary Gensler and Mary Schapiro told a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing.
CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS "The publisher of the Italian yellow pages directories, Seat Pagine Gialle, has missed a payment on its bonds and announced a tentative agreement to cancel the bonds and issue shares in the company instead," Floyd Norris reports. "But that agreement may collapse because of a disagreement over how much stock will be issued."
AIRLINE BANKRUPTCY After resisting for a decade, the parent company of American Airlines announced "that it would now follow a strategy that the rest of the industry chose long ago: filing for bankruptcy protection so it can shed debt, cut labor costs and find a way back to profitability," Jad Mouawad and Mr. de la Merced report.
GALLEON INVESTIGATION Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge fund manager convicted of insider trading, is set to report next week to a federal penitentiary in Ayer, Mass., to serve an 11-year sentence, Mr. Lattman report.

        
A last-ditch attempt to delay Mr. Rajaratnam's incarceration most likely amounted to a dress rehearsal for his forthcoming appeal.
        
"Wouldn't he rather be living as a centimillionaire in his own country rather than as a convict in a jail?" Judge Dennis Jacobs asked.
        
A federal court denied his request to remain free on bail while he appeals his insider-trading conviction.
INSIDER TRADING "A new round of charges is expected in the government's broad investigation into possible insider trading at hedge funds," Mr. Lattman reports. "Federal prosecutors are focused on traders at Diamondback Capital Management and Level Global Investors."
FORECLOSURE PRACTICES "Citing extensive abuses of troubled borrowers across Massachusetts, the state's attorney general sued the nation's five largest mortgage lenders," Ms. Morgenson reports. The attorney general, Martha Coakley, is seeking relief for consumers hurt by what she called unfair and deceptive business practices.
FINRA PROFILE "The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's nonprofit self-regulator, has quietly built a small army of market police," Mr. Protess reports. "Since Wall Street's financial crisis in 2008, this fledgling fraud task force has entered the front lines of fighting insider trading, even if the group rarely earns the credit."

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths MILLER, CHARLES D

 BODY:
MILLER--Charles D. Avery Dennison Corp. mourns the passing of Charles D. "Chuck" Miller, visionary business builder and civic leader, who died November 23, 2011 at the age of 83. In his 47-year association with Avery Dennison, Chuck was instrumental in transforming the company from a U.S.-based manufacturer into a global Fortune 500 market leader in pressure-sensitive labeling materials and office products. As chairman for 17 years and CEO for 21, he drove the company's growth with creativity, courage and confidence, and every aspect of the business -- from vision to strategy to execution to culture -- was shaped for the better by his passion and imagination. Corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California bears his name in recognition of his impact. 
Chuck translated the qualities that made him such an exceptional businessman into a deep commitment to civic leadership. Among the many roles he filled with distinction were: chairman of the board of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, director of numerous Southern California companies, chairman of United Way of Greater Los Angeles, and co-created with Peter Mullin the Mullin-Miller Million Dollar Match Fund to encourage giving to the United Way Pathways Out of Poverty Plan during the recent severe recession. He also supported a wide range of medical institutions, including Operation Walk, which provides total hip and knee replacements to the impoverished and which he personally nurtured from a local into an international organization. A lifelong lover of athletics, he was one of the first members of the organizing committee that brought the 1984 Olympic Games to Los Angeles, and helped establish the Los Angeles Sports Council and the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles (today the LA84 Foundation). He provided extensive support to the U.S. Lacrosse and personally funded the women's varsity lacrosse program at Occidental College, which today is a national power in the sport. A deep believer in liberal arts education, Chuck was especially devoted to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University. He served as university trustee and presidential counselor, endowing the Charles D. Miller Professorship in the humanities at the Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and creating the Vision Fund, a scholarship program for arts and sciences undergraduates and summer students of the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth.

HEADLINE: Defense Chief Says Israel Must Mend Arab Ties

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta spoke sternly on Friday to America's closest ally in the Middle East, telling Israel that it is partly responsible for its increasing isolation and that it now must take ''bold action'' -- diplomatic, not military -- to mend ties with its Arab neighbors and settle previously intractable territorial disputes with the Palestinians.
''I believe security is dependent on a strong military, but it is also dependent on strong diplomacy,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''And unfortunately, over the past year, we have seen Israel's isolation from its traditional security partners in the region grow, and the pursuit of a comprehensive Middle East peace has effectively been put on hold.'' 
He balanced his criticism by noting that ''Israel is not solely responsible for this isolation,'' and described what he termed ''an international campaign under way to isolate Israel.''
Mr. Panetta reaffirmed that the United States would sustain an ''unshakable commitment to Israel's security,'' proved by ''unprecedented levels of defense cooperation,'' including more than $200 million in additional assistance for Israel's ''Iron Dome'' missile-defense system.
But the defense secretary made clear that Israel now must prove its commitment to restoring partnerships across the region and resolving historic disputes with the Palestinians.
''Ultimately, the dream of a secure, prosperous Jewish and democratic Israel can only be achieved through two states living side by side in peace and security,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''With full confidence that the United States is willing and capable of ensuring that Israel can safeguard its security as it takes the risks needed to pursue peace, now is the time for Israel to take bold action and to move towards a negotiated two-state solution.''
Asked specifically what Israel should do first, Mr. Panetta replied, ''Get to the damn table'' -- that is, return to negotiations.
Mr. Panetta also called on Israel to ''reach out and mend fences with those who share an interest in regional stability,'' specifically Turkey, Egypt and Jordan. If those gestures are rejected in Ankara, Cairo and Amman, he said, ''the world will see those rebukes for what they are.''
Mr. Panetta spoke to the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, a policy center here. During the evening address, he identified Iran as the most significant national security threat facing the United States, allies and partners in the region.
Notable was the phrasing of a warning to Iran: that any action to block free transit of regional oil shipments and other commerce would be a ''redline,'' a term describing an unacceptable action that would be countered with an American response.
''No greater threat exists to the security and prosperity of the Middle East than a nuclear-armed Iran,'' Mr. Panetta said, noting that a ''pillar of our approach to the region is our determination to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.''
He pledged the United States was committed to deterring Iran's ''destabilizing activities, particularly those that could threaten the free flow of commerce throughout this vital region. That is a 'redline' for the United States.''
American policy to shape Iranian action would use both inducements and penalties, diplomacy and economic sanctions, he said. But the Pentagon would always have military options ready for the president's consideration, Mr. Panetta said.
''That's a responsibility I take very seriously, because when it comes to the threat posed by Iran, the president has made it very clear that we have not taken any options off the table,'' Mr. Panetta said.
Looking broadly across the region, Mr. Panetta also described how the United States was seeking to sustain a military presence and enhance military-to-military cooperation in the Persian Gulf after the withdrawal from Iraq at the end of this month.

HEADLINE: After Tolls Rise, Less Traffic and More Train Riders Into Manhattan

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
The rise in tolls on Port Authority of New York and New Jersey bridges and tunnels in September may have caused many commuters to leave their cars at home and switch to public transportation, early reports from the agency show.
About 890,000 fewer cars and trucks used the crossings from Sept. 19 through Nov. 22 compared with the number that did in roughly the same period in 2010, a 4 percent drop. During that period, ridership on PATH, the Port Authority subway connecting Manhattan and New Jersey, rose by about 560,000, or 3.7 percent, the agency said. 
New Jersey Transit buses also had slight ridership gains, said a spokesman, John Durso Jr., though the agency could not provide actual numbers.
Figures for ridership on New Jersey Transit trains were incomplete, officials said, though early signs pointed to a modest increase.
On Sept. 18, cash tolls rose to $12 from $8 for the George Washington Bridge, the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels, and three crossings between New Jersey and Staten Island. (The toll is collected from cars coming into New York; going to New Jersey is free.)
E-ZPass tolls during peak travel times rose to $9.50 from $8. By 2015, the cash toll will be $15 and the E-ZPass toll will be $12.50.
About 3.5 percent more riders started using E-ZPass and, over all, the Port Authority received 20 percent more in toll revenue than it did the year before.
While advocacy groups like the Tri-State Transportation Campaign are pleased that use of public transportation is up, they also hoped it would give government agencies more reason to spend on mass transit.
''Shifting more transit is definitely a good thing for the economy and the environment,'' said Veronica Vanterpool, associate director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. ''While transit across the region and especially across the Hudson River has seen tremendous growth in ridership, there hasn't been a comparable level of financial investment in transit service.''
Ron Marsico, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said the agency's fleet of PATH trains could absorb the 4 percent increase in ridership. Mr. Marsico added that the agency recently replaced its fleet of 340 cars, with new ones that allow customers to enter and exit more quickly.
Over the next few years, he said, the Port Authority will also replace its mechanical switches with computers that will allow trains to run closer together.
Joshua Crandall, who runs CleverCommute.com, a Web site where commuters share up-to-the-minute information on bus and train delays with other members, said even some affluent customers had been persuaded to leave their cars at home.
''The decision has become easier to say 'I'm going to get on the train,' '' he said.
The Port Authority experienced a similar drop in car traffic after raising tolls to $8 from $6 in 2008, Mr. Marsico said. But that decline was temporary. PATH ridership also rose after the toll increase, but fell in 2009, largely because of the economy, before rebounding somewhat in 2010.
Before the September toll increase, Erica Yahr had driven into Manhattan from Montclair, N.J., one to two days a week for the past 15 years. She is no cheapskate: She recently splurged on an iPad, often has lunch at Pret a Manger and has dinner out. But now she takes the train every day.
''I will not drive in on my own dime anymore,'' Ms. Yahr said. ''It just has to do with how big of a hike at one time that they did. It's just obnoxious.''
Longtime bus and train riders have also noticed the change. Michael Catchpole, who has been taking the Decamp 33 Grove bus into Manhattan for the past three years, said that before the toll increases, he could find a seat four days a week, but he is now lucky to sit once a week.
Two to three days a week, he said, buses are so crowded that they do not stop at all.
''Suddenly there was barely even room to stand on the bus,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Income Taxes For Wealthy May Increase In Albany Deal

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN; Danny Hakim contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders, seeking ways to shore up a state budget strained by the weak economy, are ironing out the details of a deal that would raise income taxes on the wealthy and cut them for the middle class.
Top aides to the officeholders planned to meet through the weekend, as New York State lawmakers prepared to return to Albany next week for a special session of the Legislature that the governor appeared likely to call. 
Members of the Democratic majority in the State Assembly were notified that they should be ready to return to the capital on Tuesday. Negotiations were still in the preliminary stages on Friday, and rank-and-file lawmakers had not yet been briefed on the discussions. But several people who were briefed said it was possible that a deal could be reached within days.
As of Friday, Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders had not yet agreed on the specifics of any agreement. But people briefed on their talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private, said the leaders were discussing the creation of new tax brackets that would allow them to apply higher tax rates to the state's top earners. The new brackets are likely to be temporary; their duration was still unclear on Friday.
Any deal that includes a tax increase would be a shift in Mr. Cuomo's position. He ran for governor last year on a platform of opposing all tax increases, and he has refused pleas from fellow Democrats to support extending the state's so-called millionaires' tax past its scheduled expiration on Dec. 31.
But with the Occupy Wall Street movement drawing more attention to the issue of economic inequality and with the faltering economy widening next year's projected state budget gap to as much as $3.5 billion, Mr. Cuomo refused for the first time this week to rule out seeking any increase in taxes in the coming year, and in recent weeks he has repeatedly expressed a desire to bring more ''fairness'' to the tax code.
The leaders were discussing establishing one or more new tax rates for the highest-earning New Yorkers, which would still be lower than their rate this year, when there is a temporary surcharge in place, but higher than it would have been if the surcharge were allowed to end. New rates could go into effect at the start of next year.
A portion of the revenue generated from high-income residents would be used to lower the tax rate for middle-income ones, which could make it easier for Mr. Cuomo to sell the deal to Republicans who have opposed tax increases.
''You have to give them the ability to say, 'This was not a tax increase; this was a tax cut,' '' one person briefed on the discussions said.
As is often the case with Albany deal-making, it remained possible that the negotiations would fall apart and that the governor would seek changes to the tax code in next year's regular legislative session, which begins next month.
One major unresolved issue was how much extra revenue the state would seek to raise from the tax changes, which in turn would determine the tax rate for the new high-income tax brackets and the cut for middle-class earners.
A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo declined to comment on Friday. Michael Whyland, a spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said that Assembly Democrats were ''committed to working with the governor to bring fairness to our tax code.'' Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican, said, ''Our members believe that the governor's economic program deserves a fair hearing, especially if he's talking about Senate Republican priorities like cutting taxes and creating private sector jobs.''
Several Senate Republicans said this week that they were open to revising the tax brackets, but many are leery of any form of tax increase.
State Senator Carl L. Marcellino, a Long Island Republican, said he believed lawmakers should ''seek out every other possibility that we can to reduce spending,'' instead of raising taxes.
''If we raise taxes on the people who own businesses and who provide the jobs, more of them will leave,'' Mr. Marcellino said.
Democrats are embracing the idea of a more-progressive state tax code. The Senate Democratic leader, John L. Sampson of Brooklyn, urged Mr. Cuomo on Friday to call the Legislature back.
''The state's deficit has gotten worse, which demands immediate and dramatic action,'' Mr. Sampson said.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Dips To Lowest Level For Last 2 Years

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Somehow the American economy appears to be getting better, even as the rest of the world is looking worse.
In the midst of the European debt crisis, lingering instability in the oil-rich Middle East and concerns about a Chinese economic slowdown, the American unemployment rate unexpectedly dropped last month to 8.6 percent, its lowest level in two and a half years.
The Labor Department also said that the nation's employers added 120,000 jobs in November and that job growth for the previous two months was better than initially reported. That looks like good news for President Obama as he heads into the 2012 presidential election -- especially since just a few months ago the picture looked bleak. 
''If you go back to August, all sorts of people were telling us that the economy was headed straight into recession,'' said Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist at Capital Economics. ''Since that point, we've become more and more worried about the euro zone and other areas of the global economy, but somehow, at least for the moment, the U.S. economy seems to be shrugging all that off.''
Even so, part of the reason the jobless rate fell so low was that 315,000 unemployed workers simply stopped applying for jobs. And resilient as the economy seems to have been since this summer, the fate of the fragile recovery is still tied to external -- and especially European -- events.
So far Europe's problems have been relatively contained to the Continent. Many economists worry that a disorderly default of Greece or Italy, which still looks alarmingly possible, could plunge Europe into a depression.
If recent history is any guide, even a modest shock wave from across the ocean could throw the American economy off course; earlier this year, a series of shocks from higher oil prices, the Japanese earthquake and the stalemate over the United States debt ceiling managed to drain the energy from the recovery.
November's drop in unemployment was a welcome relief, given that the jobless rate had been stuck at 9 percent for most of 2011. It is at the lowest level since March 2009; the rate has been above 8 percent for 33 months.
The share of workers who were unemployed fell in November partly because some people found jobs and partly because some discouraged workers dropped out of the labor force altogether. That left the share of Americans participating in the work force at a historically depressed 64 percent, down from 64.2 percent in October.
A separate survey of employers, which economists pay more attention to than the unemployment rate, found that companies added 120,000 jobs last month after adding 100,000 in October.
These numbers were not particularly impressive by historical standards -- payroll growth was just about enough to keep up with population growth -- but there were other signs of resilience.
Companies have been taking on more and more temporary workers, suggesting that more permanent hiring may be in the cards. What is more, help-wanted advertising, retail sales and auto sales have risen; jobless claims have fallen; and businesses seem to be getting loans more easily. Perhaps most encouraging was a recent survey of small businesses that found hiring intentions to be at their highest level since September 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed.
''Small businesses were cheering up at the end of last year but then got clobbered by the jump in oil prices, the Japanese earthquake and then the debt ceiling fiasco,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. ''Small businesses employ half the work force, and we need them on board.''
Still, serious concerns remain about the economy's ability to weather the financial and economic turmoil from abroad. The public sector continues to lay off workers at the federal, state and local level. And excluding the hundreds of thousands who have left the labor force, the country still has a backlog of more than 13 million unemployed workers, whose average period of unemployment is at a record high of 40.9 weeks. The median period, the point between the top and bottom halves, is 21.6 weeks.
''They say businesses are refusing to look at resumes from the unemployed,'' said Esther Perry, 59, of Bedford, Mass., who participated in a recent report on unemployed workers put together by USAction, a liberal coalition. ''What do you think my chances are? Once unemployment runs out, I don't know what I will do.''
Even those with jobs are in weak positions. Average hourly earnings fell 0.1 percent in November, and a Labor Department report released Wednesday found that the share of national income going to labor was at a record low last quarter.
These softer spots in Friday's numbers underscored just how much President Obama could use additional stimulus, a tidy and fast resolution to the European debt crisis or some other economic breakthrough to reinvigorate the job market before the 2012 presidential election.
''As president, my most pressing challenge is doing everything I can every single day to get this economy growing faster and create more jobs,'' President Obama said Friday in Washington.
On the issue of government action to stimulate the economy, there has been some movement in Washington toward extending the payroll tax cut, which is scheduled to expire at the end of this month. Economists have said that allowing the tax cut -- which lets more than 160 million mostly middle-class Americans keep two percentage points more of their paychecks -- to expire could be a severe drag on both job creation and output growth.
''If it isn't extended, it will have an impact on consumer spending in the first half of next year because it'll put a big dent in consumer income,'' said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economist at RDQ Economics. ''To the extent that reduces spending, there will be second-round effects on hiring.''
According to some estimates, an extension would probably lead to 600,000 to one million more jobs. The other major stimulus program scheduled to expire by 2012 is the extension of unemployment insurance benefits, allowing some jobless workers to continue collecting for as long as 99 weeks. Already, millions of people have exhausted their benefits. Failing to renew the federal benefit extensions will cause five million additional people to lose benefits next year, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said in an interview.
Unemployment benefits are believed to have one of the most stimulative effects on the economy, because recipients are likely to spend all of the money they receive quickly and pump more spending through the economy.

HEADLINE: Will China Stumble? Don't Bet on It

BYLINE: By STEVEN RATTNER


HIGHLIGHT: Steven Rattner, a contributing writer for Op-Ed, was a counselor to the Treasury secretary and lead auto adviser. He is a longtime Wall Street executive.

 BODY:
HARDLY a day goes by without news of yet another economic problem facing China. A frothy real estate market. Quickly rising wages. A weakening manufacturing sector. Tightening lending standards. The list can seem endless and frightening.
But after a recent visit to China, I remain staunchly optimistic that it will continue to be the world's greatest machine for economic expansion. While developed countries bump along with little growth, China's gross domestic product is expected to increase by 9.2 percent in 2011 and an equally astonishing 8.5 percent next year.
The country pulses with energy and success, a caldron of economic ambition larded with understandable self-confidence. Visit the General Motors plant on the outskirts of Shanghai and watch Buicks churned out by steadily moving assembly lines almost indistinguishable from those in plants in Michigan. 
That shouldn't surprise, as G.M. strives for uniformity across its Chinese facilities. Perhaps more startling is that G.M. achieves American levels of productivity, quality and worker safety -- with pay that is a small fraction of levels in the United States.
This illustrates China's great strength: its ability to relentlessly grind down costs by combining high labor efficiency with wages that remain extraordinarily low. At Foxconn's largest plant, in Shenzhen, 420,000 Chinese earning about $188 per month assemble electronic components for megacustomers like Apple, Hewlett-Packard and Dell.
Often criticized for just being a nation of ''assemblers,'' China has been increasing the value it adds to exports as more components are produced there. G.M., for example, uses 350 local suppliers.
China's economic success is colored by its opaque political system, repressive and riddled with corruption. But the unusual mix of authoritarianism and free enterprise should continue to work because of its ability to deliver rising incomes, satisfying a populace that appears more interested in economic advancement than in democracy.
China has a plethora of tasks on its economic to do list, but none are impossibly daunting. Just as in the United States a century ago, jobs are needed for vast numbers of rural migrants moving into cities. Inefficient state-owned companies must be restructured (as they were in recent decades in many European countries). The other evident stresses, like the indisputable property bubble, are manageable and far short of what brought down the American economy.
Meanwhile, an opportunity lurks in China's seeming inability to create innovative products with international identities. In an era of global corporations, a country that reveres brands, especially luxury ones like BMW and Louis Vuitton but also Starbucks and Haagen Dazs, has yet to give birth to its first.
Lenovo, one of the best-known Chinese companies, has achieved limited success with its 2005 acquisition of IBM's personal computer business. Astonishingly, Chinese auto companies have the lowest share of their home market of any major country. So China has emphasized building products like ships, where brands don't matter.
Not unlike the United States in the 19th century, China's early stage of industrialization has brought with it an unsavory wild West flavor, from cronyism to fraudulent accounting, that justifiably worries investors. But behind those distractions is a country that is investing substantially in its future -- about 46 percent of its gross domestic product, compared with 12 percent in the United States.
And while total government debt in China is high -- by some estimates, higher than in the United States -- much of the Chinese debt was incurred for investment rather than consumption, far better for longer-term growth. Notwithstanding accounts of ''roads to nowhere,'' China has vastly improved its core infrastructure. Its government arguably does better than ours at allocating capital.
The antipathy of Chinese households toward personal debt (a quarter of homes are bought with cash) has resulted in a savings rate of nearly 40 percent of income, compared with less than 5 percent for Americans.
Underpinned by a reverence for entrepreneurship, China has made starting new businesses easier, paving the way for the accumulation of vast fortunes; there are more billionaires in China than in any country except the United States. (China's income inequality also rivals that of the United States.)
A gradual move toward reform appears evident. Controls over interest rates, foreign exchange, cooking oil and gasoline, to name a few, are being liberalized. There is even attention to the environment, with tax subsidies for fuel-efficient autos and limits on new-car purchases in the largest cities.
The frustrating mercantilist approach taken by China -- it manipulates its currency and trade rules with abandon -- has served it well. It has accumulated vast foreign currency reserves ($3.2 trillion and rising) while blocking access to its market and gaining competitive advantages internationally in everything from solar panels to toys. Congressional saber rattling notwithstanding, China is likely to continue to get away with reforming only slowly.
While China hardly lacks challenges, I am betting on its continued success.

HEADLINE: Loans Without Profit Help Relieve Economic Pain

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN

 BODY:
When Hirshy Minkowicz was growing up in a Hasidic enclave of Brooklyn 30 years ago, he often noticed visitors arriving after dinner to meet with his father. They would withdraw into the study, speak for a time, then part with some confidential agreement having been sealed.
As he grew into his teens, Hirshy came to learn that his father operated a traditional Jewish free-loan program called a gemach. The visitors, many of them teachers in local religious schools, struggling to raise their families on small and irregular salaries, had been coming to borrow money at no interest and with no public exposure. 
Now 39 years old and serving as the rabbi of a Chabad center near Atlanta, Rabbi Minkowicz has done something he never expected: open a gemach that deals primarily with non-Orthodox Jews in a prosperous stretch of suburbia. The reason, quite simply, is the prolonged downturn in the American economy, which has driven up the number of Jews identified by one poverty expert as the ''middle-class needy.''
The same phenomenon has appeared in Jewish communities across the country, albeit most often in those with existing Orthodox populations already familiar with the gemach system. This institution, rooted in biblical and Talmudic teachings and whose name is a contraction of the Hebrew words for ''bestowal of kindness'' (''gemilut chasadim''), is now meeting needs created by such resolutely modern causes as subprime mortgages, outsourcing and credit default swaps.
''I honestly never thought, in my realm here, to start a gemach,'' Rabbi Minkowicz said in a recent interview. ''I thought people wouldn't understand it. It'd be a foreign concept. They hadn't grown up that way. But definitely, definitely, definitely the economy now is the worst. The 13 years I've been here, I've never seen people go from a regular life to rags. I've seen that up-front and personal.''
It is difficult to determine the exact dimensions of the economy's impact on the Jewish population in general and on the surge in the use of gemachs specifically. The loan programs, often financed and run by families, operate on the basis of anonymity. Governmental statistics on poverty, unemployment, foreclosure and other such measures of the continuing malaise are not broken down by religion, as they are by race.
Still, the evidence points to an economic toll on Jews -- not severe enough in most cases to plunge them into homelessness and destitution, or to qualify them for food stamps and Medicaid, but deep enough to destabilize what had been securely middle-class lives. Since the stock market collapse in late 2008 pushed the nation into recession, the demand for food and clothes from Jewish social service agencies and charities has risen by roughly 40 percent, according to their administrators.
''This area of the middle-class needy has just exploded,'' said William E. Rapfogel, the chief executive of the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, which covers the New York area. ''We've seen people who were making $75,000, even $200,000, lose a substantial portion of income. When they lose a job, they get another, but it's a job for less. They're so over-leveraged in their homes, they can't get out. If they sold, they wouldn't take out a nickel.''
On Staten Island, the borough of New York most akin to a suburb, Rabbi Moshe Meir Weiss of the Agudas Yisroel synagogue has seen that situation. In the past, Jews in his community used gemachs primarily to borrow items they needed for only a limited time: a wedding dress, rubber bins for moving furniture, a wig to cover hair lost to chemotherapy, even breast milk for a nursing child. Over the last several years, however, the gemachs have increasingly dispensed cash loans and groceries.
''People have been so taken by shock,'' Rabbi Weiss said. ''Picture yourself, God forbid, having to take a can of tuna from someone. It's almost like the soup lines of the Great Depression.''
The gemach system, however, offers two tangible differences. First, as a matter of religious teaching and longstanding custom, a gemach makes no profit on its loans. Second, the tradition of confidentiality, rooted in Judaic commentaries about giving and receiving charity, allows a supplicant to save face.
''When it's within your own group, it's less embarrassing,'' Rabbi Weiss said. ''You feel your compadre understands and is doing it out of love.''
In suburban Atlanta, Rabbi Minkowicz had similar thoughts in mind last August, when a congregant approached him with an idealistic but unformed proposal. The man had seen the toll that corporate layoffs and the cratered housing market had taken on the local Jewish community. He and his wife, both professionals in public-sector jobs, had saved $5,000 to do something about it. Their question was what.
At that point, Rabbi Minkowicz explained about gemach, a word the donor had never heard. What impressed the man immediately, in this era of celebrity charities and naming rights, was the quality of humility. A borrower would not be subjected to a credit check or required to put up collateral, only to have another member of the Jewish community co-sign. The donor could remain unknown.
''I could help people without seeming like I'm showing off,'' the man said. Indeed, he spoke for this column only on the promise that his identity not be revealed.
By now, four months later, the resulting gemach has made two loans of about $1,000 apiece, with a third imminent. As those borrowers repay the gemach, at the rate of roughly $100 a month, Rabbi Minkowicz can in turn recycle the money to others who need it.
All of which puts him in mind of those knocks on the door in Brooklyn decades ago, and of the decorous way his father answered. ''I've tried to use the same model I saw,'' Rabbi Minkowicz put it. ''You help the people who are struggling. And you try to preserve their dignity.''

HEADLINE: Unclear Fate For Transit Benefit

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
If you qualify for pretax transit benefits, you'll probably see the perk shrink starting in January.
The benefit allows employees to lower their federal tax bill by setting aside pretax money to pay for the cost of taking public transportation (or van pools, in less urban areas) to work. The cap, now $230 a month, was about half that amount until Congress increased it temporarily in 2009. The move put the transit benefit on par with a similar $230-a-month benefit available to help commuters pay for parking. 
The maximum parking benefit will become $240 monthly as of Jan. 1, because of an adjustment for inflation. The transit benefit, however, is scheduled to drop to $125 a month, unless Congress acts to extend the higher benefit level or to make it permanent. Roughly 2.7 million people use the transit benefit, according to Commuter Benefits Work for Us, a coalition of transit groups and businesses.
Last year, facing a similar deadline, lawmakers voted to extend the higher level of transit benefits for 2011. But it's unclear if Congress will take action on the issue before the end of this year, said Scott Bogren, a spokesman for the Community Transportation Association of America, which supports the higher benefit level.
The association and other coalition members are urging those who use public transportation to voice their support for an extension of the higher benefit level on a special Web site.
Do you use the pretax transit benefit? Will the reduction in benefit affect your commuting plans?

CORRECTION-DATE: December 7, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A report in the Best of Bucks column on Saturday about a reduction in federal pretax transit benefits for 2012 misstated the maximum amounts employees can set aside before taxes next year to pay for the cost of parking or taking public transportation to work. The maximum monthly parking benefit, starting in January, is $240, not $230, and the maximum monthly transit benefit will be $125, not $120.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Been Down So Long ...

 BODY:
The unemployment rate dropped to 8.6 percent in November from 9 percent in October in the jobs report released Friday. The economy added 120,000 jobs and job growth was revised upward in September and October. 
That's better than rising unemployment and falling payrolls. Yet, properly understood, the new figures reveal more about the depth of distress in the job market than about real improvement in job prospects.
Most of the decline in November's unemployment rate was not because jobless people found new work. Rather, it is because 315,000 people dropped out of the work force, a reflection of extraordinarily weak demand by employers for new workers. It is also a sign of socioeconomic decline, of wasted resources and untapped potential, the human equivalent of boarded-up Main Streets and shuttered factories.
The job growth numbers also come with caveats. More jobs were created than economists expected, but with the job market so weak for so long, that is a low bar. It would take nearly 11 million new jobs to replace the ones that were lost during the recession and to keep up with the growth in the working-age population in the last four years. To fill that gap would require 275,000 new jobs a month for the next five years. That's not in the cards. Even with the better-than-expected job growth in the past three months, the economy added only 143,000 jobs on average.
And most of those new jobs are low-end ones. In November, for example, big job-growth areas included retail sales, bartending and temporary services. Teachers and other public employees continued to lose jobs, and job growth in construction and manufacturing were basically flat. Indeed, work -- once the pathway to a rising standard of living -- has become for many a route to downward mobility. Motoko Rich reported in The Times recently on new research showing that most people who lost their jobs in recent years now make less and have not maintained their lifestyles, with many experiencing what they describe as drastic -- and probably irreversible -- declines in income.
Against that backdrop, the modest improvement in the jobs report, even if sustained in the months to come, would not be enough to repair the damage from the recession and its slow-growth aftermath. Help is needed, yet Congress is tied in knots over even basic recovery measures, like extending federal unemployment benefits and the temporary payroll tax cut.
Meanwhile, the increasing likelihood of a recession in Europe, or any other setback, could easily derail the weak American economy, sending unemployment back up to double-digit recession levels.

HEADLINE: Police Officers Find That Dissent on Drug Laws May Come With a Price

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- Border Patrol agents pursue smugglers one moment and sit around in boredom the next. It was during one of the lulls that Bryan Gonzalez, a young agent, made some comments to a colleague that cost him his career.
Stationed in Deming, N.M., Mr. Gonzalez was in his green-and-white Border Patrol vehicle just a few feet from the international boundary when he pulled up next to a fellow agent to chat about the frustrations of the job. If marijuana were legalized, Mr. Gonzalez acknowledges saying, the drug-related violence across the border in Mexico would cease. He then brought up an organization called Law Enforcement Against Prohibition that favors ending the war on drugs.
Those remarks, along with others expressing sympathy for illegal immigrants from Mexico, were passed along to the Border Patrol headquarters in Washington. After an investigation, a termination letter arrived that said Mr. Gonzalez held ''personal views that were contrary to core characteristics of Border Patrol Agents, which are patriotism, dedication and esprit de corps.''
After his dismissal, Mr. Gonzalez joined a group even more exclusive than the Border Patrol: law enforcement officials who have lost their jobs for questioning the war on drugs and are fighting back in the courts. 
In Arizona, Joe Miller, a probation officer in Mohave County, near the California border, filed suit last month in Federal District Court after he was dismissed for adding his name to a letter by Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, which is based in Medford, Mass., and known as LEAP, expressing support for the decriminalization of marijuana.
''More and more members of the law enforcement community are speaking out against failed drug policies, and they don't give up their right to share their insight and engage in this important debate simply because they receive government paychecks,'' said Daniel Pochoda, the legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, which is handling the Miller case.
Mr. Miller was one of 32 members of LEAP who signed the letter, which expressed support for a California ballot measure that failed last year that would have permitted recreational marijuana use. Most of the signers were retired members of law enforcement agencies, who can speak their minds without fear of action by their bosses. But Mr. Miller and a handful of others who were still on the job -- including the district attorney for Humboldt County in California and the Oakland city attorney -- signed, too.
LEAP has seen its membership increase significantly from the time it was founded in 2002 by five disillusioned officers. It now has an e-mail list of 48,000, and its members include 145 judges, prosecutors, police officers, prison guards and other law enforcement officials, most of them retired, who speak on the group's behalf.
''No one wants to be fired and have to fight for their job in court,'' said Neill Franklin, a retired police officer who is LEAP's executive director. ''So most officers are reluctant to sign on board. But we do have some brave souls.''
Mr. Miller was accused of not making clear that he was speaking for himself and not the probation department while advocating the decriminalization of cannabis. His lawsuit, though, points out that the letter he signed said at the bottom, ''All agency affiliations are listed for identification purposes only.''
He was also accused of dishonesty for denying that he had given approval for his name to appear on the LEAP letter. In the lawsuit, Mr. Miller said that his wife had given approval without his knowledge, using his e-mail address, but that he had later supported her.
Kip Anderson, the court administrator for the Superior Court in Mohave County, said there was no desire to limit Mr. Miller's political views.
''This isn't about legalization,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''We're not taking a stand on that. We just didn't want people to think he was speaking on behalf of the probation department.''
Mr. Miller, who is also a retired police officer and Marine, lost an appeal of his dismissal before a hearing officer. But when his application for unemployment benefits was turned down, he appealed that and won. An administrative law judge found that Mr. Miller had not been dishonest with his bosses and that the disclaimer on the letter was sufficient.
In the case of Mr. Gonzalez, the fired Border Patrol agent, he had not joined LEAP but had expressed sympathy with the group's cause. ''It didn't make sense to me why marijuana is illegal,'' he said. ''To see that thousands of people are dying, some of whom I know, makes you want to look for a change.''
Since his firing, Mr. Gonzalez, who filed suit in federal court in Texas in January, has worked as a construction worker, a bouncer and a yard worker. He has also gone back to school, where he is considering a law degree.
''I don't want to work at a place that says I can't think,'' said Mr. Gonzalez, who grew up in El Paso, just across the border from Ciudad Juarez, which has experienced some of the worst bloodshed in Mexico.
The Justice Department, which is defending the Border Patrol, has sought to have the case thrown out. Mr. Gonzalez lost a discrimination complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which sided with his supervisors' view that they had lost trust that he would uphold the law.
Those challenging their dismissals are buoyed by the case of Jonathan Wender, who was fired as a police sergeant in Mountlake Terrace, Wash., in 2005, partly as a result of his support for the decriminalization of marijuana. Mr. Wender won a settlement of $815,000 as well as his old job back. But he retired from the department and took up teaching at the University of Washington, where one of his courses is ''Drugs and Society.''
Among those not yet ready to publicly urge the legalization of drugs is a veteran Texas police officer who quietly supports LEAP and spoke on the condition that he not be identified. ''We all know the drug war is a bad joke,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''But we also know that you'll never get promoted if you're seen as soft on drugs.''
Mr. Franklin, the LEAP official, said it was natural that those on the front lines of enforcing drug laws would have strong views on them, either way. It was the death of a colleague at the hands of a drug dealer in 2000 that prompted Mr. Franklin, a veteran officer, to begin questioning the nation's drug policies. Some of his colleagues, though, hit the streets even more aggressively, he said.
Mr. Franklin said he got calls all the time from colleagues skeptical about the drug laws as they are written but unwilling to speak out -- yet.
''I was speaking to a guy with the Maryland State Police this past Saturday, and he's about to retire in January and he's still reluctant to join us until he leaves,'' Mr. Franklin said. ''He wants to have a good last couple of months, without any hassle.''

HEADLINE: Programs That Tie Funds to Effectiveness Are at Risk

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Policy experts and academics consider home-visiting programs -- where nurses counsel teenage mothers and other at-risk parents -- to be among the most effective social interventions. The programs slash the incidence of neglect, bolster infant health and in some cases save taxpayers money by cutting costs.
But not all programs follow best practices, or even track their results. To tackle that problem -- to make the initiatives more effective and accountable -- the Bush administration created a pilot program tying federal financing to policy outcomes. States could get federal financing if they put in place research-supported best practices.
There are now six such ''evidence-based'' pilot programs that make taxpayer dollars contingent on results and that would seem to have natural appeal to Congressional Republicans. But they are under threat from a House proposal that eliminates all federal financing for four of the six programs, including the home-visiting program, and significantly cuts money for a fifth. 
Republicans say that no decisions are final, and that the appropriations process is in its early stages. Democrats promise to fight for the initiatives, and argue for their inclusion in next year's budget. Policy experts worry not just about the evidence-based programs, but also about the future of such mechanisms to make government money go further and work better.
''The hard-working taxpayer deserves more careful consideration of how we spend their money,'' said Representative Denny Rehberg, Republican of Montana, who is chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that cut the evidence-based financing. ''We requested updates on findings from evaluations and other activities conducted using these funds. The committee will review the results carefully so we can make an informed decision about whether or not to fund this in the future.''
The evidence-based pilot programs make up a tiny portion of federal spending, accounting for about $1.2 billion out of a $670 billion budget for nonmilitary discretionary programs in the 2011 fiscal year. Nevertheless, policy experts hold that they represent an important change in how Washington thinks about accountability for such spending.
''All of these programs sprang out of asking the question: How can we get better results with less money in a constrained fiscal environment?'' said Robert Gordon, executive associate director of the White House budget office. ''If your goal is to change how government works and to send a signal that results matter, programs like these are powerful.''
The idea of tying money to outcomes seems commonsensical. But policy experts say most federally financed social programs -- like the preschool program Head Start or job retraining initiatives for displaced workers -- do not consider results when determining how to allocate money.
''For most large social programs,'' said Jon Baron, president of the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy in Washington, ''the federal government plays the role of a faucet. It directs the agencies to allocate large streams of funding, often determined by formula. Evidence about which programs are effective or not does not come into the picture.''
That began changing during the Bush administration, after years of research showed taxpayers spending billions of dollars for sometimes negligible results on things like substance abuse prevention and early childhood education.
The Bush administration created the home-visiting initiative, a $10 million competitive grant pilot program to help state and local governments invest in ''quality assurance systems,'' train workers and establish programs with ''strong fidelity to a proven effective model,'' in 2008. Congress expanded the spending to $13.5 million the next year.
When the Obama administration came into office, it decided to ''turn the dial up,'' said Peter R. Orszag, a former budget director who is now a vice chairman at Citigroup. ''The ethos is not just to spend money blindly, but to make investments -- to spend money on things that demonstrate that they work. If you try three approaches to job training, you actually try to over time dedicate more money to the programs that work better.''
The administration drastically expanded the home-visiting program, increasing spending to $1.5 billion over five years. And it decided to apply the evidence-based ethos to other programs. Congress approved $75 million to study and replicate the most effective teenage-pregnancy prevention programs, for instance. It also added competitive, evidence-based financing for two work force training programs, an initiative to improve student achievement and an initiative to help low-income communities.
The administrators of the programs say it may take several more years to see hard results. For instance, Paul Carttar, the director of the Social Innovation Fund, says it remains focused on building the infrastructure for its competitive grants to community organizations. But he estimates the program has already reached 70,000 people through local initiatives with a ''very significant evidence requirement.''
''There are other benefits of these programs that oftentimes are not really appreciated,'' Mr. Carttar said. ''Other federal agencies can adopt the best practices identified by evidence-based programs. By that same logic, they also have tremendous value, not just to federal grant-makers, but to philanthropic grant-makers, individual donors -- anyone who thinks about money creating an impact.''
The proposed budget cuts have bewildered social scientists and good-government experts. ''Why, in a constrained budget environment, do you cut the programs that have to show they're working?'' asked Ron Haskins, a former Republican Congressional staff member and White House adviser who is co-director of the Brookings Center on Children and Families. ''It makes no sense.''
The White House has also strongly objected to the subcommittee's zeroing out financing. Jacob L. Lew, the White House budget director, sent a letter acknowledging the necessity of budget cuts, but asking that Congress retain spending for programs that can help states save money and improve outcomes. ''In a period of limited resources, these initiatives encourage and reflect the systemic changes and evidence-based interventions that can achieve the greatest impacts at the lowest cost,'' he wrote.
Mr. Rehberg, the appropriations subcommittee chairman, stresses that nothing is final. ''The days of blindly throwing money at any and all programs without any consideration of how well they work are over, as well they should be,'' he said in an e-mail.
But Democrats on the subcommittee have said they will fight for their inclusion.
''These initiatives are targeted, focused investments that would improve our schools and help American families during these difficult economic times,'' said Representative Rosa L. DeLauro of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the subcommittee. ''Cutting these initiatives, and many other worthwhile programs and services, is the wrong direction.''

HEADLINE: Once on Top, American Now Fights to Keep Up

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
American Airlines simply couldn't keep up.
Most airlines found a way back to profitability in the last few years by shedding costs through bankruptcy, reducing capacity and merging with one another. But American lost passengers to newly merged carriers like Delta Air Lines and United Airlines as well as low-cost competitors like Southwest Airlines. It retrenched around fewer hub airports. It struggled with older, jet fuel-guzzling planes and delayed renewing its fleet.
So American's decision to file for bankruptcy this week highlighted both the industry's remarkable transformation over the last decade and the distance now separating this airline from its peers. While other airlines have found ways to remain profitable even with elevated fuel prices and slowing passenger demand, American has been losing about $100 million each month. American was once the nation's leading domestic and international carrier; now it is a distant third. 
''American's problems didn't happen overnight but they have finally caught up with them,'' said Robert Herbst, an independent analyst and retired airline pilot. ''Their higher costs have forced them to cut unprofitable routes, which worsened their revenue problem. Bankruptcy was inevitable.''
The industry's road to financial stability has been rocky and remains fragile. Employees, whose pensions and salaries were cut back, paid a heavy price. Dozens of airlines disappeared over the last decade, some through bankruptcies and others through mergers. The industry's losses reached $60 billion in that period.
Thanks to reduced competition, the surviving airlines were able to raise ticket prices and increase revenue in all sorts of ways through a variety of fees for things like checked bags and booking an aisle seat.
American was the last of the so-called legacy carriers, created before the industry was deregulated in 1978, not to have filed for bankruptcy. If it manages to reduce its costs under court protection, analysts say it could become a candidate for a merger or a takeover. The most likely partner is US Airways, whose chief executive, Doug Parker, has long advocated the need for consolidation in the industry.
Ray Neidl, an analyst at the Maxim Group, said that US Airways would increase American's network in the Southwest and in the Southeast, although it would not add much by way of international destinations. A merger with US Airways, Mr. Neidl said, ''would also bring a very powerful and aggressive management team into play, which American would need to regain its proper place in the industry.''
But given American's inability to reach a labor agreement with its pilots in the last three years, US Airways would pose another problem. It is still dealing with its own labor issues from its merger in 2005 with America West. Pilots from the two airlines have yet to agree to a common seniority list.
For now, American follows in the path set by Delta, United, and US Airways -- which all went through bankruptcy court in recent years. Like these carriers, it hopes to be able to rewrite its labor contracts, shed obligations and debt and perhaps reduce the pension commitments it cannot afford. The details of American's reorganization plan have not been made public yet.
US Airways filed for court protection twice before it was acquired by America West. Delta bought Northwest a year after both carriers emerged from bankruptcy. And United, which stayed under court protection the longest, from 2002 to 2006, bought Continental last year. Southwest, which never went through bankruptcy, completed its purchase of AirTran earlier this year.
''What probably saved the industry were the mergers,'' Mr. Herbst said. ''Most airlines would have gone bankrupt again without them.''
The airlines have also shown uncommon discipline in keeping their capacity in check since 2008. They have cut back on some flights and focused instead of filling as many seats as possible on their planes. Most are now flying packed planes most of the time.
American has found it harder to compete with these leaner, bigger rivals, and its market share has dropped in some of its top cities, like New York and Chicago. At the same time, American's higher costs meant it could not compete on many domestic destinations, forcing it to scale back. Since 2002, the number of seats that American flies for one mile, a common metric in the industry, has dropped by 12 percent.
Yet despite the squeeze in capacity since the financial crisis, overall capacity at American's rivals has increased in the last decade. In the same period since 2002, the measure of seats flown for one mile rose by 48 percent at United, 53 percent at Delta and 43 percent at Southwest.
While airlines have weathered the economic slowdown so far, some analysts worry that their newfound profitability may be jeopardized by American's bankruptcy. American may now be tempted to slash its fares to retain its business passengers who might otherwise feel nervous about the airline's prospects, according to Vicki Bryan, an analyst with Gimme Credit.
''Even to the layman, bankruptcy means the carrier is in serious trouble and may not survive, and that changes both the customer's behavior as well as AMR's business strategy,'' Ms. Bryan said in a research note, referring to American Airlines' parent company. ''Given American's size and what will likely prove to be a long, messy restructuring process, its bankruptcy could have a prolonged depressing effect on already precarious industry pricing and profits as travel demand continues to cool.''
American, in fact, did have a major fare sale on Wednesday, the day after its bankruptcy filing, with deep discounts on about 3,400 flights, Ms. Bryan said.
Still, such fire sales may prove temporary. American entered the protection of the court with $4.1 billion in cash, and it hopes to finance its restructuring process on its own. Some cutbacks on routes are expected, but the airline cannot afford to see its revenue dip more, Mr. Neidl said.
American's managers hope to complete the bankruptcy process in about 18 months. But what happens next remains an open question.
American is betting that once it reins in costs, it will be in shape to grow again, especially as it gets new planes ordered from Boeing and Airbus to replace its aging fleet. The new chairman and chief executive, Thomas W. Horton, said he planned an independent path for the airline. ''It is not necessary for us to pursue a combination,'' he said in an interview on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: A Trusted Market Predictor Falters

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
ONE of the most reliable guides to investing in the American stock market -- to buy during the third year of a presidential term -- is in danger of failing for the first time since the Great Depression.
Through November, an investor in the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 had a small profit of 1.1 percent this year, including reinvested dividends. But that figure was a 6 percent loss a week earlier, before investors took pleasure from positive reports of post-Thanksgiving retail sales and became more optimistic that another round of European summit meetings next week would reduce the threat of a new financial collapse. 
The last negative return during the third year of a presidential term was in 1939, when the loss was a barely noticeable 0.1 percent. That loss came as storm clouds gathered in Europe with the beginning of World War II. It is hard to think of any year since the war when Europe's problems have loomed as large to investors as they have this year.
As can be seen from the accompanying charts, an investor who put money into American stocks at the beginning of each third year, and then got out of the market for the next three years, would have done far better than one who chose any other year of the presidential cycle to invest in.
With this year's performance, the compound annual gain for all third years since World War II will dip below 20 percent, barring a major rally this month. During the postwar years, the second-best showing was from fourth years -- the years when a new president is elected. It was just over 8 percent.
A $100 investment in 1947, allowed to grow only in third years, would be worth more than $2,000 now. Similar investments in the first, second or fourth years would have grown to less than $400.
It has long been suspected that the fact that third years were the best was far from a coincidence, as presidents sought to stimulate the economy and corporate profits heading into a year when they would seek re-election or, if they were completing a second term, try to keep the White House in the hands of the same party.
This year, the economic outlook has been anything but clear, with encouraging signs of growth early in the year replaced by fears of a double-dip recession in the summer as the European credit crisis intensified. Since August, the market has gyrated wildly as European prospects have seemed to change almost daily.
At the same time, it has become increasingly clear that Congressional Republicans are unlikely to allow any significant effort to stimulate the economy before next year's election.
President Obama may be pleased to learn that third-year stock market returns have not been good predictors of election results. The four best third years -- all with total gains of more than 30 percent -- were in 1955, 1975, 1991 and 1995. In 1956 and 1996, incumbents easily won re-election. In 1976 and 1992, incumbents were defeated. Similarly, the results after the four lowest postwar gains were also split, with the incumbent party winning twice and losing twice.
The stock market has long been viewed as a leading indicator of the economy, and the presidential cycle seems to bear that out. The best economic growth, on average, has been in the fourth years of presidential cycles, with the third year second-best.
There is another historical indicator that provides hope that the third-year pattern will hold. Year-end rallies are common, and as a result December has been more likely to show increases than any other month over the last six decades.

HEADLINE: Households Show Stress

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Continued housing distress and rising prices for food and gas are weighing heavily on American families' finances as the holiday shopping season begins, a quarterly analysis shows.
The CredAbility Consumer Distress Index, a measure of household financial stability, fell sharply in the third quarter, largely erasing improvements made over the prior three quarters. An uptick in late mortgage and rental payments and higher prices at the grocery store and gas pumps were the chief culprits. 
CredAbility, a nonprofit consumer counseling agency based in Atlanta, crunches national data in five different categories -- employment, housing, credit, household budget and net worth -- to compile the index. A score below 70 indicates financial distress.
In the latest analysis, United States households scored 66.7 on the index's 100-point scale, a ''significant'' drop from 69.2 in the second quarter, and the largest drop since the third quarter of 2008, the agency found. The nation's consumers have now been in financial distress for 12 consecutive quarters, according to the index. (The analysis also measured consumer distress in individual states and found that only 19, as well as the District of Columbia, had scores above 70.) ''The average American family is feeling significant distress,'' said Mark Cole, chief operating officer of CredAbility and the index's author. The unemployment rate hasn't changed, but the rate of ''under-employment,'' in which people are working part-time rather than full-time for economic reasons, increased in the quarter.
Despite the gloomy index numbers, indications are that retail sales were up significantly over the bellwether Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Mr. Cole said he did not think that sort of spending could continue, given that the average family has shrinking savings and less left over at the end of the month. People fatigued by living within tight budgets may be looking for bargains, he said, but ''It's hard for me to imagine there's that much spending power left.''
''The only way those gains are sustainable is if they borrow money,'' he said, noting that consumers have been doing better at managing debt. ''My hope is they're not going to borrow money to buy holiday gifts.''
What are your plans for holiday spending? Does your budget allow for gifts, or do you plan to borrow to buy presents?

HEADLINE: Wall Street Groups Sue Regulator in a Challenge to a New Trading Rule

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
9:06 p.m. Updated
Wall Street sought to deliver another blow to the financial regulatory overhaul on Friday, as two industry trade groups sued a federal regulator over a new rule restricting speculative trading.
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association filed a lawsuit challenging the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's so-called position limits rule.
The agency adopted the rule in October to cap the number of contracts a trader can hold on 28 commodities. The vote was an important step in the Obama administration's effort to enforce the Dodd-Frank overhaul. 
But in the complaint filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, Sifma and I.S.D.A. argue that the commission erred when it completed the rule, contending that it failed to evaluate the rule's economic impact on Wall Street.
''The evidence is overwhelming that position limits are, at best, unnecessary and may, at worst, negatively impact commodity markets and users,'' Conrad Voldstad, the I.S.D.A. chief executive, said in a statement. A joint statement by Mr. Voldstad and T. Timothy Ryan Jr., Sifma's leader, called the rule ''poorly crafted'' and based on ''an incorrect reading of the law.''
It is unclear what will be the next step in the legal battle. A spokesman for the commodities commission declined to comment though Congressional supporters of Dodd-Frank chided the industry groups for bringing the lawsuit. ''The financial industry tried to water down Dodd-Frank before it was enacted, has been trying to chip away at it since it became law, and is continuing that effort with this lawsuit,'' Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said in a statement.
The lawsuit is the latest indication that Wall Street is shifting fronts in the battle over Dodd-Frank, moving from backroom lobbying to the courtroom. A federal appeals court in July struck down the Securities and Exchange Commission's so-called proxy access rule, a Dodd-Frank policy that would have made it easier for shareholders to nominate company directors. The court ruled that the S.E.C.'s cost-benefit analysis on the rule was inadequate.
The decision incited fear among regulators, and even caused several agencies to re-examine their Dodd-Frank rules. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, mindful of possible legal challenges, delayed voting on its position limits rule on multiple occasions. The agency also agreed to delay the enforcement of many new position limits for at least a year.
But Wall Street lobbyists say the rule did not improve with time. The I.S.D.A. and Sifma note that Dodd-Frank leaves it to regulators to enforce position limits only ''as appropriate.'' The groups pushed regulators to interpret the fine print to mean that in essence, no limits were appropriate.
Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the agency who is the chief advocate of the position limits rule, aimed to rebut those claims earlier this year. Mr. Chilton, in a speech in September at a United Nations panel, argued that Wall Street was ''trying to dance on the head of a legal pin.''
Still, the lawsuit filed Friday accused the agency of writing an inadequate cost-benefit analysis and not allowing the industry to adequately comment on the rule proposal. The commission was inundated with letters about the position limits plan - about 15,000 comments.
The rule's supporters promote the rule as the nation's best hope for protecting consumers from speculative commodities trading. Over the last few years, the financial industry has increased its speculation in the futures market. At the same time, the prices of the underlying commodities have fluctuated wildly, driving up energy costs and food prices. The rule would set limits on traders accumulating position in commodities, including energy products and metals, like oil and gold. Previously, the limits covered only nine agricultural commodities, including corn.
The decision to challenge the rule in the courts, while significant, is hardly surprising. Over the last year, several financial trade groups have issued thinly veiled threats of legal action. In March, the Futures Industry Association urged the commission to drop its position limits plan, saying it ''may be legally infirm.''
When the commission voted on the rule in October, the agency was fiercely divided, with three Democratic commissioners voting for the crackdown and its two Republicans voting against it.

HEADLINE: Democrats and G.O.P. Seize on Big Chance to Offer Competing Narratives

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The drop in the unemployment rate last month opens up a new front in the presidential campaign, with the White House getting a first big opportunity to define an improving trend in the economy and Republicans emphasizing that conditions still remain unacceptably bad.
Within minutes of the government's announcement that the jobless rate had declined to 8.6 percent in November from 9 percent a month earlier, Mitt Romney blasted out a statement noting that unemployment had remained above 8 percent throughout the 34 months of President Obama's tenure in office, ''the longest such spell since the Great Depression.'' 
Making no mention that the jobless rate is now down 1.5 percentage points from its peak two years ago, Mr. Romney added: ''The Obama administration may have come to accept such a high level of joblessness as the new normal. I will never accept it.''
A few hours later, the president cited the growth in jobs without ever mentioning the level of unemployment. ''Despite some strong headwinds this year, the American economy has now created, in the private sector, jobs for the past 21 months in a row,'' Mr. Obama said, appearing in Washington alongside former President Bill Clinton, as good a visual symbol as any of prosperity under a Democratic administration.
The differing responses highlight a big question as the primary seasons draws near: Which is more politically powerful, a positive trend in job growth or the absolute level of unemployment?
The ability of the two parties to persuade voters to look at the situation their way -- for Democrats, that the country is making progress and the economic medicine is working, for Republicans that no incremental improvements can eradicate the failure of Mr. Obama's economic leadership -- is now shaping up as central to the 2012 campaign.
Voters appear to judge the economy by a variety of measures other than unemployment, from job creation to income growth, as well as by a qualitative sense of well-being or lack of it. In any case, there is no assurance that joblessness will continue to drop, or that the financial crisis in Europe will not derail any hope the White House has of being able to sustain the argument that the worst is behind us.
The global uncertainties have some Democrats concerned about overplaying the progress theme, out of concern that the economy could be rocked by events outside the control of the president or anyone else in the United States. As a result, the White House is sure to hedge its bets somewhat, continuing to hammer away at themes like economic fairness and Republican obstructionism. ''While the U.S. economy is healing, the world economy continues to be in a fragile state and all economies are linked through trade and finance,'' said Alan Krueger, the chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers.
Should major economic trouble hit, Mr. Obama's team wants to have built the case for the argument that Democrats, more than Republicans, would better protect the middle class. No president has been re-elected since the 1930s with an unemployment rate at today's level.
But if the unemployment rate continues to move downward even modestly next year, Mr. Obama and his team will be able to take some comfort from history. Under this administration, the peak in unemployment was a little over two years ago, at 10.1 percent. It fell briefly below 9 percent early this year, but has not been as low as 8.6 percent since March 2009. When Mr. Obama took office in January 2009 the rate was 7.8 percent, and rising fast.
Democrats are looking to 1984, when President Ronald Reagan won re-election after the rate peaked at 10.8 in late 1982, fell to 8.5 percent a year from Election Day -- about where it is now -- and declined to 7.4 percent by the time voters went to the polls.
Mr. Obama's own forecast holds little prospect of a continued drop of the scale seen in 1984; the White House has projected that joblessness would average 9 percent next year. And this most recent November drop creates the risk that any backsliding next year would be cast as evidence that things are getting worse again.
If the economy is perceived to be deteriorating in the first half of an election year, it may be very difficult for a sitting president to change voter sentiment. In 1992, the last election to revolve around the economy, the elder President George Bush was defeated in his re-election bid as the unemployment rate rose to a high of 7.8 percent in June before easing back to 7.3 percent by Election Day.
If nothing else, the positive news on employment on Friday came at a moment when Democrats were gaining confidence that they had found an economic message that was resonating with voters, leaving Republicans feeling a bit off balance after a year in which they have driven the agenda in Washington.
Republicans on Capitol Hill were showing signs of division over whether to go along with Mr. Obama's demand for an extension of the payroll tax deduction. Mr. Obama, in turn, turned up the pressure on Republicans to go along before adjourning for Christmas.
But on the campaign trail, Mr. Obama's potential Republican challengers were ceding no ground. Newt Gingrich called Friday's employment report ''yet another landmark in the Obama jobs crisis.'' The key statistic, Mr. Gingrich said, was the more than 300,000 Americans who had dropped out of the labor force.

HEADLINE: Obama Announces Backing for Energy-Efficiency Initiative

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama joined former President Bill Clinton on Friday to announce $4 billion in government and private-sector commitments to finance building renovations to make properties energy efficient and to create tens of thousands of jobs in the process.
The two emphasized that no taxpayer money or government risk was involved as they appeared together at a commercial building near the White House, where retrofitting has provided more than 250 jobs and is expected to save the property owner $200,000 a year in utility bills. Instead, special contracts with investors allow upfront costs to be repaid with long-term energy savings. 
''I believe as strongly as I can say that this is good business, creates jobs, makes us more energy independent and helps to fight climate change,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''It's the nearest thing we've got to a free lunch in a tough economy, because all of the savings can be paid back within a reasonable amount of time -- I mean, all the costs of the construction -- through lower utility bills.''
Mr. Obama, who spoke with two workers in hard hats behind him, announced that he had directed all federal agencies to make at least $2 billion worth of energy-efficiency upgrades in the next two years. And he said 60 private-sector companies, nonprofit organizations and state and local governments -- including Best Buy, Walgreens, Alcoa, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Michigan State University, Cleveland Clinic and Delaware -- had committed to an additional $2 billion in financing to upgrade properties equivalent to 500 Empire State Buildings.
The financing commitments are in response to the Better Buildings Initiative that Mr. Obama announced in February, when he charged Mr. Clinton and his own advisory jobs council to enlist participants. The idea of the special energy-performance contracts dates to the Bush administration, but Mr. Obama, with his emphasis on green jobs, has sought to expand the effort significantly.
The broad support for the initiative was demonstrated by the presence of Thomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who has often been at odds with the Obama administration, and Randi Weingarten, who is president of the American Federation of Teachers and represented the A.F.L.-C.I.O. They and other participants in the initiative met privately with Mr. Obama and Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Donohue said in a statement, ''This is a sure-fire way to create jobs and make our nation's federal buildings more energy efficient, all without using a penny of taxpayer money.''
The initiative does not require legislation, and the White House promoted Mr. Obama's directive to government agencies as part of his We Can't Wait effort, which showcases executive actions that Mr. Obama takes to spur job creation despite Congressional Republicans' obstruction of his $447 billion jobs plan and other legislation.
Mr. Obama said Congress should sweeten tax incentives for institutions that undertake energy-efficiency projects. Then he segued to what has become a mantra: ''But we can't wait for Congress to act. And if they won't act, I will.''
After he and Mr. Clinton spoke, a reporter shouted to the former president, ''Do you have any advice to President Obama about the economy?''
''Oh, he gives me advice all the time,'' Mr. Obama interjected, to laughter.
Last month Mr. Clinton released a whole book of economic policy prescriptions, ''Back to Work,'' and White House advisers were not laughing, given the book's implicit, if unintended, rebuke to the current occupant of the White House.
But Mr. Clinton stepped back to the microphone to praise Mr. Obama. ''He did something that only a president can do: he got all these people together. And then to have the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the A.F.T. and others sort of lead the way, and saying, 'We will put our members' pensions into this because we can get a good return, it's a stable return; we'll put our current members to work and other working people to work.' '' He added, ''This is a big deal.''

HEADLINE: Profit-Taking Inside Congress

 BODY:
The ghost of George Washington Plunkitt, the 19th-century Tammany Hall boss who cynically defined ''honest graft,'' is in the air as bipartisan panic suddenly sweeps Congress over an ethical matter that is old news on Wall Street: insider trading. 
A long-languishing bill to ban stock trading on inside information that lawmakers glean at private hearings and discussions has begun moving toward passage. The bill was lifted from hibernation by a new study from the Hoover Institution and a report on ''60 Minutes'' detailing the apparent freedom lawmakers have long enjoyed from the insider trading ban that applies to the rest of America.
The reports question the trading practices of leading legislators in the House like Speaker John Boehner, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader, and Spencer Bachus, chairman of the House financial committee, when issues like health care reform and the financial crisis occupied center stage. All deny any wrongdoing but, with many others, are jumping aboard legislation offered five years ago by Louise Slaughter, a Democrat of New York.
Ms. Slaughter first proposed the bill when a Republican staffer privy to inside information was discovered making thousands of day trades from his office. The measure gathered dust and only nine co-sponsors -- until the ''60 Minutes'' report was broadcast Nov. 13. Since then, more than 130 other members have signed up.
That report complemented research by Peter Schweizer of the Hoover Institution tracking the stock profits and legislative activities of lawmakers who wind up millionaires. Earlier university studies had found stock-trading legislators smartly outperforming the market by 6 percent to 12 percent in the 1980s and 1990s.
The potential for trading on insider information from the halls of Congress is undeniable and needs to be policed. Indeed, Congress should have protected itself long ago. The nation should not be at risk of seeing its representatives wallow in the work ethic of Tammany's Plunkett: ''I seen my opportunities and I took 'em.''

HEADLINE: Market's Gain for Week Is the Strongest in 2 Years

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS; Nicholas Kulish contributed reporting from Berlin.

 BODY:
An early stock market rally fizzled on Friday but still left the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up 7.4 percent for the week, its biggest gain since March 2009.
A surprise drop in the nation's unemployment rate sent stocks higher in early trading, but the gains faded during the afternoon.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.61, to 12,019.42. The Dow ended the week up 7 percent, its largest weekly gain since July 2009. 
Bank stocks rose sharply, continuing a weeklong rally. Shares of JPMorgan Chase jumped 6.1 percent, the most among the 30 stocks in the Dow average. Morgan Stanley shares leapt 6.9 percent, the second-biggest gain of any stock in the S.& P. 500 index.
European stock indexes and the euro rose after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, made a speech pushing for tighter rules on government spending. Mrs. Merkel said the 17 countries that use the euro must quickly restore market confidence by making financial controls stricter.
Bond yields for Spain and Italy fell, a sign that investors were becoming more confident in the ability of those countries to pay their debt.
The CAC-40 in France and the FTSE 100 in Britain each rose more than 1 percent.
Rates in the United States were lower. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 15/32, to 99 23/32, and the yield fell to 2.03 percent from 2.08 percent late Thursday.
The Labor Department reported before the market opened that the unemployment rate fell to 8.6 percent last month, the lowest level in 2.5 years. Economists had expected the rate to remain 9 percent.
A big reason the rate fell so much, however, was that more than 300,000 people gave up looking for work and were no longer counted as unemployed.
The Nasdaq composite index inched up 0.73, to 2,626.93. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.31, to 1,244.28. Decisive steps by world leaders to right Europe's teetering economy sent stocks soaring on Wednesday.
The Dow jumped 490 points, its biggest gain since March 2009 and its seventh-largest one-day point gain in history. The weekly point gain of 787 in the Dow was the second-biggest in its history, following a 946-point gain in October 2008.
''This market has been gripped with fear for a long time,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital. ''And I think some of these fear factors are beginning to dissipate.''
This week's strong stock performance is partly a reflection of the market's increased volatility since August, when concerns that Europe's debt was spinning out of control made drastic stock price swings the norm. On Monday the S.& P. 500 broke a seven-day slide that had taken the index down 7.9 percent.
The improvements in the United States job market are ''another illustration that the U.S. economy is, for now at least, shrugging off the global economic downturn and fears about the collapse of the euro-zone,'' Paul Ashworth, the chief United States economist for Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
Among individual stocks, Western Digital, the data storage provider, rose 7.5 percent, the most in the S.& P. The company on Thursday raised its revenue estimate for the current quarter and said that recovery efforts at its factory in Thailand after severe flooding were proceeding faster than expected.
Shares of H&R Block, the largest tax-preparation company in the country, fell 6.4 percent after the company reported a wider quarterly loss late Thursday. H&R Block also said there was a jump in claims tied to bad loans made by its former subprime mortgage unit.

HEADLINE: Branding: Trump, the Debate Moderator

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
It's officially a reality television Republican primary now.
Donald Trump is pairing up with Newsmax, the conservative magazine and news Web site, to moderate a presidential debate in Des Moines on Dec. 27.
''Our readers and the grass roots really love Trump,'' said Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media. ''They may not agree with him on everything, but they don't see him as owned by the Washington establishment, the media establishment.'' Mr. Trump's role in the debate, which will be broadcast on the cable network Ion Television, is sure to be one of the more memorable moments in a primary season that has already delivered its fair share of circus-like spectacle.
Mr. Trump's own flirtation with running for president this year seems almost quaint (whose birth certificate was he all worked up about?) compared with more recent distractions - like allegations of adultery and sexual harassment, gaffes that seemed scripted from a late-night comedy show, and a six-figure line of credit at Tiffany & Co. 
But despite being derided by liberals - President Obama likened Mr. Trump to a ''carnival barker'' for his repeated assertions that the president was actually foreign-born - the real estate mogul carries weight with a certain element of the conservative base. And that sway seems particularly strong with the Tea Party wing of the base, which will be a decisive factor in the early primaries that are likely to determine the nominee. The debate, which unlike many recent ones will not be limited to a specific topic like national security or the economy, is set to happen just a week before the Iowa caucuses.
Newsmax sent candidates the invitation on Friday afternoon. It began, ''We are pleased to cordially invite you to ''The Newsmax Ion Television 2012 Presidential Debate,'' moderated by a truly great American, Mr. Donald J. Trump.'' Spokesmen for several candidates did not immediately respond to questions from The New York Times about whether they would accept.
Though presidential candidates may initially balk at the idea of appearing in a debate where Mr. Trump - with his bombast and The Hair - is the one posing the questions, they may ultimately see it as an invitation they can't refuse. In fact many of the candidates have already met with him, some more publicly than others. Representative Michele Bachmann has sat down with Mr. Trump several times this year. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas had dinner with him at Jean Georges, the posh Manhattan restaurant. And Mitt Romney paid a visit but carefully avoided being photographed.
And Newsmax is a powerful player itself. It has a broad reach into the conservative base, with monthly Web traffic second only to Fox News among sites with conservative-leaning audiences.
Mr. Trump has been a popular attraction at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual gathering in Washington. He was such a successful presence in the eyes of Fox News executives that they added a special weekly segment to their morning show ''Fox and Friends'' for him called ''Mondays With Trump.''
Whether his professed presidential ambitions are genuine or merely a publicity stunt seems not to matter in terms of the news media attention Mr. Trump can command. His highly publicized flirtation with running this year coincided with a Trump-branded product that stood to benefit from all the attention - a new season of his highly rated NBC show ''Celebrity Apprentice.''
The arc of his noncampaign was similar in 1987 and 1999 - when Mr. Trump also said that he was considering running for president, episodes that are often forgotten.
His book ''Trump: The Art of the Deal'' was published in November 1987 and reached The New York Times best-seller list by December. But by the time the Republican National Convention rolled around in August 1988, he had opted out.
''Everybody wants me to do it,'' he declared then. ''But I have no interest in doing it.''
And in late 1999, just before his book ''The America We Deserve'' went on sale, he began courting support as a candidate on the Reform Party ticket. He even toured the country with his girlfriend, Melania Knauss, now his wife. The outcome? You guessed it.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Is Divided On Extension Of Payroll Tax

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR; Jackie Calmes and John H. Cushman Jr. contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Deep rifts among House Republicans over a payroll tax break became evident Friday as rank-and-file members of the caucus told their leaders that they did not want to extend the cut in Social Security taxes for another year, as demanded by President Obama.
Given the effort Democrats are making to capitalize on the issue, Speaker John A. Boehner warned Republicans they would run political risks and could be accused of allowing a tax increase if they blocked the continuation of payroll tax relief set to expire at the end of the year. Lawmakers coming out of the caucus meeting Friday said they had had a spirited debate. 
''Most people standing up to speak were troubled'' by legislation to extend the payroll tax cut, said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. ''There was a divide between the rank and file and the leadership. There was a lot of disquiet in that room.''
In December 2010, Congress temporarily reduced the employee's share of the Social Security payroll tax by 2 percentage points, to 4.2 percent of wages. If Congress does nothing, the rate will revert to 6.2 percent in January.
Mr. Flake said, ''We should not be extending the payroll tax holiday unless we have the courage to reform entitlement programs as well.''
Mr. Obama, during an appearance on Friday with former President Bill Clinton to promote energy efficiency in buildings, suggested that Congress should delay its holiday adjournment if the impasse on the payroll tax cut was not resolved.
''I expect that it's going to get done before Congress leaves,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Otherwise Congress may not be leaving, and we can all spend Christmas here together.''
Republican leaders said they would address their members' concerns, as part of a legislative package that would also include an extension of jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed and a measure to spare doctors from a 27 percent cut in their Medicare reimbursements, scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1.
In an effort to round up Republican votes for the bill, House Republican leaders said they would include proposals easing air pollution standards for industrial boilers and clearing the way for construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to refineries along the Gulf Coast of Texas. Republicans say those proposals will create jobs but the Obama administration has put off a decision on the pipeline route until at least 2013 and Democrats are likely to resist the provision.
To offset the cost of the payroll tax relief, the House bill would cut spending in some domestic programs and raise money by selling radio spectrum licenses.
The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, criticized these provisions as extraneous. Republicans ''are taking a circuitous route to nowhere,'' she said, and they appear to be in disarray because they are ''feeling the heat'' from Democrats who insist on extension of the payroll tax cut.
Divisions were also evident among Senate Republicans. On Thursday night, the Senate rejected a proposal devised by Senate Republican leaders to extend the payroll tax cut for a year. Twenty Republican senators voted for that bill, and 26, including some of the more conservative members, voted against it.
House Republicans voiced several concerns about extending the payroll tax cut. First, they said, it could undermine the Social Security trust fund. Second, they said, it would have a substantial cost, nearly $120 billion in one year. Third, they said, the legislation uses a budget gimmick, offsetting costs incurred in one year with savings that would be achieved through spending cuts over 10 years.
In addition, some Republicans doubt that the payroll tax cut stimulates the economy. Finally, they said, Congress could find itself in exactly the same situation at the end of 2012.
Lawmakers of both parties say one of the great strengths of Social Security is that it has for decades relied on the payroll tax as a dedicated, guaranteed source of money. To make up for the loss of payroll tax revenue, Mr. Obama and Congressional leaders would use general revenues from other sources to shore up the Social Security trust fund.
House Republicans expressed qualms about this arrangement. ''It's robbing Peter to pay Paul,'' said Representative Bob Latta of Ohio. ''People paying taxes now need to know that Social Security will be there when they retire.''
Representative Scott Garrett, Republican of New Jersey, noted that the Senate on Thursday rejected two competing versions of a payroll tax cut. ''If the Senate is able to do that, we could do it too,'' he said.
''We should not be taking money from seniors to give to people who are fortunate enough to have a job,'' Mr. Garrett said.
Representative Charles Boustany Jr., Republican of Louisiana, said, ''The leadership was hoping there would be broad acceptance of the package they presented, but there wasn't.''
Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has been skeptical about the payroll tax cut because of its possible impact on Social Security.
''It's not my favorite choice,'' Mr. Camp said Friday. ''But it's something we are trying to find a way to accomplish.''

HEADLINE: In Washington State, New Bid to Raise Taxes

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
OLYMPIA, Wash. -- A strange sound rang out from the Senate Democratic caucus meeting at the State Capitol here this week.
''We broke into applause,'' said Senator Derek Kilmer of Gig Harbor. ''There hasn't been a lot of applause in caucus in the last few years.''
There may not be much more anytime soon. The applause was for the news that Boeing and union machinists, long at odds, had reached a sweeping agreement to mend their differences and build the new 737 Max airplane here in the Puget Sound region. The deal would mean thousands of jobs for years to come, yet it was no antidote for the pressing problem the caucus had to address. It would not balance the budget.
After cutting $10 billion over the past three years, including trimming higher education spending by half, slicing health care programs and streamlining state agencies, lawmakers and the 6.7 million residents of Washington State have been rewarded for their sacrifices with more bad news: The state has another enormous budget deficit. 
''I can't take it anymore,'' said Gov. Christine Gregoire, a Democrat. ''I sure hope that's where the people of the State of Washington are.''
So now, facing a budget gap of nearly $2 billion and more bleak revenue forecasts, Ms. Gregoire and some Democratic leaders say they will seek the same solution they have in the past: To raise taxes.
The question is whether, this time, voters will actually let them.
It was barely a year ago that voters rejected nearly $1 billion in increases, largely through sales taxes on things like soda and candy. Now, Ms. Gregoire is being regarded as somewhat daring -- and she has struck a more animated public posture -- in proposing a temporary half-cent increase in the state sales tax. If passed, it would raise $494 million, filling only about one-fourth of the projected hole. California, by comparison, is considering a slew of tax increase proposals that could easily exceed $10 billion.
Ms. Gregoire is walking a particularly tight political rope. The Legislature is controlled by Democrats, but a ballot measure passed last year requires a two-thirds vote for lawmakers to raise taxes. Washington also has no income tax, and last fall voters resoundingly rejected a well-financed effort, led by Bill Gates Sr., the father of the Microsoft co-founder, to levy one on the wealthy. And some people who might support an income tax on the wealthy, including among the Occupy protesters who showed up in force at the Capitol this week, oppose an increase in the sales tax. The current state sales tax is 6.5 cents, but it is 9.5 percent in Seattle after local surcharges.
''They think it's regressive, and it is,'' Ms. Gregoire said in an interview. ''But you know what my line back to them is? 'Cutting kids so they're not getting a decent education is regressive. Cutting services for the disabled so they have no place to go is regressive.' ''
It has been just six months since the Legislature closed a $6 billion budget gap, mostly through cuts. But almost immediately, revenue began falling far short of projections. In September, the governor called lawmakers back for the current special session.
She proposed two options: An ''all-cuts'' budget and a set of tax increases that she says would ''buy back'' many of the reductions to education, health care and services for the disabled. She is seeking about $341 million in revenue increases through the Legislature, most of which would require the two-thirds vote, but she wants to ask voters to raise the sales tax. That increase would expire in 2015.
''We're buying three very specific things,'' the governor said. ''There will be no doubt in the mind of voters what they are getting. They are getting education, protection for our most vulnerable and public safety.''
Voters in Arizona, a far more conservative state, but one hit early and hard by the recession, approved a temporary 1-cent increase in May 2010. Temporary taxes passed in California and North Carolina have expired.
''They cut first, for several fiscal years, severely, because they had to,'' Scott D. Pattison, the executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said of Arizona. ''But then the politics changed when the cuts were so severe.''
Ms. Gregoire says the politics have changed in Washington State, too. Recent independent surveys suggest a narrow majority would support a sales tax increase. Some major corporations, including Boeing and Microsoft, have shown support. The powerful Association of Washington Business has indicated it will remain neutral. To put the sales tax increase on the ballot in March would require simple majority approval by the Legislature, but even getting that will require negotiation.
Several moderate Democrats opposed the tax increases that the Legislature passed last year. (A citizens' initiative put the taxes on the ballot last year, and voters rejected them.) This week, after a meeting of the budget-writing Ways and Means Committee, Senator Jim Kastama, a Democrat from Puyallup, pulled up a PowerPoint presentation he had created that showed the budget gap widening over the next five years, even if the sales tax was increased.
''I want to go to the voters and say, 'Hey, I'm solving the problem,' but this really isn't a fix,'' Mr. Kastama said. ''We keep punting it, and I'm tired of punting it.''
The senator is a member of the so-called Road Kill Caucus, a centrist group that has wielded new power in lean times. The name is said to be rooted in the members' being run over in previous legislative sessions by the left and right.
Then again, the first days of this session were most notable for the loud presence of Occupy the Capitol protesters. They disrupted budget hearings and frustrated lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Several protesters were arrested.
''But I'll tell you what was weirder,'' said Senator Ed Murray, a Democrat from Seattle who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. ''The first few years of this recession, this Great Recession, I couldn't believe how quiet it was down here.''
There are Republicans in the Legislature, of course, and some see a conflict in all the new talk of taxes. ''If you have the 1 percent saying, 'Tax the 99 percent,' '' said Senator Joseph Zarelli of Ridgefield, the lead Republican budget negotiator, ''and the 99 percent saying, 'Tax the 1 percent,' you have a standstill.''

HEADLINE: Sanctions Against Syria Are Keenly Felt, From Shops to Oil Fields

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DAMASCUS, Syria -- The walls are suddenly closing in around enterprising young Syrians who bought into the idea of a modernized economy promised by President Bashar al-Assad -- their simplest money transfers are blocked, and their credit cards are useless outside Syria as the growing list of international sanctions darkens their financial future.
The owner of a handicrafts business who this week tried to transfer $450 to the Lebanese bank account of one of her suppliers found the transaction rejected because it originated in Syria. She had to hand-deliver the cash instead. Then a client, an investor for whom she is designing furniture for a new Abu Dhabi hotel, asked her to export whatever was completed immediately, lest the entire shipment get stuck.
''This is not the solution'' to end the crisis in Syria, said the woman, pulling her fashionable black wool coat tighter against the sudden winter chill hitting this superficially calm but beleaguered capital. ''This is a way to make us starve to punish the president.'' 
Nearly nine months after a sustained popular uprising erupted against the Assad government, Syria finds itself increasingly isolated, with even onetime allies condemning its use of lethal force. Turkey, the Arab League, the European Union and the United States have all imposed economic sanctions.
The measures are already biting, in ways evident to a reporter during a brief, rare visit allowed by the government, which was seeking to draw attention to its claim that the Arab League sanctions in particular amounted to an ''economic war'' against Syria.
The crucial question for Mr. Assad, the international community and the tens of thousands who rose up against the government, is whether such financial pain will induce the leadership to halt the violent suppression of antigovernment protests.
The sanctions are already unraveling the most significant change of Mr. Assad's tenure: linking Syria to the global economy, allowing private banks and opening economic opportunity for young people in nation where about three-quarters of the population is under the age of 35.
Optimists think the pressure could work, largely because the biggest tycoons are close to the president, especially his cousin, Rami Makhlouf, and some dozen sons of his father's closest allies. (Mr. Makhlouf gobbled up so many state enterprises put up for sale that Syrians wryly dubbed the privatization process ''Ramification.'')
Pessimists worry that the government, including the scions of the old guard, will let the economy sink further to cling to power.
''Up until the last minute, I did not believe the Arab League would take such a decision,'' said Mohammed Ghassan al-Qallaa, the president of the Damascus Chamber of Commerce, his office filled with Assad paraphernalia, including a small gold bust of Mr. Assad's father, former President Hafez al-Assad. ''It was like a poke in the eye.''
Good statistics remain a rarity here. But trade and investment activity is already off by 50 percent, financial analysts in Damascus said, and estimates on how much the economy will shrink this year range from 12 to 20 percent. The higher estimates kick in if sanctions -- like a flight ban still being debated by the Arab League -- are toughened.
Layoffs are rampant, with unemployment estimated to have risen to 22 percent. The tourism sector, which amassed about $6 billion in 2010, a boom year, has been decimated.
Hotel managers report occupancy rates of 15 percent or lower, if they will divulge them at all, and numerous restaurants have gone broke. Financial analysts said the luxury Four Seasons chain tried to close its once-booming Damascus hotel, an effort rejected by the government, which owns an estimated 50 percent share.
Sven Wiedenhaupt, the hotel's general manager, refused to divulge his occupancy figures or how many staff members had been laid off. But he silently cast his head first left, then right to emphasize the absence of anyone in the cavernous, distinctly chilly lobby. ''We are still keeping the lights on and trying to remain cutting edge,'' Mr. Wiedenhaupt said.
At one hotel in the northern city of Aleppo, the appearance of two German tourists proved so startling that the entire staff, from the manager to the chambermaids, rushed to pose for pictures with them. ''It was like they had arrived from another planet,'' said a Syrian woman who witnessed the scene and, like others interviewed, requested anonymity for fear of reprisal.
Although sanctions blocked transactions in dollars, until this week Syrian businessmen could still work in euros, Saudi riyals or dirhams from the United Arab Emirates. Those windows are closing.
One businessman with experience in the sanctions against Sudan said they had little effect because global vigilance proved lax. But scrutiny of Syrian transactions has been fast and widespread, he said.
In addition, the Assad government has been so focused on portraying the protests as an armed invasion by foreign jihadists that it has done little to anticipate the impact of the sanctions, analysts said. That was compounded by the firing in March of the cabinet ministers responsible for modernizing the economy.
Oil sales -- accounting for a major share of the government's revenues -- plummeted as the main European customers stopped buying. Royal Dutch Shell announced Friday that it was stopping operations in Syria to comply with new European Union sanctions. Even if Syria found new markets, analysts noted, insuring shipments would be likely to prove impossible.
Citing government figures, Jihad Yazigi, the editor of The Syria Report, a business newsletter, said oil production was down to 270,000 barrels per day, from 368,000 barrels, because of the decline in demand. Syria imports light crude oil to help refine the heavy local oil, so it faces shortages of gasoline, kerosene and heating oil as sanctions curtail the imports.
Banking has also been battered. The fact that Syria licensed 14 private banks has been the crown jewel in President Assad's economic modernization. But deposits in those banks shrank 20 percent in the past nine months, according to one private study, with about $2 billion withdrawn.
Construction has suffered as well, particularly large infrastructure projects. An engineer who frequently bids on government contracts said that no new projects were forthcoming and that some already started had been stopped.
The Damascus souks, or marketplaces, are among the few such places in the Middle East that still produce traditional handicrafts. Their wooden furniture inlaid with mother-of-pearl and brass lanterns are in high demand throughout the region.
Over sweet cups of apple tea, one manufacturer grumbled that even simple business transactions are becoming a headache. He worried that Syria would repeat the experience of Iraq, where the government under sanctions and black marketers thrived via illicit oil sales while impoverished university professors ended up driving cabs. ''Bashar Assad is one person, but there are 23 million Syrians,'' he said. ''All this pressure they put on Syria just makes the regime stronger because it gives them power.''
As the pressure mounts and the killing continues, two schools of thought emerged here.
In one corner stood the so-called traditionalists, particularly older businessmen who have lived through various iterations of sanctions over the past 30 years, not to mention the haphazard socialist central planning. For them the new measures were unquestionably a blow.
But they argued that Syrians would adjust exactly as they did in the 1980s, when they endured rationing or drove to kiosks just over the Jordanian border to buy basics like toilet paper.
But many in the younger generation are not quite so sanguine. They point out that, in the past, Syria was far less connected to the international economy. One positive change brought by Mr. Assad since inheriting power in 2000 has been edging Syria's economy onto at least the slow lane of the global information superhighway.
The new generation is bracing for Syria's being abruptly forced off that highway, and for the economy's sputtering.
If there is one bright spot in Syria's markets, it has been the growth in food sales. Though they are up, they were most likely spurred by hoarding, which inflated prices by about 20 percent, experts said. Syria has warehoused strategic commodities like cotton, olive oil and a two-year supply of wheat. Officials said it was self-sufficient in most food.
''We have no fear that people will starve or freeze,'' Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said in a news conference denouncing the sanctions. ''They will affect the citizens without any doubt, but our people are used to such pressures.''
The entrepreneurial generation is not convinced. ''Before, they could last years in a closed system where there was no connection to the outside world, but the whole dynamic has shifted,'' said a financial analyst. ''It is no longer an issue of hunkering down and eating the strategic reserve of wheat.''

PERSON: Giorgio Napolitano 

HEADLINE: From Ceremonial Figure to Italy's Quiet Power Broker

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO; Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ROME
SOME have taken to calling him simply ''Re Giorgio,'' or King George, for his stately defense of Italian democratic institutions and the outsize albeit behind-the-scenes role he played in the rapid shift from the cinematic government of Silvio Berlusconi to the technocratic one of Mario Monti.
He is President Giorgio Napolitano, 86, a former high-ranking member of Italy's Communist Party -- Henry A. Kissinger is said to have called him his ''favorite Communist'' -- who last month capped a distinguished career by orchestrating one of the most complex political transfers in Italian postwar history, and who remains a key guarantor of political stability in a rocky time.
His performance was all the more impressive in that the Italian presidency is a largely symbolic office, with no executive power. But Mr. Napolitano, who is known for his straight talk and down-to-earth style in a floridly baroque culture, pushed that role to its limit to become a quiet power broker. 
He spent months laying the groundwork for the transition -- consulting with Italian political leaders, European leaders, American officials and the Bank of Italy to shepherd the creation of a viable alternative government for the ''post-Berlusconi'' moment.
''Now is the time to show maximum responsibility. It is not the time to pay off old scores nor for sterile partisan recriminations,'' Mr. Napolitano said in a statement when announcing Mr. Monti's nomination. ''It is time to re-establish a climate of calmness and mutual respect.''
''Napolitano not only dictated the timing of the solution but also the contents, that is the unusual thing,'' said Andrea Simoncini, a constitutional law professor at the University of Florence. ''He didn't only say, 'You have to do it soon'; he basically chose Monti and created the conditions so that people couldn't not say yes to Monti.''
Today, Mr. Monti's government is widely referred to as ''a government of the president,'' backed by Mr. Napolitano and the European Union as much as by the Italian Parliament, which gave Mr. Monti's government a rousing vote of confidence last month but has yet to approve unpopular new austerity measures.
As often happens in Italy, momentum built slowly, but change happened swiftly. For months, Mr. Berlusconi had clung to power without solid support, making much-needed economic reforms impossible as world markets continued to hammer Italy. The trigger was pulled on Nov. 8, when Mr. Berlusconi lost his ruling majority on a vote the same day bond markets drove borrowing rates on Italian bonds to the same levels that have required other euro zone countries to seek bailouts.
That evening, a humbled Mr. Berlusconi went to meet Mr. Napolitano at the Quirinal presidential palace for consultations. Aides said the meeting was cordial, but its outcome was clear: The once-Teflon prime minister had agreed to step down.
Moving quickly, Mr. Napolitano plucked Mr. Monti from his post as president of Milan's Bocconi University and anointed him as a senator for life, making him a full member of Parliament, not just an academic outsider. ''That was an act of genius,'' said Corrado Augias, a veteran Italian political commentator and writer. ''He took a professor and redressed him as a politician.''
IT helped that Mr. Napolitano, whose seven-year term began in 2006, enjoys popular approval ratings of around 80 percent, compared with 20 percent in recent weeks for Mr. Berlusconi. ''This was his life insurance, because if he hadn't had it, Berlusconi would have eaten him for lunch,'' Mr. Augias said.
In the topsy-turvy world of Mr. Berlusconi's Italy, where the prime minister's personal life came to overshadow the work of governance, Mr. Napolitano had emerged as the anti-Berlusconi. With his elegant yet feisty wife, Clio, by his side, a lawyer whom he married in 1959, Mr. Napolitano came to be seen as embodying a different Italy, one of civic virtue.
This month, the Italian edition of Wired magazine named Mr. Napolitano its man of the year, for displaying ''a surprising speed in remaining connected to reality. In a word: Wired.''
Even after Mr. Berlusconi did step down, the idea of replacing his cabinet with a technocratic government was not at all a given. The former prime minister's center-right coalition was dead set on early elections, and some in his former coalition criticize the Monti government as an anti-democratic coup.
But in a new order in which markets trumped traditional democratic processes, President Obama, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France all called Mr. Napolitano during the delicate transition to express their support for his leadership -- calls widely seen as tacit support for a Monti government over early elections.
It was a striking indication of how far Mr. Napolitano, to say nothing of the rest of the world, has come in the last years of his career.
At one time, the idea of an American president thanking Mr. Napolitano -- who was essentially the foreign minister of the Italian Communist Party -- or even calling him was unthinkable.
In his earlier years, Mr. Napolitano did not stray much from the Communist Party line, once going so far as to say that the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 had contributed to peace in the world, according to a 2006 article in Corriere della Sera. But by 1969, he was part of a group of Italian Communists who broke with the Kremlin to criticize the crackdown of the Prague Spring uprising of 1968.
LIKE many Communists from his native Naples, Mr. Napolitano hailed from the more conservative wing of the party, whose members were known as the ''miglioristi,'' or the ''improvers,'' for their desire to make the world better through government rather than revolution.
The ambassador to Italy under President Jimmy Carter, Richard N. Gardner, wrote in his memoirs about his secret meetings with Mr. Napolitano, who was respected enough to become one of the first Italian Communist officials to visit the United States.
He made the trip in 1978, just weeks after the dramatic kidnapping of Prime Minister Aldo Moro by a leftist radical group, and delivered well-received lectures at leading universities. None other than the seven-time Christian Democratic prime minister Giulio Andreotti, the mastermind of postwar Italian politics, said that he had helped secure Mr. Napolitano a visa.
In the late 1980s, as the communist project was ending and the party reacted by closing ranks, Mr. Napolitano fell out of favor by calling for closer ties with the Socialists, whose social democratic views he largely shared. He left instead for Strasbourg, France, where he was a member of the European Parliament from 1989 to 1992.
After the collapse of Italy's old political order in a bribery scandal, Mr. Napolitano returned to Italy in 1992 and became speaker of the Lower House, where he commanded broad support. In 1996 he was seen as enough above the fray to be named Italy's first post-Communist interior minister, a politically sensitive position that involves overseeing the secret service.
Now, Italians are looking to Mr. Napolitano to guide the ship of state with quiet skill as Mr. Monti and his team of technocrats take on the treacherous challenge of modernizing Italy's creaking economy.
''I appreciate his dynamism and courage, especially remarkable for a man of that age,'' said Paolo Olsoufieff, a retired businessman, as he read a newspaper in a restaurant in downtown Rome. ''He is the only man capable of holding at bay the circus of ferocious beasts that is the Italian Parliament.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Subpoenas Details on Marlins' Stadium Financing

BYLINE: KEN BELSON


HIGHLIGHT: The Securities and Exchange Commission has subpoenaed the City of Miami and Miami-Dade County about the details of the financing for the Marlins' new stadium. 

 BODY:
As the Marlins' new stadium nears completion in Miami, the wreckage from the deal to finance it continues to mount.
The Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed the City of Miami and Miami-Dade County seeking details about what investigation and analysis they did before agreeing to issue nearly $500 million in bonds to pay for the stadium and adjoining parking lots in the Little Havana neighborhood.
In a 20-page letter to the county dated Dec. 1, the commission also asked for any documents concerning the team's ability to help pay for the stadium.
It is also seeking records of any campaign contributions that the Marlins may have given to officials working for the city, the county and the state, and all correspondence going back to 2007 with the owners of the Marlins and their lawyers as well as the baseball commissioner Bud Selig and Bob DuPuy, his former deputy.
The commission wants all the documents by Jan. 6, a deadline the county may have trouble meeting, R. A. Cuevas Jr., its lawyer, said.
P. J. Loyello, the Marlins' spokesman, said the team would "fully cooperate" with the investigation, which was first reported by The Miami Herald. A spokesman for Major League Baseball declined to comment.
City and county officials approved the deal to pay for more than three-quarters of the estimated $645 million cost of the stadium and parking lots in 2009. They did so during a deep recession, when services were being slashed, and despite calls to hold a referendum on the financing of the stadium and lots, which are being paid for with hotel bed taxes and parking fees.
City and county officials were accused of spending too much money on the Marlins - a for-profit organization - when other buildings, like the convention center, needed repairs. The Marlins also refused to show government officials their financial books.
This became an embarrassment last year when leaked financial documents showed that the Marlins were profitable in 2008 and 2009.
It may be difficult for the commission to accuse the Marlins of misrepresenting their finances if they did not represent them in the first place. Rather, the blame would fall to county and city officials if a lack of due diligence were found before the bonds were issued. The county and the city are also squabbling over who, if anyone, should pay property tax on the stadium's four parking lots. The county appraiser contends that the city is not exempt because it is leasing its parking spaces to a for-profit venture, the Marlins.
Although the Marlins were not subpoenaed, and the commission was careful to state that it had not concluded that anyone had broken the law, the investigation has the potential to cast a cloud over the team and its new home, which is set to open in April.
The federal investigation could scare off players from signing with the Marlins. On the other hand, players could still join the Marlins if the money offered was significantly higher than that of other teams.
The question is how long the investigation could last. The commission has deep resources and unlimited time, and investigations related to sports and teams are sure to receive a lot of news media attention. The commission could also force the Marlins and Major League Baseball to reveal rarely seen financial records.
"Sports is very high profile, and if the S.E.C. can find something here that was done illegally, then that will send a message to communities similarly situated," saidJordanKobritz, an assistant professor of sports management at Eastern New Mexico University. "If they smell any smoking gun as a result of the documents produced, that could lead them to any direction they want to go, including to the offices of M.L.B."

HEADLINE: How the Internet Is Ruining Everything

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: One of the authors of "The Cluetrain Manifesto" says the hyperlinked structure of the Internet has destroyed several millennia of Western thought and aspiration. He likes this, saying it is a better model of how the world really works. Business, not government, might create our future societies. 

 BODY:
The ongoing argument about whether the Internet is a boon or a bust to civilization usually centers on the Web's abundance. With so much data and so many voices, we each have knowledge formerly hard-won by decades of specialization. With some new fact or temptation perpetually beckoning, we may be the superficial avatars of an A.D.D. culture.
David Weinberger, one of the earliest and most perceptive analysts of the Internet, thinks we are looking at the wrong thing. It is not the content itself, but the structure of the Internet, that is the important thing. At least, as far as the destruction of a millennia-long human project is concerned.
Mr. Weinberger, a co-director of the Harvard Library Innovation Lab and a researcher at Harvard'sBerkman Center for the Internet and Society, is one of the authors of "The Cluetrain Manifesto," a blog started in 1999 that became a bestselling book in 2000. The book still enjoys a huge following, particularly with cutting-edge business thinkers. It opened with the statement that "markets are getting smarter," a questionable observation in light of such follies as the Internet stock bubble, subprime mortgages, and European debt issuance. Many other observations about the impact of global conversations, Wikileaks-style flow of information, and subverted corporate hierarchies, however, now seem both prophetic and prescriptive.
Mr. Weinberger's new book, called "Too Big to Know," will be published in January. He gave a lecture with the same name last Wednesday at the University of California at Berkeley's School of Information, touching on the book's main themes. Chief among them was the destruction of our institutions of knowledge and culture.
"Newspapers, encyclopedias, they are just gone, at the touch of a hyperlink," Mr. Weinberger said. The institutions of "education and politics - they'll just shatter. How did they get to be so fragile?" With the pained glee of a scientist discovering very bad news, he added, "knowledge for my generation was at the center of the human quest. It is going the way of the recording industry. It is a term that won't survive the generation."
The abundance problem of the Web, Mr. Weinberger said, is really an old one. The Roman philosopher Seneca talked about "too many books" (echoing Ecclesiastes 12:12, "of making many books there is no end.") The issue nowadays is to some extent the need for good filters, pushing away information after centuries of seeking it. 
But more important where the destruction of the institutions that supposedly steward the development of knowledge is concerned, he said, is the Web's ever-changing structure of links, which undermines hierarchical analysis by allowing everyone to see and contribute different points of view. "In a highly-connected medium we would expect knowledge to change. And it does," he said, "the knowledge lives in webs and networks as it has in books." 
While that can lead to speedy analysis, Mr. Weinberger said, it also means we live in a world of continual change and situational thinking. Every understanding is open to change, a kind of point of view that can be undermined by a non-expert with a persuasive argument. Even top researchers now acknowledge this, he noted: Recent claims that neutrinos travel faster than light are both posted and debated in places like arXiv.org, without the traditional process of peer-review. "It did not respect professional credentials," the Harvard researcher said.
This, along with the advent of seemingly leaderless, non-hierarchical movements from the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street, does give some evidence to the idea that our systems of knowledge organization "were based on brave falsehoods," as Mr. Weinberger put it. Since Aristotle, there has been at least lip service to the idea of teleology, a process of discovery that leads to greater and greater understanding. We have invested much of our society in making such a process better. 
Now, he said, the model of a protean, ever-linked and ever-changing world is killing that. "The dream of the West has been that we will live together in knowledge, that there is One Knowledge. The Web is saying 'Nice try,'" Mr. Weinberger said. By its very success we know that "the Internet as a medium is far more like the world we live in" and "the Web is closer to the phenomenological truth of our lives," he said.
There is a lot of truth to this, so to speak. Mr. Weinberger's book will likely make a splash and be widely discussed, as it deserves to be. He did not offer any ideas about what lasting institutions could be developed as the old ones are undone. He did say that business, which responds to the market, would probably steward the change better than government, which has fixed commitments.
Mr. Weinberger's argument raises an entirely different point. The idea that "truth" is situational and changing, always best described in quote marks, has emerged in many areas of contemporary thought. Ideas of situationalism, disorder as a natural state, and perpetual change are implicit in the thinking of Darwin, Marx and Freud. Quantum physics further undermined the idea that we can know everything with observations like the Uncertainty Principle. Postmodern philosophy and literary theory also questions the idea of objective reality, in favor of knowledge based on things like political background or sexual orientation. Put another way, when William Butler Yeats wrote "the center cannot hold," he also stated the anxiety of our age. That was in 1919.
Instead of giving us of a new and better way of seeing the world, the Internet is a tool that embodies how we have wanted to see the world for some time. We have built it according to our new ideas about the world, and it gained a power that is destroying pre-existing structures. 
There is some precedent for this; the logical methods of observation and refinement at the dawn of the Scientific Revolution enabled the creation and improvement of the microscope and the telescope. In turn, these tools both grew and shrank our sense of the world, enhancing the idea of hierarchies. Much social and scientific organization followed that path and destroyed its predecessors. We build the tool to change things, and then the tool changes us.
I put this to Mr. Weinberger. "Did we invent something to fulfill all the philosophies, or were they right?" he said. "I don't know. And in a way, it doesn't matter." That is probably the right answer, when you believe in a world of ever-changing situations. It does not matter if the discovery precedes its invention; we only deal with the thing that seems most true for now, having abandoned the idea of Truth. 
Though of course, when a Harvard researcher values something because it affords a more accurate picture of reality, the end of hierarchy and a quest for ultimate understanding seems a long way off. 
An earlier version of this post misstated the Yeats quote.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at the president's weekly address. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
There are deep rifts among House Republicans over extending the cut in Social Security payroll taxes for another year, Robert Pear reports. Speaker John A. Boehner warned members of his party that they would run political risks and could be accused of allowing a tax increase if they block the continuation of payroll tax relief.

        
Given the compounding sex scandal swirling around Herman Cain, there is much speculation that a Saturday announcement about the future of his campaign could be the end of his candidacy, Susan Saulny and Robbie Brown report.

        
Representative Jessie L. Jackson Jr. has acknowledged that his congressional staff may have "inadvertently" violated ethics rules when they helped him wage a public campaign to be appointed to the Senate seat being vacated in Barack Obama in 2008. The admission is likely to be a key factor in his re-election campaign since he faces a serious primary challenge, Eric Lipton writes.

        
"Evidence-based" pilot programs make taxpayer dollars for federal programs contingent upon positive results and measurable success, Annie Lowrey writes. But they are under threat from a House proposal that eliminates all federal financing for four of the six programs, and significantly cuts money for a fifth.

        
Richard W. Stevenson examines a big question as the primary season draws near: Which is more politically powerful, a positive jobs trend or the absolute level of unemployment? While the White House is trying to define the decline in the jobless rate as an improving trend in the economy, Republicans are emphasizing that conditions still remain unacceptably bad. 
Weekly Addresses

        
President Obama play down the news that the economy added more jobs in November, saying the gains should only motivate lawmakers to push for more job-boosting initiatives. "We need to keep this growth going and strengthen it," he said. "Because now is the time to step on the gas, not slam on the brakes." Mr. Obama is hoping a congressional victory with the payroll tax cut will fuel more economic acceleration. "You see, last year, both parties came together to cut payroll taxes for the typical middle-class family by about $1,000. But that tax cut is set to expire at the end of this month," he said. "If that happens, the same family will see its taxes go up by $1,000." He announced the addition of a tax calculator to WhiteHouse.gov for Americans to see exactly what the stakes are for them on this issue. "Try it out," he said. "Then let your members of Congress know where you stand."

HEADLINE: Remember Kyoto? Most Nations Don't

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. SEMPLE Jr.

 BODY:
Delegates from 194 countries will meet this week in Durban, South Africa, to see whether the world can do a better job of controlling the man-made greenhouse gases that scientists believe will lead to sea-level rise, floods, drought and famine. Over the years, there has been far more talk than action.
In 1997, these nations collectively promised as a first step to reduce emissions by about 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. But only 37 industrialized nations agreed to binding targets under the treaty, known as the Kyoto Protocol; the developing nations promised simply to do their best. 
The overall results have been dismal, even by Kyoto's modest standards. That agreement expires next year, and there is almost no chance that the delegates in Durban will agree on a replacement. Even 1997 signatories like Japan and Canada will not endorse a new treaty unless the Chinese do, which they won't. What we'll see is another set of aspirational targets that will mean little if countries choose to ignore them.
On this point, history is not encouraging. From 1990 to 2009, global emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas produced by burning fossil fuels, rose by a whopping 38 percent. The increase would have been far worse were it not for the economic collapse of the old Soviet bloc; emissions from those countries dropped by about one-third.
The first chart traces the change in CO2 emissions around the world in the past two decades. Western Europe has managed to reduce emissions by 5 percent by adopting a cap-and-trade system that effectively puts a price on carbon emissions; substituting natural gas for coal; and, in Germany's case, greatly expanding the use of renewable energy sources like solar power.
The biggest obstacle to global progress has been countries like China and India that made no pledges at Kyoto because, they argued (and continue to argue), the industrialized world caused most of the problem and thus bore most of the responsibility for solving it. This reasoning has lost much of its punch as those two countries have become economic powerhouses. Over all, emissions in countries that did not agree to targets have more than doubled, while China's have tripled.
What of the United States? As the largest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases among big economies, America should have taken a leadership role. It did not. The Senate refused to ratify the Kyoto accord, President George W. Bush flatly repudiated it, and Congress failed to put a price on carbon. Having pledged to reduce greenhouse gases by 7 percent, America saw its carbon emissions rise by almost that amount.
The trends were not wholly negative. Carbon dioxide emissions rose steadily in the 1990s, as the second chart shows, partly because the economy took off after the 1992 election, and power plants and factories started operating at full capacity. Emissions then leveled off after 2000, partly because some manufacturing moved abroad but also because rules requiring more energy efficiency began to kick in.
And further improvements are within reach. In the United States, old coal-fired power plants are closing, the price of natural gas (which emits only half the carbon dioxide of coal) is dropping, and automobiles are becoming more efficient. Clean energy sources like solar power are being introduced in poor African nations, and the Chinese are investing heavily in clean energy as well. Are these bits and pieces enough? Almost assuredly not. Many scientists say we need a wholesale shift in the way the world produces and uses energy, and the time window for such a shift is closing. The question at Durban is whether the world can act before the window slams shut.

HEADLINE: Teaching Good Sex

 BODY:
As a 17-year-old girl, I have always found the traditional approach to sex ed, both in school and from parents, to be rather counterproductive. They aim to educate you in a manner that will allow you to have safe sex, but I feel that it teaches girls to feel bad about sex. It becomes a question of pleasing your parents or your boyfriend and not yourself. This article literally had me shedding tears of joy to think that an educated adult recognizes the confusion surrounding sex and seeks to address it in a manner that is free from shame or the pressure to do the ''right thing,'' whatever that may be. It's not that I'm going to go out and sleep with someone tomorrow; I simply feel that I am free to operate how I see fit, regardless of cultural stereotypes that could make sex a negative experience.
EMMA STEINMETZ, 
Rochester, N.Y.
Critics of Al Vernacchio's high-school class might argue that his lessons are O.K. for adults, but not for teenagers. But kids aren't automatically issued an Adult Sexytimes Manual on their 18th birthdays. They enter adulthood with the lessons they learned in adolescence -- and if all those lessons taught them was ''don't,'' they're going to have a lot of trouble. I wish I'd learned some strategies for talking about condoms and sexually-transmitted-infection testing with real partners, not the unrealistic, one-dimensional meanies who populated many of our instructional videos (in the disaster models, those who want sex from you are often mean). I wish I'd learned that some women experience pain during sex and that there are ways to treat this. I wish I'd learned how to recognize pressure that's more subtle than ''if you loved me, you'd have sex with me.'' I wish I'd learned to advocate for my own sexual health, emotional and physical. Given that some abstinence-only curriculums still tell kids that premarital sex leads straight to death, it might take a long time for schools to teach things like this. But if nobody asks, they never will.
ANNA NORTH,
Jezebel.com, Nov. 16
The next time Laurie Abraham visits, please be sure she drives past the Main Line's Friends' Central School to West Philadelphia. Here, she will encounter 14-year-olds telling their girlfriends ''I want a baby by you,'' 11-year-olds shaving their legs to please 17-year-old boyfriends and couples so consumed by violence that one boyfriend, enraged over a pregnancy he lobbied for, threatened to yank the baby out through his 19-year-old girlfriend's throat. Our teen-pregnancy rate is far higher than other developed countries'. Abstinence programs are not the solution. But to suggest that economically disadvantaged young people, who are the most likely to become young parents or contract H.I.V., will be served by learning about ''good sex'' is breathtaking in its absurdity.
MARIA KEFALAS,
sociology professor, St. Joseph's University, Philadelphia
I was delighted to read this article. In my day (class of 1960), I don't recall there even being bananas in the lunchroom.
BOB LEVIN,
Berkeley, Calif.
There is already too much of an obsession over sex in popular culture. I remember being in high school; it was tough enough trying to concentrate on studying. Why amplify the importance of sex, when learning delayed gratification and preparing fora job in this impossible economic environment will have to be the foundation for their lives?
J.S.P.,
posted on nytimes.com
My wife and I discussed this article, and we determined that sex should be an onerous duty, undertaken only a few times, for the express purpose of creating the next generation. It should be between married people, as fully clothed as possible, with faces averted while thinking of something else. Any deviation should be promptly quashed. The very idea of young people making their own decisions about sexual matters is abhorrent. The first thing you know, they'll be deciding for themselves what they want.

HEADLINE: Cooking

BYLINE: By CORBY KUMMER. 
Corby Kummer is a senior editor at The Atlantic. His most recent book is ''The Pleasures of Slow Food.''

 BODY:
See America First. Or, better, Cook America First. And cook at home. That's how chefs, food writers and publishers are reacting to the economy this year: with continuing exploration of American regionalism and a near-universal embrace of home cooking, even by chefs who are so modernist -- the new preferred term for molecular gastronomy -- that you might've assumed they didn't have home kitchens, or at least not stoves.
Sixty years ago, a woman from Kansas with the ur-/American name Clementine Paddleford covered, by her own account, more than 800,000 miles by train, plane -- she had a pilot's license -- automobile, muleback and foot to document America's ''regional cooking,'' a term, Molly O'Neill claims in the foreword to THE GREAT AMERICAN COOKBOOK (Rizzoli, $45), that Paddleford invented. A prolific columnist and food editor for The New York Herald Tribune, she wasn't as well known as her fellow Americana pioneer James Beard, partly because she didn't have a knack for cultivating celebrity and partly because an early bout of throat cancer meant that she had to manipulate a mechanical voice box in order to speak. 
But Paddleford loved and told the stories of others, and she sought out people and families who cooked the foods journalists and locavores still think we're discovering today. (Who knew that Long Island was long a cauliflower colossus?) Kelly Alexander, the judicious editor of this updated version of the original ''How America Eats,'' reports on her struggles to reduce Paddleford's pie-crust recipes to one. But there are other recipes to try, many of them simple and local and right back in fashion.
Traveling Paddleford's byways as they have for decades, Jane and Michael Stern, authors of the frequently updated ''Roadfood,'' have usefully compiled THE LEXICON OF REAL AMERICAN FOOD (Lyons Press, paper, $19.95), with idiosyncratically chosen entries like the ''hot brown'' sandwich and the Southern boardinghouse ritual of ''round-table dining.'' The Sterns have always been culinary and cultural anthropologists, and the slightly ironic distance as well as the enthusiasm they bring to their subjects always makes them worth reading.
For full-length stops on the trail, head south by southwest. Lisa Fain's HOMESICK TEXAN COOKBOOK (Hyperion, $29.99) has won converts for its author's voice: she is herself a New York City convert but wants to recreate her home state in her tiny kitchen. And so she makes Texas' salsas, tacos, carnitas, posole and enchiladas accessible, never shying from complexity but making them doable. (Well, she does admit that ''the preparation of chicken-fried steak is a violent, messy, and dangerous affair.'') Just lay in plenty of lard, garlic, cumin and cilantro.
More evocative of its region than strictly tied to it is A NEW TURN IN THE SOUTH: Southern Flavors Reinvented for Your Kitchen (Clarkson Potter, $35). Hugh Acheson is a cook who freely draws on his French training and Ottawa childhood to inform the food he found around his adopted home, Athens, Ga., where his two restaurants -- Five and Ten, and the National -- have won acclaim. His is a seductively simple sensibility that sent me to use long-grain rice in a pepper pilaf, which perfumed the house with bacon and garlic and was even better the next day, after the rice soaked up more of the jalapeno, smoked sweet red peppers and cider-spiked cooking liquid.
Even those who embrace food-industry-chic gels and high-tech equipment are making eloquent pleas to return to simple home virtues. Ferran Adria, who pioneered /cutting-edge cuisine at his restaurant El Bulli, offers THE FAMILY MEAL: Home Cooking With Ferran Adria (Phaidon, $29.95), a curious book with good intentions but puzzling execution. Each recipe is given in pictures with laconic instructions laid on top, like balloon captions in a cartoon. The instructions, perhaps written with translation into dozens of languages in mind, are so terse as to raise more questions than they answer. Still, you can learn to make caramel foam in a siphon.
More instructively for inquisitive home cooks, Heston Blumenthal, proprietor of the Fat Duck, in Bray, England, and another international modernist celebrity, now gives us HESTON BLUMENTHAL AT HOME (Bloomsbury, $60). Despite the title, it's not really for domestic use, or at least not entirely, and the photographs, taken in the same antiseptic white kitchen and featuring only Blumenthal, are far from homey. But it is a cooking course that will show you how to make the building blocks of many of his dishes without the capital investment. (He does allow himself a chapter on sous-vide cookery, which he thinks should and eventually will be ubiquitous in home kitchens.) Here he shares easily achievable techniques -- for instance, ''ice filtration'' to clarify stocks, freezing them in blocks and melting them over a filter in the fridge, and long oven-browning of onions for a deep-flavored soup, with the bonus of the ''amazing meaty effect'' of adding star anise. And there are homelier tips (adding roasting juices to salad dressing) as well as some very simple recipes, like quickly seared sea bass with vanilla butter. But the book hasn't been converted for American cooks -- it's all grams and Celsius, and nobody took out the Marmite consomme -- and you do come across instructions like ''Have your digital probe ready.''
The lavish photographs in John Besh's MY FAMILY TABLE: A Passionate Plea for Home Cooking (Andrews McMeel, $35) are the opposite of Blumenthal's, teeming with picturesque children and the telegenic father who cooks with them. Besh takes an opening shot at his modernist brethren: ''So many of us chefs spend way too much of our time overmanipulating foods, attempting to turn them into things they inherently are not.'' Many of his recipes, written in his warm, natural voice, are easy. Yet some are more special-occasion than the title might imply. The most useful section provides the dishes his wife challenged him to create when he ''made the mistake'' of questioning her ''about what she was feeding our children'' on weeknights, when he's ''almost never around.'' So he came up with some recipes kids will eat and distracted, time-pressed cooks can make: cauliflower mac and cheese, sloppy Joe sliders, tomato soup with grilled ham and cheese. (You'll want to stock pepper jelly, which he likes with almost everything.) These, and building-block recipes like a chicken fricassee open to endless variations and a roast chicken that can be reused throughout the week, are the ones family cooks will turn to.
A chef's cookbook ideally brings the reader into the mind of a great chef and gives a home cook ideas he or she can incorporate into everyday life. Jean-Georges Vongerichten is a chef with an unerring, original sense of flavor, and where Adria's book feels schematic and condescending, HOME COOKING WITH JEAN-GEORGES: My Favorite Simple Recipes (Clarkson Potter, $40), written with Genevieve Ko, feels schematic and heartfelt, incorporating influences from his Alsatian upbringing and Asian culinary training. It's more a book for the weekends he talks about in his introduction, but almost every recipe has ideas you may not have thought of: pork chops with a sauce of cherries boiled down with vinegar and port and mixed with mustard; lamb shanks with lots of garlic, Asian pear, lemon grass, ginger, soy sauce and chili.
The French-trained chef who made the total transition to teaching home cooks is, of course, Jacques Pepin. He absorbed Paddleford's understanding of where American cooking was, and made it better. Along with Julia Child, his frequent television partner, he has been the country's great cooking teacher. ESSENTIAL PEPIN (Houghton Mifflin, $40) showcases a lifetime's worth of his cooking, along with a searchable DVD that illustrates nearly 100 techniques that are needed for the more than 700 recipes -- and no one teaches technique better. Though the base is French home cooking, this is an omnibus cooking /encyclopedia.
Barbara Kafka also distills a lifetime of cooking in THE INTOLERANT GOURMET: Glorious Food Without Gluten and Lactose (Artisan, $29.95). Several years ago, Kafka learned that the food sensitivities of her childhood had resurfaced, so she set out to rethink the full-flavored soups, roasts, braises and sauces she's been known for, coupling them with ingenious technical breakthroughs and workarounds. She includes the microwave, of course, but also supplies the key to perfect poached eggs, and tips related to the subject at hand: a trick for breading and frying involving rice bran; a formula for light and addictive waffles (the secret is coconut milk, and I've tasted them -- I've known Kafka for years) and thickeners where you wouldn't think of them, like cornstarch in curried chicken salad. There's a tasting chart, by brand, of gluten-free pastas that will be worth the price for many people. But the challenge of cooking without milk and cream is far less familiar than doing without flour, and Kafka rises to that, too, in a book that's really a sophisticated general cookbook.
Meat is the ingredient of the moment, and butchers are the rock stars of the food world. The only surprise in WHOLE BEAST BUTCHERY: The Complete Visual Guide to Beef, Lamb, and Pork (Chronicle, $40) is that Ryan Farr, who has written this book with Brigit Binns, doesn't have tattoos -- at least not ones we notice in the color photographs on every page, with minimal captions. It's all practice and no theory. If you're in a meat cooperative and getting quarters of whole animals, this will be useful. But going so far requires a certain level of commitment. ''I encourage you to make a head roast,'' Farr writes. ''It's a fun, ambitious and challenging project, because you have to take the whole face off the skull.''
The meat that cooks are obsessed with these days is pork. Treading ground that Fergus Henderson has already trod, Libbie Summers, a recipe developer for Paula Deen, takes a ''pork for chicks'' approach in THE WHOLE HOG COOKBOOK: Chops, Loin, Shoulder, Bacon, and All That Good Stuff (Rizzoli, $30), an aggressively pretty book supported by the Smithfield Hams people, which could give readers pause. But Summers, a hearty gal from hardy stock, gives recipes that will let you put pig into pretty much everything (pulled pork spring rolls, ''porkovers'') and includes instructive pictures that will help you, say, trim and tie a crown roast and render your own lard.
Stephanie Pierson wants to knock pork off its pedestal, and THE BRISKET BOOK: A Love Story With Recipes (Andrews McMeel, $29.99) even has a flirtatious heifer on the cover. Pierson, a funny writer (and contributor to the food coverage at TheAtlantic.com), clears up the heifer-steer distinction and many others, but mostly gives many recipes and techniques, going to the experts -- a long day with Christopher Kimball for a perfectionist brisket -- to help explain how ''a flaccid four-pound, gray-brown piece of beef, shaped roughly like the state of Tennessee'' can ''inspire Proustian prose, evoke the deepest pleasure, create indelible memories.'' The answer, of course, is that everyone grew up eating it and it's easy to cook. ''With some food,'' a friend of hers says, ''there's a right way and a wrong way. With brisket there's only 'my way.' ''
Any meat-lover -- and fish- and vegetable-lover -- will learn from ALL ABOUT ROASTING: A New Approach to a Classic Art (Norton, $35) because the author, Molly Stevens, is such a careful teacher, as fans of her previous book, ''All About Braising,'' already know. So she has new discoveries -- that you don't need to rinse poultry (it might actually spread pathogens around, but more important, it just waterlogs the skin and meat) and that presalting is better at seasoning and tenderizing turkey than brining. She's also an imaginative cook and puts in homely touches, like using the roasting juices from ginger chicken as a sauce for elbow macaroni with tomatoes.
Just when you're sure you don't need another Italian cookbook, Nancy Silverton comes out with THE MOZZA COOKBOOK: Recipes From Los Angeles's Favorite Italian Restaurant and Pizzeria (Knopf, $35). She didn't think she wanted one either, but then she went into business with Mario Batali and discovered the excellent burrata in Los Angeles, and applied her breadmaking skills to pizza, treating its crust as carefully developed, long-risen bread and inspired not by Italy but by Chris Bianco, the Phoenix pizza legend. Matt Molina, her chef and collaborator on the book with Carolynn Carreno, studied in Batali's kitchens. Silverton's sophisticated savory-chef's palate and pastry chef's precision will make you go into the kitchen to relearn what you thought you knew about pasta and contorni. And every pizza nut will need her dough recipe, carefully calibrated for home kitchens.
Lidia Bastianich and her daughter, Tanya Bastianich Manuali, visit a different Italy: the ethnic shops, bakeries and restaurants that introduced Italian food to America. LIDIA'S ITALY IN AMERICA (Knopf, $35), a companion book to a new PBS series, features her typically straightforward, doable recipes for better homemade versions of dishes like fried squid, sausage and peppers, chicken Tetrazzini and an elaborate eggplant parmigiana layered with spinach and based on the one at Roberto's, on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx.
This year brings two major books on Morocco, and, sorry to say, you should have both of them. Any serious cook needs every offering by Paula Wolfert, who has updated and rethought her landmark first book in THE FOOD OF MOROCCO (Ecco/HarperCollins, $45), compiling the dishes she has found and mastered in her 50 years of travel there. As the many adherents of her ''Mediterranean Clay Pot Cooking'' will tell you, it's time to spurn enameled cast iron and coddle clay, for its ability to sequentially steam, brown and bake. And, of course, you have to get started on the preserved lemons that go into almost everything. The sumptuous full-color design and pretty travelogue photos belie the seriousness Wolfert brings to every recipe. In addition to being sold on tall tagines and, of course, remastering couscous, you'll also find showpiece dishes that don't rely on long-prepared components, like whole fish stuffed with a homemade almond paste made of fried almonds scented with cinnamon and orange flower water.
Mourad Lahlou grew up in Marrakesh and craved the food of his country while in college in California, changing tracks from economics to restaurants. MOURAD: New Moroccan (Artisan, $40) is very much a California chef's book, with some of the same team that translated Thomas Keller's books for home cooks, led by Susie Heller, making his relatively complicated Moroccan-based but West Coast-influenced food practicable for home cooks. Like Keller, Lahlou is a fairly obsessive perfectionist who doesn't shy away from long lists of ingredients and multi-step dishes. His book will be more immediately accessible for chefs, Wolfert's for home cooks and those who care about how the food is rooted in its culture. But the pair of them will make a fine gift -- in a box, of course, with a clay pot.
It's an odd phenomenon: modernist chefs who seek to reproduce the packaged industrial foods of their childhood. Such is the case with Christina Tosi, who has today's de rigueur appreciation of farmers -- her father worked in the dairy division of the U.S.D.A. -- but who spent months in the kitchen of MOMOFUKU MILK BAR (Clarkson Potter, $35) perfecting a cake batter that would mimic her favorite mix, Funfetti. Her signature creation is Cereal Milk, which is what you get after steeping oven-toasted cornflakes in milk and adding a bit of brown sugar. This and a buttery baked cornflake crunch serve as the basis and toppings for cookies that will win young fans -- while her mixtures of salt and sweet, and her slightly newfangled use of milk powder and glucose will attract older ones.
Lisa Yockelson hews to more classic territory in BAKING STYLE: Art, Craft, Recipes (Wiley, $45), a collection of cakes, cookies and breads that will gladden the heart of any baking enthusiast. It's an encyclopedic book from an author whose recipes really work.
Every bread baker, home or pro, has been influenced, knowingly or unknowingly, by Carol Field's ITALIAN BAKER (Ten Speed Press, $35), which the author has now revised and retested. I'm perhaps improperly impartial because I'm quoted inside the back cover with enthusiastic praise of the first edition. But the technique of a long-risen, low-yeast bread started with Field, and she's still the master of that and biga, the ''almost natural yeast'' that's an easy and essential sourdough starter. It's also Field who introduced Americans to ciabatta and made bakers aware of the regional variety of focaccia.
Finally, two books provide chapter-length lessons so right and so eloquent that I think of them as homilies (though their authors wouldn't be so presumptuous), teaching us the virtues Clementine Paddleford once celebrated: thrift, thoughtfulness and keeping meals on the table by constantly recycling what you've made in the days before.
Tamar Adler is a young cook who went to work at Chez Panisse after opening her own small restaurant in Georgia. Her recipes in AN EVERLASTING MEAL: Cooking With Economy and Grace (Scribner, $25) for dishes like frittata made with leftover pasta, Thai fried rice and rice pudding grow from her essays in a lovely, only occasionally precious voice.
Greg Atkinson has been a professional chef at Seattle's esteemed Canlis, a dad of two boys and a food reporter. He's a natural writer whose honesty in AT THE KITCHEN TABLE: The Craft of Cooking at Home (Sasquatch, paper, $17.95) about being thrilled and intimidated to meet food-world celebs, about working to reproduce something he tasted and loved and about growing beyond the whole-food movement he joined as a youth is always engaging. Of starting a big, festive fish fry in honor of a woman he met near the end of her life, he says, ''I felt that same easy, timeless kind of eternity I sensed that day.'' It's a sense we should all strive to feel in our own kitchens.
Cooking of The Times
Some of the names that have graced the daily pages of The New York Times's Dining section are also appearing this season on bookstore shelves.
MARK BITTMAN'S KITCHEN EXPRESS (Simon & Schuster, $15) is a paperback edition of his collection of 404 ''inspired seasonal dishes you can make in 20 minutes or less.''
And in COOK THIS NOW (Hyperion, $29.99) the Times food columnist Melissa Clark offers ''120 easy and delectable dishes you can't wait to make.''
For THE FOOD52 COOKBOOK (Morrow/HarperCollins, $35), Amanda Hesser teams with Merrill Stubbs to cull the best recipes home cooks have submitted to their Web site, Food52.com.
Ed Levine's blog, SeriousEats.com, has inspired the recipes and food finds in SERIOUS EATS: A Comprehensive Guide to Making and Eating Delicious Food Wherever You Are (Clarkson Potter, paper, $27.99).
And for the perfect finale, there's Patricia Wells's SIMPLY TRUFFLES: Recipes and Stories That Capture the Essence of the Black Diamond (Morrow/HarperCollins, $27.99).

HEADLINE: The Blog: California Pressed on Fuel-Economy Rules

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
Suspecting that California regulators may be exerting unlawful influence over the agencies that determine federal fuel-economy standards, Representative Darrell Issa has begun an inquiry into the practices of the California Air Resources Board, or CARB, the agency charged with setting pollution standards for the state.
He is also seeking information from automakers to aid his investigation. 
Mr. Issa, a California Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, is pursuing details of the state agency's role in determining the next round of Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, known as CAFE, a process undertaken with the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The standards were formally unveiled Nov. 16 by President Obama and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.
In a Sept. 30 letter to Mr. LaHood, Mr. Issa said the new round of standards, which would require automakers to achieve a corporate fleetwide average of 54.5 miles per gallon for 2025, were possibly ''negotiated in secret, outside the scope of law, and could generate significant negative impacts for consumers.''
On Monday, Mr. Issa sent letters to 15 automakers, including three domestic manufacturers, asking them to voluntarily provide information by Dec. 12 about the negotiations over the standards and their likely impact on the industry.
In a telephone interview, Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents the interests of the 12 largest automakers in the United States, said that manufacturers were likely to comply with Mr. Issa's request.
''I'm sure automakers will be cooperating with the oversight committee,'' she said. ''We're still looking at the letters and how much detail is requested.''
CARB was identified as a target of the committee's investigation in a Nov. 9 letter addressed to Mary D. Nichols, the California board's chairwoman. Mr. Issa had asked Ms. Nichols to testify at a committee hearing on Oct. 12. Citing prior commitments, Ms. Nichols did not attend, prompting Mr. Issa to write in the November letter that the state agency was ''unresponsive to Congressional concerns and unappreciative of Congressional priorities.''
Among the questions posed by Mr. Issa to CARB in his letter was, ''Do you believe that a closed and secretive process is the best approach for regulating an industry that affects nearly every American?''
CARB responded to Mr. Issa's requests on Nov. 23. Stanley Young, a CARB spokesman, said in a telephone interview Tuesday that the agency was preparing to send more documents.
Jeffrey Solsby, a spokesman for the majority staff on the House committee, said in a telephone interview Tuesday that the CARB documents were still under review.
A point of contention between Mr. Issa's committee and CARB is whether California regulates federal fuel-economy standards, an authority exclusively delegated by Congress to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In its response to the committee requests, CARB said it was instead regulating greenhouse gas emissions, a position it said was affirmed in court rulings. ''California has not set, and is not setting fuel-economy standards,'' CARB said.
Even so, Mr. Issa wrote in his letter to CARB that the relationship between fuel economy and tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions was so close that ''compliance tests for fuel-economy standards are done by measuring vehicular CO2 emissions.''
Mr. Young, the CARB spokesman, said that the board was not operating outside its legal mandate. ''We depend on the courts to make a determination, and they have definitively held that California's greenhouse gas standards are not fuel-economy standards.'' He said that CARB worked together with N.H.T.S.A. and the E.P.A. on a unified program for the round of standards for 2017-2025. During that process, the agencies ''shared data, conducted joint technical and engineering studies and had regular staff meetings,'' he said.
It is the substance of that collaboration that interests the House committee. ''In summary, it appears that CARB and the state of California are in the business of regulating fuel-economy standards, in direct contravention of the law,'' Mr. Issa concluded in his letter to CARB.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: How the Food Industry Eats Your Kid's Lunch

BYLINE: By LUCY KOMISAR. 
An investigative reporter and author, who received support from the Investigative Fund, a project of the Nation Institute, for the reporting of this essay.

 BODY:
An increasingly cozy alliance between companies that manufacture processed foods and companies that serve the meals is making students -- a captive market -- fat and sick while pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. At a time of fiscal austerity, these companies are seducing school administrators with promises to cut costs through privatization. Parents who want healthier meals, meanwhile, are outgunned.
Each day, 32 million children in the United States get lunch at schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program, which uses agricultural surplus to feed children. About 21 million of these students eat free or reduced-price meals, a number that has surged since the recession. The program, which also provides breakfast, costs $13.3 billion a year.
Sadly, it is being mismanaged and exploited. About a quarter of the school nutrition program has been privatized, much of it outsourced to food service management giants like Aramark, based in Philadelphia; Sodexo, based in France; and the Chartwells division of the Compass Group, based in Britain. They work in tandem with food manufacturers like the chicken producers Tyson and Pilgrim's, all of which profit when good food is turned to bad. 
Here's one way it works. The Agriculture Department pays about $1 billion a year for commodities like fresh apples and sweet potatoes, chickens and turkeys. Schools get the food free; some cook it on site, but more and more pay processors to turn these healthy ingredients into fried chicken nuggets, fruit pastries, pizza and the like. Some $445 million worth of commodities are sent for processing each year, a nearly 50 percent increase since 2006.
The Agriculture Department doesn't track spending to process the food, but school authorities do. The Michigan Department of Education, for example, gets free raw chicken worth $11.40 a case and sends it for processing into nuggets at $33.45 a case. The schools in San Bernardino, Calif., spend $14.75 to make French fries out of $5.95 worth of potatoes.
The money is ill spent. The Center for Science in the Public Interest has warned that sending food to be processed often means lower nutritional value and noted that ''many schools continue to exceed the standards for fat, saturated fat and sodium.'' A 2008 study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that by the time many healthier commodities reach students, ''they have about the same nutritional value as junk foods.''
Monica Zimmer, a Sodexo spokeswoman, said that ''much has changed'' since those studies, pointing to the company's support for ''nutrition education to encourage young students to eat more fruits and vegetables.''
Roland Zullo, a researcher at the University of Michigan, found in 2008 that Michigan schools that hired private food-service management firms spent less on labor and food but more on fees and supplies, yielding ''no substantive economic savings.'' Alarmingly, he even found that privatization was associated with lower test scores, hypothesizing that the high-fat and high-sugar foods served by the companies might be the cause. In a later study, in 2010, Dr. Zullo found that Chartwells was able to trim costs by cutting benefits for workers in Ann Arbor schools, but that the schools didn't end up realizing any savings.
Why is this allowed to happen? Part of it is that school authorities don't want the trouble of overseeing real kitchens. Part of it is that the management companies are saving money by not having to pay skilled kitchen workers.
In addition, the management companies have a cozy relationship with food processers, which routinely pay the companies rebates (typically around 14 percent) in return for contracts. The rebates have generally been kept secret from schools, which are charged the full price.
Last year, Andrew M. Cuomo, then the New York State attorney general, won a $20 million settlement over Sodexo's pocketing of such rebates. Other states are following New York and looking into the rebates; the Agriculture Department began its own inquiry in August.
With the crackdown on these rebates, food service companies have turned to another accounting trick. I found evidence that the rebate abuses are continuing, now under the name of ''prompt payment discounts,'' under an Agriculture Department loophole. These discounts, for payments that are often not prompt at all, are really rebates under another name. New York State requires rebates to be returned to schools, but the Sodexo settlement shows how unevenly the ban has been enforced.
The food service companies I spoke with denied any impropriety. ''Our culinary philosophy, as a company, is to promote scratch cooking where possible and encourage variety and nutritionally balanced meals,'' said Ayde Lyons, a Chartwells spokeswoman. ''We use minimally processed foods whenever possible.''
There are economic and nutritional consequences to privatization. School kitchen workers are generally unionized, with benefits; they are also typically local residents who have children in public schools and care about their well-being. Laid-off school workers become an economic drain instead of a positive force. And the rebate deals with national food manufacturers cut out local farmers and small producers like bakers, who could offer fresh, healthy food and help the local economy.
Children pay the price. Dr. Zullo found that privately managed school cafeterias offered meals that were higher in sugar and fats and made unhealthy snack items -- soda, cookies, potato chips -- more readily available. The companies were also less likely to use reduced-sugar recipes. Linda Hugle, a retired school principal in Three Rivers, Ore., told me that when her district switched to Sodexo, ''the savings were paltry.'' She added, ''You pay a little less and your kids get strawberry milk, frozen French fries and artificial shortening.''
Advocates who fight for better food face an uphill battle. Dorothy Brayley, executive director of Kids First, a nutrition advocacy group in Pawtucket, R.I., told me she encountered resistance in trying to persuade Sodexo to buy from local farmers. (Sodexo says it does buy some local produce and has opened salad bars in many schools.) Donna D. Walsh, a former school board president in Westchester County, N.Y., told me she worked with a supportive superintendent to get Aramark to stop deep-frying food and to open a salad bar. But after a new superintendent came in, she said, the company went back to profit-driven menus of pizza and bagels.
The federal government could intervene. The Agriculture Department proposed new rules this year that would set maximum calories for school meals; require more fruits, vegetables and whole grains; and limit trans fats.
Not surprisingly, the most committed foes of the rules are the same corporations that make money supplying bad food. Aramark, Sodexo and Chartwells, as well as food processing companies like ConAgra, wrote letters arguing, among other things, that children may not want to eat healthier food.
Any increase in fruit and vegetables might result in ''plate waste,'' wrote Sodexo. A protein requirement at breakfast, Aramark said, would hamper efforts to offer ''popular breakfast items.'' Their lobbying persuaded members of Congress to block a once-a-week limit on starchy vegetables and to continue to allow a few tablespoons of tomato sauce on pizza to count as a vegetable serving. Thanks to that cave-in, children will continue to get their vegetables in the form of potatoes for breakfast and pizza for lunch.
One-third of children from the ages of 6 to 19 are overweight or obese. These children could see their life expectancies shortened because of their vulnerability to diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Unfortunately, profit, not health, is the priority of the food service management companies, food processors and even elected officials. Until more parents demand reform of the school lunch system, children will continue to suffer.
Correction: December 11, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture with an opinion essay on Dec. 4 about privatized food services in public schools was published in error. It showed students eating at Gates Chili Middle School in Rochester, but the school has not privatized or outsourced its cafeteria operations.

HEADLINE: Treasuring Urban Oases

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Alexander Garvin, natty in bowtie and jacket, watched commuters hustle through the gray, sunken concrete plaza at Citigroup Center on Lexington Avenue. Across 53rd Street, in the fading afternoon light, more New Yorkers ducked into a faceless subway kiosk on the triangular patch of wind-swept sidewalk -- ostensibly a second public plaza -- that occupies the southeast corner. This is the city's public realm, or part of it.
What passes for public space in many crowded neighborhoods often means some token gesture by a developer, built in exchange for the right to erect a taller skyscraper. Mr. Garvin, an architect, urban planner and veteran of five city administrations, going back to the era of Mayor John V. Lindsay (1966-73), has spent the better part of the last half-century thinking about these spaces.
''The public realm is what we own and control,'' he told me the other day when we met to look around Midtown. More than just common property, he added, ''the streets, squares, parks, infrastructure and public buildings make up the fundamental element in any community -- the framework around which everything else grows.'' 
Or should grow.
Writing in The New York Times last week, Christopher B. Leinberger, a professor of urban planning, took note of ''a profound structural shift'' in America during the last decade or so, ''a reversal of what took place in the 1950s.'' Back then drivable suburbs boomed while center cities decayed. Now more and more people want to settle in ''a walkable urban downtown.'' The most expensive housing in the country, and not just New York City, is in ''high-density, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods,'' he said.
But what makes high-density neighborhoods pedestrian friendly?
Good public space, for starters.
The best public spaces encourage diverse urban experiences, from people watching to protesting, daydreaming to handball, eating, reading and sunbathing to strolling and snoozing. Witness the High Line. The park opened a couple of years ago on the West Side with no special program of cultural offerings or other headline attractions to lure people. The attraction was, and remains, the place itself. Its success shows how much can be achieved, economically and architecturally, when city government and private interests make the public realm, on a grand scale, their shared interest. Governors Island is another enlightened urban experiment. Leslie Koch, its president, has been planning the island to respond to what people want to do there. The layout of green spaces, bike paths, playgrounds and pavilions evolves as the public uses the place each summer, a process that flips around how most public spaces get designed.
That said, in a contentious city where you can't plant a single tree without somebody complaining to City Hall, expecting the public to oversee the design of the public realm at large is nuts. Besides, as everybody learned about Zuccotti Park, much public space is not even really public but privately owned, and landlords find ways to restrict access by cutting hours or limiting activities.
We've been so fixated on fancy new buildings that we've lost sight of the spaces they occupy and we share. Last month Mr. Garvin addressed a conclave of architects, planners and public officials from around the country and abroad, who met on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of New York's landmark 1961 zoning resolution. That resolution established the incentive program for private developers, whereby developers construct public spaces -- plaza ''bonuses,'' in zoning lingo -- in return for bigger buildings. Acres of some of the costliest real estate in town have been turned into arcades and squares as a consequence, but sheer space, the urban sociologist Holly Whyte famously observed, is not ''of itself'' what people need or want. Quality, not quantity, is the issue.
Mr. Garvin argues that the city should reverse its approach, zoning neighborhoods like Midtown, Lower Manhattan and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, by thinking first about the shape of public space instead of private development. And it was clear why on our walk. We started at the Citigroup Plaza, which is far from the worst public space in the city. With a few shops, trees and the entrances to the building and subway drawing people down into it, it's at least busier and less glum than most sunken plazas, and inviting in ways that the barren patch of sidewalk across the street isn't. But the two sites were developed piecemeal, as separate footnotes to skyscrapers. ''If from the beginning,'' Mr. Garvin said, the city had organized ''all the subway entrances, stairways, corridors, shops and plazas through which pedestrians flow and into which sunlight should penetrate, this might have been a great public space.''
Rockefeller Center, Times Square and Bryant Park (which copies much from European landmarks like the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris), are among the world's great public spaces and they are also commercial hubs. The goal is to learn from their success, and avoid lost opportunities like Lexington Avenue and 53rd Street.
The Dutch today put together what they call ''structure plans'' when they undertake big new public projects, like their high-speed rail station in Rotterdam: before celebrity architects show up, urban designers are called in to work out how best to organize the sites for the public good. It's a formalized, fine-grained approach to the public realm. By contrast, big urban projects on the drawing board in New York still tend to be the products of negotiations between government agencies anxious for economic improvement and private developers angling for zoning exemptions. As with the ill-conceived Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn, the streets, subway entrances and plazas around Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues, where millions of New Yorkers will actually feel the development's effects, seem like they've hardly been taken into account.
Meanwhile the public demand for parks, squares and more pedestrian-oriented streets only grows. Every new plaza the city opens, like the recent one on Gansevoort Street, instantly fills up; local shop owners reap the benefits. Retail sales rose in Times Square after Broadway was closed to traffic two years ago and became a pedestrian plaza, contrary to what some businesses there feared.
The transformation of Times Square required brave thinking by the Bloomberg administration. The same level of daring might help blossoming neighborhoods like Bushwick, Brooklyn, and could yet redeem New York's most ignominious failure to safeguard the public realm, Penn Station. Creative redesign (turn 33rd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues into a car-free, glassed-over pedestrian gateway to the station) and a little hardball politics (find another home for Madison Square Garden) might still turn the Farley Post Office into a dignified Amtrak terminal and bring some light and air into what is now a rat's warren of a transit hub suffered by 550,000 commuters each day.
From the Citigroup Center, Mr. Garvin navigated the northern sidewalk along 53rd Street, made nearly impassable by a phalanx of planted security bollards. At Park Avenue he climbed the steps leading up to the plaza of Mies van der Rohe's great Seagram Building, a modernized Italian piazza raised a few feet above Park Avenue. Imagine, Mr. Garvin said, if Park Avenue were altogether redesigned now for the public realm. ''Why should there be a median that no one uses?'' he asked. ''Suppose the street was reconfigured, with one of the sidewalks widened and connected to the plazas along the street? You don't build great public spaces incrementally,'' he repeated, and marched on toward Rockefeller Center.
Its pedestrian passage, lined with brightly lighted shops, meticulously maintained, sloping toward the skating rink, framing the view that unfolds when you arrive; its network of subway entrances, underground concourses and open spaces, carefully mapped out from the start: what makes Rockefeller Center special, its Art Deco details aside, is how the site was conceived around public space. ''It doesn't get better than this,'' Mr. Garvin said.
In Times Square he lamented the forest of telephone booths and lampposts that have become archaic impediments in the era of cellphones and lighted signs, but he praised the farsighted zoning law enacted in the Edward I. Koch era that demanded those lighted signs. In Bryant Park Mr. Garvin exalted the plan by which local businesses bonded together during the 1980s and retailers on the site helped to pay for one of the most incredible urban transformations in New York history. Once a crime-ridden symbol of urban blight and the bankruptcy of public space, the park was a crowded wonderland the other day, with its Christmas market, food stalls and cafes.
Mr. Garvin's final destination, as dusk turned to dark: Grand Central. Packed with commuters, it's a daily reminder of how the public realm, at its best, speaks to the aspirations of a society and the nobility of a great city.
He spread his arms. ''We ought to be able to learn from this,'' he said.
That was his challenge to public officials. And to the rest of us too.

HEADLINE: Brother Can You Spare a Line?

BYLINE: By D.W. GIBSON

 BODY:
This past summer I drove across the country interviewing people who had lost their jobs since 2007 - since the housing market disintegrated, since Lehman Brothers evaporated, since layoffs subsumed the work force. I asked for details about the climactic phone call, the conference room, the look of the sky out the window, the security escort, the drive home: all the particulars of the experience.
I met a mortgage broker who, one morning, learned he had been laid off when he found the door to his office building padlocked. I met an H.R. executive who had laid off a couple of hundred people before she herself was laid off. I met a husband who was laid off two weeks after his wife announced she was pregnant. I met a wife who laid off her husband. 
I was collecting these stories for a forthcoming book about the experience of being unemployed. Modeled on Studs Terkel's ''Working,'' the genre-defining oral history of what people do all day and how they feel about what they do, this book will be called ''Not Working.'' Accompanying me on the two-month trip were the filmmaker M J Sieber, who was helping to film a companion documentary, and the playwright Mallery Avidon, who was helping to find subjects, taking notes for a script and discovering a talent for writing haikus. We drove from Orange County, Calif., to New York City in a 1999 Jeep with 142,000 miles on it; we ran on the unexpected and inexplicable stamina that came with hearing mostly demoralizing stories.
Since it was work people had lost, and work that they sought, I ended every conversation by asking each person to define the word. ''Work'' never means the same thing, it turns out. Rather, we negotiate a complicated relationship to the idea, rooted in our own achievements and defeats, our own pursuits and resources. ''It's what I do to know I'm being a good person,'' said Wendy Hamilton, 34, who had lost two jobs in a row at nonprofits in Omaha. ''It's a paycheck,'' said Jim, 43, an underemployed, union-eschewing and last-name-concealing drywall man in Lemon Valley, Nev. The range of answers has common themes but no duplications and is riddled with contradictions.
Taking this trip meant going M.I.A. on my wife, Tasha Garcia Gibson, who is an owner of a couple of small New York City restaurants that demand seven-day workweeks. I have picked her up at 2 a.m. enough times to know what the closing minutes of a 14-hour day look like: the floors get mopped; the security gates come down; busboys, waiters and cooks gather at the door. They're exhausted and eager to start long subway rides home, but they wait because leaving before my wife finishes payout is not an option. Rent is needed now, so is dinner and a refill on the Metrocard.
On the road, I felt closest to my wife when 2 a.m. rolled around. Not only could I visualize exactly where she was, but the image was also emblematic of what I was encountering across the country. The unemployed, the underemployed, the still-employed but ridiculously overworked: everyone was gasping from week to week.
I know the sensation of gasping for air. I maintain no fewer than four jobs as a writer and publishing professional. I am a cog in the wheel that is optimistically referred to as the creative services, euphemistically referred to as freelancing, realistically referred to as I-take-what-I-can-get. We work from home and make our own hours, sure, but we also survive without things like medical benefits or long-term financial planning. Work is the opportunity standing in front of us right now, if there is one at all. Otherwise, it's unreturned calls and empty in-boxes. We must make work.
When my editor brought up the idea for a book collecting the stories of the unemployed - for some writer somewhere - I persuaded him the commission was mine because I was seized with a conviction about the project. I cleared my summer calendar of all face-to-face meetings and resolved to fulfill my responsibilities by way of a laptop that would, over the next several weeks, glow in darkened motel rooms from Rawlins, Wyo., to Columbus, Ohio.
Some of the people I interviewed were curious, maybe even a bit suspicious, about my relationship to work. They understood that I was traveling and conducting interviews but remained unclear on whether such tasks qualified as work: ''This is your job?'' ''Who's paying you for this?'' I told them I had a small book advance that would get me across the country. A few of them noted that if my income was spent in short order, I wouldn't have anything left when I sat down to write the book. They asked who would pay me then. I confessed I had not yet thought that far.
But staving off anxiety is rather straightforward when your work is interviewing people like Scott Cooksley, 47, of Reno, Nev. He lost his managerial job at a casino, then staggered to his feet after homelessness, two heart attacks and four kinds of cancer, now in remission. As of summer he was back in an apartment with a regular paycheck, managing the food bank that helped save him. ''Work is not just to get an income,'' he said. ''It's to feel self-worth. You have to have that.''
In the face of stories like Scott's - scores and scores of them - I found myself wondering about the worth of the work I had created. I tended to question it most in the moments before I approached a possible interviewee. It wasn't easy walking up to strangers in cities and states where I had never been, asking them not only to come to a complete stop on the sidewalk but also to sit down and tell me about an experience they would probably like to forget.
Sandra, for instance, did not come to a complete stop. Mallery and I spotted her in a strip mall parking lot in Fresno, Calif., and accompanied her to the front door of an unemployment office. The following day, we met on a bench inside an air-conditioned mall. An out-of-work home nurse and mother of four who did not want to give her last name, Sandra explained that she enrolled in high school at 38 because she wanted a diploma instead of a G.E.D. ''Work shows your character,'' she said. ''How are you going to say you want something and you don't work for it?''
When Sandra asked me to explain my own situation, I referred to my trip as ''work'' but stayed away from ''job.'' ''Job'' implied a layer of obligation I didn't feel; ''work,'' on the other hand, implied the purpose I sought. On the best of days, there is a beneficiary of one's labor. As Dale Harris, 64, a former St. Louis cop who after several months of unemployment recently secured a graveyard shift guarding a nuclear-waste site, told me, ''Work is producing something that's of benefit to someone else.''
The service of listening, inherently passive, often felt inadequate. It might have aided cathartic venting, but it was always useless when it came to meeting immediate, practical needs. I left many conversations with unresolved endings - forthcoming state budget cuts, next week's foreclosure date.
Tammy Moss's foreclosure date was imminent. A petite woman with cropped hair and dark brown eyes, Tammy, 51, wore a freshly pressed shirt and, as she spoke, her hands remained clasped on the glass surface of her dining table in Missouri. She was paid the day she was laid off from a title company, a check for one week's salary at 5 p.m. on a Friday. Her supervisor said things had slowed and that, when they picked up again, she would call. When Tammy gave me her definition of work, she sat perfectly straight, as though anticipating that someone might set a batch of bank reconciliations in front of her. ''I'd like to get back to it,'' she said. ''That's my definition of work: I'd like to get back to it.''

HEADLINE: The Junking of the Postal Service

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL. 
A reporter and blogger on environmental issues for The New York Times.

 BODY:
A FEW weeks ago a petition appeared next to the mailboxes in my building's lobby in Upper Manhattan. It read: ''Save Saturday Delivery! ... Save the U.S. Postal Service!'' Over the next 24 hours signatures poured onto the sheet of paper.
I will not say whether I signed. But I will tell you what arrived in my mailbox that Saturday: two credit card offers; a Linen Source catalog for someone who used to live in my apartment; a notice of a sale on running shoes; some coupons for 10 percent off on pizza delivery; three promotional letters about colleges; and a bank letter about changing terms on my son's high-school checking account for 2012.
As junk mail multiplies and the United States Postal Service struggles for financial survival, experts are increasingly asking the question, do Americans need Saturday mail delivery ... or daily mail delivery ... or a state-run postal service at all? Should mail be a guaranteed government service -- like primary education -- because it is essential to our well-being? Or has this once hallowed institution, like pay phones, outlived its utility? 
The founding fathers regarded the postal service as an essential instrument of nation building in a vast new country, serving to ''bind the nation together,'' according to the law that created it. After radio and telegraph communications rendered that role obsolete in the early 20th century, the post office instead took on an important commercial function, with bills and payments sent by mail allowing for the growth of regional and national companies. But faxes, then direct deposit, and now online billing and payments have provided alternative delivery systems for what was yesterday's mail -- from paychecks to birth announcements, said Ian Lee, a historian of both the United States and Canadian postal services.
''The post office is in the final stage of decaying into total irrelevance,'' said Mr. Lee, a professor of strategic management at the Sprott School of Business at Carleton University in Ottawa.
The fact is that the primary beneficiary of the United States Postal Service today is arguably the advertisers whose leaflets and catalogs flood our mailboxes. First-class mail -- items like bills and letters that require a 44-cent stamp -- fell 6.6 percent in 2010 alone, continuing a five-year-long plunge. Last year was the first time that fewer than 50 percent of bills in the United States were paid by mail. There were 9.3 billion pounds of ''standard mail'' -- the low-cost postage category available to mass advertisers -- but only 3.7 billion of first-class mail.
In fact, to compensate for projected declines in ''real'' mail, the Postal Service has been aggressively promoting the use of new services for advertisers like Every Door Direct, which allows local retailers to place unaddressed promotional material in every mailbox in an area for pennies a piece, with a few clicks of a mouse.
''One could argue that the real customer of the Postal Service is now the direct mailer; it is a channel for advertising,'' said Chuck Teller, founder of Catalog Choice, an online service in Berkeley, Calif., that helps people get their names off catalog mailing lists; this requires submitting the customer numbers on unwanted catalogs that arrive in the mailbox, one by one. And the problem is not just annoyance. Direct-mail advertising generates an estimated 10 billion pounds of waste each year, costing cities an estimated $1 billion to dispose of it, according to Catalog Choice.
No surprise then that dozens of United States localities have hired Catalog Choice to create Internet platforms to allow residents to opt out of mailings. Even at $22,000 for the first year of service, King County, Wash., which includes Seattle, has calculated that it will be a good investment for all the garbage collection it will obviate, said Tom Watson, a project manager in the solid waste division of the county. ''I know it's a big revenue stream for the Postal Service, but to justify this kind of waste because it supports jobs is insane,'' said Mr. Watson, who noted that junk-mail reduction was hugely popular with voters.
The complicated relationship that many citizens have with the post office was tested in Canada this summer, when a monthlong hiatus in much of Canada's mail delivery over a labor dispute provoked few complaints. When Canadian postal workers struck in 1990 there was great pressure on government to make concessions. This year, opinion columns ran under headlines like ''Who Cares?'' and ''Postal Strike? Bring it on Baby: Walkout a momentary nuisance -- until people realize they don't need the post office anyway.'' The Toronto Star predicted that Canadians would ''quickly figure out ways to use it even less than they do now.''
And guess what? Canada's post office long ago ended Saturday delivery and house-by-house delivery in some newer neighborhoods. (Mail is left in banks of boxes at subdivision entrances.)
If there is fairly wide agreement that government mail delivery today in America has little practical value for many, there is little consensus about what do to about it. Few broach doing away with the post office entirely.
THE post office is a large employer, especially of minority workers, and laying off hundreds of thousands of employees in this economy would be extremely difficult. Even postal skeptics note that it still delivers essential communication to small subgroups that are not (yet) well connected online: the elderly and rural residents. And how else would we get subscription magazines? Ralph Nader has argued that the service should be maintained because it is a crucial delivery network for items like medicine in the case of national emergencies. For now, the overwhelming majority of Americans who pay bills online still prefer to receive paper statements.
But to cover its costs, the post office needs to keep mail volume high. And even some high-end direct mailers worry that the contents of American mailboxes are coming to resemble a paper infomercial. ''The post office has to make sure the signal-to-noise ratio remains high -- if TV was all commercials no one would watch,'' said Hamilton Davison, executive director of the American Catalog Mailers Association.
Some experts favor a general ''do not mail'' option for people who do not want to receive any direct mail -- although advertisers vehemently oppose that approach, maintaining that glossy unsolicited catalogs remain beloved by shoppers, and the postal system would most likely collapse if there were a sudden drop in its business. The Postal Service claims that 81 percent of American households surveyed in 2010 reported that they either read or scanned advertising mail.
So, Professor Lee asked: ''If the Postal Service has become a subsidized tool for mass mailers, why does the state still own it?'' Perhaps catalogs should be delivered by private companies, ending the centuries-old law that the only a government employee can place things in your mailbox. And what's the point of getting mail every day, when recycling is picked up only once a week?
It is striking that even though many European countries have privatized postal services -- shedding thousands of buildings and millions of jobs -- the actual delivery of mail looks much as it does here. Deutsche Post, the German postal carrier, which converted from a state company to a private one over a decade ago, is still required to provide coverage six days a week. (And it still delivers and encourages direct mail.)
Mr. Davison said the catalog mailers in his industry group could accept the loss of Saturday delivery, and would be fine with every-other-day delivery if that kept the post office afloat and costs down, noting that rates for glossy catalogs have increased greatly. So why are residents of my building resistant? Perhaps it is lingering nostalgia for the thrill of opening a party invitation or a letter from a long-lost college friend -- before we had Evite and Facebook.
Maybe they should ask themselves the last time they sent one through the mail -- or signed something they then put in an envelope.

HEADLINE: Economic Revival, Without the Fancy Cheese?

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
There is a certain queasiness to be felt every time one enters Brooklyn Bridge Park -- a sense that the whole enterprise isn't quite morally tenable.
The first two perfectly pristine phases of the park have been in operation for more than a year now. When the project is completed it will bring 76 acres of artful waterfront parkland to Dumbo and Brooklyn Heights, further glorifying neighborhoods that already house some of the most expensive and desirable real estate in the city -- some of the most dramatic views and green streetscapes and tasteful citizens.
To suggest that this area needed to be made more beautiful is, in a sense, like imagining that Catherine Deneuve could have benefited from a new look in 1967. 
It is never difficult to see how envy and resentment are fomented in this city: How easy it might be to feel aggrieved if, living in the dilapidated sectors of Staten Island's North Shore, you considered Brooklyn Bridge Park and noticed that no one had come forward with a dependable offer of aesthetic enhancement for your neighborhood. ''For years we've been watching what has been going on in Manhattan and Brooklyn,'' Katie McCarthy told me when I visited a used bookstore of which she is an owner in the Tompkinsville section, ''and wondered, what about us?''
Two weeks ago, though, in a deal that seemed to conclude at such a remove from public attention that Ms. McCarthy, a 30-year resident of Staten Island, was herself unaware of it, the city completed the sale of a seven-acre site on the Staten Island waterfront called Homeport. A decommissioned naval base, Homeport was turned over to the New Jersey developer Ironstate, a company that was responsible for a lot of the revitalization in Hoboken and Jersey City.
Ironstate is to invest $150 million to create a 900-unit, low-rise rental apartment complex containing 30,000 square feet of retail space. In an effort to create that great ephemeral, character, only a few of the stores will belong to national chains. The city is supplying $32 million for infrastructure improvements. Much of that will go to create an esplanade and six-acre park, allowing the Bloomberg administration to prove that it isn't interested merely in the prettiest girl at the party.
Staten Island, of course, is the borough that so many New Yorkers regard as something to be held away, as if with a pair of tongs. It has never been cool enough, or attractive enough, or poor enough to capture the interests of the city's liberal ruling class.
In the two decades of discussion on remaking Homeport, the city has rejected proposals (one for a Formula One racetrack) that would have turned the area into a day tripper's pit stop, projects with the potential for further cementing Staten Island's reputation as a place to be left.
(By the late 1980s, Mike Nichols's film ''Working Girl'' had already gone a long way to making that characterization indelible. More recently, the VH1 reality series ''Mob Wives'' has delivered a less than favorable impression of those who remain.)
The truth is that people, or at least young people, have been leaving Staten Island over the past 20 or so years. A study released this year by the public policy organization the Center for an Urban Future showed that there were about 2,000 fewer people ages 20 to 34 living on Staten Island in 2009 than there were in 1990. In 1990, that demographic represented 25.3 percent of the population, while now it represents just less than 20 percent. At the same time, the number of people older than 65 has been rising. By 2030, Staten Island is expected to have the highest percentage of senior citizens of any of the five boroughs.
Even the face of bohemianism there seems comparatively ancient. When I visited Every Thing Goes, a bookstore and cafe on Bay Street where vinyl records are sold and leftist conspiracy theories are dispensed by a bearded East Village exile manning the counter, I encountered no one younger than 50.
That Staten Island is depleting itself of young people has been a source of concern to the city, Seth W. Pinsky, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, told me. The hope is that Homeport will be appealing enough and reasonable enough to retain and attract men and women in their 20s and 30s who might otherwise be inclined to move, especially to New Jersey.
Could the surrounding neighborhoods, Stapleton and Tompkinsville among them, become the next Williamsburg, as some residents have speculated? In some sense this seems as unlikely as the welcoming of a Wal-Mart on Madison Avenue. Despite Homeport's proximity to the Staten Island Ferry Terminal, the neighborhood is still far away from well, Williamsburg, and the other neighborhoods in which the young and trend-setting congregate.
Perhaps even more relevant, Staten Island is not an incubator of preciousness; it seems allergic to preciousness. Before there were artisanal-cheese mongers in Williamsburg there were painters, performance artists, tattoos, eccentrics, an alternative-culture elite. Staten Island has a lower share of residents with bachelor's degrees than any borough except the Bronx.
At the same time, though, the island's North Shore does not conform to the borough's cliches. (And in truth the borough on the whole has become less like its image: In 2010, 52 percent of Staten Island residents under the age of 18 were non-Hispanic whites, a drop from 73 percent 20 years earlier.) The area surrounding the Homeport site is less suburban, far less well off, less white and grungier than much of Staten Island. You will see graffiti, junkyards, abandoned cassette players and a methadone clinic a few doors down from a sleekly laid-out clothing store -- elements that are catnip to a certain kind of 26-year-old.
With a monorail to Long Island City, who knows what this pocket of Staten Island could become.

HEADLINE: For Rodgers And Packers, No Reason To Be Humble

BYLINE: By MIKE TANIER. 
All times Eastern. Picks do not reflect the betting line.

 BODY:
Packers (11-0) at Giants (6-5) Sunday, 4:15 p.m. Line: Packers by 7.
Aaron Rodgers threw for 299 yards and 3 touchdowns in a winning effort a few weeks ago, but he was not satisfied with his performance. ''I didn't throw the ball very well,'' he said after the game, a 35-26 win over Tampa Bay on Nov. 20. ''I'm not trying to be ridiculously humble right now. I'm just frustrated.'' Rodgers's quotation shines a light on a major problem gripping the N.F.L.: ridiculous humility, the absurd self-denigration to which great players succumb when they avoid expressing satisfaction or joy at achieving anything short of seven straight Super Bowl championships. We have grown so used to hearing Tom Brady-types say ''we still have a lot of work to do'' after 38-20 victories that we fail to notice that it has transcended professionalism or constructive criticism, becoming a pantomime of masochistic self denial. 
With Rodgers at least addressing the ridiculous humility phenomenon and Charles Woodson acknowledging last month that an undefeated season is a desirable goal, the Packers now represent the vanguard of football honesty: the one team daring enough to occasionally express pride. Rodgers should throw for 400 yards against a Giants defense full of rookies and backups. He may still feel frustrated after the game. Imagine how Tom Coughlin will feel. Pick: Packers.
Falcons (7-4) at Texans (8-3) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Falcons by 2.5 .
Things are falling apart in Houston, where center Chris Myers does not hold, but he does cut block. The Falcons heard the falconer and won two straight games. Multiple quarterback injuries have loosed anarchy upon the Texans, who turn to W. B. Yeats - oops, T. J. Yates - to stem the blood-dimmed tide. The losses of Matt Schaub and Matt Leinart have caused the second coming of Jake Delhomme, who slouched off to Houston to sign a new contract Tuesday. Delhomme is full of passionate intensity, and he is not quite the worst: Brett Favre, with his gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, was also mentioned as a possible replacement. A third-string quarterback has little hope against the balanced, efficient Falcons. Gary Kubiak must prepare Yates and Delhomme for an upcoming slate of winnable games against the Colts and Panthers so the Texans can clinch their division and avoid another century of stony sleep. (Between Yates and the early-season Mike Kafka references, my editors have heroically decided to burn the office copy of ''The Norton Anthology of World Literature.'' We promise this will not happen again.) Pick: Falcons.
Colts (0-11) at Patriots (8-3) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Patriots by 20.
In what can only be interpreted as a ''Producers''-like effort to be as terrible as possible, the Colts acquired their third former member of the winless 2008 Lions this week. Fullback Jerome Felton joins Dan Orlovsky - now the starting quarterback - and Ernie Sims to give the Colts a noncoincidental cluster of players who know just how an 0-16 season works. They also fired the defensive coordinator Larry Coyer for the crime of running the same defense he has run for the last two years but without being spotted 30 points by the offense. The linebackers coach Mike Murphy takes over, but only because Franz Liebkind was not available. On top of all of their other woes, the Colts have the worst special teams in the N.F.L. Their punt returners average just 2.2 yards per return; factor in 14 fair catches, and that average drops to 1.3 yards. The primary return man, Blair White, is 2.06 yards tall, so he would be better off catching punts and falling straight forward than doing whatever he currently does. The punter-kickoff specialist Pat McAfee, meanwhile, leads the team in special teams tackles. It is good to know that one Colts player has not yet quit. Pick: Patriots.
Lions (7-4) at Saints (8-3) Sunday, 8:20 p.m. Line: Saints by 9.
The former Lions coach Steve Mariucci believes that someone besides the current coach Jim Schwartz should be assigned to discipline Ndamukong Suh, who is suspended for this game after treating a Packers lineman like a cigarette butt on Thanksgiving. Who is up to such a challenge? Supernanny? Sister Mary Stigmata from ''The Blues Brothers''? If last month's heart-to-heart talk with Roger Goodell had no impact on Suh, it may be time for the ''Clockwork Orange'' treatment: in the event of a late hit, simply play ''Ode to Joy'' over the loudspeakers and watch Suh curl into the fetal position. With Suh, the Lions had the potential to bring pressure up the middle and force Drew Brees to move out of the pocket. Without him, Brees will only suffer from his usual ''which wide-open receiver should I throw to'' anxiety. Pick: Saints.
Bengals (7-4) at Steelers (8-3) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Steelers by 6 .5.
Come for the division rivalry and the hard hits; stay for the wire fu. Bengals receiver Jerome Simpson paid homage to Hong Kong cinema last week when a Browns defender brushed against him after a play. Simpson flew backward about 5 yards, and the theatrics had the desired effect: the defender was penalized for unnecessary roughness. The move was so amazing that Simpson's Wikipedia page was updated with an ''Acting Career'' category, and the Wachowski brothers are developing a Bengals highlight project. The Steelers get defenders LaMarr Woodley and Troy Polamalu back this week, and the Bengals must do whatever it takes to prove they can win at least once against the A.F.C. North superpowers, even if it means using the Steelers' hard-hitting reputation against them. Do not be surprised if this game descends into a production of Crouching Bengal, Hidden Steeler. Pick: Steelers.
Ravens (8-3) at Browns (4-7) Sunday, 4:05 p.m. Line: Ravens by 6.5 .
The Ravens have followed every ''statement'' win this season with a loss to an inferior opponent: losses to the Seahawks, the Titans and the Jaguars followed big wins against the Steelers (twice) and the Texans. So avoiding a letdown was a major topic of conversation for the Ravens after beating the 49ers on Thanksgiving. ''We've got to conquer a demon in Cleveland,'' John Harbaugh said. Perhaps that is why Joe Flacco now sports a Fu Manchu mustache: goofy facial hair has been known to ward off evil spirits (and women). Flacco said the new mustache was an effort to ''get everybody to get on the bandwagon here on our offense. It's kind of tough convincing everybody.'' The Ravens' offense has never had a bandwagon, and if it did, no one would get on board with a bunch of guys who look like Mike Piazza circa 1993. Pick: Ravens.
Titans (6-5) at Bills (5-6) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Bills by 2 .5.
If he scores a touchdown this week, Steve Johnson will lampoon the injured Titans receiver Kenny Britt with an end zone dance interpretation of a two-hour wait in the violations line of New Jersey's Motor Vehicle Commission branch in Bayonne. He will also spoof Nate Washington if he can discover anything noteworthy about Nate Washington. Bob Costas will chide Johnson for his antics and all of us for watching them, and the Titans will win after Johnson drops three easy touchdown passes and Matt Hasselbeck sets up Rod Bironas for a game-winning field goal with his longest pass of the day: a 4-yard screen to Javon Ringer. Pick: Titans.
Jets (6-5) at Redskins (4-7) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Jets by 3.
Last week Mark Sanchez became the fourth N.F.L. quarterback to throw four touchdown passes in a fourth-quarter comeback victory yet still pass for fewer than 200 yards. He was also the first quarterback since Tommy Kramer in 1979 to throw four touchdown passes in a comeback victory while completing fewer than 50 percent of his passes. (Thanks to the statistical researcher Scott Kacsmar for the data.) Whether you consider these feats proof that Sanchez is great or terrible has everything to do with your preconceptions of Sanchez, whose performances have a knack for being both a vase and two faces. Redskins quarterback Rex Grossman spent his Bears career proving that a team with a good defense can endure some pretty erratic quarterbacking, and Sanchez is determined to provide further evidence. Polarized arguments about Sanchez's merits ultimately serve only one useful purpose: they give Eli Manning a break. Pick: Jets.
Panthers (3-8) at Buccaneers (4-7) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Buccaneers by 3 .5.
The Desert Eagle semiautomatic handgun can produce nearly 1,800 foot-pounds of muzzle energy when fired, enough energy to blast a hole clean through the Buccaneers' playoff hopes. Quarterback Josh Freeman severely cut his finger while spending some quality time with his weapon of choice at a firing range in late October. There is nothing wrong with obliterating a few targets unless, like Freeman, you are recovering from a sprain of the same finger, prefer a weapon known for its severe recoil and need your right hand in peak condition to do your job properly. Freeman played through the finger injury, but his accuracy was off, and now he also has a shoulder injury. The backup Josh Johnson took most of the passing snaps with the first team, with Freeman limited to handoffs. If Johnson starts against Cam Newton, the two speedy quarterbacks should forget football and hold a track meet. Meanwhile, Freeman can pamper his sore shoulder by launching a few rocket-propelled grenades. Pick: Panthers.
Chiefs (4-7) at Bears (7-4) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Bears by 7.
In this edition of Overengineered Solutions to Simple Problems, we will explore various methods of designing a game plan for a backup quarterback with limited talent. The Todd Haley Method: abandon the downfield passing game entirely and install a Wildcat-like package with a backup cornerback taking snaps from center. The Mike Martz Method: cram the game plan with elaborate, complicated screen passes, then use your best running back as a deep receiver instead of just handing him the ball. The Common Sense Method - employing better backups than Tyler Palko and Caleb Hanie in the first place, then showing a little confidence in them while scaling the game plan back slightly - is too simplistic and effective for the modern N.F.L. offensive guru. Pick: Bears.
Raiders (7-4) at Dolphins (3-8) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Dolphins by 3.
The Raiders are 7-4 for the first time since 2002, the last season they went to the Super Bowl. Isn't that great news, cornerback Stanford Routt? ''Seven-and-four is also a gift and a curse. Right now we're still leading the division. If we go in and pee down our leg and wind up finishing second in the division, it's going to be an embarrassment.'' Buddy, the Chargers are way ahead of you in that department. The surprising point spread is the result of Raiders injuries: running back Darren McFadden and several receivers are hobbled, forcing the Raiders to try to win with defense, special teams and Routt's lukewarm brand of optimism. Pick: Dolphins.
Broncos (6-5) at Vikings (2-9) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Vikings by 1.5 .
The Vikings were facing a midweek blackout: 3,000 tickets remained for this game on Wednesday, despite a visit from the football equivalent of Justin Bieber. The Vikings are trying to float a stadium referendum, but if fans will not pay to see Tim Tebow, what hope does the team have of selling them on Christian Ponder? The Vikings ended up purchasing the tickets themselves, and the 3,000 fans who received them will be asked to either try out as long snappers so Jared Allen can stop doing it or form a human chain to try to stop Von Miller. Pick: Broncos.
Rams (2-9) at 49ers (9-2) Sunday, 4:15 p.m. Line: 49ers by 13. The 49ers clinch the N.F.C. West with a win, but that does not mean Jim Harbaugh will start resting starters. ''We've got five games to play and they'll all be critical,'' he said Tuesday. Also, taking a full month off is not resting, it's unemployment. Instead of spending December mall-hopping, the 49ers must work on their pass protection: Alex Smith was sacked nine times by the Ravens, and Harbaugh broke the sacks down into a 3-by-3 matrix of miscues. ''Three of them we got beat on the protection call,'' he said, adding, ''Three other times we got physically beat. And then maybe there were two other ones Alex could've gotten rid of it quicker.'' That is only eight, but N.F.L. coaches do not like to quibble about statistics. Pick: 49ers.
Cowboys (7-4) at Cardinals (4-7) Sunday, 4:15 p.m. Line: Cowboys by 4.5 .
Kevin Kolb is expected to return for the Cardinals, and not a moment too soon. The team succumbed to the latest N.F.L. Wildcat neurosis, the cornerback-as-quarterback phenomenon, when Patrick Peterson lined up to take a shotgun snap last week. He fumbled it. ''Right when I was securing the ball into my right hand, my knee hit the tail end of the ball and that kind of popped it out,'' he said. ''But, man, if I had the opportunity to hang on to that ball, I believe I was going the distance.'' Yes, it would have been huge, had the ball not bounced off his knee and dribbled four yards downfield. In his official statistics, Peterson gets credit for recovering the fumble, but not for forcing it. Pick: Cowboys.
Chargers (4-7) at Jaguars (3-8) Monday, 8:30 p.m. Line: Chargers by 2.5 .
The Jaguars fired Jack Del Rio, announced the sale of their franchise, and extended the contract of General Manager Gene Smith in the course of about six hours Tuesday. It was as if they were trying to get three years' worth of headlines out of the way in one morning so we could all go back to ignoring them. The lesson from Del Rio's firing: it is better to accept responsibility for your late-game decisions, no matter how mind-bogglingly foolish, than to blame them on your offensive coordinator. Norv Turner is living, gainfully-employed proof. Pick: Chargers.

HEADLINE: New Iraqi Hotel Hopes to Draw Guests to a Place Where the Stay Used to Be Mandatory

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER; Zaid Thaker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
UMM QASR, Iraq -- The road approaching the Basra Gateway hotel in southern Iraq crosses a landscape so blighted with trash and spilled crude oil, which shimmers in gigantic pools in the sand, that it is difficult to imagine any guests ever passing this way.
When they do arrive, guests are greeted by a jumble of concrete blocks, sand bags and barbed wire -- the hotel's front gate. Instead of a doorman, Basra Gateway employs a gunman. 
He smiles and pulls back a coil of razor wire, welcoming travelers to this improbable hotel, which has opened within what used to be Camp Bucca, an American prison base with a notorious reputation among Iraqis.
Basra Gateway is one of the fledgling efforts by Iraqi companies to make good commercial use of hundreds of recently abandoned American military bases -- usually desolate, off-putting ensembles of concrete on the edges of towns. The hotel's developer and operator, the Kufan Group, is hoping to lure executives from oil and oil-services companies that operate in the nearby fields. The trailers-cum-hotel rooms go for about $190 a night, and they can be booked only in blocks in advance.
''The dream that we have is to turn this into a commercial oasis,'' said Maythem H. al-Asadi, Kufan's president. ''It's only a matter of time.''
The company's venture, as with others that have taken over American bases, relies on hundreds of American military residential trailers, known as CHUs, from the acronym for containerized housing unit. They had once accommodated guards. Kufan workers installed indoor plumbing in some, creating the guest rooms.
Besides the few upgrades to the trailers, the prison remains unaltered and eerily empty, the wind whistling through the old guard towers.
The United States military is handing over all bases to the Iraqi government by the end of the year. Only about a half-dozen of the 505 bases in Iraq are still in American hands.
Most are becoming Iraqi military bases, with some exceptions. The Saddam Hussein-era palaces at the Victory Base Complex near Baghdad, once used by American generals, for example, may become a convention center.
Other bases, left empty by the Americans, were promptly looted of air-conditioners and refrigerators, items now showing up in Iraqi flea markets.
The Kufan Group obtained Camp Bucca from the Iraqi government at an auction, with an eye toward creating a hotel, logistics center and container storage area for the oil industry. At first glance, it hardly seems an auspicious site: the panoramic scene of storm fencing and coiled razor wire resembles nothing so much as the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and its former function was similar.
Regardless, the hotel opened on Nov. 24 to coincide with an oil and gas conference in nearby Basra. Amar Latif, Basra Gateway's general manager, said his guests appreciate ''our many layers of dirt berms'' and other walls.
The transformation is emblematic of one particularly optimistic vision, held by some businessmen, of what Iraq may become after the American withdrawal, despite lingering sectarian tensions and persistent insurgent violence. Iraq, they say, is poised now to move quickly from war to an oil boom of historic proportions that will quickly inflate the economy and generate exceptional opportunities for companies that get in early.
The city of Basra, despite its present impoverished appearance, sits above immense wealth. Oil production, mostly from fields near here, is projected to increase faster in Iraq than in any other country in the world over the next 25 years, according to International Energy Agency projections.
If all goes well, production in Iraq will rise by an additional five million barrels per day by 2035, bringing the total to more than eight million barrels per day. For comparison, that is more than a third of all the oil consumed each day in the United States, a vast fortune in energy.
As the military leaves, the oil-services companies Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Schlumberger and Weatherford International are expanding operations, hopeful of economic growth. General Electric opened three offices in Iraq in November, a month before the last American soldier is to march out.
At the former American prison camp, for example, oil companies are considering renting space on a permanent basis for employees, according to the Kufan Group.
''Exxon loved it,'' Mr. Latif said of the former Camp Bucca. Their representatives visited half a dozen times, he said, to examine the security arrangements, taking in the sprawl of razor wire and concrete walls and exclaiming, ''Oh boy, it's excellent!''
On the downside, Iraq's security situation is still so dismal that a former prison appears alluring as a hotel.
About 150 executives who came to explore opportunities in the petroleum business in southern Iraq at the conference last month wound up here. Opening day did not go smoothly. Partly that was because not all of the executives, who had booked accommodations through the conference organizers, had been told they would be staying in a prison camp until the bus pulled up at the guard post outside.
''People complained,'' said Loay Almalaieka, a vice president of the Kufan Group. The new plumbing burst in some rooms. ''We couldn't achieve a great level of satisfaction with these executives, for obvious reasons.''
One delegation of Swedes, distraught at staying in this eerie hotel, checked out early; it is not clear where they went, Mr. Almalaieka said.
The operators acknowledge that Basra Gateway is a work in progress. After all, the previous tenants had no right to be finicky. ''We are trying to create a more homey atmosphere,'' said Andrew D. Quaile, a project manager with the Cater Corporation, an Australian contractor handling the food service.
Still, the Kufan Group also plans to re-open the even more desolate detainee portion of the camp. There, inmates lived in tents ringed by the dirt walls. In a sign of the changing Iraq, that area might be used now for laborers from South Asia who work in the oil fields, the company said.
''We don't call them prison tents now,'' Mr. Latif said. ''They are low-cost, high-density accommodation.''

HEADLINE: The Decadent Left

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
IN the days when Tea Party activists were crowding town hall meetings and Glenn Beck's fans were thronging the Washington Mall, a kind of existential despair settled over the American left. The country was mired in an economic crisis that most left-wingers believed was caused by the excesses of free-market capitalism, yet the only major protest movement belonged to the political right. What was the left good for, if it couldn't even persuade people to take to the streets? Why didn't American liberalism have a Tea Party of its own?
Now it has one. Or rather, it has several: the union-organized rallies across the Midwest earlier this year, which attacked budget cuts and defended public-sector pay; the environmentalist protests, complete with arrests outside the White House, against the proposed Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the United States; and of course the tent cities of Occupy Wall Street, now entering winter hibernation but probably destined to return in force next year. Indeed, since the 2010 midterms, left-wing street theater has arguably eclipsed Tea Party activism as our politics' defining form of protest. 
Of these movements, Occupy Wall Street earned by far the most attention, while achieving the least in terms of actual policy. The union protests against Wisconsin's curbs on collective bargaining helped set the stage for the recent repudiation, via referendum, of similar legislation in Ohio. The environmental protesters haven't stopped the Keystone pipeline outright, but they induced President Obama to delay its consideration until 2013.
The O.W.S. protesters, on the other hand, haven't even settled on concrete political objectives. As two of the movement's more perceptive conservative critics -- Matt Continetti in The Weekly Standard and James Panero in The New Criterion -- have said, many protesters seemed more interested in founding a kind of Paris Commune or Oneida Community in Zuccotti Park than in actually participating in public-policy debates.
This has led some liberals to argue that the Occupy protesters should find a way to imitate the more pragmatic efforts of unions and environmentalists. In a recent issue of The New Yorker, Jane Mayer highlighted ''the difference between the focused, agenda-driven campaign'' fought by critics of the Keystone pipeline ''and the free-form, leaderless one waged by the Occupiers.'' Given that anti-Keystone activists succeeded (at least temporarily), she wrote, ''the Occupy movement could do worse than to learn from the pipeline protest.''
But there's a sense in which the pipeline protesters and Midwestern unions are exactly the people that the O.W.S. crowd should not learn from, if they aspire to appeal to a wider audience than left-wing activists usually reach.
Yes, Occupy Wall Street was dreamed up in part by flakes and populated in part by fantasists. But to the extent that the movement briefly captured the public's imagination, it was because it seemed to be doing what a decent left would exist to do: criticizing entrenched power, championing the common good and speaking for the many rather than the few.
The union rallies and the Keystone demonstrations, by contrast, represented what you might call the decadent left, which fights for narrow interest groups rather than for the public as a whole.
The Wisconsin protests didn't defend American workers' right to bargain for their fair share of company profits, as traditional union protests have. They defended government employees' right to negotiate with elected officials over the division of taxpayer dollars -- a recipe for profligacy that even liberal icons like Franklin Roosevelt and the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s George Meany once opposed.
Likewise, the Keystone protesters haven't been defending ''the interests of wage-earning Americans,'' to borrow the historian Michael Kazin's description of the historic purpose of the American left. They've been harnessing the power of the Democratic Party's wealthy environmentalist donors to actively kill off American jobs.
Stopping the pipeline won't drive down demand for fossil fuels, or prevent Canada's oil from being extracted and shipped around the world. But for a small group of activists and donors, keeping the pipeline out of their national backyard is all that counts, even if American workers pay the price.
Whatever your politics, there's arguably more to admire in the ragtag theatricality of Occupy Wall Street than in that sort of self-righteous defense of the status quo. Even if it has failed to embrace plausible solutions, O.W.S. at least picked a deserving target -- what National Review's Reihan Salam describes as the ''moral rupture'' created by Wall Street's and Washington's betrayal of the public trust.
Better a protest movement that casts itself (however quixotically) as the defender of ''the 99 percent'' than a protest movement that just represents Democratic interest groups. And better a left that flirts with utopianism than a left that adheres to the dictum attributed to Leonid Brezhnev during the Prague Spring: ''Don't talk to me about 'socialism.' What we have, we hold.''

HEADLINE: Good Morning. You're Nobel Laureates.

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
CHRISTOPHER A. SIMS, a prodigious mathematician and a path-breaking economist, was fast asleep at his home near Princeton University when the telephone rang.
It was early on the morning of Oct. 10, the sun not yet up. A crank call, he figured, and rolled over.
Then the phone rang again. His wife, Cathie, fumbled for the receiver.
''If it's a prank,'' she whispered, ''they're doing a pretty good Swedish accent.''
At the same hour, near the campus of New York University in Manhattan, Thomas J. Sargent was already wide awake. He, too, had received an unexpected call. 
Stockholm was on the line. The two men, intellectual sparring mates for more than 40 years, had won the Nobel in economic science. (They are to collect it on Saturday.)
And yet, in this time of economic angst, with the fate of the euro and the course of the global economy uncertain, these two Americans have reached the pinnacle of a profession that, to many, seems to have failed miserably. The financial crisis of 2008-09, the Great Recession, the debt mess in Europe -- few economists saw all of it coming. For all its elegance, modern macroeconomics seemed to provide little help when the world needed it most.
Today, solutions to our economic troubles, from onerous government debt to high unemployment, remain elusive. And the field of economics, like Washington politics, seems as polarized as ever.
During the Great Depression, John Maynard Keynes held out remedies. His ideas have shaped many policy makers' thinking ever since. Keynes maintained that market economies are inherently unstable and, if left to their own devices, can self-destruct. Hence governments, he argued, must sometimes intervene.
Mr. Sims and Mr. Sargent neither prescribe cures nor forecast the future. Nor do they deal in the sound bites of talking heads on cable TV. They are reluctant celebrities, men whose work can baffle even Ph.D.'s.
So it comes as a surprise, not least to Mr. Sims and Mr. Sargent, that these two now find themselves thrust into an uncomfortable spotlight. Conservative voices, like the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, have claimed them as their own. The men's work on economic cause and effect and the theory of rational expectations -- which maintains that people use all the information available in making economic decisions -- proves that Keynes had it wrong, these commentators say.
It would be a provocative thesis -- if it were true. But Mr. Sims and Mr. Sargent say their work is being misread. Both, in fact, are longtime Democrats who maintain that government can, and should, play a role in economic affairs. They stand behind many recent policies of the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve. They even have some ideas about how European governments might defuse the running crisis on the Continent.
They won their Nobel for ''their empirical research on cause and effect in the macroeconomy,'' in the academy's words. What that means, in part, is that they have done some serious math. Today, ideas they largely formed in the 1970s and '80s help shape the thinking inside the Fed and on Wall Street.
Their work goes beyond old labels like Keynesianism and the monetarism of Milton Friedman. They have shown that fiscal and monetary policy are inextricably linked, and their research reflects the broad shift in economics from words to numbers -- toward a level of empirical analysis that few outside the profession can readily grasp. But it contains a kernel of skepticism appropriate for these troubled times. In a world of uncertainty and constraint, cause and effect may not be what they seem. As a result, we must test and retest our assumptions -- and try to prepare for the unexpected.
''The most impressive thing about them as scholars,'' says David Easley, an economist at Cornell University, ''is that in recent years they have questioned the assumptions of the models they helped to create, and they have been at the vanguard of the efforts to go beyond them.''
Mr. Sargent says his most important work is spoken ''in the beautiful language of math.'' He knows it's not widely understood.
''The kind of work we do, that real economists do, will never catch on with the public,'' he says.
THOMAS SARGENT, in a draft of his Nobel acceptance speech, refers to himself as an ''American provincial.'' On a recent afternoon, over a bowl of noodles at an Asian restaurant near N.Y.U. in Greenwich Village, he used football metaphors to discuss economics. He compared fiscal policymakers to coaches, with X's and O's. He often wears T-shirts, sweatshirts and baseball caps, gear as appropriate in Montana, where he keeps a cabin, as it is in Washington Square.
Born in 1943, the son of an insurance salesman and a social worker, Mr. Sargent grew up in Monrovia, Calif., east of Pasadena. He says he didn't cut an impressive figure in high school. ''I wasn't the brightest kid, not by a long shot,'' he says. ''I was interested in football, in girls, in getting my work done with the least amount of effort.''
Economics? Please. ''I think you've got to watch out for anybody in high school who says he wants to become an economist,'' he says.
And yet, from an early age, Tom Sargent was acquainted with real-world economics. Both of his grandfathers were pretty much wiped out in the Depression, he says.
His classmates at Monrovia High School say he was exceptionally bright -- an academic whiz who also ran track and was president of his junior class. He graduated in three years and headed to the University of California, Berkeley.
There, he took introductory courses in economics and political science, a subject that still fascinates him. He went door to door to campaign for John F. Kennedy and, although his work has been embraced by political conservatives, says he is a lifelong Democrat who fondly remembers ''the days when all the Democrats believed in balanced budgets.''
Economics, rather than politics, became his life's work partly because of an inspiring teaching assistant named Jerry Kenley. Fifty years later, sitting in his office at N.Y.U., Mr. Sargent remembers his old T.A.
''Jerry liked to say, 'Economics is organized common sense.' I still think that's about right,'' Mr. Sargent says. Those early classes touched on everything from farm subsidies to taxation. ''Wow, it really got me going,'' he says.
He hasn't been in touch with Mr. Kenley in 50 years. Now retired in California, after a career as a professor in the state university system, Mr. Kenley says: ''Tom Sargent was sharp as a tack on every point.''
At Berkeley, Mr. Sargent also crossed paths with Hyman Minsky, the business-cycle theorist whose work has returned to vogue since the start of the global financial crisis. Mr. Minsky, who died in 1996, argued that during exuberant periods, financial markets create credit bubbles that eventually lead to credit tightening, downturns and crises -- events now sometimes known as ''Minsky moments.''
Mr. Minsky was Mr. Sargent's adviser and encouraged him to pursue graduate work at Harvard. ''He told me I was capable of succeeding in a place like that,'' Mr. Sargent said. ''I didn't think I could handle it. I didn't have the math.''
In retrospect, Mr. Sargent believes that Mr. Minsky's math skills, too, were less developed than they might have been. But at Mr. Minsky's urging, the young man from Monrovia set out for Cambridge, Mass.
WHEN Tom Sargent arrived at Harvard in 1964, Christopher Sims was already turning heads there. Mr. Sims had studied mathematics at Harvard College, then dazzled the economics department as a grad student.
Mr. Sargent says the two weren't close friends then. ''He was so brilliant I was afraid to talk to him,'' Mr. Sargent says.
Mr. Sims wrote his undergraduate thesis on information theory, a subject to which he has returned over the years. In his senior year, he says, he wanted ''something more practical'' and switched to economics.
It was a natural move. His grandfather William Morris Leiserson was a labor economist and member of the National Labor Relations Board during the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. His uncle, Mark Leiserson, a Yale economist, urged him from age 10 to enter the profession.
''It backfired at first,'' Mr. Sims says, surrounded by books in his Princeton office. ''But I guess something stuck.''
Great things were expected of him. His math teacher at Greenwich High School in Connecticut, Stephen Willoughby, now a retiree in Tucson, Ariz., says he was a math prodigy. ''I always expected Chris would win a Nobel. I just wasn't sure what field it would be.''
Mr. Sims's classmates voted him most likely to succeed. ''In a class of intelligent people, he was exceptional,'' says Joyce Tracksler, a high school friend who is now a mystery writer in Kittery Point, Me.
His parents were exceptional, too. His father, Albert, was a diplomat, and young Chris lived in Germany a few years as a child. The family later moved to the Washington suburbs before settling in Greenwich. His father became an executive at the Institute of International Education and at the College Entrance Examination Board in New York. During the Kennedy administration, he helped start the Peace Corps.
Because of his father's College Board connections, Mr. Sims got hold of an old SAT exam, which he and Mr. Willoughby used to conduct a statistical analysis. They found that on multiple-choice questions in English and social studies, the ''longer answers tended to be correct.'' In math, they determined that the number that was ''closest to all of the other numerical choices'' was probably the right one. Mr. Willoughby says Mr. Sims got perfect scores on SATs, and his teacher assumed that the young man would later ''do something involving math, statistics and probability.''
Mr. Sims's mother, Ruth, made her own mark in Greenwich. Now ailing, she was president of the League of Women Voters of Connecticut in Mr. Sims's youth and in 1977 became the first Democrat since 1905 and the first woman ever to hold the highest office in town, the position of first selectman.
She won the first of two terms in a runoff after several recounts and reports of possible skulduggery, though never proven, by members of the Republican opposition.
''There isn't much political coloration in my economic writing,'' Mr. Sims said one afternoon in his Princeton office, looking very much like an older version of the Greenwich boy he was, in a blue oxford button-down shirt, black slacks and moccasins. ''It's not surprising that few people know my political views. They really aren't very important.''
AS Mr. Sargent tells it, Mr. Sims changed his life. In 1972, Mr. Sims published an article titled ''Money, Income, and Causality.'' Mr. Sargent says he recognized its importance but couldn't follow all of it.
''I spent the next two years learning enough math so that I could make sense of it,'' he says. ''From there, having learned that language, I was able to start asking some questions of my own and to go in my own direction. That paper really got me started.''
Around the same time, Mr. Sargent says, he was denied tenure at the University of Pennsylvania and needed a job. Mr. Sims had just taken a position at the University of Minnesota.
''I got a call from Chris,'' Mr. Sargent says, ''and the next week I had an interview and a job offer and my life really went in a great direction.'' (Mr. Sims says he doesn't remember the details.)
In his office, Mr. Sims translates the paper that sent Mr. Sargent on a math quest. It provided a technique to assess the direction of causality in central bank monetary policy.
Just as monetarists like Mr. Friedman had said, shifts in the money supply affect inflation, the paper showed.
''The monetarists loved it,'' he recalls. It appeared to confirm their theory that changes in the growth of the money supply determined inflation.
But the paper also helps explain why Mr. Sims has been called an iconoclast. His technique was later used to show that the causality went both ways. ''Variables like interest rates and inflation also led to changes in the money supply,'' he says.
Monetarism has not entirely recovered.
Mr. Sims developed a statistical approach called vector autoregression, or V.A.R. It enables the testing of cause and effect -- whether, for example, the money supply is affecting interest rates, or vice versa. That is a crucial determination if economic models are to have any accuracy, as the Nobel committee has noted.
V.A.R. has become a tool, albeit a highly specialized one, in financial analysis. It's used in some models run by central banks, and, as Aaron Gurwitz, the chief investment officer at Barclays Wealth, says, it has been useful in ''helping us understand the patterns in market volatility over time.''
Mr. Sims now spends much of his time using information theory -- he compares limits on our ability to process information to the limits on water flow imposed by a pipe -- to expand the horizons of economic modeling. He calls his new approach ''rational inattention,'' and is the first to say that V.A.R. techniques aren't a panacea.
''People have criticized them, saying they didn't give us enough understanding to prevent the financial crisis, and that's true,'' he says. ''But that's like saying, after a teenager gets into an accident, that driver's education failed because the teenager took it and still got into an accident. You'd still want a teenager to take driver's ed.''
GOOGLE ''Thomas Sargent'' and ''rational expectations'' and you'll get hundreds of hits. Along with Robert E. Lucas Jr. of the University of Chicago, who won the Nobel in 1995, Mr. Sargent is widely considered one of the founders of the theory, though he says it had many earlier proponents, including Keynes.
(Mr. Sargent, formerly of the University of Minnesota, and Mr. Lucas were also often labeled members of the ''freshwater'' school of economics, partly because of the inland location of their universities. That label makes little sense now, if it ever did, says Mr. Sargent, a Californian transplanted to Manhattan, a ''saltwater'' enclave.)
Put simply, the idea of rational expectations is that in many economic situations, the outcome depends on what people expect to happen. That might sound obvious today, but in the '70s and '80s, many economic models, based on aspects of Keynesian theory, didn't take expectations into account. Policies informed by those old models may have helped cause the stagflation of the '70s. In 1977, Mr. Sargent wrote a paper, ''Is Keynesian Economics a Dead End?'', which highlighted such models' flaws.
He attributed many of these failings to economists who adapted Keynes's theories, and not to Keynes himself, whom he considers a great economist. But like Minsky, Keynes ''didn't have enough math to really develop his concepts on his own,'' Mr. Sargent says.
After learning enough to crack Mr. Sims's equations, Mr. Sargent says he realized he needed to know more. A tenured professor at Minnesota at the age of 30, he sat in on higher-level math courses and continued for years. And as the Nobel committee has noted, he has helped to make rational expectations part of mainstream thought and to take econometric modeling to a new level. His book, ''The Conquest of American Inflation,'' is still useful in analyzing prospects for inflation in the current climate, Mr. Gurwitz says.
''Tom Sargent developed a model that shows how policy makers and markets had a meeting of the minds in the '80s, and got inflation under control,'' he says.
Mr. Sargent not only analyzed changes in central bankers' understanding of the relationship between inflation and unemployment, but he also factored in the financial markets' reaction to changes in policy, and, further, the reaction of the policy makers to the reaction of the markets.
''It's a beautiful model,'' Mr. Gurwitz says, ''and it helps us understand what's going on today.''
Still, Mr. Sargent has his critics. In a blog post at the market nadir in March 2009, for example, Willem Buiter, now chief economist of Citigroup, said Mr. Sargent was among the scholars whose theories had left the profession ''unprepared when the crisis struck.'' Mr. Buiter would not comment for this article.
Mr. Sargent is tough on himself, saying the ''rational expectations approach'' and the techniques he has helped to pioneer don't yet capture economic reality. How do people really think, as individuals and in a market? How should we account for changes in expectations as people learn? How should we incorporate human thinking more realistically into economic models? He's grappling with such questions, seeking more sophisticated techniques that incorporate what he calls the theory of ''adaptive learning.''
His own assumptions need to be continually re-examined ''to capture a fundamentally uncertain, constrained, complicated world,'' he says.
Simon Potter, director of economic research at the New York Federal Reserve, says he has taken Mr. Sargent's message to heart: ''Our profession hasn't reached the stage where it can reliably forecast the economy,'' Mr. Potter says. ''Our collective failure to do so in the financial crisis shows this.''
And so, he says, ''we at the Fed have been using the teachings of Thomas Sargent to 'tweak our models' and build in alternative assumptions.'' The point is to ''ratchet down our forecasts,'' he says, and try to prepare for ''less obvious, less easily expected outcomes.''
WHILE neither Mr. Sims nor Mr. Sargent gives much prescriptive advice about the current economic malaise, both have already given guidance about the global crisis -- providing advance warning of serious consequences if policy makers fail to understand the links between monetary and fiscal policy.
In a prescient paper more than a decade ago, Mr. Sims warned of disaster to come in the euro zone if a new central bank wasn't accompanied by a unified fiscal authority. To avoid disaster now, he says, the European Central Bank must show a willingness ''to act as a lender of last resort'' in Europe. If that happens, he says, markets may be able to stabilize long enough for Europeans to study a long ''menu'' of accompanying fiscal and political arrangements.
Mr. Sargent has also written extensively about ''budget constraints'' and monetary policy. One influential study, ''Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic,'' written with Neil Wallace of Penn State, says a central bank will eventually run out of ammunition if the government fails to manage its debt. That analysis applies to the United States today, Mr. Sargent says.
''There are many choices open to us here,'' he says. ''But at some point the market will have to be convinced that the government can handle its debt.''
As for the euro, he says he will provide a few possible answers in his Nobel speech on Saturday. His draft is a scholarly, 40-page, footnoted, annotated paper. ''There isn't much about Europe in it,'' he acknowledges. ''They don't want advice from an American, really.''
The paper contains an explication of rational expectations econometric theory, written in English and math, and an astute fiscal and monetary history of the United States in its early days.
Mr. Sargent notes that the United States moved from loose confederation to federal union -- the arrangement embodied in the Constitution -- in large part because of a crippling debt crisis. The parallels with Europe seem clear. Is he calling for a federal Europe?
''Maybe,'' he says. ''I'm pointing out the constraints and the possibilities.''

HEADLINE: Secrets Of the Bailout, Now Told

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
A FRESH account emerged last week about the magnitude of financial aid that the Federal Reserve bestowed on big banks during the 2008-09 credit crisis. The report came from Bloomberg News, which had to mount a lengthy legal fight to wrest documents from the Fed that detailed its rescue efforts.
It is dispiriting, of course, that we are still learning about the billions provided to various financial firms during the crisis. Another sad element to this mess is that getting the truth requires the legal firepower of an organization as rich as Bloomberg. 
But that's the way our world works. Billions are secretly showered on troubled financial institutions to stave off disaster. Individuals get little or no help.
Here are some of the new figures:
Among all the rescue programs set up by the Fed, $7.77 trillion in commitments were outstanding as of March 2009, Bloomberg said. The nation's six largest banks -- JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley -- borrowed almost half a trillion dollars from the Fed at peak periods, Bloomberg calculated, using the central bank's data.
Those six institutions accounted for 63 percent of the average daily borrowings from the Fed by all publicly traded United States banks, money management and investment firms, Bloomberg said.
Numbers for individual companies were equally astonishing. For example, the Fed provided Bear Stearns with $30 billion to see it through its 2008 shotgun marriage with JPMorgan. This was in addition to the $29.5 billion in assets purchased by the Fed from Bear to assist in the buyout by JPMorgan. Citigroup, meanwhile, tapped the Fed for almost $100 billion in January 2009 -- its peak during the crisis -- and Morgan Stanley received $107 billion in Fed loans in September 2008.
Some may see all this as ancient history or as ho-hum disclosures that confirm what everybody already knew -- that our banks were on the precipice and that only hundreds of billions of dollars could save them. The Fed says that the money it lent in these programs was paid back without generating any losses.
But the information is revealing nonetheless. The fact is, investors didn't know how dire the situation was at these institutions. At the same time that these banks were privately thronging the teller windows at the Fed, some of their executives were publicly espousing their firms' financial solidity.
During the first three months of 2009, for example, when Citigroup's Fed borrowing apparently peaked, Vikram Pandit, its chief executive, hailed the company's performance. Calling that first quarter the best over all since 2007, Mr. Pandit said the results showed ''the strength of Citi's franchise.''
Citi's earnings release didn't detail its large Fed borrowings; neither did its filing for the first quarter of 2009 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other banks kept silent on these activities or mentioned them in passing with few specifics.
These disclosure lapses are disturbing to Lynn E. Turner, a former chief accountant at the S.E.C. Since 1989, he said, commission rules have required public companies to disclose details about material federal assistance they receive. The rules grew out of the savings and loan crisis, during which hundreds of banks failed and others received government help.
The rules are found in a section of the S.E.C.'s Codification of Financial Reporting Policies titled ''Effects of Federal Financial Assistance Upon Operations.'' They state that if any types of federal financial assistance have ''materially affected or are reasonably likely to have a future material effect upon financial condition or results of operations, the management discussion and analysis should provide disclosure of the nature, amounts and effects of such assistance.''
Given these rules, Mr. Turner said: ''I would have expected some discussion in the management discussion and analysis of how this has had a positive impact on these banks' operating results. The borrowings had to have an impact on their liquidity and earnings, but I don't ever recall anybody saying 'we borrowed a bunch of money from the Fed at zero percent interest.' ''
I asked officials at Citigroup and Morgan Stanley about these disclosures. Jon Diat, a spokesman for Citigroup, said the bank's disclosures in its quarterly filings with the S.E.C. ''were entirely appropriate.'' He added that Citi and other financial services firms ''utilized numerous government programs that provided significant funding capacity and liquidity support which helped increase the flow of credit into the economy.''
Morgan Stanley pointed to its annual report for 2008, which mentioned the various Fed programs and the bank's ability to tap them. The filing noted that the Fed was authorized to extend credit to Morgan Stanley's broker-dealer units in both the United States and Britain but contained no dollar amounts used.
Of course, there is stigma associated with a company tapping into federal assistance programs. This is the Fed's main argument for keeping its operations under wraps. And companies want to avoid frightening investors by disclosing their reliance on this type of emergency cash, even if it is only temporary.
But keeping this information from shareholders is no way to engender their trust. And a lack of investor confidence often translates to depressed valuations among companies' shares. If investors doubt that a company is coming clean about its financial standing -- the current worry is how exposed our banks are to European debt woes -- its stock price will suffer. This is very likely one of the reasons that big bank stocks trade at such low price-to-earnings multiples today.
It will be interesting to see whether the S.E.C. does anything to enforce its rules that companies disclose federal assistance in financial filings, either in the recent past or in the future. You could certainly argue that requiring such disclosures is even more important nowadays, given that so many banks are considered too big to fail and that the taxpayer will undoubtedly be asked once again to rescue them from their mistakes.
''These banks and the Fed have never believed in transparency,'' Mr. Turner said. ''I actually think their thought process is sorely flawed. If the banks knew this stuff was going to be made public they'd behave differently. Instead of runs on the bank you'd have bankers doing things intelligently to avoid getting into trouble.''
What an idea!

HEADLINE: On Land and in the Bay, Innovation Tackles Truancy

BYLINE: By TREY BUNDY. 
tbundy@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
On Monday morning, the start of the school week, five teenagers rowed toward the breakwater leading into San Francisco Bay.
''It's so foggy you can't even see the Golden Gate Bridge,'' said Austin, a 17-year-old student at Downtown High School in Potrero Hill, as he worked the oars. When the students passed an old sailboat, their instructor, Jeff Rogers, told them it was built 120 years ago in Hunters Point.
''Hey,'' Austin said. ''My 'hood.''
If not for the boating expedition, Austin might have still been home, in bed, instead of in school. But on that day his classroom happened to be a sailboat. Before coming to Downtown, he was a chronic truant in the San Francisco school system, one of the thousands of students at risk of dropping out. Now he attends school about 80 percent of the time. 
For decades, teachers and school districts have battled truancy, struggling to engage students who cope with economic hardship, community strife, domestic violence and drug abuse. Some students avoid school because they are not interested or because they are being bullied. But since 2008, in part because of programs like those at Downtown, the San Francisco district's chronic truancy has dropped by 31 percent.
Downtown High is a continuation school, with one of the two largest concentrations of truants in the city; the other is Ida B. Wells High School in the Western Addition. There are no ringing class bells or six-period school days at Downtown; the curriculum is ''project-based,'' meaning students choose one course each semester to fulfill all of their academic requirements. Math, science, history and English are taught in hands-on classes in music, nature, drama and social movements.
Jaime Osorno, Downtown's counselor, came to the school four years ago after working in the district as a truancy specialist. ''I chose this because I felt that we were offering something different to students,'' Mr. Osorno said. ''When I was in other schools, it was like, 'Here's your classes, good luck.' ''
Most of the 275 students at Downtown High have exhausted efforts by other schools to get them on track to graduate, including parent meetings, support programs and mediations with the San Francisco District Attorney's Office. As a result, ''attendance drives everything'' at Downtown, said Mark Alvarado, the principal.
At Downtown, success means that a student attends school at least 80 percent of the time and earns at least 17.5 credits each quarter. Roughly 100 students achieve that mark, up from about 25 in 2007, but the numbers fluctuate weekly.
The students fall into three categories. Those with 80 percent attendance or better are in Cohort A; students in Cohort B show up 40 percent to 80 percent of the time; and some students in Cohort C have never even set foot on campus.
''These are the kids that make me nervous,'' Mr. Alvarado said of Cohort C, adding that few of them make it to graduation. Instead, he tries to connect those students to adult education and vocational training programs.
''Cohort B wants to graduate,'' he said. ''They could have dropped out already. They weren't successful before for whatever reason, but they're coming to school.''
On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, the school put on a holiday feast and a talent show. Mr. Alvarado estimated that 145 out of 275 students attended, a typical showing at Downtown.
Widny, a lanky 18-year-old, put on a giant Afro wig and played guitar with his funk band, MMARSS + 1, in the cafeteria. He said later that Downtown High's music program was what got him to school each day.
''It mixes music with math and English and literacy, all of that stuff,'' he said. ''We're learning about logarithms, advanced math I never thought I'd get to.''
Widny moved to San Francisco from New Jersey, where he used to cut school because he was bullied. Now, he said, he carries a 3.8 G.P.A. and shows up every day because he is afraid he might miss something good.
''We had a circuit board, and we had to program a robot,'' he said. ''It's pretty fun building a robot and having it fight against another robot.''
Mr. Osorno, the counselor, said those small accomplishments went a long way.
''By the time they get to ninth grade, if they don't see themselves being successful, that's when you get the truancy,'' he said. ''They think, 'I get F's if I show up, and if I don't show up, I get F's, and I get in trouble when I'm here.' ''
Latinos and blacks make up the majority of truants, Mr. Osorno said. And while some students skip class because they lack interest, others struggle with issues that overwhelm their ability to care about school.
''There's drug use, there's death, probation, dealing with different systems, and families distrusting the school system,'' he said. ''It's hard because you want to help them out, but there's stuff you really can't do, like housing.''
Downtown High's boating program is part of the adventure-based project ''Get Out And Learn'' that took the class to the Sierras in September for 10 days of backpacking.
On Monday morning, 20 students arrived at Sea Scout Base, an old, one-story building on pylons above the water at Aquatic Park. Ed Cavanaugh, the teacher who founded the program, collected the students' cellphones to minimize distractions, then reviewed the day's schedule: sailing, working on essays and constructing a 15-foot boat that the group has already spent seven weeks building on the dock.
The class took a few minutes to settle, cracking jokes and laughing.
''Here's your chance,'' Mr. Cavanaugh said, cutting them off. ''If you're not going to do anything, you can leave now.''
The group got quiet.
''A week from today, we're launching this boat,'' Mr. Cavanaugh continued. ''Whether we're finished or not, we're putting it in the water. You guys know how to swim, so it shouldn't be a problem if it doesn't float.''
When the laughter subsided, Mr. Cavanaugh drew the students' attention to a board that displayed the day's tide schedule and a quote from Lady Bird Johnson: ''Children are likely to live up to what you believe of them.''
''What do you think it means?'' he asked the class.
''Tell your children they're going to make it,'' 17-year-old Jesus said. ''If you mentally abuse them, they're going to fail.''
On the dock, Vahn, a 16-year-old, used a carpenter's plane to smooth a plank on the unfinished boat. ''My last school was crowded and loud and we just worked with books,'' he said. ''This is way better than that.''
Mr. Cavanaugh said he related to some of the students' aversion to traditional classroom learning.
''I'm certainly more engaged when I'm building something,'' he said. ''I'm not trying to make backpackers or boat builders out of them, just to show them that there are applications to the academics. We use boating to teach physics.''
Still, he said, some students will not come to school no matter how engaging or creative the curriculum.
''Some are pregnant, some are in prison,'' he said, standing on the dock and watching the fog burn off over the bay. ''If this is too much to ask, forget sitting in rows for six class periods.''

HEADLINE: European Leaders Look to I.M.F. for Assistance, Again, as Euro Crisis Lingers

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY and STEVEN ERLANGER; Annie Lowrey reported from Washington, and Steven Erlanger from Paris.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- European leaders are looking outside the Continent for help solving the longstanding crisis over the euro, but while the International Monetary Fund may be able to help, it will not be the magic wand they seek.
The fund may be asked to assist further as leaders of the 17 European Union nations that use the euro meet to prepare for a summit meeting on Thursday and Friday. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France are scheduled to hold talks in Paris on Monday, and, at the request of President Obama, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner is meeting with European leaders later in the week.
European Union leaders have already turned to the I.M.F. to assist smaller nations like Ireland, Greece and Portugal. In all three, the fund is providing about a third of the necessary loans and its expertise in guiding countries with solvency problems back to recovery. Last month, at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Cannes, the fund was also asked to monitor the economic, fiscal and structural reforms in huge and shaky Italy -- not as a lender, at least not yet, but rather to lend its skills and credibility to the efforts of the new prime minister, Mario Monti, a technocrat. 
The I.M.F. lacks the resources to create the much-discussed ''firewall'' to keep interest rates at sustainable levels for troubled euro zone economies. Italy and Spain together have total debts of more than $3.3 trillion, with Italy about to roll over $276 billion in debt over in the next six months and Spain about $150 billion. Just those two rollovers would wipe out the amount the fund has available to lend worldwide, about $400 billion.
European policy makers are looking to the fund to help ensure budgetary restraint while perhaps also serving as a vehicle for financing. The I.M.F. could raise or contribute its own money, or channel money from countries with surpluses, like China.
A senior Treasury official said that the I.M.F. might provide ''additional, spare-tire capacity'' by contributing some financing, but that Europe would primarily use its own resources to wrestle down interest rates and keep countries like Spain solvent.
''Europe is rich enough. It is not in net deficit, when you balance out all of the trade deficits and surpluses,'' says Raghuram Rajan, a professor at the University of Chicago and former chief economist at the I.M.F. ''What Europe needs right now is money that is willing to absorb losses -- and the I.M.F. is not going to provide the money that absorbs losses.''
Analysts say that Europe will need to provide the bulk of that money itself: through the European Central Bank; the European bailout fund, called the European Financial Stability Facility; or transfers from fiscally sound countries like Germany.
Consideration of how to use I.M.F. resources and expertise started in earnest at the Cannes summit meeting in early November. Finance ministers were ordered to develop plans for ''deploying a range of various options'' for the fund to help bring down borrowing costs.
Some of the options appear to be more likely than others. One is a plan to have euro zone central banks lend money to the I.M.F. The fund could then provide lines of credit to countries struggling to finance their debts, and could participate in fiscal monitoring.
That plan is gaining support in Europe. ''It is an easy solution because bilateral loans are coming from the central banks,'' said Herman Van Rompuy, the European Union president, on Thursday, according to Bloomberg News. ''They haven't to ask for money from the taxpayer.''
A second plan under discussion would have the I.M.F. create new special drawing rights to grant to member countries. Countries hold the special drawing rights -- an i.o.u. with a value based on a basket of major currencies -- as reserves and can tap them in case of an emergency. The measure would be marginal and supplementary, given that the special drawing rights would be apportioned to members according to their contributions to the I.M.F. But by assuring investors that countries have the capacity to repay all loans, such additional special drawing rights could push down borrowing rates.
American agreement is necessary to increase I.M.F. funds, and in private conversations Treasury officials have ruled out that measure for now. Further, Mr. Obama is considered highly unlikely to ask Congress for extra money to bail out Europe, especially in an election year.
All the options under consideration are founded on the fund's reputation for helping countries, albeit sometimes painfully, return to fiscal health and manage short-term liquidity crises.
The fund ''brings money to the table,'' says Edwin M. Truman, a former Treasury official and now at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''But it also brings credibility. The fund has been in the business of creating lending programs for decades. It has a reputation for being tough and unbiased.''
Some watchers wonder why the I.M.F. should be involved in aiding such rich countries at all.
''This is a European problem, and there is no strong rationale for I.M.F. lending,'' said Simon Johnson, a former I.M.F. chief economist who also contributes to a New York Times blog, Economix. ''Europe has lots of money and no balance of payments problem. The euro is a reserve currency. The Germans can do a lot themselves, and the Germans and the E.C.B. can do everything the I.M.F. can do.''
''There's no justification under the I.M.F.'s articles for the I.M.F. to get involved in Italy,'' said Andrew Hilton, director of the Center for the Study of Financial Innovation, in London, and a longtime fund watcher. He added that less-wealthy fund members, like Brazil, Argentina, Russia and India, would have legitimate complaints about bailing out more wealthy countries.
Still, further I.M.F. involvement seems very likely. In recent days, euro zone leaders have indicated support for a bolstered I.M.F. role in resolving the sovereign-debt crisis.
Luc Frieden, Luxembourg's finance minister, said the European bailout fund and the central bank did not have the capacity to ease the crisis alone. ''We have to do so together with the I.M.F. and with the E.C.B., within the framework of its independence,'' he told reporters at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers.

HEADLINE: Know What You're Protesting

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He is advising Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, in the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

 BODY:
''HOW do you feel about the walkout?''
I have been asked that question repeatedly over the last several weeks, and I think that I should answer it.
First, a bit of background.
I have been a professor of economics at Harvard for more than a quarter-century. Since 2005, one of my assignments has been to run Economics 10, the yearlong introductory course. About 750 undergraduates enroll every year, often making it the largest course on campus. I give some lectures, invite a few of my colleagues to do so as guests and oversee an army of graduate-student teaching fellows who run small sections.
On Nov. 2, a group of students staged a walkout of one of my lectures. In an open letter to me, the organizers said the action was meant ''to join a Boston-wide march protesting the corporatization of higher education as part of the global Occupy movement.'' They said that ''the biased nature of Economics 10 contributes to and symbolizes the increasing economic inequality in America.'' 
The university administration, which had heard about the planned protest, sent several police officers to sit in my class for the day as a precautionary measure. Luckily, they weren't needed.
Eight minutes into the lecture, about 5 to 10 percent of the class stood up and quietly left. Some other students who had taken the class in previous years then walked into the room as a counterprotest. I have been told that at least one of the students who walked out sneaked back in later: he wanted to support the protest but didn't want to miss the lecture. After a few minutes, I resumed the class as usual.
So how do I feel about it?
My first reaction was nostalgia. I went to college in the late 1970s, when the memory of the Vietnam War was still fresh and student activism was more common. Today's college students tend to be more focused on polishing their resumes than on campaigning for social reform. I applaud the protesters for thinking beyond their own parochial concerns and trying to make society a better place for everyone.
But my second reaction was sadness at how poorly informed the Harvard protesters seemed to be. As with much of the Occupy movement across the country, their complaints seemed to me to be a grab bag of anti-establishment platitudes without much hard-headed analysis or clear policy prescriptions. Ironically, the topic of the lecture that the protesters chose to boycott was economic inequality, including a discussion of recent trends and their causes.
The course I teach is a broad survey of mainstream economics. It includes ideas of many greats in the field, like Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Arthur Pigou, John Maynard Keynes and Milton Friedman. The material is similar to what you'd learn at most other universities.
Many Harvard students recognize this. An editorial in the student newspaper, The Harvard Crimson, said: ''The truth is that Ec 10, a requirement for economics concentrators, provides a necessary academic grounding for the study of economics as a social science. Professor Mankiw's curriculum sticks to the basics of economic theory without straying into partisan debate.''
Perhaps the protesters were motivated by an inchoate feeling that standard economic theory is inherently slanted toward a conservative world view. If so, they would be following a long tradition.
As a student, I took my first economics course using Paul Samuelson's famous textbook. For the second half of the 20th century, it was a leading text for introductory economics. It offered many millions of students around the world their first and often only look at the subject.
Professor Samuelson's own politics were decidedly left of center, but that did not prevent him from being attacked by those even further left. A two-volume critique of his book, called ''Anti-Samuelson,'' was published in 1977. (It was condensed from the original four-volume German edition.) Written by Marc Linder, now a professor of labor law at the University of Iowa, it aimed to provide a Marxian counterpoint to the standard economics of the day. Professor Linder focused on the Samuelson book not because he thought it was particularly egregious but because it was a prominent representation of mainstream economic thought.
I don't claim to be an economist of Paul Samuelson's stature. (Probably no one alive can.) But like him, I have written a textbook that has introduced millions of students to the mainstream economics of today. If my profession is slanted toward any particular world view, I am as guilty as anyone for perpetuating the problem.
Yet, like most economists, I don't view the study of economics as laden with ideology. Most of us agree with Keynes, who said: ''The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique for thinking, which helps the possessor to draw correct conclusions.''
That is not to say that economists understand everything. The recent financial crisis, economic downturn and meager recovery are vivid reminders that we still have much to learn. Widening economic inequality is a real and troubling phenomenon, albeit one without an obvious explanation or easy solution. A prerequisite for being a good economist is an ample dose of humility.
My fervent hope is that any students who are still protesting the class will return -- and that, while recognizing our limitations, they will learn from us what they can. A few might choose to become economic researchers themselves. Their contributions will surely be welcome. They might even improve the next generation of textbooks.

HEADLINE: Higher Loan Limits, Again, for Pricey Markets

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
LESS than two months after lowering the maximum loan amount that could be backed by the Federal Housing Administration, lawmakers in Washington reversed course just before the Thanksgiving holiday and once again raised that limit, offering home buyers more financing options in a tight credit market.
Under the new guidelines, the F.H.A. would be able to back loans up to $729,750 for the next two years in the nation's most expensive real estate markets, including New York City and the surrounding metropolitan area. 
Before the change, according to rules that went into effect on Oct. 1, the maximum loan the F.H.A., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could back was $625,500. Congress decided to leave the lower loan ceilings for the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac untouched.
Last year, there were 1,541 loans from $625,500 to $729,750 issued in New York City, all backed by the federal government, according to data analyzed by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University. Fannie and Freddie accounted for the vast majority, with about 11 percent insured by the housing administration. Private lenders underwrote 1,737 loans above $729,750 with no federal backing.
The F.H.A. does not issue loans but instead offers private lenders guarantees against homeowner default. In 2006, the agency backed about 5 percent of the nation's mortgages. In 2010, it insured a third of all loans. It backs loans in which down payments can be as low as 3.5 percent of the cost of the home.
Loans backed by the F.H.A. cannot be used to buy a co-op, according to the administration's Web site. Condominiums need to obtain certification to be eligible, and in New York many have done that to broaden the pool of eligible buyers.
Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, which lobbied to have the loan limits raised, said it was good news for potential buyers across the city.
''We are thrilled that it is a two-year extension,'' he said, describing the move as a recognition that the housing market still needed help. Had Congress not raised the limits, he said, ''it would have been a disaster.''
If the lower limits had remained in place, private lenders would have needed to greatly increase the number of jumbo loans they backed, to make up for those no longer secured by federal agencies.
It remains to be seen if buyers will turn to the F.H.A. or whether private lenders will step back into the market, but the move ensures that the role of the F.H.A. is likely to grow in coming years.
Mark A. Willis, a research fellow at the Furman Center who helped analyze the data, said he was concerned that the private sector was not ready to increase lending so substantially, and that this reluctance would have made financing even harder to get. ''Given the fragility of the housing market in general,'' he said, ''we worried that this might not be the best time to start pulling back government involvement.''
Beyond the specific question of loan limits, the question at the heart of the debate concerns the role the federal government should play in the mortgage market. About 90 percent of loans issued in the country are backed by the federal government.
While the growth of Fannie and Freddie has been well documented, the F.H.A., which traditionally helped first-time buyers or those with low to moderate income, has also greatly expanded its purview in recent years. There is broad agreement in Washington that the federal government should eventually have a smaller footprint in the mortgage market, but the question is how fast it can pull back without hurting the housing market.
The loan limits were increased in 2008 in direct response to the collapse of the housing market and the credit crisis. The Obama administration, in a position paper on the housing market released this fall, argued that lower loan limits would mean that ''larger loans for more expensive homes will once again be funded only through the private market.''
But many in the real estate industry feared that with the private market not ready to fill the void, loans would be harder to get and home prices further depressed. They lobbied vigorously to reverse the lower loan limits.
The National Association of Realtors, which opposed lowering the limits, spent $17.6 million lobbying Congress last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

HEADLINE: Ruffalo Embraces a Role Closer to Home

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
CALLICOON, N.Y.
STROLLING by restaurants and antiques stores on a quiet Main Street the day after Thanksgiving, Mark Ruffalo waved hello to a girl in the back of a passing S.U.V. and greeted friends on the sidewalk who were eager to introduce visiting relatives.
Mr. Ruffalo, the actor known for indie hits like ''The Kids Are All Right'' and ''You Can Count on Me,'' has lived in this sleepy Catskills burg on the Delaware River for three years now, settled into a routine focused on raising three children with his wife, the actress Sunrise Coigney, on a former dairy farm with a 2,500-square-foot house, a barn and a pond.
''There's always a renovation going on,'' he said, describing one way he keeps busy when he's not filming on location elsewhere. ''My pond is kind of Grand Central for the families in the summer.''
Then, crossing a bridge above the river's crystalline waters, Mr. Ruffalo the affable neighbor suddenly metamorphosed into the other Mr. Ruffalo: the celebrity figure for the movement against natural gas drilling in New York State. 
''This is the cleanest river in the United States, and if they go through with this, it's going to be a massive industrialization of New York,'' he said vehemently. ''People have no idea what they're in for.''
Not surprisingly, Mr. Ruffalo has become something of a polarizing force in this neck of rural New York, where a debate over plans for drilling has pitted neighbor against neighbor.
The land that he cherishes sits atop one of the richest natural gas fields in the world, the Marcellus Shale, and energy companies have scurried to negotiate leases with landowners in the expectation that New York State will begin issuing drilling permits next year.
Extracting the gas involves a controversial drilling process known as horizontal hydraulic fracturing, or hydrofracking, in which millions of gallons of water and chemicals are injected into the shale under high pressure.
Opponents like Mr. Ruffalo argue that the drilling could contaminate water wells, clog the roads with truck traffic and mar serene vistas. Supporters counter that fracking will revitalize economically depressed areas across the state.
William Graby, 58, a dairy farmer whose property is near Mr. Ruffalo's and jointly leads a group of local landowners who banded together to negotiate top price for the leases, said the risks of hydrofracking have been exaggerated. He flatly accuses the actor of ''trying to take away my property rights.''
''I can guarantee you that his bank account looks very different from the rest of us,'' he said. ''We need industry and jobs so we can send our kids to college.'' Mr. Ruffalo has tried to persuade some neighbors into joining his cause but has mostly been rebuffed, Mr. Graby added.
The actor, 44, said he is thinking of his children, too. ''I'm not going to allow my kids to be contaminated by gas drilling,'' he said. As much as Mr. Ruffalo wants his son, 10, and daughters, 6 and 4, to grow up in a place where no one ever asks them ''how much my movies are grossing,'' he said, he would contemplate moving away if the state green-lights the drilling.
So, as energy companies pour millions of dollars into television ads and into lobbying the state government to approve the drilling, promoting fracking as a source of tax revenues and jobs, Mr. Ruffalo is hopping around the state, using his A-list status to campaign for a ban on hydrofracking in New York.
Mr. Ruffalo has raised money for elected officials opposed to fracking, led Occupy Wall Street troops to public hearings in New York City and lobbied legislators in Albany and Washington for support. He enlisted actors like Ethan Hawke to make public service announcements and online videos about the potential dangers to tap water and started up his own Web site on the issue, waterdefense.org.
''Some of us work behind the scenes,'' said the actress Debra Winger, a fellow resident of Sullivan County and fracking foe who arrived here more than 20 years ago. ''Mark happens to be an energetic and wonderful speaker.''
Mr. Ruffalo, the eldest of four siblings reared near forest land in Wisconsin before the family moved to Virginia and, later, California, said he first fell in love with the Catskills region in the mid-1990s. Working on the Off Broadway version of ''This Is Our Youth,'' in which he played a laid-back college dropout, he decided to drive up and visit a friend in the area.
''I came and I could not believe I was in New York,'' the actor said. ''I could not believe that something so wide open could be so close.'' He put down $5,000 on a mouse-infested cabin and 27 acres, then sold it a few years later to finance his purchase of the 47-acre former dairy farm, visiting occasionally from Los Angeles.
A turning point came in 2008, when his younger brother, Scott, a hairdresser, was found shot in Beverly Hills in a still unsolved murder. ''You don't recover from that,'' Mr. Ruffalo said.
His career offered him little solace: he was hardly making ends meet with independent film work that took him away from his wife and children for months at a time, he said. So, he and Ms. Coigney decided to make the leap, moving here that year.
Then a funny thing happened. ''The Kids Are All Right,'' which he had wrapped up before leaving California, opened last year to rave reviews, drawing four Oscar nominations, including his own for best supporting actor. He describes his role in the film, an organic restaurant owner who is hunted down by his progeny years after he donates sperm to their lesbian mothers, as a homage to the ''sex appeal and charisma'' of his slain brother.
Today he is busier than ever. He just finished filming ''Thanks for Sharing'' with Gwyneth Paltrow, in which he plays a sex addict, and is preparing to shoot the heist film ''Now You See Me'' with Jesse Eisenberg next month and later the lead role in the movie adaptation of Larry Kramer's play ''The Normal Heart.'' And in an unusual detour, he has been cast as the Hulk in a superhero extravaganza, ''The Avengers,'' due out late next spring. But, true to his journeyman actor cred, Mr. Ruffalo showed up for a lunch interview in a local restaurant unaccompanied -- no publicist, no handler -- and scruffy in jeans and rolled-up sleeves, his hair tousled. ''People here don't care who I am,'' he said appreciatively as he ordered guacamole and potato chips.
Indeed, the people at the other two occupied tables in the restaurant paid him no notice as he spoke urgently about the need for an ambitious national energy policy that champions investment in solar and wind energy over ''extreme energy'' from fossil fuels.
Another fracking opponent, Victoria Lesser, a onetime wardrobe designer for entertainers like the Bee Gees who now runs an inn in the nearby hamlet North Branch, said that a drilling ban is a tough sell coming from ''outsiders'' like her and Mr. Ruffalo who were not born in the area. ''It's been a challenge,'' she conceded in an interview.
The two have held local anti-fracking fund-raisers and recently formed a group called Farmhearts to help struggling farmers find alternatives to leasing their land for drilling. ''The farmers sitting on the biggest pieces of land don't want to hear it,'' she said.
Noel van Swol, who presides over a landowners' group known as the Sullivan-Delaware Property Owners Association, minces no words. ''He's a carpetbagger,'' he said of Mr. Ruffalo. ''He has no real technical understanding of the issues involved in oil and gas drilling.''
By contrast, an audience of nearly 1,000 people gave Mr. Ruffalo a rock star's welcome Wednesday at a public hearing in Manhattan on the state's proposed fracking rules. Shouting into the microphone, ''We want renewable energy now!'' he drew a standing ovation.
''He's someone who has brought a great deal of attention to this issue,'' said Walter Hang, whose business, Toxic Targeting, compiles data on gas drilling and who has appeared on panels with the actor. ''Women love Mark Ruffalo. I've been at events where they just go nuts.''

DIABLO CODY
By Dave Itzkoff
There's a lot of the real-life Diablo Cody -- the Oscar-winning screenwriter of ''Juno'' who added the phrase ''honest to blog'' to the cultural parlance -- in her script for ''Young Adult,'' her latest collaboration with the director Jason Reitman. She may not suffer from writer's block like her protagonist, played by Charlize Theron, but, Cody says, ''everything else -- the bitterness, the drinking problem -- that's me.'' A scene in which Theron's character binges on KFC was particularly personal. ''If it had been me,'' Cody says, ''I would have gone 'method.' ''
THEY'RE FAMOUS ON THE INTERNET

Julieanne Smolinski, 28, is a former waitress, but on Twitter she's known as Boobs Radley, a name inspired by literature and puberty. With a stream of jokes that go out to her 45,000 followers, she enjoys modest fame as a writer: ''A waiter recognized me from my avatar and went, 'Boobs?' Maybe he was just reading the specials.''
SUBWAY FINES? HEJ DA!

Want to ride the subway in Stockholm but don't want to drop about $115 for a monthly pass? For $15 a month, a nonprofit group called Planka.nu (rough translation: free-ride.now) offers an insurance policy that will pay the $175 fine if you get caught. While the group thinks public transportation should be free, authorities definitely don't. They're spending millions of dollars to replace turnstiles with unhoppable glass panels. Undeterred, Planka.nu posted YouTube videos showing how to sneak through the new gates. The simplest method: follow closely behind a paying customer.

Although ''The Iliad'' and Psalms were sung to the lyre, music and poetry are now separate in the minds of most literary arbiters. Yet the critic Christopher Ricks contends that Bob Dylan's fine, surprising language establishes him as a poet, whatever his medium. Leonard Cohen, accepting the Prince of Asturias Award for Literature in October, clarified, ''Poetry comes from a place that no one commands.''
WASHINGTON MONUMENTS
F.D.R. IN 2012? WAIT A MINUTE ...
By Matt Bai
The Democratic Party is now selling T-shirts and tote bags with F.D.R.'s likeness emblazoned on them. Not that Roosevelt wasn't an awesome president, but there's more than enough 1930s nostalgia these days. Democrats keep talking about building more tunnels and bridges and the need for a second New Deal, while Republicans pine for prewar budgetary austerity. Maybe if we spent less time harking back to the last depression, we might come up with some truly modern ideas for preventing another one.
The disaster-obsessed often wonder: Isn't there an earthquake-proof box or robot suit I can buy to avert death in case of catastrophe? Enter the Noah capsule, a tsunami escape pod developed by Japanese company New Cosmopower. A cross between a Magic 8 Ball and a yellow submarine, the four-person pod features a small window and breathing vents. Do people really see themselves bouncing along in a tsunami-buoyed $3,900 bowling ball? Cosmo has already received orders for more than 600 pods.

If it's a cocktail dress, less is more. If there are a lot of embroideries, or if there are a lot of textures, keeping a fairly simple shape is great.

 BODY:
The purpose of a ''holiday'' magazine is, invariably, to talk about gifts: those we want, those we give, those we dream about in abstract and lustful ways. And this issue contains an extraordinary number of all of the above. Jane Herman and Ethel Park's selection of presents (Page 103) is as delightful and diverse as one could hope for. Their strategy for those on your list? Give a small bundle of items that, taken together, provide charming commentary on the personality of the giftee. They love canary yellow diamonds (hello, Rihanna!) with a crane-shaped bedside lamp, sandals for the beach with a jigsaw puzzle and stormproof matches (monsoon insurance!), local green eggs and Dutch eco magazines. It's an adorable and adult spin on a Christmas stocking. (In the course of their shopping, they unearthed and juxtaposed a vast number of cool items; visit our Web site for even more.) 
Of course, when we talk about gifts, we also look beyond the wrapping paper. There is the gift of great writing: we are delighted to share a part of Emmanuel Carrere's ''Lives Other Than My Own'' (Page 117), his meditation on loss in the wake of the Asian tsunami of 2004, and to publish Joan Juliet Buck's memoir of a Christmas spent in Venice, fitfully and miserably, with her parents and Peter O'Toole (Page 140). There is also the gift of discovery: Sebastian Kim and Jacob Brown's portfolio, on Page 147, of the breakout talents of 2011 (including Tyler, the Creator and Charlie Day) is terrific fun.
And then there is the gift of being in the company of extraordinary people. Viggo Mortensen and Tory Burch are two individuals I admire enormously. Mortensen, whom I have never met, reveals himself in Zoe Heller's profile (Page 170) to be thoughtful, elegant, moral, a late bloomer in Hollywood with a professional ethic and a sense of decency that could seem tedious if he wasn't so disarmingly clever. Burch, whom I do know, has a clarity of mind and an unflappable kindness, both at home with her children and when running her 1,200-employee fashion brand, that are riveting and incapable of replication (see Daphne Merkin's profile on Page 184). What I take away from both these stories is how valuable work is to both these people -- not just their own labor, mind you, but for their teams and collaborators.
The value of a job is something very much on the mind of D W Gibson, a young writer who has undertaken to compile an oral history of unemployed Americans, 2007 to the present. It's his rethink of Studs Terkel's seminal study from 1974. In this issue he discusses the project (Page 124) and his own status as a demi-employed freelancer married to a small-business owner. It is so tempting when we think about gifts and holidays and all the fluffery associated with this time of year to believe that leisure is the greatest present, that thing we dream about in abstract and lustful ways. But I think we know otherwise: what we are reminded of by Gibson is that jobs, good jobs, are the greatest gifts we can give and receive. Postcards from the edge:

HEADLINE: From Indie Record Stores, Holiday Gift Thoughts

BYLINE: By ANDY LANGER. 
Andy Langer is the music columnist for Esquire and the afternoon D.J. at KGSR in Austin.

 BODY:
Last month, more than 60 independent record stores across Texas kicked off the holiday shopping season with a Black Friday edition of Record Store Day, an annual promotion that features special vinyl and CD releases made exclusively for mom-and-pop record stores. It is intended to bring shoppers back to independent record stores, which offer human interaction between customers and clerks that often results in the discovery of a new favorite album. Better still, what makes small record stores different is their emphasis on selling locally produced music.
We asked representatives from three independent record stores in Texas to recommend recent releases from local artists. 
JOHN T. KUNZ, OWNER
WATERLOO RECORDS, AUSTIN
Hayes Carll, ''KMAG YOYO (& other American stories)'' (Lost Highway Records)
Last year, the Americana Music Association named Mr. Carll, an Austin-based singer-songwriter, the new/emerging artist of the year. His second national release, titled after an unprintable military acronym, landed him on ''The Tonight Show'' and at the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival.
''I love the sense of humor in his songs,'' Mr. Kunz said. ''And humor, especially the self-deprecating kind, is part of the singer-songwriter tradition in Texas. But he's also very politically aware -- from the title track's take on war and national security to 'Another Like You,' a wry, John Prine-style duet between politically opposed lovers. The whole thing is really a huge leap forward for a guy I think we're going to be listening to for a long time to come.''
Sarah Jarosz, ''Follow Me Down'' (Sugar Hill Records)
Ms. Jarosz, a 20-year-old Wimberley native, recorded her second set for Sugar Hill Records by flying to Nashville on weekends and holiday breaks from the New England Conservatory in Boston, where she is studying contemporary music improvisation. A who's who of the acoustic music world -- from Bela Fleck and Jerry Douglas to Shawn Colvin and the Punch Brothers -- contributed to the album.
''Her comfort zone keeps widening as she soaks up new influences,'' Mr. Kunz said. ''She's got this angelic, plaintive voice that marries so well to her songwriting. And while she comes from a very traditional folk and bluegrass tradition and is so adept with those instruments, on this record she shows a great pop sensibility too. And then she'll pull out a Radiohead cover.''
ED SWIENCKI, BUYER
FOREVER YOUNG RECORDS, GRAND PRAIRIE
Kirk Franklin, ''Hello Fear'' (GospoCentric Records)
In March, the Fort Worth native and Arlington resident's 11th album debuted at the top of Billboard's Gospel sales chart. Earlier this week, the set was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Gospel Album and Best Gospel Song.
''Especially for a huge star, Kirk makes records remarkably free of ego,'' Mr. Swiencki said. ''It's not about him, it's about delivering the message. He comes at it from a very contemporary place, but he's also respectful of the gospel tradition.''
Carl Marshall, ''Grown Folks Love to Dance!'' (CDS Records)
A journeyman soul singer and producer, Mr. Marshall cut his teeth in the New Orleans band Sam & the Soul Machine alongside Aaron Neville and Sam Henry. Building on the regional success of ''Grown Folks Love to Dance,'' Mr. Marshall quickly followed with his second release of 2011, ''Songs People Love the Most Volume 2.''
''I think people listen because he's like talking to one of your friends,'' Mr. Swiencki said. ''It's very straightforward and easy for people to connect to. It's a very down-home kind of affair.''
THOMAS ESCALANTE, OWNER
SIG'S LAGOON, HOUSTON
Los Skarnales, ''Dale Shine!'' (self-released)
Although its name loosely translates to ''brothers of ska,'' this veteran Houston act has grown into a bilingual, horn-driven musical melting pot that rarely covers the same musical territory twice. On its first record in six years, the band integrates another influence into its repertory: New Orleans-style funk and rock.
''They're meshing everything from ska to rockabilly and from cumbia to mambo, but by now it's really their own sound,'' Mr. Escalante said. ''And because they're a band known primarily for the craziness of their live show, capturing that spirit in a studio can be tough. But I think this time they really nailed it. It's a party record that stands on its own but also has a certain undeniable live energy to it.''
Thunderado, ''All Time Gone'' (self-released)
Led by Hunter Perrin, whose day job, until recently, was playing guitar in John Fogerty's touring band, this Houston trio plays so economically that its second album features 11 songs in just 30 minutes.
''They're known primarily here in Houston, because Hunter's gig with Fogerty made it tough to tour with Thunderado, but I feel like there's something here capable of reaching a much wider audience,'' Mr. Escalante said. ''Like a lot of the bands that play at the club next door to our shop, the Continental Club, there's a certain swampy Gulf Coast element to what they do, but there's also bits of surf and rockabilly. When I put it on in the store, it's an easy sell.''

BYLINE: By STEVEN HELLER

 BODY:
These are indeed happy holidays for film-title fans like me, who have spent sleepless nights anticipating the arrival of SAUL BASS: A Life in Film and Design (Laurence King, $75), by Jennifer Bass and Pat Kirkham. Weighing in at 424 pages, with a foreword by Martin Scorsese, this collection is gratifyingly complete. It ought to be: Jennifer Bass is Saul Bass's daughter, and she has unlimited access to the treasures of his archive.
Even if you don't know Bass's name, you have doubtless seen his work, which spanned more than 50 years and included title sequences for films like ''North by Northwest,'' ''The Man With the Golden Arm,'' ''Ocean's Eleven'' and ''Spartacus''; movie posters for ''Exodus,'' ''Vertigo,'' ''The Shining'' and ''Schindler's List''; corporate identities for Exxon, Minolta, the Girl Scouts and the Bell System; as well as scores of packages, advertisements and more. Oh, I almost forgot -- in addition to designing the main titles for Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' Bass also came up with the quick-cut shower sequence in which Janet Leigh meets her historic cinematic demise. 
Bass, who died in 1996 at 75, was one of America's most prodigious midcentury modern graphic designers and the pioneer of motion design, which would be enough on its own to earn him a lofty place in the annals of pop culture. Yet movie titles and advertisements were not his only strengths; working with his wife, Elaine, he also designed, directed and shot mini movies-within-movies that could almost stand on their own. (And other work sometimes did: his short film ''Why Man Creates,'' commissioned by Kaiser Aluminum, won the 1968 Oscar for best documentary short.)
As a visual consultant on ''West Side Story'' (1961), Bass designed the prologue sequence that accompanies Leonard Bernstein's overture. Maybe you remember it: ''Brilliant, saturated hues slowly change color over a single delicate drawing,'' Kirkham writes. Gradually, the drawing solidifies and we recognize that we've been watching the tip of Manhattan from the air. Bass directed the aerial photography high above the city, ''finally zooming down in one seamless take to the teeming streets.'' (Before Google Earth!) Kirkham captures Bass's exquisite big-screen image ballets: ''In the stylized language of dance, the audience is introduced to rival gangs, the Sharks and the Jets, as they contest and defend their turf.''
One of Bass's most recognizable designs is the graphic identity he created for Otto Preminger's ''Anatomy of a Murder,'' showing an expressionistic illustration -- part childlike image, part forensic diagram -- of a carved-up corpse. A very different masterpiece is his carnivalesque animated epilogue for ''Around the World in 80 Days,'' as cheerful as ''Anatomy'' is dark. These were designed to get audiences ''in the mood'' of the picture, as Bass put it, and to create ''an atmosphere, an attitude and a generalized metaphor for what the film was about.''
Some of the lesser-known films included here reveal Bass's diverse stylistic approaches. For the title sequence of a World War II drama, ''Attack!'' (1956), he showed a montage of relaxing soldiers abruptly interrupted by a scene of 16 men being slaughtered. It is, strange to say, a rare treat, thanks to its superb graphic intelligence. After the massacre, the titles commence with the camera following a dead soldier's helmet as it rolls down a hill. It stops in front of a solitary daffodil and fades slowly into the circular mouth of a loudspeaker playing swing music. ''Saul's stylish sequence uses the beat to focus on close-ups of men walking, eating, stamping their feet, sitting on steps and warming their hands over a brazier,'' Kirkham explains. The sequence closes with a reprise of the loudspeaker.
Another surprise is the sequence for the little-known -- to me, anyway -- western ''Cowboy'' (1958), starring Jack Lemmon and Glenn Ford. Bass tried to ''recapture the flavor, the excitement and the rich humor'' of the Old West, he said, ''by the use of the typical pen-and-ink line drawings and typography of the time.'' Yet rather than falling back on the sepia pastiche typical of Hollywood westerns, Bass's titles are contemporary and colorful. A designer-alchemist, Bass could make old elements new, and use modern graphics to evoke any time period.
A book devoted exclusively to Bass's film work would have satisfied any fan (and would have weighed a bit less, too). But ''Saul Bass: A Life in Film and Design'' is an encompassing professional monograph that also covers his poster designs and corporate trademark campaigns. Many of Bass's logos are still used, or at least imitated, as in the AT&T emblem he designed that ushered in a trend of scan lines on globes. However, where Bass's film work is imbued with his passion for visual storytelling, the corporate work, though effective -- and better than a lot of what's out there -- mostly lacks his personal spark. Mostly, but not entirely: if you want to see sparks, take a look at his playful series of matchbooks for Ohio Blue Tip. They're reminiscent of his most rollicking title sequences.
The only thing missing from this brick of a book is a cleareyed appraisal of Bass's work. His reputation could certainly withstand it, but Jennifer Bass's intimate connection to the material may have made any objective critique impossible. Nonetheless, Kirkham's narrative and the informative comments by Saul Bass and his colleagues provide an essential portrait of a designer who successfully balanced art and commerce, and who remains an influence on contemporary graphic and motion design.
Another major influence on postwar graphic design grew out of a grass-roots mash-up of workers and students that paralyzed a city. No, it was not the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations in New York, but the May 1968 Paris ''revolution'' that ''almost drove President Charles de Gaulle out of office,'' as Johan Kugelberg notes in his introduction to BEAUTY IS IN THE STREET: A Visual Record of the May '68 Paris Uprising (Four Corners, $40), edited by Kugelberg with Philippe Vermes. The events ''were not premeditated by left-wing intellectuals; they weren't planned by trade unions or by the Communist Party,'' he adds. ''They can rather be described as the greatest wildcat strike in history. Everyday people witnessed how the Parisian students were treated by the cops, and reacted. At its peak, millions of Frenchmen were on strike.''
Unlike the Occupy Wall Street movement, which has yet to find a coherent graphic identity, May '68 was ''illustrated'' by distinctive ad hoc lithographs and silk-screen prints posted throughout Paris with slogans and images (many picturing the helmeted national police and a comic de Gaulle) devised by an assortment of painters and graphic artists under the umbrella Atelier Populaire. One founder of the Atelier was Kugelberg's co-editor Philippe Vermes, who recalls gravitating to the amphitheater of Censier University, near the Sorbonne. ''I wanted to join in,'' he writes, ''be a part of a growing student movement.'' With the Comite des greves des Beaux Arts, he occupied the school's painting and lithography studios, and on May 14 they printed the first poster ''to express in a nutshell the determination to connect students and workers.'' The posters, hung ''under the cover of night,'' became the single most effective method of reaching the public. ''Parisians would wake up the following morning and see the issues at hand. The posters, as common as popcorn, were everywhere for everyone.''
This was not a peaceful revolution. Many demonstrators were badly beaten by the police. In response, art was not just a metaphoric weapon. It had real impact, as this translated line of graffiti suggests: ''The most beautiful sculpture is the sandstone paving stone, the heavy, cube-shaped paving stone is the one that we throw in the face of the cops.'' The ubiquity of the graphics made the Atelier a chief target of the authorities. ''We feared a police bust at the Atelier Populaire, and they did finally come on June 27,'' Vermes writes. ''There was no resistance; we took our paper, our paint and our press with us and walked out. The police had expected to seize a big printing press; they didn't realize that we had carried out our tools for poster making with us.''
Over the years many books large and small have sampled the Atelier's output. Today the entire collection is at the Bibliotheque Nationale on Rue de Richelieu. But ''Beauty Is in the Street'' (its title comes from a poster) is a fairly complete catalog of the posters, with contextual photographs and documents from the period, some of which have rarely if ever been seen since 1968. Ironically, despite the fact that most of these posters are anonymous, and that all were made in the ''service of the struggle,'' the editors note that ''every effort has been made to secure copyright approval.'' Even protest posters for the people are copyright protected. Vive la revolution!
Street demonstrations of a joyful kind met the demise of Communist rule in Poland, which also signaled the end of the cold war. Yet not everything during the dreary years of authoritarian power was without visual merit. Poland was home to some of the most talented and imaginative poster artists in the world, who circumvented censorship through clever double entendres. And in POLISH COLD WAR NEON (Mark Batty, $55), by Ilona Karwinska, we are introduced to a legacy of luminescent advertising design that might have vanished unnoticed if not for the author's vibrant documentary photographs.
Karwinska spent more than five years chronicling the repair and disrepair of neon signs throughout Poland, from Bialystok to Warsaw. ''Was it the unique typefaces, symbols and craftsmanship,'' she asks, ''or was it the evident neglect and decay that prompted me to document and ultimately try to preserve these signs?'' According to an informative introductory essay by the design historian David Crowley, the neon signs that sprang up in Poland in the 1960s and '70s were ''part of international attempts to reconcile socialism and consumerism . . . a radiant 'You are here.' ''
When turgid Socialist Realism was abandoned in the late 1950s, planners in the Eastern bloc looked for ways (usually inexpensive ways) to revitalize socialist cities. ''Neon, it was claimed, would bestow lightness and grace upon the existing urban fabric and would anticipate the glittering glass and steel towers that modernist architects -- under the spell of Mies van der Rohe -- were then projecting as the future,'' Crowley writes. However, by the end of the 1970s the Polish economy was stuck in Communist mire and the nation was bankrupt. With living costs on the rise, keeping neon lighted became a luxury. During martial law (1981-83), the last gasp of Communist authority, ''most of Poland's neon signs were switched off,'' Crowley says, ''their cold tubes becoming melancholic signs of conflict.'' Today, as Karwinska documents, many lights are still off, while others are glowing, suggesting the set of one of those cold war movies whose smart art direction gives them so much voyeuristic appeal.
Neon may have brightened up Communist streets, but vibrant advertising was de rigueur in capitalist precincts. From the mid-19th century, when color printing became economical, retail businesses and manufacturers of all kinds used it to sell their goods. Few industries were as enthusiastic about color reproduction (particularly chromo/lithography, or ''printing in colors from stones'') as American cigar makers. The most prolific creator of cigar box labels was a family-owned printing company that changed names several times but was run by four successive generations of men named George Schlegel, who produced hundreds of cigar box labels, box trimmings, flaps and bands. Their immense output is featured in John Grossman's LABELING AMERICA: Popular Culture on Cigar Box Labels (Fox Chapel, $39.95).
The John and Carolyn Grossman Collection of chromo/lithography, housed at the Winterthur Museum in Delaware, includes 250,000 specimens of this early and often exquisite form of color printing -- the high-definition medium of its day. The Schlegel archive's original art, proofs, embossing dies and litho stones are abundantly represented in this splendidly printed book. But the art is not the only point of interest. The text offers a brief history of how graphic design evolved from a sideline of printing into an integral profession. Among the most popular promotional genres, cigar labeling expanded throughout the late 19th century. ''The popularity of cigars was big, but many of the cigar manufacturers were small,'' Grossman says of their inability to make custom labels. ''The lithographers responded by creating myriad stock designs and titles that could be ordered by number.'' Schlegel's line of ''sample labels'' began in the 1880s, and many shown in the book are unaffiliated with any particular manufacturer.
The art themes run the gamut from exotica (Monkey Brand) to erotica (Art Club, featuring a naked rump), from historical (Gettysburg) to hysterical (Tampa Fad, with a rooster smoking a cigar), from celebratorial (Mark Twain) to educational (Vassar Girl). Only a few are purely decorative. And some, like one titled ''Two Friends'' showing a woman shaking hands with a St. Bernard, are nonsensical. Yet all in all, they are amazing examples of commercial art.
For anyone interested in printing history or aesthetic ephemera, not to mention cigar box art, this is a jewel of a book. What is missing, though, is a sense of which of these sold the best and why. These days, that's called market research.
The anonymous artists who made cigar labels were skilled representationalists -- no surprise, since they worked before the vogue for abstraction. Today realism is just one more fashion, which can leave a Renaissance talent out in the cold.
That's exactly where Kurt Wenner often works. A former scientific illustrator for NASA, Wenner is a street artist par excellence, who draws amazing original works (and occasional reproductions) in chalk and pastel directly on the street. ASPHALT RENAISSANCE: The Pavement Art and 3-D Illusions of Kurt Wenner (Sterling Signature, paper, $24.95), by Wenner with B. Hansen and M. Hospodar, exhibits his sidewalk murals of classical compositions -- destined to be washed away by time and rain -- that might have put Michelangelo to shame (at least the church let him do his indoors).
Wenner, who learned perspective and dimension in Italy, is one of an increasingly popular breed of street performers who earn tips for their artistic labors. At least the bills are higher denominations these days, as Wenner is invited the world over to decorate various public spaces. ''It is interesting for me to see the way in which the different cultures perceive my work,'' he writes. ''In Europe and the United States, the impermanence of street painting is foremost in the public's mind. . . . To Eastern minds, the impermanence of street painting is completely natural, even unremarkable. They are most fascinated by the drawing style itself, which is very exotic and intriguing to them.''
''Asphalt Renaissance'' is an art book, with startling color photos of the work in situ, often with observers standing around providing context. But it is also a process book. Although Wenner's own comments are sometimes inspiring and the text is enlightening (''The invention of an entirely new form of perspective was born out of Wenner's need to make an irrefutably original artistic statement within the context of classicism''), I could have done without the layout tricks, including photo captions in obtrusive color bars with faux chalk shadows. The monumentality of the work also begs for a larger format than this. But no book could be as incredible as Wenner's live work, which would be difficult to reproduce under any circumstances.
If Wenner's approach offers one alternative to abstraction, another is data visualization, or ''viz'' -- the gathering of complicated information into readable graphics. (Think of a subway map, or a pie chart.) ''Visualizations of complex data sets can also function as art,'' Lev Manovich notes in his foreword to Manuel Lima's VISUAL COMPLEXITY: Mapping Patterns of Information (Princeton Architectural Press, $50), another in a line of books showing examples of artful data viz used to ''communicate a concern, rather than to show data,'' as the computer scientist Robert Kosara put it at a conference a few years ago. How, Manovich writes, do you ''ask interesting questions about society through its data traces? This is a new opportunity, responsibility and challenge for contemporary artists.''
''Visual Complexity'' is a showcase for the intersection of art, design and science. The field has flourished thanks to computer science and Web dissemination, and has become an art and design trend. It's not for everyone, but if you ever studied Venn diagrams in elementary school, you've engaged in primitive data visualization. Lima has taken this fundamental idea of connectedness, found in those overlapping circles, and expanded it to the visualization of networks.
The book is a kind of manifesto, making the case for (as Lima writes) ''a new network-based outlook on the world, one that is based on diversity, decentralization and nonlinearity.'' Cynics may look at Mariona Ortiz's ''Indie in the 1990s'' -- a circular map using solid and dotted lines to track collaborations in the music scene -- and see an organization chart run amok, but it's actually a pretty fascinating way to perceive the connectedness of things. Of course, if you're convinced that there's too much information in the world and that design can't make it more comprehensible, then Chris Harrison's ''WikiViz'' (which seeks to detail ''the linking structure of Wikipedia,'' but looks more like a dropped jar of iron filings) might make your head explode.
Some of the examples are indeed silly. Some are profound. Many are decidedly beautiful. And all are fascinating, given the infinite kinds of data that can be visualized. Frankly, I'd be happy if somebody devised a map showing me how to network my TV remote to everything else in my home.

HEADLINE: Cities Beyond The Law

BYLINE: By STEVE INSKEEP. 
A host of NPR's ''Morning Edition'' and the author of ''Instant City: Life and Death in Karachi.''

 BODY:
Washington
NOTHING clarifies your thoughts on the role of government quite so much as visiting a place that isn't governed.
I once visited such a place under construction in Karachi, Pakistan. A developer was building small concrete row houses on land he didn't own. Electricity came from cables illegally hooked to the nearest power lines. Drinking water came not from plumbing but from delivery trucks. And the children told me they were not attending any school. The nearest thing to the rule of law were the police officers, who collected bribes to pretend that the neighborhood didn't exist.
Millions of people in the developing world live in communities like this, without security, infrastructure or other tangible evidence of the state. Such ungoverned zones have spread in many cities as the world's urban population has exploded. They are not strictly a result of population growth, but rather of the failure to manage its consequences. 
Nor are they strictly a product of poverty. Rising prosperity has actually accelerated their growth. The millions who migrate to cities in search of better jobs, schools and health care are making a reasonable bet. Growing cities are closely linked to the global economy, and they create their own opportunities as people demand more goods and services.
The trouble is that people are overwhelming the capacity and infrastructure of the state, even in rising economic powers like India and China.
New York once had its own ungoverned zones. But many decades of investment in infrastructure, education and policing slowly eased the city's problems. Today's rapidly growing cities face even greater challenges.
Karachi, Pakistan's largest metropolis, has grown so quickly since the country gained independence in 1947 -- to more than 13 million people, from about 400,000 -- that it has become almost unrecognizable.
No single political ideology created Karachi's ungoverned zones. Rather, they were spawned by decades of spastic government. National leaders veered from socialism to crony capitalism, from democracy to dictatorship. They made great plans and then lost interest, or lost their jobs, as aid from the United States came and went.
In 1958, Gen. Ayub Khan took control of Pakistan in a military coup. Fearing riots, one of his first priorities was moving people out of central Karachi's informal neighborhoods -- where many lived in appalling conditions in shacks or tents.
With American help, the dictator brought in Constantinos Doxiadis, then one of the world's leading city planners. He designed sprawling new suburbs with subsidized homes along broad streets, intending to resettle half a million people -- the rough equivalent of moving almost all of Washington's population to a new location outside town.
During the construction, in 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower visited Pakistan and was flown over the new suburb of Korangi in a helicopter, as children stood in lines below to spell out, ''I Like Ike.''
Pakistan's government soon turned its attention to other projects, however, and the suburban construction drive fell apart. New suburbanites were building unauthorized homes much like the inner-city hovels from which the state had evicted them.
Today, informal settlement has become an industry spread over hundreds of square miles surrounding Karachi. Politically connected developers seize sections of government land and subdivide them into lots for new homes -- as many as 100,000 per year.
Some are sprawling South Asian McMansions. Most are tiny row houses, where poor residents are left to dig their own sewers and steal electricity. The police have worked out a standard payoff to look the other way. In 2010, the going bribe was 5,000 rupees per lot, about $57.
But there are consequences to moving the real estate market beyond the law. Greed and emotions run high. Land battles contribute to gunfights between Karachi's political parties -- shootouts that kill far more people than terrorism does.
Violence disrupts what few government services are available in some areas. At an empty school I visited in October, the writing on the chalkboard showed that no teacher had been there since May 31. The teachers came from outside the neighborhood, and local gunfights made the commute too risky.
Walking past the stacked and dusty desks, and chatting with neighborhood boys who are supposed to attend class there, makes you realize the value of simple, stable, boring governance that maintains basic law and order.
When governments turn instead to dreamy plans, ideological warfare or corruption, they make themselves irrelevant. As Nazim Haji, a Karachi businessman, put it, ''We're not a poor country. We're a poorly managed country.''
INCREASING wealth has allowed some people to insulate themselves from collapsing urban infrastructure. In Karachi, affluent families have hired private security guards, or bought generators to deal with daily electric blackouts. But it's not easy to ward off the effects of a corroding public sector.
Last year I went looking for that Karachi suburb from the late 1950s, where kids had stood looking up at Eisenhower in his helicopter.
A friend helped me find one of the original houses in Korangi, and the elderly woman who was its first resident. But the old broad street had become barely wide enough for a single car. Longtime residents told me they had built new and bigger houses over the years. One had a redbrick front, a bay window and a second-floor balcony.
People made room for the larger houses by moving the front walls forward to capture part of the street for themselves. And something else was happening: Residents said the narrow road was rising. Garbage was often left on the street, which also flooded during monsoon season, and the nearby drain was clogged. Sediment had built up.
Residents said the floor of the old woman's house from the 1950s had once been above ground, but was now about two feet below. She'd piled up a little dam of rocks in front of the door in hopes of keeping out the annual rains. Of course residents had built their newer homes even higher, but they said the street was still climbing.
Afterward, I thought of ancient cities like Babylon and Sirkap, a ruined city in northern Pakistan. There, a guide had shown me a hole where archaeologists digging many feet below ground had found the remnants of buildings long gone.
It had taken centuries for the city to rise, decline and disappear. I wondered if it had suffered from a failure to mind the public interest: cleaning the drains, picking up the garbage, respecting the rule of law. And I wondered if Karachi was now experiencing a high-speed version of the process that put that ancient city underground.

HEADLINE: Capote's Account of Failed Reinvention in the City

 BODY:
The Big City Book Club returned on Tuesday with a live online discussion of Truman Capote's 1958 novella, ''Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' Ginia Bellafante, the Big City columnist, debated the significance of Holly Golightly, the main character, with readers, as well as the relative merits of the book and the 1961 film adaptation starring Audrey Hepburn.
The club will meet again on Jan. 10 to discuss ''A Walker in the City,'' by Alfred Kazin. 
GINIA BELLAFANTE ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' is a magnificent, economical account of failed reinvention in a city where, needless to say, legions come and never ascend as high as their aspirations would have them go. The subject was one in which Capote had a visceral interest. His own mother, Lillie Mae Persons, fled the South and remade herself as Nina Capote, after marrying a Cuban businessman, but killed herself in 1954.
Holly is eaten up by the high life. Her failure is baroque. It was not enough for Capote to send her off to middle-class housewife existence. That, of course, would have been its own kind of tragedy, but Capote allows Holly to be banished by the force of her own hope. She is somewhere far away, still propelled by a wondrous, misguided optimism.
For decades readers and writers have speculated about the real Holly Golightly. Who was the inspiration? Was it Capote's mother? Gloria Vanderbilt? The beautiful New Yorker writer Maeve Brennan? Holly was all of those people, surely, and perhaps most significantly Capote himself.
So what do you all make of Holly Golightly? Is she a timeless representation of a certain kind of New York existence?
CHRISTIE, NEW YORK I am a young woman who has lived in NYC for five years. I read the book about three years ago and was thunderstruck by how different the book was than the movie -- and how much more interesting Holly's character was.
Many women of my generation idolize Holly Golightly and her world. Her gestalt has become shorthand for young women with a happy, kittenish sexuality, expensive tastes, and a sweet, innocent need to be loved. After I read the book, I began to see this as rather disturbing. Holly is a terrible role model -- I don't think she was ever meant to BE a role model -- and yet so many young women want to be like her, not despite her flaws, but BECAUSE of her flaws. Her flaws are considered sexy and artistic.
G.B. I couldn't agree more. Holly was not intended to be a role model. If anything, her story was intended to be a cautionary tale. Young women today do find her whimsy and moment-to-moment-ness really appealing. Is it because there is so much pressure for young women (for young people generally) to succeed today? Perhaps. Holly was content merely to let things happen.
JILL BOSSERT, BROOKLYN, NY I'm curious as to Capote's alleged desire to have Marilyn Monroe play Holly. I understand they were friends, so did he just want to give her a job? Holly was blond, in a way, but I can't quite see MM saying ''Quel rat!'' convincingly. Audrey Hepburn is more in Brennan's image, at least physically.
G.B. You can't see Marilyn saying ''Quel rat!'' in that whispery voice? Really? I can. Capote has described Holly as ''an American geisha.'' Marilyn obviously transmits that more easily than Hepburn. As a colleague of mine said recently, with Marilyn, the point would not have been missed.
It's hard to say that Hepburn was wrong for the role because her performance turned out to be so iconic. But the vulnerability she conveys is girlish. It seems at least likely that Monroe would have given a more pained performance and gotten at the depth of the character's vulnerability more effectively than Hepburn.
STUYTOWN BOOK CLUB-J, NY NY If Holly was an American geisha as Capote describes her, she was a childlike one. For example, didn't you think Holly was truly astonished and offended when Sid Arbuck followed her home and demanded sex in exchange for his picking up the check? Although she admits to having had sexual relations with 11 men in exchange for $, I think she supported herself mainly through platonic relationships, such as with her gay millionaire sugar daddy, O. J. Berman, Sally Tomato, etc.
STEVELONG, NYC Just an offhand observation about the movie. It also painted a picture of the New York of that time, right down to fire escapes. How many girls were drawn to come to New York by the movie? Now, ask yourself how many were drawn by the book? Holly, of course, was also about adventure. Despite what you call the ''book's abiding spirit of melancholy,'' it does display a life in NY that was hardly boring.
HOLLY, MARSHALL, MO I was a young fashion model during this period and I well knew the life and characters in the book. It was an amazing time to live in NYC. You really could do anything you wanted. Education was cheap. Creative jobs abounded. You could also afford to live in the city. My Golightly brownstone apartment cost $175 a month. Manhattan in those years was a true neighborhood; you ran into your friends passing by Tiffany's on the way to work or Doubleday's or MOMA. You could go to the theater and out to dinner without being rich. It was wonderful time and place to be young or old.
TB, PHILADELPHIA The book and the movie are both perfect in their own ways. Capote's prose, Hepburn's sad smile are national treasures. If Hollywood had gone for fidelity -- say, if the movie were made in the mid-'70s, or today -- we never would have seen the kind of faux-innocent Holly that Audrey Hepburn created, and that would be a sad thing.

HEADLINE: Welcoming the New Folks

BYLINE: By ROB LYNCH. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
WHEN I was 14, I worked on a farm, picking tomatoes. I was paid 50 cents an hour and made enough to buy a pair of skis.
In high school and college, I worked on an ambulance as an Explorer, in the Boy Scouts-affiliated program that links young people to various professional services. I also trained as an emergency medical technician.
In 1973, I enrolled in Ohio Wesleyan University intending to study pre-med. I thought I'd be an emergency room doctor, but I didn't have the discipline for the program so I switched to economics and history. After graduating, I worked in group insurance sales for five years, then in human resources and benefits consulting for 26 years. Part of that was with Buck Consultants, for 19 years, and the last four of those were after the company was sold to Mellon Financial. 
I joined VSP Global in 2006. We have four divisions. One of them, VSP Vision Care, provides vision benefits to employees of more than half the Fortune 500 companies and almost 40,000 other organizations. Our largest client is the federal government. We also offer vision insurance to individuals. We're a nonprofit, but we pay taxes. We weren't required to pay them for most of our history, but in the early 2000s the federal government challenged our non-taxable status, questioning how we could call ourselves a not-for-profit operating in communities when we operated in all 50 states.
We responded that we supported thousands of independent sole practitioners, not optometrists who worked for retail chains, for example. The government wanted us to expand our board of directors but we didn't feel that we could run our business that way, so we sued the I.R.S. We lost and have been paying taxes since 2003.
Vision care holds a significant place in health care because doctors, through eye exams, can diagnose and monitor a few chronic diseases or conditions that are important for cost control, including diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol.
Our other divisions are Marchon Eyewear, which manufactures and distributes eyeglasses and sunglasses, the VSP Optics Group, which offers ophthalmic products and lab services for doctors in private practice, and Eyefinity, which provides software for practice management.
We've made 18 acquisitions since 2007, partly to expand globally. I was involved in several acquisitions before coming to VSP Global, and I saw mistakes. Big companies may buy a business because they don't have time to develop a new capability, for example, but then they insist that the new staff conforms to their way of operating. They forget that they bought the business because of the people who came with it. But then those people often leave shortly afterward. We try to be mindful of those who join us from companies we acquire.
I served on the VSP Global board for several years before becoming president and C.E.O. I knew I had a good, high-level understanding of what was occurring in the company, but from my consulting days, I also knew I was getting the veneer. Stepping into this position, I realized there was a lot I hadn't been exposed to. It wasn't because people weren't transparent or that the information wasn't available; it's just that you don't necessarily get into all the details at that level. When you leave the board to manage the company, you have to be prepared for that.
You also need to understand that many of the board's decisions are a result of a tremendous amount of work that's already taken place in the company. I had to educate myself about what was really going on to deliver what the board was seeing as the final product.

HEADLINE: Grim Findings in Latin Crash Tests

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
SOME of the best-selling cars in Latin America and the Caribbean provide extremely poor crash protection, new safety tests show.
The testing by the Latin American New Car Assessment Program, known as Latin NCAP, represents the first comprehensive crash-test program for Latin America, safety experts say. Latin NCAP is an initiative of safety organizations including the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile and the FIA Foundation and is similar to NCAP programs that promote highway safety in Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, the United States and Europe.
The test results indicate that occupant safety in the region's best-selling cars is ''20 years behind the five-star standards now common in North America and Europe,'' Latin NCAP said. ''Unfortunately, in Latin America one-star cars still dominate the market.''
In a telephone interview, David Ward, director general of the FIA Foundation, said the poor crash protection was ''a problem that will likely increase.'' Companies are producing unsafe cars because they can, he added, because of lax government regulations and a lack of consumer awareness. 
The World Health Organization says that the Latin-Caribbean region has the world's highest per capita death rate from motor vehicle crashes and that the rate is expected to rise sharply as more people acquire vehicles.
Latin NCAP tested models from some of the largest automakers in the United States and Europe.
The Chinese-made Geely CK1 received the worst rating in front-impact testing: no stars on a five-star scale. The Geely lacked air bags, as did the single-star cars, which are manufactured and sold in the region by Fiat, Ford, General Motors, Peugeot and Volkswagen.
The three best performers in the front crash test received four stars. They were the Ford Focus Style, Chevrolet Cruze and Nissan Tilda Hatchback. All had two air bags.
None of the lowest-rated cars meet the safety requirements of Europe or the United States and are not sold in those regions. Aside from not having air bags, which have generally not been required by governments in the region but may be offered on more expensive models, some of the least expensive and most popular cars ''show weaknesses'' in their body structures, Latin NCAP said.
The group said it was ''disappointing that the Latin NCAP tests reveal a number of models with body shells that fail to remain stable.''
The Latin tests, like other NCAP programs around the world, are based on standards set by the United Nations in 1998. The Latin NCAP's frontal test, in which a car strikes an offset barrier at 40 miles per hour, is identical to one used in the United States by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
In contrast, the NCAP tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States crashes cars into a full frontal barrier, not one that is offset to the driver's side, at 35 m.p.h. That agency also gives star ratings based on the occupants' chance of injury, but its ratings are not equivalent to those in the Latin American tests.
Latin NCAP wants Latin American governments to enact U.N. safety standards into law, and it has has asked automakers selling cars in the region to comply voluntarily with the standards.
''It is not a question if they will -- they must,'' Mr. Ward said. In the past, in North America and Europe, automakers have had to be pushed to adapt safety standards, but once faced with results like those from the test they ''tend to respond very quickly,'' he said.
Some manufacturers have already cooperated with Latin NCAP, and legislation recently passed in Argentina and Brazil will require standard air bags by 2014, according to the group's report.
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group in Washington that represents 12 major automakers, declined to comment on the report.
Four out of five cars sold in Latin America are made in Brazil, said Mr. Ward of the FIA Foundation, and it is now the sixth-largest auto-producing nation. Last year, Brazil overtook Germany as the world's fourth-largest car market, and within five years it is expected to overtake Japan for third place, he said.
''Frankly, they won't cut it internationally if they remain at low-level standards,'' Mr. Ward said. ''If countries like this don't establish a regulatory floor, ever-cheaper cars will be sold. In a race like that, China and India are likely to win.''
Bella Dinh-Zarr, the North American director of a global initiative called Make Roads Safe, as well as director of road safety for the FIA Foundation, said: ''We understand all the economic issues and the worry that cars will not be affordable. But that's just not the case.''
She said it would cost little more to produce cars with life-saving technologies like air bags and crumple zones, which absorb the energy of a collision. Further, she added, manufacturers in the region are building cars on old platforms even though newer, safer vehicle designs exist.
''The factory platforms already exist to make safer cars, and I believe that car manufacturers just need strong encouragement to move forward with using these platforms worldwide,'' she said. ''Most models that are similar to the models in the U.S. did better. This is because they had the essential safety features that we expect, like air bags and crumple zones.''
American consumers won't tolerate unsafe cars, Dr. Dinh-Zarr said, ''and there is no reason that our Latin American and Caribbean neighbors should have to either.''
Until recently in the region, only the affluent could afford cars, and most were imported. But as in many other developing regions, there has been a large increase in car buyers from the middle class, and as a result, production has exploded in the last five years.
The report also included a separate star rating for crash test protection of child restraints, which found that the restraints recommended by some automakers did not fit well in their vehicles and therefore performed poorly. To achieve a high score, both the car and the child restraint had to perform well.
The report's findings also raise safety questions for travelers. A survey of the Web sites of major car rental companies operating in the region indicated that some cars listed in the report were in the rental fleets, said Rochelle Sobel, founder of the Association for Safe International Road Travel, a nonprofit advocacy group. ''Let the renter beware,'' Ms. Sobel said. ''Very often car buyers have safety in mind, but it's often not on the radar screen when renting.''
People often assume that safety standards abroad are similar to those in the United States, and are not aware that many countries have poor roads, weak laws that are erratically enforced, inadequate signs and lighting and inexperienced drivers. When those factors are combined with cars that lack basic safety features, ''it's really a recipe for disaster,'' Ms. Sobel said.
Worldwide, motor vehicle crashes are the No. 1 killer of healthy Americans abroad, the State Department says, exceeding deaths by terrorism, crime, infectious disease or plane travel.
Ms. Sobel, whose organization developed Road Travel Reports that detail road safety issues for about 140 countries, recommends checking rental car fleets and reserving a car long before traveling to ensure that the desired model is available, and upon arrival to insist on it or one with similar safety features. In addition, before leaving the lot it is advisable to inspect the vehicle for safety features, as well as the condition of the tires and whether the windshield wipers are working.

In the frontal test, Latin NCAP crashed cars into an offset barrier at 40 miles per hour. Air bags are not required in many Latin markets, but some of the tested cars included air bags. The child safety rating measured both the effectiveness of child restraints and the crash protection of the car itself.

HEADLINE: The New Digital Divide

BYLINE: By SUSAN P. CRAWFORD. 
A professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and a former special assistant to President Obama for science, technology and innovation policy.

 BODY:
FOR the second year in a row, the Monday after Thanksgiving -- so-called Cyber Monday, when online retailers offer discounts to lure holiday shoppers -- was the biggest online sales day of the year, totaling some $1.25 billion and overwhelming the sales figures racked up by brick-and-mortar stores three days before, on Black Friday, the former perennial record-holder.
Such numbers may seem proof that America is, indeed, online. But they mask an emerging division, one that has worrisome implications for our economy and society. Increasingly, we are a country in which only the urban and suburban well-off have truly high-speed Internet access, while the rest -- the poor and the working class -- either cannot afford access or use restricted wireless access as their only connection to the Internet. As our jobs, entertainment, politics and even health care move online, millions are at risk of being left behind.
Telecommunications, which in theory should bind us together, has often divided us in practice. Until the late 20th century, the divide split those with phone access and those without it. Then it was the Web: in 1995 the Commerce Department published its first look at the ''digital divide,'' finding stark racial, economic and geographic gaps between those who could get online and those who could not. 
''While a standard telephone line can be an individual's pathway to the riches of the Information Age,'' the report said, ''a personal computer and modem are rapidly becoming the keys to the vault.'' If you were white, middle-class and urban, the Internet was opening untold doors of information and opportunity. If you were poor, rural or a member of a minority group, you were fast being left behind.
Over the last decade, cheap Web access over phone lines brought millions to the Internet. But in recent years the emergence of services like video-on-demand, online medicine and Internet classrooms have redefined the state of the art: they require reliable, truly high-speed connections, the kind available almost exclusively from the nation's small number of very powerful cable companies. Such access means expensive contracts, which many Americans simply cannot afford.
While we still talk about ''the'' Internet, we increasingly have two separate access marketplaces: high-speed wired and second-class wireless. High-speed access is a superhighway for those who can afford it, while racial minorities and poorer and rural Americans must make do with a bike path.
Just over 200 million Americans have high-speed, wired Internet access at home, and almost two-thirds of them get it through their local cable company. The connections are truly high-speed: based on a technological standard called Docsis 2.0 or 3.0, they can reach up to 105 megabits per second, fast enough to download a music album in three seconds.
These customers are the targets for the next generation of Internet services, technology that will greatly enhance their careers, education and quality of life. Within a decade, patients at home will be able to speak with their doctors online and thus get access to lower-cost, higher-quality care. High-speed connections will also allow for distance education through real-time videoconferencing; already, thousands of high school students are earning diplomas via virtual classrooms.
Households will soon be able to monitor their energy use via smart-grid technology to keep costs and carbon dioxide emissions down. Even the way that wired America works will change: many job applications are already possible only online; soon, job interviews will be held by way of videoconference, saving cost and time.
But the rest of America will most likely be left out of all this. Millions are still offline completely, while others can afford only connections over their phone lines or via wireless smartphones. They can thus expect even lower-quality health services, career opportunities, education and entertainment options than they already receive. True, Americans of all stripes are adopting smartphones at breakneck speeds; in just over four years the number has jumped from about 10 percent to about 35 percent; among Hispanics and African-Americans, it's roughly 44 percent. Most of the time, smartphone owners also have wired access at home: the Pew Internet and American Life Project recently reported that 59 percent of American adults with incomes above $75,000 had a smartphone, and a 2010 study by the Federal Communications Commission found that more than 90 percent of people at that income level had wired high-speed Internet access at home.
But that is not true for lower-income and minority Americans. According to numbers released last month by the Department of Commerce, a mere 4 out of every 10 households with annual household incomes below $25,000 in 2010 reported having wired Internet access at home, compared with the vast majority -- 93 percent -- of households with incomes exceeding $100,000. Only slightly more than half of all African-American and Hispanic households (55 percent and 57 percent, respectively) have wired Internet access at home, compared with 72 percent of whites.
These numbers are likely to grow even starker as the 30 percent of Americans without any kind of Internet access come online. When they do, particularly if the next several years deliver subpar growth in personal income, they will probably go for the only option that is at all within their reach: wireless smartphones. A wired high-speed Internet plan might cost $100 a month; a smartphone plan might cost half that, often with a free or heavily discounted phone thrown in.
The problem is that smartphone access is not a substitute for wired. The vast majority of jobs require online applications, but it is hard to type up a resume on a hand-held device; it is hard to get a college degree from a remote location using wireless. Few people would start a business using only a wireless connection.
It is not just inconvenient -- many of these activities are physically impossible via a wireless connection. By their nature, the airwaves suffer from severe capacity limitations: the same five gigabytes of data that might take nine minutes to download over a high-speed cable connection would take an hour and 15 minutes to travel over a wireless connection.
Even if a smartphone had the technical potential to compete with wired, users would still be hampered by the monthly data caps put in place by AT&T and Verizon, by far the largest wireless carriers in America. For example, well before finishing the download of a single two-hour, high-definition movie from iTunes over a 4G wireless network, a typical subscriber would hit his or her monthly cap and start incurring $10 per gigabyte in overage charges. If you think this is a frivolous concern, for ''movie'' insert an equally large data stream, like ''business meeting.''
Public libraries are taking up the slack and buckling under the strain. Nearly half of librarians say that their connections are insufficient to meet patrons' needs. And it is hard to imagine conducting a job interview in a library.
IN the past, the cost of new technologies has dropped over time, and eventually many Americans could afford a computer and a modem to access a standard phone line. Phone service -- something 96 percent of Americans have -- was sold at regulated rates and the phone companies were forced to allow competing Internet access providers to share their lines.
But there is reason to believe this time is different. Today, the problem is about affording unregulated high-speed Internet service -- provided, in the case of cable, by a few for-profit companies with very little local competition and almost no check on their prices. They have to bear all the cost of infrastructure and so have no incentive to expand into rural areas, where potential customers are relatively few and far between. (The Federal Communications Commission recently announced a plan to convert subsidies that once supported basic rural telephone services into subsidies for basic Internet access.)
The bigger problem is the lack of competition in cable markets. Though there are several large cable companies nationwide, each dominates its own fragmented kingdom of local markets: Comcast is the only game in Philadelphia, while Time Warner dominates Cleveland. That is partly because it is so expensive to lay down the physical cables, and companies, having paid for those networks, guard them jealously, clustering their operations and spending tens of millions of dollars to lobby against laws that might oblige them to share their infrastructure.
Cable's only real competition comes from Verizon's FiOS fiber-optic service, which can provide speeds up to 150 megabits per second. But FiOS is available to only about 10 percent of households. AT&T's U-verse, which has about 4 percent of the market, cannot provide comparable speeds because, while it uses fiber-optic cable to reach neighborhoods, the signal switches to slower copper lines to connect to houses. And don't even think about DSL, which carries just a fraction of the data needed to handle the services that cable users take for granted.
Lacking competition from other cable companies or alternate delivery technologies, each of the country's large cable distributors has the ability to raise prices in its region for high-speed Internet services. Those who can still afford it are paying higher and higher rates for the same quality of service, while those who cannot are turning to wireless.
IT doesn't have to be this way, as a growing number of countries demonstrate. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ranks America 12th among developed nations for wired Internet access, and it is safe to assume that high prices have played a role in lowering our standing. So America, the country that invented the Internet and still leads the world in telecommunications innovation, is lagging far behind in actual use of that technology.
The answer to this puzzle is regulatory policy. Over the last 10 years, we have deregulated high-speed Internet access in the hope that competition among providers would protect consumers. The result? We now have neither a functioning competitive market for high-speed wired Internet access nor government oversight.
By contrast, governments that have intervened in high-speed Internet markets have seen higher numbers of people adopting the technology, doing so earlier and at lower subscription charges. Many of these countries have required telecommunications providers to sell access to parts of their networks to competitors at regulated rates, so that competition can lower prices.
Meanwhile, they are working toward, or already have, fiber-optic networks that will be inexpensive, standardized, ubiquitous and equally fast for uploading and downloading. Many of those countries, not only advanced ones like Sweden and Japan but also less-developed ones like Portugal and Russia, are already well on their way to wholly replacing their standard telephone connections with state-of-the-art fiber-optic connections that will even further reduce the cost to users, while significantly improving access speeds.
The only thing close is FiOS. But, according to Diffraction Analysis, a research firm, it costs six times as much as comparable service in Hong Kong, five times as much as in Paris and two and a half times as much as in Amsterdam. When it comes to the retail cost of fiber access in America, we do about as well as Istanbul.
The new digital divide raises important questions about social equity in an information-driven world. But it is also a matter of protecting our economic future. Thirty years from now, African-Americans and Latinos, who are at the greatest risk of being left behind in the Internet revolution, will be more than half of our work force. If we want to be competitive in the global economy, we need to make sure every American has truly high-speed wired access to the Internet for a reasonable cost.
Correction: December 11, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An opinion essay on Dec. 4 about the emergence of a new digital divide erroneously attributed a distinction to the Monday after Thanksgiving, sometimes called Cyber Monday. It was the biggest online sales day of the year, not the biggest overall sales day.

HEADLINE: How Do You Say 'Lehman' In Italian?

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON, JACOB GOLDSTEIN and CAITLIN KENNEY. 
Adam Davidson, Jacob Goldstein and Caitlin Kenney work for NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Much like our own recent housing crisis, the European financial mess is unfolding in a foreign language. It is the lingua franca of financial obscurity -- ''sovereign credit spreads'' and other terms that most people don't need, or care, to know.
Yet the bottom line is simple: Europe's problems are a lot like ours, only worse. Like Wall Street, Germany is where the money is. Italy, like California, has let bad governance squander great natural resources. Greece is like a much older version of Mississippi -- forever poor and living a bit too much off its richer neighbors. Slovenia, Slovakia and Estonia are like the heartland states that learned the hard way how entwined so-called Main Street is with Wall Street. Now remember that these countries share neither a government nor a language. Nor a realistic bailout plan, either.
Lack of fluency in financialese shouldn't preclude anyone from understanding what is going on in Europe or what may yet happen. So we've answered some of the most pressing questions in a language everyone can comprehend. Though the word for ''Lehman'' in virtually any language is still ''Lehman.''
Q: Will the euro survive? 
It's a dangerous question to ask out loud. Suppose a credible rumor spread throughout Greece that, rather than accept the harsh terms of another bailout package, the government was plotting to revert to the drachma. Fearing the devaluation of their savings, Greeks would move their money somewhere safer, like a German bank. The Greek banking system would then, in all likelihood, implode.
But Greece's economy is too small for an isolated collapse to cause any significant damage throughout the continent. (Even a collapse confined to Greece, Ireland and Portugal couldn't take down Europe.) So the concern about a run on the Greek banking system is largely about whether a panic might spread to Spain or -- worse -- Italy, which could topple Europe's financial system. Maybe that's why the treaty that created the euro doesn't say anything about a country's abandoning the currency. Or why European leaders scarcely mentioned the possibility (not in public, at least) until this fall, two years into the crisis.
Q: Why is it such a bad thing for a country to abandon the euro?
If a country did pull off a surprise euro exit -- and get out before everybody could take their money out of the banks -- there would still be a period of economic chaos. Exports and imports would shut down. Lending would collapse, which would send companies into bankruptcy. Ripple effects would be felt throughout Europe.
The problem is thorny enough that the British chief executive of Next, a European retailer, recently offered a $:250,000 prize for the person who comes up with the best plan for countries to leave the euro without destroying the European economy. (Have a brilliant idea? Entries are due early next year.)
Q: Wait a minute: If leaving the eurozone would be so awful, why would anyone do it?
It's not all bad. Leaving the euro would allow a country to ignore demands from the leaders of other European countries. It could simply refuse to pay its debt.
After the short-run pain, weaker European countries could also see a long-term benefit. If Greece or Portugal went back to the drachma or the escudo, the cost of their exports would fall. Because it would be cheaper for foreign travelers to stay in their hotels and eat in their restaurants, their tourism industries would get a bump, too. The alternative is to spend the next decade as poor countries tied to a rich one's currency.
Q: Why exactly does Angela Merkel always look so woebegone?
For the euro to survive in the long run, Germany -- the zone's biggest economy -- will most likely need to vouch for the debt of struggling eurozone members. And it will become more expensive to borrow money if bond investors fear the country is becoming overextended.
The Germans are also wary of the widespread calls for the European Central Bank to buoy Spain and Italy by buying their bonds. If they know the E.C.B. will bail them out, what will be their incentive to act responsibly in the future? Worse, Germans argue, printing money to pay off government debt (which is what the E.C.B. would essentially be doing) is the first step to hyperinflation.
Q: What happens to theEuropean Union if the euro crumbles?
It turns out that a bunch of vastly different countries, each with control over its own budget but all bound to a common currency, is not a sustainable economic model. And that leaves Europe with two main, and painful, options.
Option 1: Keep the euro, and make the eurozone even more integrated. While this doesn't necessarily require a full-blown United States of Europe, individual countries would probably have to give bureaucrats in Brussels or Frankfurt power over how much money they can spend. The E.C.B. might promise to do whatever is necessary to stop a panic, but poorer eurozone countries would very likely endure years of difficult economic adjustments, including falling wages.
Option 2: Greece and perhaps a few other struggling countries on the periphery leave the euro. A Greek exit alone might give the European dream a hard kick in the teeth, but it wouldn't necessarily be fatal. It might, in fact, even prod European leaders to act more boldly to defend the rest of the eurozone. But the departure of Italy -- the zone's third-largest economy -- would be a different story. Italy is what wonks call a systemically important country, which means that it is so big, and so intertwined with the rest of Europe, that it would take the whole eurozone down with it. Think massive disruptions to European trade, chaos in the financial system and a dose of political and social unrest.
Q: What does this mean for the U.S.?
Fortunately, exports to eurozone countries amount to only about 3 percent of America's overall economy. The bigger worry, though, is the financial system. U.S. banks say their exposure to Europe is manageable, but when you ask smart people what a financial disaster in Europe would mean for the U.S., their answer usually goes, ''Blah, blah, blah, Lehman.'' To put a finer point on it: when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in the fall of 2008, it initiated a global financial panic greater than almost anyone predicted, largely because of uncertainty. Nobody knew who owed what to whom. The global financial system froze, with disastrous consequences.
European banks currently hold an extraordinary amount of European debt. And while U.S. banks have been reporting more details about their exposure to European banks, there still is a tremendous sense of uncertainty about who is on the hook, and for what, exactly. If Europe's biggest banks go down, it could very well cause another Lehman-like crisis in the U.S. The good news: It's still an ''if.''
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Don't worry too much about Greece.
2. Instead, worry about Italy.
3. Portugal might do all right with the escudo.
4. Just as in '08, it's all about uncertainty.

HEADLINE: Iran's First Great Satan Was England

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER. 
A visiting professor of international relations at Boston University, a former New York Times correspondent and the author of ''Reset: Iran, Turkey and America's Future.''

 BODY:
Boston
IF there is one country on earth where the cry ''Death to England'' still carries weight -- where people still harbor the white-hot hatred of British colonialism that once inflamed millions from South Africa to China -- that country would be Iran. And that is what the leaders of Iran must have been counting on when screaming militiamen, unhindered by the police, poured into the British Embassy in Tehran to vandalize it on Tuesday.
Most Iranians, like most people anywhere, would deplore the idea of thugs storming into a foreign embassy. Nonetheless, some may have felt a flicker of satisfaction. Even an outrage like this, they might have said, is a trifle compared with the generations of torment Britain inflicted on their country. 
So Iran's mullahs -- they, not President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, are reported to have been behind the attack -- were not gambling in ordering, or at least tolerating, it. They presumably realized that the world would denounce their flagrant violation of international law. But they also knew it would resonate with the narrative Iranians have heard for so long about their own history.
The spark for the embassy invasion was Britain's imposition of new economic sanctions on Iran. Pressure for those sanctions came not so much from Britain as from the United States and Israel, but those countries could not be targets for a similar attack because they do not have embassies in Tehran. Besides, Iranians these days can be surprisingly besotted with the United States; in my own visits I am often surrounded by people who compete to proclaim their love for America, and whose anger at Israel seems more political than emotional.
Those Iranians, however, feel quite differently about Britain.
Britain first cast its imperial eye on Iran in the 19th century. Its appeal was location; it straddled the land route to India. Once established in Iran, the British quickly began investing -- or looting, as some Iranians would say. British companies bought exclusive rights to establish banks, print currency, explore for minerals, run transit lines and even grow tobacco.
In 1913, the British government maneuvered its way to a contract under which all Iranian oil became its property. Six years later it imposed an ''agreement'' that gave it control of Iran's army and treasury. These actions set off a wave of anti-British outrage that has barely subsided.
Britain's occupation of Iran during World War II, when it was a critical source of oil and a transit route for supplies to keep Soviet Russia fighting, was harsh. Famine and disease spread as the British requisitioned food for their troops.
One of the most popular Iranian novels, ''Savushun,'' is set in this period. It tells of two brothers who take roles every Iranian can recognize: The elder is ambitious and panders to the occupiers; the younger refuses to sell his grain to them and pays a tragic price for his integrity.
During their occupation, the British decided that Reza Shah Pahlavi, whom they had helped place in power, was no longer reliable. They deposed him and chose his son, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, as the new shah.
Once the war ended, Iran resumed its efforts to install democracy, under the leadership of Mohammed Mossadegh. He had campaigned against the Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1919 and had written a book denouncing ''capitulation'' agreements, under which foreigners were granted immunity from Iranian law.
After he was elected prime minister in 1951, Mr. Mossadegh asked Parliament to take the unimaginable step of nationalizing Iran's oil industry. It agreed unanimously. That sparked a historic confrontation.
Mr. Mossadegh embodied the anti-British emotion that still roils the Iranian soul. The special envoy President Harry S. Truman sent to Tehran to seek a compromise in the oil dispute, W. Averell Harriman, reported that the British held a ''completely 19th-century colonial attitude toward Iran,'' but found Mr. Mossadegh just as intransigent. When Mr. Harriman assured Mr. Mossadegh that there were good people in Britain, Mr. Mossadegh gave him a classically Iranian reply.
''You do not know how crafty they are,'' he said. ''You do not know how evil they are. You do not know how they sully everything they touch.''
Desperate to regain control of Iran's oil, the British sought to crush Mr. Mossadegh with measures that included harsh economic sanctions -- sanctions comparable to the ones they are now imposing. When that failed, they asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to join in a plot to overthrow him. He agreed, not because he wished to help the British recover their oil but because he had been persuaded that otherwise, Iran might fall to Communism. Iran, after all, was on the southern flank of the Soviet Union, standing between it and the oil fields and warm-water ports of the Persian Gulf.
The coup, staged in August 1953, ended Iranian democracy and allowed Mohammed Reza Pahlavi to build a dictatorship that remained a staunch cold war ally of both Britain and the United States. But the alliance backfired on both countries when his repression set off the 1979 revolution that brought the mullahs to power. Today, many Iranians who loathe the mullahs nevertheless look for Britain's hand behind any dark plot; some even accuse it of organizing the 1979 revolution, and imposing Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
More than half a century ago, Secretary of State Dean Acheson wrote that Mr. Mossadegh was ''inspired by a fanatical hate of the British and a desire to expel them and their works from the country regardless of the cost.'' Many Iranians still feel that way, as their country falls into ever deeper isolation. In Iran, the words ''anger'' and ''Britain'' fit easily together.
Outside interference is a central fact of modern Iranian history. And for most of the 20th century, Britain was at the center of most of it.
Nonetheless, a spark of admiration has long been buried within Iranians' anger, as it was in many other places across the British Empire. Mr. Harriman noticed it in his talks with Mr. Mossadegh. The old man liked to tell stories about his favorite grandson, and Mr. Harriman asked where the boy was attending school.
''Why, in England, of course,'' was the reply. ''Where else?''

LENGTH: 1307 words

HEADLINE: Achtung, Kmart Shoppers

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
VOLKSWAGEN, a slugger around the globe but a bench player in the United States, has redesigned its Passat to suit American tastes. If those tastes run to fast food, Toyotas and Costco family packs, so be it.
This year, with General Motors blowing past a tsunami-stressed Toyota to regain its status as the world's top-selling automaker, VW has risen to a surprising No. 2. But in this country, VW's serial misreadings of the market have cost it sales and muddied its image. The company may have made its reputation with the people's car, but nimbler companies like Hyundai and Kia have become today's go-to bargain brands.
Granted, VW has long sustained a niche of fierce loyalists with its sophisticated German design and performance, often in euro-size packages. But too many mainstream American customers, put off by VW's high prices and shaky reliability, have crossed its cars off their shopping lists.
Eventually, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. VW's new bid to conquer America is built on a proven strategy: offering bigger cars at smaller prices. Can you say ''Chevy Caprice'' in German? 
VW's new prescription, which may or may not contain hallucinogens, is to nearly triple its American sales to 800,000 units by 2018. The only way to pull that off is to build cars in America.
With a lavishly subsidized factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., cranking out Passats -- VW's first United States plant since it stopped breeding Rabbits in Pennsylvania in 1988 -- the company joins a carpetbagging confederacy that includes BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan and Toyota.
Many older Passats were as tasty as prime German schnitzel, just a grille and some leather away from being an Audi. In contrast, the 2012 version is the McDonald's value meal of family sedans: soft, supersized and served in a generic, stamped-out box.
The similarly repositioned Jetta, which has sold briskly since its debut a year ago, has helped VW to raise sales this year by more than 25 percent through November.
An attractive price helps to make up for the Passat's lack of pizazz. The base model is $20,765, a remarkable $7,180 less than its equivalent from last year. Yet the Passat, unlike the dumbed-down Jetta, doesn't feel designed for the bargain bin.
But I can't help thinking that the bread-and-butter Passats, tugged by a droning, obsolescent lump of a 5-cylinder engine, are riding the coattails of two markedly superior versions: one an ultrafrugal diesel and the other with a 3.6-liter V-6 rated at 280 horsepower.
For all the talk of the Passat's affordability, the truly compelling versions still rank among the most costly cars in the midsize class. The diesel Passat TDI SE starts at $26,765 and the lowest-priced 3.6L SE is $29,765. If you load up the deluxe SEL versions you'll spend roughly $33,000 to $34,000.
At least scheduled maintenance is free for three years or 36,000 miles.
My hunch is that many shoppers will test-drive the 5-cylinder first and wonder what the fuss is about. But if you ask the sales representative for the keys to a V-6 or a TDI, the driving experience improves immeasurably.
VW itself may see the 5-cylinder engine as its weak link: Car and Driver's Web site recently reported that VW was already planning to drop that 170-horsepower engine in favor of a much more agreeable 1.8-liter turbo 4-cylinder producing roughly 200 horsepower. That engine would surely put the Passat in the sweet spot of affordability and performance that VW is seeking.
To some eyes, the Passat's exterior styling is its other unlovable trait -- so inoffensive as to be offensive. The VW resembles an 8-year-old's Crayola rendering of a car: three boxes, the tallest one in the middle.
The look is almost patronizing, leading one to wonder what VW executives really think of American tastes. The front fascia is hiked up high, drawing attention to the rictus formed by the grille. And the rear end may set the current standard for sedan lethargy.
Certainly, family sedans don't sink or swim on styling alone -- just ask one of the millions who've bought Camrys. But owners of the hunky Hyundai Sonata, to name one rival, will take a quick look at the Passat and mentally congratulate themselves on their choice.
Jump inside and everything changes. The Passat flaunts its big-boned American virtues without sacrificing its Germanic roots. Few corners are visibly cut in the huge, comfortable cabin. The compliant ride and enormous back seat and trunk could charm the slacks off your Buick-loving uncle.
Yet the Passat drives like a real Volkswagen -- meaning it feels better on the road than nearly every competitor, including the Sonata with its vague steering, the solid Ford Fusion and even the venerable Honda Accord.
Front or back, the VW's seats are not just euro-handsome, but as comfortable as the chairs in a $45,000 Audi. For higher trim levels, authentic metal or wood trim offer gleaming relief from the plasticky faux finishes in many rivals.
The postcard-size navigation screen is too small and the system responds slowly to inputs, but reliable mapping and clear graphics balance out the cons. The optional 400-watt Fender audio system makes pleasing, potent sounds.
Long limbs enjoy a class-beating 39.1 inches of rear legroom, just sneaking past the new Toyota Camry. That rec-room-size back seat can tempt you to add a fifth passenger, but the hard center perch quashes that notion, at least for long trips.
Searching fingers will find only mild evidence of cost-cutting. There are a few sharp plastic edges, and a pair of climate-control knobs feel a bit imprecise. The hood is supported by a prop rod, rather than gas struts, and the trunk hinges are of the exposed luggage-mashing type. The 5-cylinder, to its credit, can be had with a 6-speed manual transmission or a conventional 6-speed automatic. But the engine revs lazily, barely tops 5,500 r.p.m. before it prematurely upshifts and achieves a mediocre 22 miles per gallon in town and 31 on the highway. The Sonata's 198-horse 4-cylinder makes for a telling comparison: it beats the VW by 28 horses, yet is rated 3 m.p.g. higher in both town and country.
The 3.6 VR6 engine solves those performance issues. Teamed with a dual-clutch DSG automated-manual gearbox, it scoots the Passat from 0 to 60 miles per hour in just 6.3 seconds. That gearbox features a useful Sport mode as well as shift buttons on the steering wheel. But fuel economy suffers with the V-6, which is rated 20/28 m.p.g.
The plump-cushioned suspension exhibits a noticeable fault, a tendency to bob and float over wallowy pavement. The lane-filling size is jarring for those familiar with trim Passats of the past.
But as it did in its heyday of the late '90s and early aughts, the Passat drives like a special piece, a cut above the usual mainstream family sedans.
In concert with the sophisticated diesel and V-6 powertrains, the accurate steering, a VW signature, tips the game to the Passat.
At this point, skeptics may raise the issue of long-term reliability, or lack thereof. VW has often languished near the bottom of the closely watched quality surveys by J. D. Power & Associates. Suspicious minds may also envision early cars running off the rails in the new Chattanooga plant. Quality problems have plagued other new auto factories, including the Mercedes plant in Alabama that produced the original M-Class S.U.V.
For its part, VW insists that quality is improving, citing warranty costs that have fallen about 10 percent a year. That said, there's a reason VW loyalists drive you crazy at parties, going on about how wonderfully their cars drive.
Judging by the Passat's expanded size and patriotic appeal -- built in America, by and for Americans -- something tells me the ranks of unpaid Passat lobbyists are about to expand.
INSIDE TRACK: VW aims for America's vast middle and scores a direct hit.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths MILLER, CHARLES D

 BODY:
MILLER--Charles D. Avery Dennison Corp. mourns the passing of Charles D. "Chuck" Miller, visionary business builder and civic leader, who died November 23, 2011 at the age of 83. In his 47-year association with Avery Dennison, Chuck was instrumental in transforming the company from a U.S.-based manufacturer into a global Fortune 500 market leader in pressure-sensitive labeling materials and office products. As chairman for 17 years and CEO for 21, he drove the company's growth with creativity, courage and confidence, and every aspect of the business -- from vision to strategy to execution to culture -- was shaped for the better by his passion and imagination. Corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California bears his name in recognition of his impact. 
Chuck translated the qualities that made him such an exceptional businessman into a deep commitment to civic leadership. Among the many roles he filled with distinction were: chairman of the board of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, director of numerous Southern California companies, chairman of United Way of Greater Los Angeles, and co-created with Peter Mullin the Mullin-Miller Million Dollar Match Fund to encourage giving to the United Way Pathways Out of Poverty Plan during the recent severe recession. He also supported a wide range of medical institutions, including Operation Walk, which provides total hip and knee replacements to the impoverished and which he personally nurtured from a local into an international organization. A lifelong lover of athletics, he was one of the first members of the organizing committee that brought the 1984 Olympic Games to Los Angeles, and helped establish the Los Angeles Sports Council and the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles (today the LA84 Foundation). He provided extensive support to the U.S. Lacrosse and personally funded the women's varsity lacrosse program at Occidental College, which today is a national power in the sport. A deep believer in liberal arts education, Chuck was especially devoted to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University. He served as university trustee and presidential counselor, endowing the Charles D. Miller Professorship in the humanities at the Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and creating the Vision Fund, a scholarship program for arts and sciences undergraduates and summer students of the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth. In 1998, he received the Heritage Award in recognition of his outstanding service to Johns Hopkins. He also had a long association with Occidental College, serving as a trustee from 1977 to 1998 and continuing thereafter as a trustee emeritus. He remained an active businessman, civic leader and philanthropist after retiring from Avery Dennison. He invested in real estate and owned and operated a wine company, the noted Jackson Hole restaurant Koshu, and a highly successful stable of thoroughbred horses. At the time of his death, he was a member of the executive board of the Rose Bowl Legacy Campaign for the renovation and preservation of the Rose Bowl, a member of the advisory board of the Autry Museum of Western Heritage and a trustee of Southern California Public Radio. The company expresses its deepest condolences to his wife, Carolyn; his daughters Amanda Daly Miller, Candice Louise Miller, Katherine Ann Miller, Susie Cherrill Otten and Charlotte Juanita Miller; and his grandchildren Laura, David, Eric and John Otten, and Harper, Juliet and Zander Branch. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service is planned for December 12 at 11am at The Langham Huntington, 1401 South Oak Knoll Avenue, Pasadena, and a memorial website: CharlesDMiller.org, is now live. In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory can be made to: Charles D. Miller Legacy Fund United Way of Greater Los Angeles, 1150 South Olive Street, Los Angeles, California 90015.

HEADLINE: Marlins' Stadium Deal Draws Federal Scrutiny

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
As the Marlins' new stadium nears completion in Miami, the wreckage from the deal to finance it continues to mount.
The Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed the City of Miami and Miami-Dade County seeking details about what investigation and analysis they did before agreeing to issue nearly $500 million in bonds to pay for the stadium and adjoining parking lots in the Little Havana neighborhood.
In a 20-page letter to the county dated Dec. 1, the commission also asked for any documents concerning the team's ability to help pay for the stadium. 
It is also seeking records of any campaign contributions that the Marlins may have given to officials working for the city, the county and the state, and all correspondence going back to 2007 with the owners of the Marlins and their lawyers as well as the baseball commissionerBud Selig and Bob DuPuy, his former deputy.
The commission wants all the documents by Jan. 6, a deadline the county may have trouble meeting, R. A. Cuevas Jr., its lawyer, said.
P. J. Loyello, the Marlins' spokesman, said the team would ''fully cooperate'' with the investigation. A spokesman for Major League Baseball declined to comment.
City and county officials approved the deal to pay for more than three-quarters of the estimated $645 million cost of the stadium and parking lots in 2009. They did so during a deep recession, when services were being slashed, and despite calls to hold a referendum on the financing of the stadium and lots, which are being paid for with hotel bed taxes and parking fees.
City and county officials were accused of spending too much money on the Marlins - a for-profit organization - when other buildings, like the convention center, needed repairs. The Marlins also refused to show government officials their financial books.
This became an embarrassment last year when leaked financial documents showed that the Marlins were profitable in 2008 and 2009.
It may be difficult for the commission to accuse the Marlins of misrepresenting their finances if they did not represent them in the first place. Rather, the blame would fall to county and city officials if a lack of due diligence were found before the bonds were issued. The county and the city are also squabbling over who, if anyone, should pay property tax on the stadium's four parking lots. The county appraiser contends that the city is not exempt because it is leasing its parking spaces to a for-profit venture, the Marlins.
Although the Marlins were not subpoenaed, and the commission was careful to state that it had not concluded that anyone had broken the law, the investigation has the potential to cast a cloud over the team and its new home, which is set to open in April.
The federal investigation could scare off players from signing with the Marlins. On the other hand, players could still join the Marlins if the money offered was significantly higher than that of other teams.
The question is how long the investigation could last. The commission has deep resources and unlimited time, and investigations related to sports and teams are sure to receive a lot of news media attention. The commission could also force the Marlins and Major League Baseball to reveal rarely seen financial records.
''Sports is very high profile, and if the S.E.C. can find something here that was done illegally, then that will send a message to communities similarly situated,'' said Jordan Kobritz, an assistant professor of sports management at Eastern New Mexico University. ''If they smell any smoking gun as a result of the documents produced, that could lead them to any direction they want to go, including to the offices of M.L.B.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: What About Premium Support?

 BODY:
As the election campaign progresses voters can expect to hear a lot of hype -- and if we are very lucky some good ideas -- about how best to ''reform'' Medicare. It will take stamina and well-honed skepticism to sort it all out.
Republican politicians are touting the virtues of market competition and calling for a ''premium support'' plan that would give beneficiaries a set amount of money to shop among private plans for their own insurance. What they do not say is that private plans have long been more costly than traditional Medicare and have shown far less ability to slow spending. Nor do they admit that the most extreme versions of premium support -- like the one championed by Representative Paul Ryan -- would save the government money mainly by shifting costs to the beneficiaries, who would have to decide whether to forgo treatments or pay more for coverage. 
Most Democrats have been fiercely opposed to privatizing Medicare. They believe the traditional system can be reformed to reduce costs without demolishing the whole structure. But with concerns about the rising deficit and the long-term sustainability of Medicare, some centrist Democrats are backing the premium support idea.
As Americans try to figure out who is right or wrong in this debate, here are some matters to consider:
HAS IT BEEN TESTED? The Massachusetts health care reforms already provide premium support to help low- and middle-income people buy private policies on an exchange. Unlike the Ryan plan, the program guarantees everyone a defined, comprehensive set of benefits, and officials bargain aggressively with private plans to keep their premiums down. As a result, annual cost increases have been held well below the premium increases for other private group insurance providing comparable benefits.
The Medicare prescription drug program provides support to help beneficiaries buy coverage from private insurers. The costs have been far less than initially projected, a fact that promoters of premium support trumpet. Market competition has helped, but costs have mainly been held down because many major drugs have gone off patent and have been replaced by cheaper generics.
Perhaps the strongest caution against overselling the benefits of competition is Medicare's own track record. What critics of the current program don't acknowledge is that over the past four decades, Medicare's spending per enrollee has risen much more slowly than private insurance premiums -- an average of 8.3 percent a year between 1970 and 2009, compared with 9.3 percent for private premiums. And the private Medicare Advantage plans that cover roughly a quarter of all enrollees cost an average of 10 percent more than what the same coverage would cost in traditional Medicare.
The lesson from all this is that it is far too early to talk about scrapping traditional Medicare. At the same time, serious analysis and testing of premium support are clearly worth pursuing.
A GOOD APPROACH The best proposal for premium support is one that gives beneficiaries choice while protecting them from any added costs if competition does not keep prices down. Enrollees would be given a set amount of money to buy a plan comparable to what Medicare now provides. If they chose a plan that cost less, they could pocket the difference. If they wanted better benefits, they would have to pay the added premium themselves. But if market competition failed to restrain costs, the federal government would increase the support given. So far, this idea has found no support among leading politicians, who apparently have less confidence in market forces than they claim.
SOME BAD APPROACHES Versions of premium support backed by Congressman Ryan and other conservatives have one primary goal: pushing down growth in federal spending on Medicare, even if it means that beneficiaries have to pay far more for coverage. These proposals tie increases in premium support to indexes, like the gross domestic product or the consumer price index, that historically have risen far more slowly than health care costs.
Proponents hope competition will lead private plans to reduce their premiums and that beneficiaries will think seriously about whether they need a costly CT scan. While competition and cost-sharing by beneficiaries could help curb overuse of services, we are skeptical that patients who are chronically ill or nearing the end of life, who account for a huge chunk of Medicare's spending, would second-guess their doctors and choose cheaper care.
The Congressional Budget Office concluded that the Ryan plan would force new enrollees in 2022 to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket for benefits similar to those currently provided by Medicare.
THE NEXT TEST The health care reform law, starting in 2014, will provide premium support subsidies to help people with modest incomes buy private policies on new insurance exchanges. That will be the next big test of whether premium support can work to hold down costs while providing good coverage. With so many uncertainties, it would be rash to weaken or jettison the traditional Medicare program now. The good news is there is some time to get it right.

HEADLINE: From a Cold Apartment to a Utica College Dormitory

BYLINE: By CHANNING JOSEPH

 BODY:
The bullies in middle and high school did not care much for Jonathan Ferreira's love of Beyonce, the singer with the enviable moves. When he performed her dance steps, other students called him gay.
''I was always into Beyonce,'' Mr. Ferreira, 19, said in an aunt's Bronx apartment on a recent weekend visit from college. His appreciation, however, led to confrontations.
''I was in a couple of fights,'' he said. But he added: ''I knew who I was. I like Beyonce. Big deal.''
The bullies are but a memory now, one that is nothing compared to the memory of enduring cold winters in New York City while he was growing up poor. In his new dorm room at Utica College, he has one important thing that he did not have in the small room that he shared with his mother in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx: a warm place to sleep. 
As Mr. Ferreira wrote in his college application essay: ''My teeth were chattering as I sat there shivering in my ice cube of an apartment. The only thing keeping me warm was a thin quilt and my mother's body heat. The black bags covering the broken windows were not keeping any of the cold out.''
Mr. Ferreira's mother, Ana Reyes, immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic before he was born, and he said his father abandoned the family when Mr. Ferreira was still a child. Ms. Reyes worked 14 to 15 hours a day in a porcelain doll factory, and then as a hairstylist, before she became disabled by diabetes when he was in middle school.
When she worked, Mr. Ferreira said, her feet would swell from standing for long hours. ''She would beg me to give her a massage because her feet would just hurt,'' he said.
Though his mother dropped out of school, she taught him that education was the best way to escape a life of poverty. So he excelled. An honors student, he finished in the top 10 percent of his class at Renaissance High School for Musical Theater and Technology, where he had taken advanced-placement courses and participated in College Now, a free program allowing him to take courses at Lehman College like macroeconomics and theater.
Ms. Reyes may have been a force behind his education, but with her income she could not provide all the tools. She receives $697 a month in Supplemental Security Income because of her disability, and she and her son get a total of $50 in food stamps every two weeks. His mother still lives in the room in Morris Heights, for which she pays $150 a month.
Because Mr. Ferreira had no computer at home, he would leave home by 6 a.m. so he could arrive at school before classes and use the computers there to finish his homework. His efforts paid off: he was accepted into 15 colleges but chose Utica, enrolling with 19 college credits.
As he was preparing to apply to college, Mr. Ferreira sought assistance from St. Raymond Community Outreach, an affiliate of Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. St. Raymond provided a $300 stipend, which he used to pay for the SAT. The organization also helped furnish his Utica dorm room with sheets, towels and a mattress.
Catholic Charities drew $350 from the fund to help pay for textbooks.
But with higher education come additional expenses. Although Mr. Ferreira received about $4,000 in grants and loans to attend Utica, he still needs to raise another $4,000 each semester.
Despite the hardships, Mr. Ferreira carries himself with a friendly air and an easy smile. He has a full schedule of academic work, attends a Zumba fitness class and is a member of the swimming team and a step-dancing team. He still enjoys learning the complex choreography of a certain musical diva.
When he imagines his life 10 years from now, Mr. Ferreira said, his career path is a little fuzzy. An engineer, perhaps? An economist? Maybe even a Zumba instructor.
One thing is clear, though: ''I do see myself in a house close to the city, living with my mother,'' he said. ''But this time, I will be supporting her.''

HEADLINE: In Turkey to Strengthen Ties, Biden Refuses to Ignore a Host's Economic Boast

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. came to this ancient city that spans Europe and Asia to talk about building bridges between the United States and the Islamic world. But on Saturday, he felt compelled to brush back a challenge from his Turkish hosts.
Mr. Biden was a keynote speaker at an annual gathering of students and young entrepreneurs that President Obama inaugurated last year as a way of encouraging American-style business in Muslim countries. This entrepreneurial spirit, Mr. Biden said, had helped to fuel the political uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa. 
But while the vice president was here to reach out, and did so in a later meeting with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he got a taste of how the economic travails in the United States and Europe have bolstered the brashness of emerging powers like Turkey, which has so far avoided the troubles in Europe and the United States.
Ali Babacan, a deputy prime minister of Turkey who oversees the economy, delivered a confident address about Turkey's future and its status as a model Muslim democracy. He attributed Europe's spiraling debt problems to its lack of political leadership.
''If they had a strong government like we have in Turkey,'' he said, ''they would be able to solve their problems.''
Mr. Babacan said that with 7.5 percent economic growth projected this year, Turkey, not the larger but troubled economies of the United States and Europe, was poised to win in the 21st century. ''The fast fish, not the big fish, eats the small fish,'' he said.
Mr. Biden then got up to speak, and after declaring that he did not plan to talk about the American economy, he did just that. First he took issue with Mr. Babacan's competitive tone, saying, ''I am going to suggest that we, all nations, are in this together.'' Then, even as he was acknowledging economic difficulties, he pointedly reminded the audience that in a sea of young sharks, the United States was still the whale.
''The fact that our economy is three-and-a-half times as large as the next-largest economy, and larger than the next four combined, does not make us immune from what's happening around the world,'' Mr. Biden said.
The vice president's aides said he had added those words to his 31-minute speech after listening to Mr. Babacan. There was no evidence that either man was ruffled by the episode. They posed next to each other with broad smiles after their speeches.
The rest of Mr. Biden's day appeared more harmonious, including his two-hour session with Mr. Erdogan, who was recuperating from a medical procedure at his private residence. Mr. Biden and his aides put on slippers and were introduced by Mr. Erdogan to his son, daughter and son-in-law, according to a senior administration official.
Turkey and the United States, NATO allies since 1952, have had a rich but complicated relationship during the Obama administration. The president has assiduously cultivated Mr. Erdogan, viewing him as part of a new generation of Muslim democratic leaders.
But the two clashed over Turkey's vote in the United Nations Security Council against harsher sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program. Turkey and Brazil tried to break the impasse with Iran -- a diplomatic gambit that the United States repudiated.
Mr. Biden appeared not to have pushed Mr. Erdogan on Iran. While the vice president made the case for continued pressure, the senior official said, the two did not discuss specific sanctions. Mr. Biden urged Mr. Erdogan to repair Turkey's badly frayed relations with Israel, and the leaders discussed the upheaval in Syria, where Mr. Erdogan has imposed sanctions and backed up the American demand that President Bashar al-Assad step down.
Despite his striking pushback, Mr. Biden made clear later in his speech that he admired Turkey's ambition. He noted that Turkey, whose economy is now the 17th largest in the world, aspired to enter the top 10 by 2023, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish republic.
''With what I know about Turkey's people and its leaders over the past 35 years, and what I've seen in the last decade, and what I've seen this week,'' he said, ''I'd say that's a pretty good bet.''

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Higher Taxes, or Lower?

 BODY:
Readers debate how the rich and corporations should be taxed.
The Letter
To the Editor:
President Obama and several Congressional Democrats have called for higher taxes on ''the rich'' as a way to help reduce the budget deficit. But we cannot ignore two negative byproducts that such a move would almost certainly entail.
First is the increased potential for tax avoidance. High-income earners, when faced with a higher tax liability, will go to great lengths to defer income, incorporate their businesses to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates, or simply stop working, among other things.
Second is the macroeconomic impact of higher taxes on the rich. Taking capital away from the very people who are most likely to create jobs will naturally result in fewer jobs. 
This is no trivial matter. Even if the economic effect is ambiguous, lawmakers should ''first, do no harm'' when considering tax changes in a fragile economy. Instead, the better course of action is comprehensive corporate tax reform. There is strong, bipartisan support inside and outside of Congress to lower corporate tax rates while getting rid of special-interest loopholes.
Such a proposal could be revenue neutral, but its effect on the economy would spur growth because the lower rates would increase production and innovation. And fewer loopholes would reduce the exorbitant compliance costs. Over all, such reform would create jobs, keep the United States competitive in the global economy and help lower the budget deficit.
ANDREW ROTH Washington, Nov. 29, 2011
The writer is vice president for government affairs at the Club for Growth, which advocates pro-growth policies, lower taxes and limited government.
Readers React
Why is it that the conservative solution is always lower taxes, despite the fact that tax rates are at near historic lows and the Bush tax cuts of the last decade did not prevent the economic quagmire into which so many in the middle class are sinking while the 1 percent remains unaffected?
Mr. Roth says higher taxes won't result in increased revenues because high-income earners will find ways around them or ''simply stop working,'' though the higher tax rates of the pre-Bush era had no noticeable effect on their work habits. And the Bush tax cuts not only failed to create jobs, but also did nothing to forestall the high unemployment and underemployment that we face today.
While comprehensive corporate tax reform is an admirable objective, corporations don't need lower tax rates to finance increased production and innovation. Corporations are already sitting on mountains of excess cash, which they are using to reward shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks while paying exorbitant salaries and bonuses to their executives.
In the short term, we must increase taxes on the ''haves'' to provide revenues for government job stimulus programs to create the jobs that we need to remain competitive in the global economy.
JAY N. FELDMAN Port Washington, N.Y., Nov. 30, 2011
One hardly knows where to begin in responding to Mr. Roth, but I'll limit myself to three points:
1. Businesses don't create jobs; customers do. Businesses hire people when there are customers to buy what they produce, not because taxes were lowered.
2. Some of America's best economictimes occurred when tax rates were much higher and executives earned far less. I'd like Mr. Roth to explain why those overtaxed and underpaid leaders of the '50s, '60s and '70s worked so hard to build successful, innovative companies.
3. Can Mr. Roth possibly understand how arrogant his ''first, do no harm'' (to the rich) sounds to the millions of Americans who have lost jobs, health insurance and homes?
BRUCE HARVILLE Madison, Wis., Nov. 30, 2011
If corporate tax reform is beneficial, as I believe it would be, why not both reform corporate taxes and revoke the Bush tax cuts on the top brackets? The choice Mr. Roth poses to do one or the other is a false one.
Also, while we're at it, why not bring back one of Ronald Reagan's significant contributions to fairness in taxation (later undone under President Clinton): make the capital gains rate equal to that on ordinary income so Warren Buffett's secretary won't have to pay taxes at a much higher rate than Mr. Buffett?
BARRY D. REIN New York, Nov. 30, 2011
Mr. Roth suggests that Congress legislate lower corporate tax rates while simultaneously removing special-interest loopholes. This sounds so sensible until you confront two huge problems associated with this approach.
First, intensive lobbying will almost surely prevent the removal of all such loopholes while the rate reduction will remain in the ensuing legislation.
Second, even if these loopholes were initially eliminated, it is surely predictable that they and others will be gradually reintroduced in future years while the new lower rates became enshrined in the political psyche.
This is exactly what happened in 1986 when many (but certainly not all) so-called loopholes were removed from the individual income tax as marginal rates were drastically reduced. Twenty-five years later, the lower rates are still with us, but the list and impact of loopholes have multiplied.
JOHN F. BECKMANN Sherman Oaks, Calif., Dec. 1, 2011
The writer is a retired certified public accountant.
My wife and I are educators and pull in a bit over $100,000 a year and would be happy to pay a little more in taxes.
What we invest individually is usually returned twofold or more in benefits for all of us. Isn't that the principle of collectivism within a democracy? We undertake projects that we as individuals could never accomplish on our own: roads, schools, police, courts, food and airline safety, clean air, health care, old-age security, the common defense and much more.
We have become such an antitax society that we have forgotten why we tax and how we can't get by without taxes. Of course, it's only fair that the richest Americans should pay a little more. But all of us, truthfully, if we are able, should pay a little more, too, not just the rich.
JOHN E. COLBERT Chicago, Nov. 30, 2011
For most years from the end of World War I to near the end of the cold war, the United States had marginal tax rates for the wealthy of 50 percent or higher (as high as 94 percent). This was a period when the United States became the dominant world power, economically, militarily, politically and culturally. High rates do not seem to have dampened American entrepreneurial spirits.
Coupled with capital gains taxes that required long-term investment to reap their benefits, these taxes did something far more important for the economy than raise government revenue: they curtailed personal greed. The ''greed tax'' greatly discouraged corporate and financial services executives from focusing primarily on personal enrichment. Instead, during this period executives focused their efforts on building companies intended to last.
After the Reagan tax cuts, which eliminated these high marginal rates, executive pay soared from 40 times a line worker's pay to 300 times and higher. Without the greed tax, executives quickly put short-term personal gain well ahead of the long-term interests of their companies.
The greed tax may well have been the single and simplest policy for growth that has ever existed. America's decline began when it was trashed. High rates should be reinstated not just for revenue but for the sake of the nation.
ROBERT AVILA Astoria, Queens, Dec. 1, 2011
If raising taxes on the rich invites evasion, this is not an argument against raising taxes but in favor of eliminating the countless loopholes that allow the rich to evade taxes.
And if capital formation truly depended upon huge tax breaks for the rich, then the post-World War II economy would have never gotten off the ground.
For a long time Republican fiscal policy has been based on moving the burden of taxation from capital to labor. In the last 30 years that policy has succeeded, at enormous cost to middle- and working-class Americans.
EDWARD BAKER Seattle, Nov. 30, 2011
In response to Mr. Roth's letter on modernizing corporate income taxation, why stop with just a reduction in rates? Economists have long pointed out that there is a basic unfairness and economic distortion in first taxing corporate income and then taxing shareholders on dividends paid out by corporations from their after-tax earnings.
When one considers that corporate income taxes are almost fully passed on to consumers in the cost of goods and services sold, the corporate income tax is much like a disguised sales tax borne by consumers.
So scrap the corporate income tax completely and replace it with a consumption sales tax (with generous exemptions to protect the less wealthy).
WINTHROP DRAKE THIES New York, Nov. 30, 2011
The writer is a retired tax attorney.
Mr. Roth states that high-income earners, faced with higher tax rates, ''will go to great lengths'' to employ strategies of tax avoidance. Does he mean that the wealthy will send even more business than they currently do to the accounting and legal professions, as well as to the lobbyists? If this is true, then the proposed tax increase on those who can clearly afford it would seem to be a boon for job creation in those fields.
He goes on to state that the high earners may ''simply stop working.'' Would they really resign out of spite rather than return to pre-Bush-era tax rates? To them I say, Don't wait, quit now and thereby create job opportunities for the rest of us.
GARY WISS New York, Dec. 1, 2011
The Writer Responds
Despite the overall negative tone in the readers' responses, I found some agreement that comprehensive corporate tax reform is a good idea. That's encouraging. Let's hope Congress runs with it. But I was also struck by a couple of things that were quite diametric from common-sense business practices and the empirical evidence.
Mr. Feldman says that corporations don't ''need'' lower taxes to increase production because they are already sitting on a pile of cash. But that is precisely why lower taxes are needed. Currently in the market, there is a large supply of idle labor (higher than usual unemployment) and a large supply of idle capital (companies sitting on cash). The only way to produce value is to marry those two things.
But there is a huge wedge preventing that from happening. Companies aren't investing because the obstacles to production are too high. Those obstacles include market uncertainty, overreaching regulations and, yes, taxes. Removing those obstacles, or lessening them, will spur growth.
Mr. Rein recommends raising the capital gains tax. This is the single worst thing we can do to help repair the country's finances. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, when we have raised or lowered the capital gains tax rate over the last 30 years, the opposite has occurred with regard to government revenue.
As for the matter of fairness, Warren Buffett has already amassed his fortune. Raising capital gains taxes will not change that, but it will take longer for his secretary to create her own personal wealth by taxing her more on her own investments.

HEADLINE: Riding the Republican Roller Coaster

BYLINE: By ARTHUR S. BRISBANE

 BODY:
RICHARD STEVENSON, the political editor who has overseen national election coverage for The New York Times since 2006, was explaining why this presidential contest was not the stunted affair I told him I thought it was.
''If 2008 was an epic clash of personalities and historical figures,'' he said, ''2012 is very possibly an epic clash of ideologies and ideas at a moment of palpable crisis, both in terms of the immediate economic situation and in terms of a vision of the place of America in the world. So this election really is going to mean a lot.''
In an interview last week, Mr. Stevenson discussed The Times's campaign coverage strategy. The big questions, as he sees them, are whether President Obama will experience ''one of the most dramatic rise-and-fall stories in the history of American politics,'' and whether the Republicans, knowing they have a real chance to unseat the president, will seize the opportunity or fumble it. 
Truly epic, one has to agree. But the epic phase must wait while President Obama bides his time and the Republican primary campaign bumps toward clarity. For the moment, The Times and other news organizations are stuck with covering a Republican contest that political historians and other experts say may be an unprecedented exercise in whack-a-mole primary politics.
''I have never seen so much movement in the national polls this early in the process,'' said William G. Mayer, a Northeastern University political science professor who has written extensively about presidential nomination campaigns. ''I can't think of a precedent for the way that Romney was up, then Perry comes along. He is way up and then drops like a stone. Then Herman Cain comes along, gets this big rise and he drops. Then Newt Gingrich comes along. You don't normally get this much movement early in the cycle.''
And that does not include Michele Bachmann, who enjoyed her own rise and fall before Rick Perry's parabolic flight. It is an exceptional pattern, said Thomas E. Patterson, a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, who wrote the groundbreaking 1993 book ''Out of Order,'' in which he identified the rising tendency of journalists to impose their own point of view on campaigns.
In this campaign, he noted, the press in some ways ''has been deprived of a narrative because as these candidates have shot up in the polls in series, with Perry and Cain and so on, the problem is they have melted in the spotlight. They have disappeared before the narrative could get established.''
The campaign is ''event-driven,'' he said, buffeted by debate performances, good and bad, and a few big news stories, like The Washington Post's piece on Mr. Perry's hunting camp where a rock was painted with a racial slur, and Politico's report on sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Cain. In this environment, Mr. Patterson says, it is hard for The Times or any other news outlet to lead ''because all the journalists are looking at the same thing at the same time.''
Tom Rosenstiel tracks how the news media has covered the candidates so far. The Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism, which he directs, has identified a clear dynamic:
A debate gaffe generates a viral video and a candidate goes down. On the other side of the equation, one good debate performance alone does not necessarily move the poll needle positively, but successive good performances do. In turn, ''rising poll numbers tend to correlate with good press attention,'' Mr. Rosenstiel said. ''The press says, 'Oh, the guy is rising in the polls.' '' With the increased attention comes fast-response vetting of the rising candidate, exemplified last week by a couple of tough Times articles about Mr. Gingrich.
One candidate who seems to float outside this dynamic is Ron Paul, the Texas libertarian. The Project for Excellence in Journalism says he is getting weak coverage despite poll numbers now putting him in the top half of the pack.
On this point, Steve Bowen, a Times reader in Tulsa, Okla., wrote me to say: ''One must wonder about why The Times and other major media refuse to allow their reporters to cover Ron Paul in at least the amounts afforded to other candidates. Especially those who poll well below his numbers.''
Which brings us back to Mr. Stevenson and The Times's approach to a campaign that wants to be epic but remains stuck in its pre-epic phase.
''Not all candidates are created equal,'' he said. ''We do not feel compelled to treat every candidate with the same intensity or seriousness as we do others.''
Should Mr. Paul surprise with a very strong showing in Iowa, Mr. Stevenson may have to rethink. For now The Times has made judgment calls about who gets what. Mitt Romney,Perry,Gingrich and Cain all have a beat reporter assigned to their campaigns, while the rest of the field gets what Mr. Stevenson calls ''zone coverage.''
Meanwhile, the national political correspondents Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg operate more loosely to follow developments, with Mr. Zeleny focusing on campaign dynamics and Mr. Rutenberg on investigative matters. The stable also includes another investigator and specialists in campaign finance and campaign advertising. Finally, there are four ''biography'' writers who go deep and wide.
The volatility of the race requires quick reflexes, yet seriously vetting a candidate in-depth takes time. Mr. Stevenson said the paper has commissioned some deep background work that had to be shelved because the candidate involved was tanking by the time the reporting was ready.
And then there are the stories that do run but that some readers wish had not. A Nov. 24 article on Mr. Romney's signature hairstyle drew this response from Frances Rabinowitz of Brooklyn: ''Does an article about Mitt Romney's haircut and choice of style give us important information about his qualifications to lead our country as president?''
Mr. Stevenson replied that The Times writes regularly about weighty matters, but ''that doesn't mean we can't have some fun now and then, especially when we can use a lighter piece to give readers another way to think about the candidates and the race.''
So that's where things stand early in the campaign: reader complaints trickling in, but no profound outpourings yet. It is a pre-epic whack-a-mole contest in which the only thing holding steady is Mitt Romney's hair.

HEADLINE: This Is a Big Deal

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
IN many ways, President Obama has been a disappointment on energy and the environment. He has been completely missing in action on the climate debate. His decision to block his own Environmental Protection Agency from setting new rules to cut smog levels was disappointing. And, while I believe in using the balance sheet of the U.S. government to spur clean-tech research and start-ups, Solyndra was a case of embarrassing excess -- precisely what happens when you rely too much on government push not consumer pull, spurred by price and regulatory signals.
But, for me, all is forgiven -- because Obama came through big-time last month. 
He backed his great E.P.A. administrator, Lisa Jackson, and Department of Transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, in producing a deal with all the top U.S.-based automakers that will go into effect in 2017 and require annual mileage improvements of 5 percent for cars, and a little less for light trucks and S.U.V.'s, until 2025 -- when U.S. automakers will have to reach a total fleet average of 54.5 miles per gallon. The current average is 27.5 m.p.g.
This deal will help America's cars and trucks approach the mileage levels of Europe and Japan and spur innovation in power trains, aerodynamics, batteries, electric cars and steel and aluminum that will make cars lighter and safer.
The E.P.A. and the Transportation Department estimate that these new innovations will gradually add about $2,000 to the cost of an average vehicle by 2025 and will save more than $6,000 in gasoline purchases over the life of that car -- savings that will go into the rest of the economy. And all that assumes that gasoline prices will only moderately increase and there are no innovation breakthroughs beyond what we anticipate. If gasoline prices soar higher and innovation goes faster -- both highly likely -- the savings would be even more.
The new vehicles sold over the life of the program -- including its first phase between 2012 and 2016 -- are expected to save a total of four billion barrels of oil and prevent two billion metric tons of greenhouse gas pollution.
This is a big deal -- a legacy deal for Obama that will make a significant, long-term contribution to America's energy, environmental, health and national security agendas.
The compromise was worked out between the E.P.A. and the Transportation Department with General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, BMW and six other major car companies. It was announced Nov. 16 and came about largely because once the Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide was a pollutant -- and once California made clear that it and several other states were going to impose their own improved auto emissions standards, if the federal government didn't -- the major auto companies saw the handwriting on the wall and entered into talks with the Obama administration on a deal that will transform the industry.
The Global Automakers trade association -- which endorsed the deal because it gives the industry long-term regulatory certainty to do research and invest -- called the Obama plan a ''comprehensive and harmonized national approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy ... while providing manufacturers the needed flexibility and lead time to design and build advanced technology vehicles.''
Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign of the Center for Auto Safety, said the mileage deal ''is the biggest single step that any nation has taken to cut global warming pollution,'' but he cautioned that, like any Washington compromise, it does contain loopholes that ''give the auto companies opportunities to behave irresponsibly -- if they choose.'' If the companies' total fleet mix of cars and trucks stays roughly as projected, they would hit the 54.5 m.p.g. target by 2025. But, because the deal allows for a weaker mileage standard for trucks than cars, Becker added, ''if the industry as a whole decides to make many more trucks than now projected, we will not achieve the 54.5 m.p.g. target, although average mileage would still improve significantly from today's levels.''
Naturally, the E.P.A.-haters hate the deal. They focus on the increase in vehicle costs that will phase in over 13 years -- and ignore the net savings to consumers, plus the national security, innovation, jobs, climate and health benefits. These critics are the same ''conservatives for OPEC'' who, after Congress agreed in 1975 on a 10-year program to raise the fleet average mileage of American cars from 15 m.p.g. to 27.5 m.p.g., got together not only to halt mileage improvements in American vehicles during the Reagan administration, but to roll them back. This helped to drastically slow U.S. auto mileage innovation and ultimately helped to bankrupt the American auto industry and make sure the United States remained addicted to oil.
Of course, today's G.O.P., whose energy policy was best described by Lisa Jackson as ''too dirty to fail'' -- i.e., we can't close any polluting power plants or impose cleaner air rules because it might cost jobs -- is fighting a last-ditch effort to scuttle the deal. Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican and chairman of the House oversight committee, is leading the charge to kill it. What a thing to be proud of.

HEADLINE: Building a Better Mitt-Bot

BYLINE: By ROBERT DRAPER

 BODY:
''Your story about dust regulation captures my interest,'' Mitt Romney said to the farmer, sounding as if he actually meant it. It was a late October afternoon in Treynor, Iowa, the setting for one of those campaign meta-events at which a presidential candidate enjoys a casual moment with real people that is in fact carefully staged and dutifully broadcast by multitudes of local and national reporters hovering a few feet away. In this instance, Romney was participating in a round-table discussion with a dozen local businessmen -- his kind of folks -- and exhibiting his teacher's-pet flair for spewing out entrepreneurial minutiae. 
He peppered them with questions. To an energy producer: ''High sulfur or low sulfur content? And how clean is the system you're able to employ? Do you have a trading system for SOx and NOx?'' To a feedlot operator, Romney inquired about the number of heads of cattle and their intended purpose. And while discussing renewable energy with an ethanol C.E.O., the candidate offered up a modest smile and said: ''When I was a boy, the kind of numbers -- help me with my memory on this -- but an acre could produce 60 bushels of corn. And now it's about 160 bushels of corn, is that about right?''
''Governor, I'm sorry, but we're running a little short on time,'' Romney's advance director, Will Ritter, cut in a few minutes later.
''O.K., I'll be a little bit shorter,'' the candidate promised. Nonetheless, all of this unscripted, free-enterprise small talk cohered into a larger point -- indeed, it was the point, the message, the Tao of Mitt, if you will -- and in case anyone failed to see it, the candidate spelled it out during the round-table discussion: ''I can only tell you this from spending 25 years in business: I understand business.''
That same day, the local organizers had planned press availability with Romney. But the national campaign nixed the idea -- just as it had long dispensed with the freewheeling ''Ask Mitt Anything'' Q. and A.'s, some 200 of which the candidate subjected himself to during the 2008 campaign. ''You can't control the message,'' one of Romney's senior advisers later explained to me. ''But at a business round table, it's much more easily controlled because you're having a group of businessmen, and you're talking about the economy and the challenges that they may be facing, and Mitt is very conversant on those points.''
Similarly, this adviser went on, Romney's five sons, who were ubiquitous features of the previous campaign -- and whose affluent preppiness was the subject of much snarky commentary -- would be far less present this time around. ''The campaign's interest and focus is on the economy message, not so much on showing the entire dimension of the family.'' He went on, ''It just doesn't fit.'' After the eldest Romney boy, Tagg, was teasingly invited in a Twitter post to ''tailgate for the next debate'' by the daughters of Jon Huntsman, ''he wanted to Tweet with the Huntsman girls,'' said the adviser. Smiling faintly, the adviser added, ''No Tweeting.''
Mitt Romney's campaign has decided upon a rather novel approach to winning the presidency. It has taken a smart and highly qualified but largely colorless candidate and made him exquisitely one-dimensional: All-Business Man, the world's most boring superhero. In the recent past, aspirants and their running mates have struggled to clear the regular-guy bar. Dan Quayle lacked a sense of struggle; Michael Dukakis couldn't emote even when asked what he would do if his wife were raped and murdered; George H. W. Bush seemed befuddled by a grocery-store scanner; John Kerry was a windsurfer; John McCain couldn't count all of his houses.
Romney, a socially awkward Mormon with squishy conservative credentials and a reported worth in the range of $190 million to $250 million, is betting that in 2012, recession-weary voters want a fixer, not a B.F.F. As the Romney campaign's chief strategist, Stuart Stevens, told me: ''The economy is overwhelmingly the issue. Our whole campaign is premised on the idea that this is a referendum on Obama, the economy is a disaster and Obama is uniquely blocked from being able to talk about jobs.''
Meanwhile, Romney has been the race's putative front-runner from the outset. It's true that a low ceiling of support has loomed over him for months, while Republicans have anxiously searched all corners for an alternative. Nonetheless, his challengers appear to be self-immolating one by one and have done little to warrant his attention. Whenever Romney does step out of his tightly circumscribed ''I understand business'' framework, it is to appeal to conservatives by attacking the president's dubious appreciation of capitalism -- saying that Obama ''fails to understand America,'' that he regards the United States as ''just another country with a flag'' and that he takes his inspiration ''from the socialist Democrats of Europe.''
I heard Romney make the last two comments during recent campaign stops in Iowa, where the first Republican contest will take place Jan. 3. In a clear reversal of previous election cycles, a Bloomberg poll last month indicated that 71 percent of Iowa Republicans polled viewed fiscal concerns as the predominant issue. Iowa is there for Romney to win. The same poll showed Herman Cain with 20 percent support, Ron Paul with 19 percent, Romney with 18 percent and Newt Gingrich with 17 percent. (In recent weeks, Gingrich has risen, following Perry's and Cain's reigns as candidate of the moment.) The statistical dead heat reveals that this time around, the social conservatives who tend to predominate at the Iowa caucuses -- and who view Romney with deep distrust -- have yet to coalesce around a particular favorite, as they did with the former Arkansas governor and Baptist preacher Mike Huckabee in 2008. Back then, Huckabee benefited from an unexpectedly high turnout, taking 34 percent of the vote to Romney's 25 percent.
In this year's muddled field, his staff believes that he could win with his totals from 2008. They also believe that he doesn't have to win Iowa -- that he could take second or even third and then move on to New Hampshire, where he maintains a summer home and is considered a heavy favorite. Amid a flawed and far less financially endowed field, Romney's staff has every reason to believe that he could effectively clinch the nomination in less than a month, after the Florida primary on Jan. 31.
There's a far less favorable possibility, of course, and it, too, begins with the Iowa contest, which the Romney campaign views with great wariness, as if it might be some kind of sting operation. Despite the obvious rewards of going all in and delivering an early knockout blow in Iowa, Romney's advisers do not want to risk ginning up expectations that their candidate may again fail to meet. Even worse, they fear that he will reanimate the image of him as a flip-flopper willing to tell the state's conservatives whatever they wish to hear, which in turn will dog him into New Hampshire and beyond as it did the last time around. As Doug Gross, the 2008 Romney campaign's Iowa chairman, told me: ''He tried to be somebody he wasn't. That's why he lost.''
The spin Romney himself puts on his minimalist approach is that after nearly four years of nonstop campaigning, ''people know me pretty well.'' And yet the unintended signal sent by his narrow casting is that the less said about Mitt Romney, the better. Obama's strategists ran an entire presidential campaign through the affecting tapestry of his own narrative. Romney -- who has written two books, both scantily personal -- maintains an uneasy distance from his own life story, steeped as it is in privilege, Mormonism and the murky art of political compromise. His avoidance of these subjects does not mean that they will go away, only that his opponents will have an opening to frame them as they wish.
Still, it may well be that this strategy of underwhelming force ends up fitting perfectly with a pervasive sense of disillusionment with the once-dazzling Obama. In the aftermath of failed romance with the One, perhaps the electorate will come to settle on Mitt Romney as the One Who Won't Break Your Heart.
The unmarked three-story waterfront building at 585 Commercial Street at the base of the Charlestown Bridge in Boston's North End seems more aptly suited for a numbers racket than for Mitt Romney's campaign headquarters. In 2007, during Romney's previous campaign, burglars (apparently unaffiliated politically) broke in and made off with several computers. Plans to demolish the vacant structure and replace it with condominiums were forestalled, allowing the Romneyites to move back in last year. This fall, a group of Occupy Boston protesters brought nearby traffic to a standstill but were unaware of the building's inhabitants and left it unharassed.
The equally bleak panorama inside -- grimy industrial carpet, halfhearted wall adornments and the occasional piece of paper taped to a door announcing that the person inside is in charge of ''Strategy'' or some such -- is a testament both to a campaign's tunnel vision and to the fact that the wealthy Romney is a rather tightfisted fellow. (For a time, he elected to save money at his PAC headquarters in Lexington by not installing land lines, even though cellphones did not work inside the building.) Particularly unkempt is the corner office on the second floor, with its clutter of unused exercise equipment, mislaid cups of espresso and a blender half-full of yesterday's purple energy drink. Its occupant is the Romney campaign's chief strategist, Stuart Stevens.
Stevens, a 58-year old Mississippi native (whom I have known for over a decade), is as wry, eclectic and mussed in appearance as his boss is earnest and buttoned up. Stevens has skied the North Pole, run successful campaigns in Albania and the Democratic Republic of Congo and assisted Vice President Dick Cheney in his debate preparation against John Edwards in 2004. He wrote an early episode of the hit TV series ''Northern Exposure'' and consulted on Hollywood projects (including the movie ''The Ides of March'') with the politics junkie George Clooney, who after spending considerable time in Washington finally agreed with Stevens's contention that it is the most sexless city in America. Though Stevens's customary facial expression is the faintly smiling, middle-distance squint of someone lost in abstraction, he can be direct and combative in the extreme and has the reputation, as a prominent G.O.P. consultant who admires Stevens's talent put it, of one who ''does not play well with others.''
Stevens gravitates toward nonideological Republicans -- his client list has included Bob Dole, Charlie Crist and another former G.O.P. governor of Massachusetts, William Weld -- and hoped to run Romney's 2002 gubernatorial campaign. But he was beaten out by Mike Murphy, an equally colorful strategist (the two dislike each other). In the summer of 2007, after defecting with his business partner, Russ Schriefer, from the McCain campaign to produce ads for the Romney team, Stevens found that he had joined an already top-heavy staff -- and that Murphy, among others, had already laid out a jumble of messaging strategies. As one Romney adviser now concedes: ''We brought on a lot of people because we didn't know what we didn't know. We were new to the national stage, and we wanted as much input and advice as we could get, and we also wanted to demonstrate to the world that we could win that invisible primary. So we had a lot of voices, and they weren't unanimous on every point.''
Even Romney, for whom heaven is an eternal round-table discussion, came to recognize that the proliferation of highly paid consultants had reached the point of diminishing returns. This time around, he has pared down his front office. Still onboard are a few old hands; one of them, Beth Myers, told Romney that the 2008 campaign lacked a single day-to-day strategist -- and that for 2012, Stuart Stevens should be that person.
Stevens and his partner, Schriefer, have instilled focus in a campaign that previously seemed a bit grasping. Gone is the weighty Romney entourage as well as the lavish ad buys, which always struck Stevens as presumptuous. (A favorite Stevens axiom: ''If you don't enter this process humbly, you will leave it humbly.'') Though he does not seem terribly intimidated by Romney's Republican opponents -- to Stevens, Rick Perry brings to mind the townies in the early scenes of ''The Deer Hunter'' who go loping into Vietnam expecting to kick butt -- he refers to the Obama team as ''the best campaign organization ever put together'' and reminds his colleagues, ''The only thing more intoxicating than getting elected president is the terror of losing the power of the White House. They'll fight savagely to hang onto that power.''
Stevens devised the campaign's refrain ''Obama Isn't Working,'' with its dreary recession visuals and testimonials from the jobless posted on a Romney Web site. The strategist's gift for withering criticism is rubbing off on his boss. Though Romney now and again employs distinctly Mitt-like language when referring to the president as a ''well-intentioned'' man who's simply ''out of his depth,'' the candidate increasingly cleaves to the more jut-jawed message that Obama has ''failed America'' and doesn't get ''what makes America work'' -- which segues to the virtues of the ubercapitalist Romney, whose new campaign slogan is ''Believe in America.''
In the meantime, Stevens and other advisers have counseled Romney to ignore attacks from disapproving conservatives, like the comment made by the Baptist pastor and Perry supporter Robert Jeffress that ''Mormonism is a cult.'' (''Four years ago, that would have set off all sorts of alarm bells -- we would have tried to mobilize our evangelical supporters to counter what Jeffress and others have been saying,'' a senior staff member told me.) Romney has quietly courted key figures in the Tea Party movement since its inception two years ago: among his PAC's first donations was one to the Congressional campaign of Michele Bachmann; he was the first major figure to endorse the current South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley; and he also gave to the losing campaigns of Sharron Angle of Nevada and Christine O'Donnell of Delaware.
But the Romney campaign has made its peace with -- and in the general election may make a virtue out of -- the fact that he remains despised by the far right. Among this segment is Iowa's most prominent Tea Party activist, Ryan Rhodes, who told me that Romney's campaign has not reached out to him and who also said, ''You look at his health care plan, the fact that he hired people who lobbied for Solyndra -- it takes those issues off the table that you could tie around Obama's neck.'' He went on: ''I don't think he has a major belief system. He's Mitt Romney. He's a manager, O.K.?''
In the past, Romney, an English major in college, was reluctant to let others put words in his mouth. But those running his campaign felt that his prose tended to accentuate Romney's blandness and wasn't a good use of his time. (''During the 2008 campaign,'' one staff member says, snickering, ''I used to tell people: 'We're not very happy with our speechwriter, and we want to fire him. His name's Mitt, and he works on the third floor.' '') Stevens, who has made a second career out of writing dialogue for recurring TV characters, persuaded Romney to surrender the speechwriting responsibilities to him -- and in recent weeks, Stevens in turn has deferred to the punchy prose of Lindsay Hayes, a former speechwriter for Sarah Palin.
Stevens has also played a hand in Romney's much-lauded debate performances, which have buttressed the candidate's assertion that he is best equipped to take on the rhetorically deft Obama. The previous campaign's debate sessions were, says one adviser, ''like an Economics 101 course in college, just a lot of people sitting auditorium-style with their computers.'' This year's prepping has involved fewer contributors conjuring sound bites. ''All we do is argue,'' says Stevens, who has coached Romney to not get entangled in the specifics of a question. Instead: Hear the topic, zone out the rest, say what you're about, don't get hung up on how the crowd responds. It's not about the room. It's about the answer.
Another Stevens maxim is ''You've got to dig the ditch you're going to die in'' -- or, less metaphorically, ''You have to be willing to lose,'' a slogan that he and Schriefer inscribed on a message board early on in the campaign. It's a rousing sentiment that Romney has taken to heart in his forceful defense of the Massachusetts health care law that some admirers have begged the ex-governor to disavow. During such moments, Romney seems to project the confident air of a chief executive who spends little time fretting over what other people think.
More often, however, Mitt Romney the data-driven former corporate consultant seems like a man puzzling his way to victory, doing and saying whatever might solve the problem immediately at hand. In Iowa, I watched as the candidate confronted the dicey issue of ethanol subsidies at the Treynor business round table like a man who had no intentions of losing, dying, ditch-digging or anything else except ingratiating. First he stipulated that ''I supported the subsidy of ethanol to help get the industry on its feet.'' After qualifying that support by saying, ''I didn't feel the subsidy needed to go on forever,'' Romney noted that the subsidy was due to expire in December anyway. He qualified that observation by remarking, ''I might've looked at more of a decline over time. . . .'' But, he cheerfully observed, ''most people I know in the ethanol industry say, 'Fine -- we're now up and going.' '' Lest anyone doubt his commitment, Romney reminded his audience, ''For me, ethanol is part of national security -- it is part of America developing our own energy. . . . And I would like to see the ethanol industry continue to be successful to grow and to provide a growing share of America's domestic energy sources.
''And how to do that,'' he finished with an unsteady grin, ''as Ross Perot used to say, I'm all ears!''
Among Stevens's colorful analogies, the unlikeliest is one in which he compares Romney to Michael Vick, the dynamic quarterback of the Philadelphia Eagles. ''Michael Vick's not a real good pocket guy,'' Stevens told me. ''So don't tell him he can't roll out. Try to make him the best rollout guy that's ever played.'' And indeed, Romney's staff has endeavored to focus the campaign on his strengths, which are decidedly the opposite of Vick's. So instead of letting their quarterback roam and improvise, they're keeping him tightly contained in the business-centric pocket, hoping to God that he does not stray from it.
Romney has been spending a great deal of time lately with Republicans who want to like him. On Oct. 26, he met with 61 Republican members of Congress who had either already endorsed him or were considering doing so. ''The thing I try to convey to my colleagues is, 'Mitt Romney is not going to embarrass you -- he's the most vetted candidate out there,' '' says Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, who helped organize the gathering. In that sense, Romney did not disappoint. Though he devoted the bulk of his talk to the economy, he also made the point, Chaffetz says, ''that in the general election he's going to be very attractive to both Republicans and independents.''
Still, one attendee was annoyed when Romney gave a lengthy explanation for his conversion on the abortion issue and then concluded with the stilted formulation, ''I come down on the side of pro-life.'' The representative confronted Romney and said, ''That's not going to work with my rural voters.''
Another congressman, Darrell Issa of California, offered the former Massachusetts governor a suggestion. ''Instead of always telling people this is what you're going to do, tell them how you did it,'' Issa said. ''Like when you had a budget deficit and went through it line by line with each department head -- that really resonates with people who go through their own budgets line by line. It's more personal.''
Romney considered the idea, then carefully said, ''I'm going to have to figure out how to do that.'' Implicit in his response was that Romney's four years dealing with the Democrat-controlled Massachusetts State Legislature -- one in which the governor showed himself to be, as one adviser puts it, ''a conciliator'' and ''a practical politician'' -- is a story best left for the general election. (Or avoided entirely. As another Romney campaign strategist observes, ''It's a terrible time to be running based on your experience in government.'')
Later that afternoon, Romney met with two House Republican leaders: Paul Ryan, the Budget Committee chairman, and Kevin McCarthy, the majority whip. Romney wanted to discuss Medicare reform with Ryan, who says he encouraged the candidate to ''be bold, be specific and defend yourself.'' The plan Romney would unveil a week later -- one that allows future senior citizens to choose between traditional Medicare and a private health insurance plan -- amounts to a compromise proposal that Ryan acknowledges/ is politically safer than his, and which he is ''perfectly comfortable with.''
McCarthy also counseled boldness. ''Look, no candidate ever wants to have a primary challenge, but it always makes you stronger,'' the majority whip told Romney. He added, ''You've got to have that Reagan-and-the-microphone moment.'' (He was referring to the 1980 debate in which the candidate Reagan proclaimed, ''I am paying for this microphone,'' appearing decisive.) ''People are just starving for a leader,'' McCarthy said.
Hearing such stories, you get the notion that Republicans yearning for victory are calling out for something brilliant and yet unseen to burst out of Romney's gray chrysalis. Simultaneously earthbound and, as one Republican congresswoman puts it, ''a little too perfect,'' Romney seems, even to himself, an ill fit for his newly chosen vocation. While trying to win over voters in New Hampshire in early 2008, he turned to an aide and said: ''You know, I've done a lot of stuff. I've started companies, I ran companies, I ran the Olympics. This is by far the hardest thing I've ever done!'' He added, laughing, ''Why didn't anybody tell me?''
The chief vulnerability of the Romney campaign resides with the understandable decision to keep their anti-Michael Vick in the pocket, thereby limiting our view of the man. Those who at close range watched Romney's failure to close the deal in 2008 did not witness a rejection per se. Instead, it appeared that Republican voters could not quite envision this decent, clever and socially uneasy fellow governing their country -- as opposed to, say, managing their stock portfolios. Stories of Romney's wooden people skills are legion. ''The Mormon's never going to win the who-do-you-want-to-have-a-beer-with contest,'' concedes one adviser, while another acknowledges, ''He's never had the experience of sitting in a bar, and like, talking.''
To his admiring subordinates, Romney is the man who, while waiting in an aide's garage during an advertising shoot, took it upon himself to sweep it spick-and-span. He is the boss who hosted a 2008 post-mortem at his house in Belmont, Mass., and instead of demanding answers or fixing blame, passed out photo albums of the campaign for each staff member to keep. One longtime aide maintains that Romney is, no matter how much of a corporate barracuda the Democrats make him out to be, ''more Richie Cunningham of 'Happy Days' than Gordon Gekko'' of ''Wall Street.'' And he possesses an almost otherworldly unflappability -- seen, for example, on a public street in 2009, when a detractor who recognized Romney cursed at him.''Well!'' remarked Romney to a companion. ''I guess somebody's having a bad day!''
Romney's associates maintain that his genial and humble aspect masks a voracious intellect. A longtime friend of Romney's explained to me that a desire to digest all available viewpoints was the thread that ran through the candidate's entire professional life. At Bain Capital, said the friend, Romney ''wanted hardworking people who would challenge him -- he plays devil's advocate, trying not only to understand what you think the answer is but what your depth of thinking is.'' While turning around the troubled Winter Olympics in Utah, ''he brought in a management team with divergent views.'' As governor, Romney ''wanted a cabinet that would argue different points of view.''
The friend then hastened to assure me that Romney was, beyond all that discursiveness, a decisive leader. But as a presidential candidate, he does not always display his intellectual rigor in his policy proposals. An adviser once told me about how in 2007 Romney reacted to the news that the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was planning on visiting ground zero during a United Nations convention. First, the candidate engaged in a debate with his foreign-policy aide, Dan Senor. Then the two men switched sides and argued opposite positions. Finally, Romney called for someone to bring him the United Nations Charter, which he read and discussed at length with Senor.
But in the end, Romney's response to the Ahmadinejad visit was unremarkable. He released a four-sentence press statement denouncing the Iranian leader's intentions as ''shockingly audacious'' and concluding that rather than ''entertaining Ahmadinejad, we should be indicting him.''
I asked the campaign staff if I could talk to Romney about his economic proposals. They replied that in the interests of controlling the campaign's message, the candidate would not be participating in any profiles or ''proc/ess stories.'' Instead, they suggested I speak with the campaign's policy director, Lanhee Chen, a highly respected Harvard Ph.D., who did his best to characterize Romney's views. The problem is that when you look beneath Mitt Romney's critique of the Obama economy, his remedies feel a bit thin.
Asked what President Romney would have done during his first days in office, in lieu of a federal stimulus, to address the market meltdown, Chen rattled off a few likely options: ''Lowering the corporate tax rate. Enacting a permanent extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Immediately ratifying our pending trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. In the energy sector, freeing up the necessary land to enable greater domestic production.'' He did not make clear how Romney would have steered these boilerplate conservative proposals through a Democrat-controlled Congress.
I asked Chen about Romney's recent recommendation that the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment of the Arts be targeted for federal spending cuts. Was the candidate proposing that these two federal agencies, long opposed by conservative groups, be eliminated altogether? ''We haven't specifically discussed that,'' Chen said.
These programs had a combined annual budget of less than $500 million. Meanwhile, Romney previously criticized President George W. Bush's Medicare Part D prescription-drug program for its exorbitant cost -- ''the actual balance-sheet impact . . . [is] now estimated to be approximately $8 trillion,'' he wrote. Had Romney discussed repealing the pricey entitlement? ''It was not under consideration,'' Chen replied.
Romney's policy director had thorough responses to about half of my inquiries. He didn't know if the candidate's heavy criticism of Obama's ''green jobs'' initiatives meant that Romney was skeptical of a green-jobs industry on its face. He didn't know what exemptions Romney would eliminate in pursuit of a flatter tax code. Asked if Romney agreed with Michele Bachmann's sentiment that every adult American should pay taxes, Chen replied, ''I don't have anything for you there.'' Finally, I asked for clarification of a remark I heard Romney make on the campaign trail in western Iowa: ''You cannot have a strong economy without strong families and strong values.'' While I could appreciate how that sentiment would appeal to Iowa's social conservatives, the logic wasn't especially clear.
''You know, it's a general comment on the importance that strong families have in our country's economic strength,'' Chen said. He recalled that Romney expanded on the topic at the Values Voters Summit a few weeks back and referred me to the speech.
Here is what it says on the subject: ''The foundation needed for a strong economy and a strong military is a people of strong values.''
Romney's newest book, ''No Apology,'' similarly represents how the candidate's intellectual vigor gives ground to political calibrations. Romney decided to write the book immediately after bowing out of the race in February 2008. ''I can live with everything that happened in the campaign,'' he told aides. What frustrated him was his inability to articulate a vision for the country. Two advisers recall a meeting in the summer of 2008 at which Romney cited as a literary inspiration a book that had been on his mind, about the decline of France following the mass protests of the 1960s -- and then proceeded to translate it aloud from French.
While touring the country raising funds for Republican candidates that summer, Romney also pored over texts from British leftists arguing why America's decline as a superpower should be welcomed. He told aides to thrash out big ideas for the book, and he envisioned gathering roomfuls of experts. After first hiring a ghostwriter, Romney then decided that he would prefer to write it himself. He spent most of the first half of 2009 at his new home in La Jolla, Calif., typing away on his laptop while e-mailing his researcher for details on radical Islam and the fall of the Roman Empire.
For those political insiders who had been hearing murmurs that Romney was intending to write a ''Tom Friedman-esque'' book, it came as something of a surprise to read ''No Apology'' -- a data-packed but mostly familiar defense of American exceptionalism that, as the title indicates, also devotes ample space to condemning President Obama's supposed tendency to apologize on the world stage for America's moral lapses. Where Romney's book strikes an unusual chord, for a politician anyway, is in its frank recognition that for innovation to thrive, governments must stand back and allow the ''creative destruction'' of obsolete industries -- and the jobs they produce. Readers will recognize in such passages the brisk realism of Mitt Romney, corporate consultant.
Squaring such sentiments with the Mitt Romney who won the Michigan primary in January 2008 is more vexing. More than one adviser told me that Michigan was where Romney ''found his voice'' -- an odd claim, given the widespread view at the time that the primary featured Mitt Romney at his most pandering. While the front-runner, McCain, delivered ''straight talk'' that some industries in Michigan were unlikely to be rejuvenated and that worker retraining was the more prudent course than trying to ''recreate the past'' -- an argument for creative destruction -- Romney labeled his opponent a defeatist and sunnily pledged ''to fight for every single job.'' (Ten months later, Romney returned to his Bain mind-set and wrote an Op-Ed in The New York Times titled, ''Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.'')
Another side of Mitt Romney is ever-so-briefly revealed in ''No Apology'' -- that of a former lay pastor, or ''stake president,'' at his Mormon church in Boston. Serving in that capacity, Romney wrote, ''I cannot count the number of times I consoled or counseled a person who had lost a job.'' In a couple of short but moving paragraphs, the author recites a few such poignant moments before concluding, ''Ever since these experiences, unemployment is not merely a statistic for me.'' Sheryl Gay Stolberg independently confirmed Romney's counseling interactions in an article in this paper. But Romney refused to be interviewed on the subject, and his campaign staff also declined to assist Stolberg, just as my inquiries on his time as Mormon stake president were, unlike my queries on other subjects, met with silence.
''He's probably taken it off the table because he feels that the downside of bringing up his Mormon leadership responsibility is greater than his upside,'' says Doug Cropper, a Romney supporter and Mormon bishop in Davenport, Iowa. ''And I understand it.''
The unintended consequence is that it leaves less of Mitt Romney to understand -- and, correspondingly, more room for doubt.
It's very unlikely that we'll ever hear Mitt Romney and Barack Obama openly discuss the things they have in common. Nonetheless, we may well see in the general election a contest between two dispassionate and accommodating pragmatists and skilled debaters who relish intellectual give-and-take, and whose willingness to compromise has infuriated the party faithful. Both have promised change. Each will frame the other as being not up to the task.
How ably Romney the nominee will defend himself, given the kid-gloves treatment by his current competition and the campaign's avoidance of large segments of his own life story, is difficult to say just yet. In early November I watched Romney return to Iowa for only the fourth time. He stopped in Dubuque and Davenport and, before decent-size crowds, essentially regurgitated his address on the economy from the week before. In both cases he spoke for less than 20 minutes and did not take questions from the audience. Far more of his ground time was devoted to filming promotional material in a Dubuque sheet-metal factory, where the footage would capture the candidate seeming engaged in the kind of heart-to-heart dialogues with working-class Americans that the campaign had otherwise left off his schedule that day.
Near the end of his talk in Davenport, he said to the 275 east Iowans in attendance, ''I want you to get to know me a little better.'' After wrapping up his speech, he moved briskly through the crowd, pausing now and then to take photos and sign autographs, before flying out of Iowa with Stuart Stevens and a couple of other staff members.
The following morning in Des Moines, I met with Romney's former Iowa chairman, Doug Gross. The strategist recalled how he had gotten off to a rocky start with the Romneys when he first traveled to Boston to meet them in the spring of 2007. That day, Gross brought up Romney's potential liabilities in Iowa -- including his previously progressive stances on abortion and gays, along with his Mormon faith -- and warned that he would have to prove that he could relate to average voters. According to Gross (and confirmed by someone else who was there): ''He got mad, his wife stormed out and he never talked to me the rest of the night. They found it insulting.''
Romney nonetheless hired Gross, who believes that the results of that 2008 campaign vindicated his initial concerns. Despite being asked to rejoin the campaign this year, he has not done so. I asked him if he had any reservations as to whether Mitt Romney would be a good president.
''Yeah,'' he immediately replied. ''That's why I haven't committed. To be an excellent president -- part of the rap on Mitt is that he's too flexible. I see that as a good thing, because it shows he's willing to be pragmatic and do what works.
''But,'' added Mitt Romney's former Iowa chairman, ''I don't know if he's got the gut instinct to make the right call at the right time. I don't know yet.''

HEADLINE: British Debt History

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: When 150 percent was no problem. 

 BODY:
I've been playing around with the IMF's historical public debt database, which has long-term information on ratios of debt to GDP. And you really have to marvel, given that historical record, at the deficit panic now so widespread. Here's debt as a percentage of GDP in Britain, back to 1830:
That uptick at the end -- you'll see it if you squint -- is what's driving the Cameron government's insistence on slashing spending in a liquidity trap.
It's also interesting to note -- contrary to what you often hear -- that at the time Keynes was writing, and calling for fiscal stimulus, Britain was substantially deeper in debt than Britain or the United States are now.

HEADLINE: Carbon Emissions Jumped in 2010, Report Says

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Researchers say the high growth rate reflects a bounce-back from a 1.4 percent drop in emissions in 2009, the year the recession had its biggest impact. 

 BODY:
Carbon dioxide emissions rose 5.9 percent last year, the biggest absolute jump on record and the biggest percentage increase since 2003, Justin Gillis reports, citing the findings of an international collaboration of scientists. Coal combustion accounted for more than half of the growth in emissions, their report said.

HEADLINE: New Plan on Payroll Taxes Expected From Reid

BYLINE: BRIAN KNOWLTON


HIGHLIGHT: Both parties are struggling to find a way forward on the payroll tax, after Democratic and Republican versions fell short last week. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, is expected to offer a new plan on Monday for extending the payroll tax cuts and jobless benefits that otherwise would expire this month, a fellow Democratic senator said on Sunday.
"Majority Leader Reid called me yesterday and said he will propose tomorrow a compromise plan to extend the payroll tax cut," the senator, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, said on "Fox News Sunday."
Mr. Conrad, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Mr. Reid had indicated that the plan would be "paid for in a way that's credible and serious" - though he would not say whether it would be through a tax increase, spending cuts or some combination of the two.
The plan will be "a serious attempt to move this ball forward, because we should not have a tax increase on the middle class," Mr. Conrad said. "That makes no sense in this economy."
Both parties are struggling to find a way forward on the payroll tax after Democratic and Republican versions fell short last week. While Mr. Conrad described the Reid plan as "a compromise," a spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said that Republicans had not been consulted.
A Reid spokesman, Adam Jentleson, confirmed the gist of Mr. Conrad's remarks, but he told Bloomberg News, "We are still reviewing the details with our caucus."
Appearing on the same program as Mr. Conrad, Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma and a member of the Finance Committee, predicted the payroll tax cut would be extended, as would unemployment benefits.
But, he said, "The question the American people ought to ask is, 'Where is the backbone in Washington to actually pay for these extensions in the year in which the money is spent?' "
In December, Congress temporarily reduced employees' portion of the Social Security payroll tax by 2 percentage points, to 4.2 percent of wages.
President Obama has urged Congress to extend the reduction, saying that its expiration would inflict a "significant blow" on a slowly recovering economy. Barring any action by Congress, the rate will return to 6.2 percent next month.
"Now is the time to step on the gas, not slam on the brakes," Mr. Obama said in his weekly radio address on Saturday. "Unfortunately, too many Republicans in Congress don't seem to share that same sense of urgency."
House Republicans are deeply divided over the payroll tax. Some insist that such a change must be paid for in the year it takes place, and others warn of the political dangers of opposing a popular tax break that benefits millions of Americans.
Some legislators - including Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who is running for president - say that extending the reduction would take money away from Social Security. But Democrats say there would ultimately be no losses to that program.

HEADLINE: Telecom Italia Mobile Regains Health With Support From a Spanish Phone Company

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
ROME -- In April 2007, as the global economy was beginning to unravel, Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications company, led a group of Italian investors who bought a 22.4 percent stake in Telecom Italia, one of the pioneering mobile operators in Europe.
The purchase was sanctioned by the Italian government, which wanted to preserve a modicum of Italian influence over its former monopoly, a big employer saddled with a load of major problems. The biggest was Telecom Italia's 37 billion, or $49 billion, debt, a legacy of the operator's two leveraged buyouts in 1999 and 2001.
But in a sense, the European deal was sealed in America. Thirty-seven years earlier, the Telefonica executive chairman and chief executive, Cesar Alierta, and Telecom Italia's then-chairman, Gabriele Galateri di Genola, met while getting master's degrees in business at Columbia University in New York. Their friendship made the tricky cross-border deal possible, said Franco Bernabe, who has been Telecom Italia's chief executive since 2007 and who, in April, also became its executive chairman, succeeding Mr. Galateri di Genola.
''I think it was an important reason Telco was formed at the beginning,'' Mr. Bernabe said during an interview, using the formal name of the Telefonica investment vehicle that acquired the stake. 
The group, which includes Bank Intesa Sanpaolo, the largest Italian bank, and Generali, the largest Italian insurer, has provided the former phone monopoly with the stability it lacked in its turbulent first decade as an investor-owned company. Since 2007, Telecom Italia has slowly reclaimed its lead in Italy, where it makes two-thirds of its sales, and has expanded businesses in Brazil and Argentina, where it is in heated battle with, among others, its partner Telefonica.
Mr. Bernabe is a lanky native of Vipiteno, a town at the foot of the Brenner Pass south of the Austrian border. He ran the state oil company, ENI, in the 1990s and was known for a below-the-radar management style called ''barra dritta,'' or steady hand on the rudder. When he was hired to run Telecom Italia in 2007, Mr. Bernabe told the board there would be no fireworks: That, he said, meant no mega-mergers, no big headlines.
So far, he has largely kept his word, quietly steering Telecom Italia on an upward trajectory made possible by relentless debt reduction, attrition-based staff cuts sanctioned by labor unions and savings from its cooperation with Telefonica in Italy and Spain, where the operators jointly purchase handsets and other equipment and share cost-saving techniques.
''Keeping a consistent path of cash generation, cutting costs, streamlining the operation, making the organization leaner -- that's not very exciting,'' Mr. Bernabe said in his office overlooking the Corso d'Italia, a busy boulevard flanked by remnants of a 1,700-year-old city wall. ''Everybody prefers to do something else, to expand the footprint, to make acquisitions, to be in the press because you are a great manager, and so on and so forth. That is not my piece of cake.''
But Mr. Bernabe, 63, gets animated when he talks about the financial benchmarks that have charted the company's recovery. From 2008 to 2010, Telecom Italia and Telefonica trimmed 1.3 billion in annual operating expenses through their cooperation, Mr. Bernabe said. In the three years through 2013, they plan to cut 1.5 billion more. Fifty-five percent of the savings revert to Telecom Italia; 45 percent go to Telefonica.
And the cutting will not stop there, he said. The austerity programs allowed Telecom Italia in October to reduce its net debt for the first time in more than a decade to less than 30 billion -- 29.9 billion to be exact. The reduction broke a psychological barrier of sorts for Telecom Italia, Mr. Bernabe said. Investors cheered the debt reduction and the company's 32 percent increase in third-quarter net profit, to 807 million.
Carlos Winzer, an analyst at Moody's in Madrid, said, ''I think the agreement with Telefonica has been successful for Telecom Italia and Mr. Bernabe. The company needed a stable, long-term investor. I think Telefonica has helped create the conditions Mr. Bernabe needed to make progress in reducing the company's debt.''
The last time Telecom Italia had reason to celebrate was the mid-1990s, when Italians were the first Europeans to embrace mobile phones in large numbers and the company's Telecom Italia Mobile TIM unit was seen as a model for the wireless future.
Those pioneer days are over. Like Telefonica, Telecom Italia is now a dominant operator in a mature market, where everyone has one or more cellphones and competitors poach customers.
In Italy, as in Spain, the competition in wireless is intense. The British-owned Vodafone Italia is the No. 2 mobile operator, with 30 million customers in the third quarter, compared with 31.7 million for TIM, according to the Italian regulator Agcom. Wind, a rival owned by Vimpelcom of Russia, and 3 Italia, a unit of the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa, are also active.
In this advanced stage of the mobile business, Italy is leading another trend: It has the greatest percentage of households in Western Europe that rely solely on mobile phones: 30 percent, according to Mr. Bernabe. With the rivalry migrating to mobile, Telecom Italia slashed prices this year after Vodafone briefly surpassed TIM in customers in the second quarter of 2010.
''We were very expensive,'' Mr. Bernabe said. ''We were complacent about our own market. We were the largest, the best, and we thought a large price premium could last forever. That was not the case.''
Since January, TIM has added 659,000 new customers, Mr. Bernabe said. The price cuts were the main reason why Telecom Italia's revenue fell 9.2 percent in the nine months that ended in September, to 5.3 billion. But the pretax profit margin rose to 49.6 percent, from 48 percent a year ago.
With similar tactics, Telecom Italia is expanding its South American businesses, where it owns 67 percent of TIM Brasil, the No. 2 mobile operator, with 59.2 million customers, and 21 percent of Telecom Argentina, the No. 1 operator, with 19.9 million clients. In Brazil, TIM is growing faster than Vivo, the market leader, which is owned by Telefonica. In October, TIM's annual rate of subscriber growth was 26 percent, compared with 17 percent for Vivo, according to Anatel, the Brazilian regulator.
In Brazil and Argentina, Mr. Bernabe said, Telecom Italia maintains ''Chinese walls'' that shield the subsidiaries from its cooperation with Telefonica in Europe. Latin American regulators insisted on the separation, he said, and monitor to detect collusion. Each month, Telecom Italia holds two separate board meetings in Milan or Rome: one to discuss Italy and one to discuss South America, where the Telefonica board representative is absent.
Mr. Bernabe said Telefonica had never expressed an interest in using its stake as a prelude to a full takeover of Telecom Italia, which would be politically difficult in Rome. Although the partners in the investment group are supposed to review their holding next spring, five years into the venture, Mr. Bernabe said he expected no changes.
''I think it stays the way it is, exactly,'' Mr. Bernabe said. ''There is no reason to change it. From our point of view, I am happy with this relationship and the way it is working. Of course there are several entities involved. Each one may have their own opinion. From my point of view, there is no reason to change it.''
Mr. Winzer, the Moody's analyst, said he expected Telefonica's commitment to Telecom Italia to remain unchanged, describing it as a ''standstill agreement'' and financial holding for Telefonica. Politically, a takeover of Telecom Italia would be difficult if not impossible, Mr. Winzer said, especially during these difficult economic times.
Officials for Telefonica, based in Madrid, declined to comment for this article. But in previous comments this year to analysts and investors, Mr. Alierta, the executive chairman, and other Telefonica executives have spoken positively about its cooperation with Telecom Italia.
In June 2010, Mr. Alierta, speaking to a group of bankers and financial analysts in Bilbao, Spain, said Telefonica was focused on improving the cost savings from its alliance with Telecom Italia. The relationship, at the time three years old, was ''already working very well,'' he said, according to Expansion, a Spanish newspaper that covered his speech.
In Latin America, however, Telefonica is facing increased competition from its ally. Telefonica has 195 million customers in 10 countries and also competes with America Movil, the group based in Mexico City that has 241.5 million wireless subscribers and is owned by the billionaire investor Carlos Slim Helu. Mr. Slim is the second-largest shareholder in The New York Times Co.
Telefonica, with its Telecom Italia stake, may be intent on preventing Telecom Italia's subsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina from falling into the hands of Mr. Slim, should he try a bid for Telecom Italia, said Innocenzo Genna, a lobbyist in Brussels for small European operators and a former legal counsel at Tiscali Italia, a Telecom Italia rival in Italy.
Mr. Bernabe said there had never been any agreement, ''explicit or implicit,'' with Telefonica that would bar the sale of Telecom Italia's Latin American businesses to America Movil. In any case, he said, the two subsidiaries were the fastest growing parts of Telecom Italia's business and the company had no interest in selling them.
Mr. Slim and AT&T had been among those first expressing interest in the stake in Telecom Italia that was sold in 2007 to the group led by Telefonica.
In Europe, Telecom Italia is still paying for its costly leveraged buyouts, a legacy of the bankrupt, debt-fueled mentality that has brought Italy and the world economy to the brink, he said. The company still has work to do in many areas, he said. The accounting firm Ernst & Young, in a November report, said Telecom Italia was slower than its peers in collecting money.
Telecom Italia takes an average of 80 to 100 days to collect from clients, versus 40 to 45 days for Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, Vodafone and KPN, the Dutch operator, said Holger Forst, a telecommunications analyst at Ernst & Young in Cologne. He studied the accounts receivable data in the company's financial report.
''They still have work to do in this area,'' Mr. Forst said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pain in the Public Sector

 BODY:
Buried in the relatively positive numbers contained in the November jobs report was some very bad news for those who work in the public sector. There were 20,000 government workers laid off last month, by far the largest drop for any sector of the economy, mostly from states, counties and cities. 
That continues a troubling trend that's been building for years, one that has had a particularly harsh effect on black workers. While the private sector has been adding jobs since the end of 2009, more than half a million government positions have been lost since the recession.
In most cases, states and cities had to lay off workers because of declining tax revenues, or reduced federal aid because of Washington's inexplicable decision to focus more on the deficit in the near term than on jobs.
Those layoffs mean a lower quality of life when there are fewer teachers, pothole repair crews and nurses. On Thursday, a deteriorating budget situation prompted what officials in Marion, Ind., called a ''radical reorganization'' of city services, which will result in the layoffs of 15 police officers (out of 58) and 12 firefighters (out of 50).
The cutbacks hurt more than just services. As Timothy Williams of The Times reported last week, they hit black workers particularly hard. Millions of African-Americans -- one in five who are employed -- have entered the middle class through government employment, and they tend to make 25 percent more than other black workers. Now tens of thousands are leaving both their jobs and the middle class. Chicago, for example, is laying off 212 employees in the upcoming fiscal year, two-thirds of whom are black.
That's one reason the black unemployment rate went up last month, to 15.5 percent from 15.1. The effect is severe, destabilizing black neighborhoods and making it harder for young people to replicate their parents' climb up the economic ladder. ''The reliance on these jobs has provided African-Americans a path upward,'' said Robert Zieger, an emeritus professor of history at the University of Florida. ''But it is also a vulnerability.''
Many Republicans, however, don't regard government jobs as actual jobs, and are eager to see them disappear. Republican governors around the Midwest have aggressively tried to break the power of public unions while slashing their work forces, and Congressional Republicans have proposed paying for a payroll tax cut by reducing federal employment rolls by 10 percent through attrition. That's 200,000 jobs, many of which would be filled by blacks and Hispanics and others who tend to vote Democratic, and thus are considered politically superfluous.
But every layoff, whether public or private, is a life, and a livelihood, and a family. And too many of them are getting battered by the economic storm.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Pushes New Tax Rates For Big Earners

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Sunday called for ''comprehensive reform'' of New York's tax code that would mean higher tax rates for the wealthy and a tax cut for the middle class, according to officials briefed on the plan.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat whose popularity soared as he cut spending and won concessions from labor unions during his first year in office, also called for a stimulus package that would increase spending on road and bridge construction; finance new programs to train poor urban youths; and legalize resort-style casino gambling. 
Mr. Cuomo was expected to call lawmakers back to Albany as soon as this week to take up some of his proposals.
While Mr. Cuomo did not provide specifics on his tax proposals, he and legislative leaders were negotiating a deal, the officials briefed on the plan said, that would allow the state's so-called millionaires' tax -- a surcharge on incomes over $200,000 for individuals -- to lapse as scheduled on Dec. 31.
But one or more new tax brackets for high-income earners would have those individuals paying less than they did under the surcharge -- allowing officials to say that the millionaires' tax had lapsed -- but paying at a higher rate than they would have been under existing tax brackets. The proposal would also lower the tax rate for middle-income earners and might include tax incentives for businesses. It was not clear on Sunday what the income thresholds would be.
The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private, said that if agreed upon, the new rates would last for several years; a commission would be created to come up with permanent new rates and to address tax loopholes and changes to business taxes.
Mr. Cuomo made his call for a tax overhaul and stimulus proposals in an essay his office sent to reporters on Sunday. ''Our goal in New York should be twofold: to fashion a job-creating economic plan, and to defy political gridlock like we see in Washington and make government work to actually implement the plan,'' Mr. Cuomo wrote.
Any move to raise tax rates for some and increase spending would be a risky step for Mr. Cuomo, who vowed during his election campaign last year to oppose tax increases.
But in Albany, he appears to have the ear, if not yet the full support, of many Republican lawmakers and business leaders, who say the governor has demonstrated his sensitivity to New York's long history of high taxation and free spending. Democrats, emboldened by the Occupy Wall Street movement, are eager for the governor to push a more progressive tax system and a more aggressive job-creation program.
The Legislature had not been scheduled to return to Albany until January, but Mr. Cuomo began considering swifter action as the state's weak economy caused tax collections to grow less rapidly than expected, causing an estimated $350 million shortfall in this year's state budget and a projected shortfall of up to $3.5 billion next year.
Mr. Cuomo has also been seeking to mollify his critics in the Democratic Party and labor unions who have been pressuring him to renew the millionaires' tax or find another way to increase revenue collected from the state's wealthiest residents.
The deal under consideration could both placate liberals and allow Mr. Cuomo to say he stayed true to his promise on the millionaires' tax.
Mr. Cuomo began his first term by laying out an economic agenda that would limit taxes and spending. He campaigned on a promise of not raising taxes -- ''I say no new taxes, period,'' he declared on the day of his inauguration -- and he repeated that message many times this year. At times, Mr. Cuomo found himself more closely aligned with Republicans than Democrats.
Liberals have responded enthusiastically to Mr. Cuomo's interest in a more progressive tax code, in which higher-income New Yorkers would be taxed at higher rates.
''Unemployment is painful to individuals and destructive to society, and the governor, the speaker and the majority leader have a chance to demonstrate that the 1 percent do not control politics in New York,'' said Dan Cantor, the executive director of the Working Families Party. ''Asking the rich to do their share is not unreasonable in the slightest, and spending that revenue on job creation is good policy and good politics, and the governor is correct to make this move.''
Business leaders in recent days have signaled an openness to Mr. Cuomo's tax code revisions, even if they would raise taxes on some people.
Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, a network of business leaders, said that Mr. Cuomo was ''appropriately changing the terms of debate from the class warfare language of the millionaires' tax advocates to focus on tax reform that promotes universal fairness.''
''He knows it is possible to raise revenues without inflammatory rhetoric that drives business and wealth out of the state,'' Ms. Wylde said. She added that because lawmakers had moved this year ''in the direction of showing they could exercise some discipline over spending,'' the business community would support a ''balanced approach'' of spending cuts and new revenues as Mr. Cuomo drew up his next budget.
Anticipating the possible special session, the Democratic majority in the State Assembly has summoned its members to the Capitol for Tuesday, and the Republican majority in the Senate said it would assemble its members on Wednesday.
A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, Josh Vlasto, confirmed that negotiations were under way with legislative leaders on a number of issues, including what to do about the state's budget gap, as well as a much-contested proposal to legalize the hailing of livery cabs on most New York City streets.
Some of the other changes will take time to implement: legalizing full-scale commercial casinos would require amending the state's Constitution, a process that would require approval from two consecutive Legislatures and then a voter referendum. (Mr. Cuomo said he wanted to create ''destination gaming locations,'' which he said would ''promote job creation and recapture revenue that is currently being lost to other states.'')
A spokesman for the Senate Republicans, Scott Reif, said lawmakers this week planned to ''discuss a number of issues, including our commitment to cutting taxes to create new private-sector jobs.'' A spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Global Carbon Dioxide Emissions in 2010 Show the Biggest Jump Ever Recorded

BYLINE: By JUSTIN GILLIS

 BODY:
Global emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel burning jumped by the largest amount on record last year, upending the notion that the brief decline during the recession might persist through the recovery.
Emissions rose 5.9 percent in 2010, according to an analysis released Sunday by the Global Carbon Project, an international collaboration of scientists tracking the numbers. Scientists with the group said the increase, a half-billion extra tons of carbon pumped into the air, was almost certainly the largest absolute jump in any year since the Industrial Revolution, and the largest percentage increase since 2003.
The increase solidified a trend of ever-rising emissions that scientists fear will make it difficult, if not impossible, to forestall severe climate change in coming decades. 
The researchers said the high growth rate reflected a bounce-back from the 1.4 percent drop in emissions in 2009, the year the recession had its biggest impact.
They do not expect the extraordinary growth to persist, but do expect emissions to return to something closer to the 3 percent yearly growth of the last decade, still a worrisome figure that signifies little progress in limiting greenhouse gases. The growth rate in the 1990s was closer to 1 percent yearly.
The combustion of coal represented more than half of the growth in emissions, the report found.
In the United States, emissions dropped by a remarkable 7 percent in the recession year of 2009, but rose by just over 4 percent last year, the new analysis shows. This country is the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, pumping 1.5 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere last year.
The United States was surpassed several years ago by China, where emissions grew 10.4 percent in 2010, with that country injecting 2.2 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide emissions are usually measured by the weight of carbon they contain.
The new figures come as delegates from 191 countries meet in Durban, South Africa, for yet another negotiating session in a global control effort that has been going on, with minimal success, for the better part of two decades.
''Each year that emissions go up, there's another year of negotiations, another year of indecision,'' said Glen P. Peters, a researcher at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo and a leader of the group that produced the new analysis. ''There's no evidence that this trajectory we've been following the last 10 years is going to change.''
Scientists say the rapid growth of emissions is warming the Earth, threatening the ecology and putting human welfare at long-term risk. But their increasingly urgent pleas that society find a way to limit emissions have met sharp political resistance in many countries, including the United States, because doing so would entail higher energy costs.
The new figures show a continuation of a trend in which developing countries, including China and India, have surpassed the wealthy countries in their overall greenhouse emissions. In 2010, the combustion of fossil fuels and the production of cement sent more than nine billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere, the new analysis found, with 57 percent of that coming from developing countries.
Emissions per person, though, are still sharply higher in the wealthy countries, and those countries have been emitting greenhouse gases far longer, so they account for the bulk of the excess gases in the atmosphere. The level of carbon dioxide, the main such gas, has increased 40 percent since the Industrial Revolution.
On the surface, the figures of recent years suggest that wealthy countries have made headway in stabilizing their emissions. But Dr. Peters pointed out that in a sense, the rich countries have simply exported some of them.
The fast rise in developing countries has been caused to a large extent by the growth of energy-intensive manufacturing industries that make goods that rich countries import. ''All that has changed is the location in which the emissions are being produced,'' Dr. Peters said.
Many countries, as part of their response to the economic crisis, invested billions in programs designed to make their energy systems greener. While it is possible those will pay long-term dividends, the new numbers suggest they have had little effect so far.
The financial crisis ''was an opportunity to move the global economy away from a high-emissions trajectory,'' said a scientific paper about the new figures, released online on Sunday by the journal Nature Climate Change. ''Our results provide no indication of this happening.''

Heineken, the Dutch brewer, is seeking to consolidate its worldwide media planning and buying account, with spending estimated at more than $350 million. The assignment is now divided between two media agencies: Mindshare, part of the GroupM unit of WPP, and the Starcom MediaVest Group, part of the Publicis Groupe. A decision is expected by mid-2012.
CKE Restaurants, Carpinteria, Calif., owned by Apollo Management, expanded its relationship with 72 and Sunny, Los Angeles, by naming the agency to handle the creative account for its Carl's Jr. and Hardee's fast-food chains, which had been handled for less than a year by David & Goliath, El Segundo, Calif. Spending was estimated at $50 million to $65 million. CKE has been using 72 and Sunny as the digital agency for the chains. The shift was reported by adage.com. 
Kraft Foods, Northfield, Ill., expanded its relationship with Droga5, New York, by awarding the agency the creative duties for a new snack product, MilkBite. Spending has not been determined. Droga5 also creates campaigns for Kraft brands like Athenos foods.

Lars-Christian Cords will join Euro RSCG Worldwide Public Relations on May 1, 2012, in two posts: president of Euro RSCG ABC, Germany, and chief campaign officer at the Euro RSCG Germany agency group, based in Dusseldorf. As president, he will assume duties from Wolfgang Kreuter, chief executive at Euro RSCG ABC, who will continue there, the agency said, in a ''leading position.'' The post of chief campaign officer is new. Until Mr. Cords joins Euro RSCG, he will remain chief executive at fischerAppelt, Berlin. Euro RSCG Worldwide Public Relations is part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Worldwide, which is owned by Havas.
Jason Wagenheim was named vice president and publisher at Teen Vogue magazine, New York, part of the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications. He succeeds Sabine Feldmann, who is to be given a new post at Conde Nast, the company said. Mr. Wagenheim had most recently been vice president and publisher at another Conde Nast magazine, Glamour; he was abruptly removed from that post on Nov. 22, after only two months on the job.
Kevin Martinez was named vice president and publisher at Details magazine, New York, part of the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications. The post had been vacant and Mr. Martinez had been serving as a consultant to Details since July, a month after he left Elle magazine, New York, which had been acquired by the Hearst Magazines unit of the Hearst Corporation. (Mr. Martinez was shifted to associate publisher from publisher after the acquisition and he left Elle soon after.)

Two leading media forecasters are reducing their estimates for growth in worldwide advertising spending in 2012, citing concerns like a slowdown of economies in Europe and the sovereign debt crisis there. But the forecasters say they are not overly fearful that marketers will suddenly and sharply cut their ad budgets, pointing to coming events like the 2012 Summer Olympics and the United States state and federal elections as significant potential stimulants. They also predict growth in ad spending in Japan as that country continues recovering from the effects of the earthquake and tsunami last spring.
GroupM, part of WPP, is predicting an increase of 6.4 percent in worldwide ad spending next year from 2011; its most recent forecast, in July, predicted a gain of 6.8 percent. In the United States, GroupM said, ad spending in 2012 will rise 4 percent from 2011; the July forecast predicted an increase of 4.2 percent.
ZenithOptimedia, part of the Publicis Groupe, is predicting an increase in worldwide ad spending in 2012 of 4.7 percent; its most recent forecast, in October, was for a gain of 5.3 percent. In the United States, according to ZenithOptimedia, ad spending next year will increase 3.5 percent from 2011; that is unchanged from the October forecast.
Publicis Groupe, Paris, acquired Gomye, a digital agency with three offices in China, and Ciszewski, which was described as Poland's largest independent public relations agency. Financial terms of the deals were not disclosed. Gomye will be renamed Publicis Modem Beijing, serving as the digital arm of the Publicis Worldwide agency in Beijing. Ciszewski will be renamed Ciszewski MSL and will become the lead agency brand of the MSL Group unit of the Publicis Groupe.
WPP Group, Dublin, acquired the Glover Park Group, Washington, an agency that specializes in government relations and strategic communications. Financial terms were not disclosed. Glover Park, which has more than 140 employees, also has offices in Boulder, Colo; Los Angeles; and New York. Glover Park will operate as a stand-alone unit of WPP, which also owns agencies with Washington presences like Blue State Digital and the Dewey Square Group.
Cohn & Wolfe, New York, part of WPP, signed an agreement to acquire Impactasia, an independent Chinese public relations agency, and merge it with the Cohn & Wolfe operations in China. Financial terms were not disclosed. The merged agency will be named Cohn & Wolfe-Impactasia and have offices in cities like Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Internet advertising revenue in the third quarter totaled $7.88 billion, up 22 percent from the same period a year ago, according to a report from the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PricewaterhouseCoopers. It was the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, the report said.

HEADLINE: Private-College Presidents Getting Higher Salaries

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Presidents at 36 private colleges earned more than $1 million in 2009, up from 33 the previous year, according to a study by The Chronicle of Higher Education.
The annual study, using data from federal tax documents, found that the median compensation -- including salary and benefits -- was $385,909, a 2.2 percent increase from the previous year. The median base salary increased by 2.8 percent to $294,489.
The highest-paid president in 2009 was Constantine Papadakis of Drexel University. Mr. Papadakis, who died in April that year, earned $4,912,127, most of it from life insurance and previously accrued compensation paid to his widow. His base salary was $195,726. 
The next three top earners -- William R. Brody of Johns Hopkins University ($3,821,886); Donald V. DeRosa of University of the Pacific ($2,357,540); and Henry S. Bienen of Northwestern University ($2,240,775) -- also left their presidencies.
The three highest earners who remained as chief executives were Nicholas S. Zeppos of Vanderbilt University ($1,890,274); Charles H. Polk of Mountain State University, in West Virginia ($1,843,746); and Shirley Ann Jackson of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ($1,771,877).
While the private colleges in the study -- The Chronicle's similar study of salaries at public universities appears in the spring -- spent an average of 0.4 percent of their budgets on presidential salaries, there were outliers.
Mr. Polk's $1.8 million compensation amounted to 3.5 percent of the budget at Mountain State University, which has had accreditation problems and a low 2.5 percent graduation rate for first-time, full-time students, according to The Chronicle's report.
Although presidential pay generally has little effect on the budget, its symbolic importance makes it a likely target of criticism at a time when pay inequities have become a rallying point for the Occupy protest movement, Jack Stripling, a reporter at The Chronicle said in a call with journalists on Friday. He pointed out that Amy Gutmann, president of the University of Pennsylvania, came under fire from an Occupy group last month even though her salary of $1.3 million is less than 1 percent of the institutional budget.
While the typical president earned 3.7 times as much as the average pay and benefits of a full professor at the same institution, the study found great variations. Kevin J. Manning at Stevenson University in Maryland earned $1,491,655 -- 16.1 times as much as the pay and benefits of the average full professor there.
Five other presidents earned at least 10 times as much as a typical professor at their colleges: Ms. Jackson of Rensselaer; Mr. Zeppos of Vanderbilt; Frances Lucas of Millsaps College, in Jackson, Miss.; Jehuda Reinharz of Brandeis University (he is no longer president); and J. Timothy Cloyd of Hendrix College, in Conway, Ark.
At the other end, Patrick E. White at Wabash College in Indiana earned $239,207, about twice the average professor's compensation at the college.
The Chronicle's interactive graphic on presidential compensation is at chronicle.com/compensation. Salaries for private college presidents have grown far more, adjusted for inflation, in recent years than professorial pay.
In the decade from 1999-2000 to 2009-10, average presidential pay at the 50 wealthiest universities increased by 75 percent, to $876,792, while professorial pay increased 14 percent, to $179, 970.
''The job of college president has changed dramatically in the last 30 years, as have the demands,'' David L. Warren, the president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, said in a statement. ''There is just a small pool of candidates who possess the skill set that is required and are willing to take on the stressful 24/7 nature of the position.''
Pressure on private college presidents is increasing on many fronts, Mr. Warren said, including budgetary challenges, uncertainty about the sustainability of the traditional financial model, calls for further regulation, greater competition, growing student financial need, and consumer concerns about rising tuition.
A study released last year by the Council of Independent Colleges found that less than one in four chief academic officers at private colleges planned to pursue a presidency.

HEADLINE: Comedians in Chief Mustn't Be Prudent

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
When it comes to political satire, are you better off than you were four years ago?
''The Daily Show'' and ''The Colbert Report'' remain sharp despite losing many of their favorite targets from the Bush administration. ''Funny or Die,'' the comedy site whose first video went online in 2007, has become a formidable player, recently scoring with a commercial parody in which Mike Tyson played Herman Cain, off-kilter casting that seems even more creepy in the wake of the sex scandals that caused him to suspend his campaign.
Yet as we head into another general election campaign, ''Saturday Night Live,'' the biggest national stage for presidential parody, still has not figured out how to make Barack Obama funny. In its long history of mocking presidents, no impression has made less of one.
To be fair Fred Armisen, who has played the president more than 30 times since early 2008, has a more difficult challenge than his predecessors. Mr. Obama doesn't have a thick accent or easily mocked tics (lip biting, eye squinting). When not delivering a speech, his affect is flavorless or elegant, neither very funny. And would it kill him to have a sex scandal? How about just a rumor? 
Where the best political comedy by Jon Stewart emerges out of conviction, ''SNL'' generally adopts a more detached approach. Any show whose original writing staff included Al Franken could not be described as fair and balanced, but Bill Clinton and Al Gore (both of whom were played best by the masterly Darrell Hammond) have received as harsh treatment as Republicans have. James Downey, the show's longtime writer of political sketches, described his preferred stance in ''Live From New York,'' an oral history of ''SNL'' by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller, as one without anger or agenda.
Neither were necessary for ''SNL'' to mine laughs from Donald Trump, Herman Cain or Rick Perry, who provided fertile targets during the current Republican primary campaign. As the field winnows, and the general election promises weekly sketches with Mr. Obama, the prospect of more tepid gags about the president's inability to get angry does not bode well.
When it comes to stamping a politician in the public consciousness, ''Saturday Night Live'' has no equal. Will Ferrell's George W. Bush was so popular that it spawned a Broadway show. It didn't matter that Gerald Ford was an athlete: Chevy Chase, who made little effort to look or sound like him, convinced America that Ford was a graceless klutz. As Sarah Palin, Tina Fey probably had the biggest impact of any comedian on the last election.
That's surely why politicians so often agree to appear on the show that mercilessly mocks them. Ms. Palin didn't sit down with David Letterman, but she did stand next to Lorne Michaels, the ''SNL'' producer, in a sketch. ''SNL'' has become such a powerful cultural force that the show doesn't need merely to piggyback the political scene. It can lead, deciding what exactly becomes the characteristic trait worthy of lampooning.
What's needed with Mr. Obama, I humbly suggest, is not tweaks, but a more imaginative style. Mr. Armisen's relatively understated performance is too shackled to the real world. He nicely captures the president's cadence and his habit of starting sentences with an exasperatedly reasonable ''Look,'' and ending emphatically. But accuracy is not insight, nor is it the goal. Being funny is. Mr. Armisen would be wise to find inspiration in his show's greatest presidential impression: Dana Carvey as the elder George Bush.
Making that colorless patrician funny was as much a comic challenge as that facing Mr. Armisen. His early attempts were high concept riffs on the idea that he was a wimp trying to act tough. Mr. Carvey began with straightforward mimicry, but through the 1988 campaign he gradually became more physically mannered and antic. By the time Mr. Bush was elected, Mr. Carvey's complete sentences turned into checklists of catch phrases (''Stay the course,'' ''wouldn't be prudent'') and elaborate evasions of anything concrete.
''People say the economy has problems,'' Mr. Carvey said in a robotic, high-pitched whine in an Oval Office address. ''Try telling it to that guy out there in Oregon who is working on that thing, doing it, going round and round in the whole area out there.''
Most of Mr. Carvey's sketches were solitary speeches delivered at a desk, with no gimmicks and relatively few jokes. The humor was rooted in character. What made Mr. Carvey such a thrillingly adventurous and funny performer is that he kept pushing his cartoonish character in more flamboyant directions.
His elaborate hand gestures became so ornamental that they looked like something out of Peking Opera. As he refined the character, his language grew vaguer and vaguer, an evolution that was actually an articulate comment on the decline of clarity in political rhetoric. Sentences turned into fragments, then words turned into mumblings. ''Not going to do it'' became ''na ga da.'' It was so outlandish that it appeared less scathing than it actually was. Mr. Bush, who appeared on the show, seemed genuinely to like it.
In recent years ''SNL'' has become more obsessed with verisimilitude. More attention is paid to accuracy in hair, costumes and accents with less room for the bizarre. There are exceptions, particularly turns by Bill Hader, who does compellingly eccentric versions of Rick Perry, James Carville and an oddly sinister Shepard Smith, who introduced himself in one debate sketch with ''I come from a town full of secrets.''
Mr. Carvey captured a certain essence of Mr. Bush, but his artistic aim was far broader. That ambition is lacking in Mr. Armisen's earthbound performance. Tellingly, in the most memorable satire of Mr. Obama, a quirky spin on the Incredible Hulk in which the president, when made angry, turned into the Rock, Mr. Armisen, a gifted comic actor, delivered the setup, not the joke. Similarly, he seemed like a straight man in sketches sending up the 2008 general-election debates.
On Saturday's show Mr. Armisen, starring in a stale sketch about his lack of power in Washington, seemed less mannered than usual, speaking more casually, but the caricature still lacked focus. What's frustrating about these performances is the same thing that has left many in Mr. Obama's base disillusioned. Mr. Armisen seems sometimes to blend into the background.
One wishes he would take more chances, strike out in a more fanciful, provocative direction or satirize a more unexpected trait. That would require artistic boldness. Of course dramatically changing the presidential impression now could seem too radical a move. Or as Mr. Carvey's Mr. Bush might put it: Wouldn't be prudent. At the same time, caution may often be a virtue for politicians, but rarely so for comedians.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 7, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture on Monday with a critic's notebook article about the portrayal of presidents and presidential candidates on ''Saturday Night Live'' was published in error. It showed Dana Carvey in the movie ''The Master of Disguise,'' not on ''Saturday Night Live.'' And because of an editing error, the caption misidentified the president he was shown impersonating. It was George W. Bush, not George H. W. Bush.

HEADLINE: What Gingrich Didn't Learn in Congo

BYLINE: By ADAM HOCHSCHILD. 
Adam Hochschild is the author of ''King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa.''

 BODY:
San Francisco
NEWT GINGRICH seldom misses a chance to note that he is a historian. He lards his speeches with references to obscure events in the American past, talks about his time teaching at West Georgia College (not one of those effete Ivies), and has declared that the more than $1.6 million in fees he earned from Freddie Mac was for his work not, heaven forbid, as a lobbyist, but as a historian. And last year he was in the news for saying President Obama exhibited ''Kenyan, anticolonial behavior.''
Mr. Gingrich would be our first president with a Ph.D. since Woodrow Wilson. Does his work as a historian tell us anything about him? Or, for that matter, anything about why, despite certain events in 1776, he considers ''anticolonial'' an epithet? To address these questions, a good place to start is his 1971 Tulane doctoral dissertation: ''Belgian Education Policy in the Congo 1945-1960.'' 
A curious document it is -- but not in ways that Mr. Gingrich's enemies might hope for, since the dissertation is not filled with racism or drum-beating for colonialism's glories. At the start he asks, ''Did the colonial powers perform a painful but positive function in disrupting traditional society and so paving the way for more rapid modernization? Even if they did, was the price of colonial exploitation too high?'' Good questions, but he never answers them. Instead, he surveys his subject in a highly pedantic way, dutifully covering rural and urban schools, church and state schools, white and black schools, Protestant and Catholic schools, and education for men and for women. Footnotes, statistics and quotes from eminent authorities abound. The writer who emerges from the text is not the fire-breathing, slash-and-burn partisan attacker Mr. Gingrich's critics portrayed from his time as House speaker, nor the profound, big-picture thinker Mr. Gingrich the candidate presents himself as. It's the desk-bound policy wonk.
Part of the wonkery is the absence of any human detail. What did a colonial-era Congolese school look like? What was in the textbooks? How did the teachers treat their students? The reader never learns because Mr. Gingrich never went there -- although he did go to Belgium. Perhaps he couldn't afford a trip to Africa. He cites interviews with one American and seven Belgians -- but not a single Congolese, though there were hundreds living in Europe and the United States he could have talked to.
Instead, the future legislator was interested in how educational policy in the Congo reflected tensions in Belgian political life -- between Catholics and secularists, and between the French and Flemish halves of the country. Absent Congolese voices and lives, the dissertation is as dry as a stale biscuit.
Despite these limitations, however, Mr. Gingrich is clear-eyed about colonialism. ''Belgium ran the Congo as a profitable business,'' he writes. ''This goal could be achieved only with a passive native population.'' He notes that the various ''civilizing'' efforts the Belgians were so proud of ''were commercially motivated. For example, the natives received medical care because it improved their capabilities as a work force. They received enough education to be effective workmen.''
He refers to the ''paternalistic'' policies of a mining company and the colonial government and to the channeling of blacks into vocational and technical training as '' 'Uncle Tom'-ish,'' though ''advanced'' for its time. Secondary education for girls was ''appalling''; for boys, ''also pretty dismal.'' School financing was ''woefully inadequate'' and it was ''pathetically unjust'' that spending per pupil on the children of white settlers was nearly 10 times what it was for Congolese. He scoffs at Belgian pride in setting up two universities during the final years of colonial rule, pointing out that the students were overwhelmingly white.
Beyond education, Mr. Gingrich has a shrewd politician's sense of how the colonial system worked. Power was held by a ''triumvirate'': an all-white senior civil service, a powerful cartel of corporations and the Catholic Church. The first wanted power, the second profits, the third converts. Could this astute description reflect a hitherto unknown radical phase in Newt's youth?
Alas, no: his beef is not that there might be anything immoral about one country's owning and exploiting another, but that the Belgians didn't create a class of Congolese who could keep the economy functioning efficiently -- for whose profit, he never asks. ''The Belgians get very low marks for their efforts to develop a political elite and much of the country's post-independence chaos is due to this Belgian failure.''
Hmmm. If you think this sounds too anticolonial, better alert Fox News. But the bigger question is: does this thesis show an original, creative historian at work? This it does not.
Woodrow Wilson's Ph.D. dissertation boldly asserted that the founding fathers had gotten many things wrong, and advocated for this country something like the British parliamentary system. Soon published as a book, it was argued over for decades, and even scholars who disagreed with Wilson respected him, and his openness to changing his ideas. Mr. Gingrich may succeed in being elected president, but it is hard to imagine him, like Wilson after he left the White House, being elected president of the American Historical Association.

HEADLINE: In One Rival, Romney Now Sees A Grave Threat

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
BOSTON - Inside a drab office building here, Mitt Romney's aides have been following all the rules. Now they'll find out if the rules still apply.
Build on Mr. Romney's 2008 run to assemble a broad but lean campaign infrastructure? Check.
Focus the candidate's message, in strong debate performances and well-controlled campaign events, on the core issue of economic revival? Check. 
Take the long view toward a general election war against President Obama? Check.
Yet Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, suddenly faces a challenge from Newt Gingrich, who is enjoying a tidal surge in support. Mr. Gingrich, shredding campaign textbooks that prize preparation and discipline, has leads in polls in Florida, Iowa and South Carolina, and is drawing closer in New Hampshire, Mr. Romney's redoubt.
The timing of Mr. Gingrich's rise, just a month before the nomination voting starts, and his track record in national Republican politics make his a graver threat than earlier surges by Representative Michele Bachmann, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Herman Cain. That's clear from Mr. Romney's allusions to Mr. Gingrich, a former House speaker, as a ''lifelong politician,'' an ''insider'' and a ''lobbyist'' - with more probably to come in debates and perhaps television advertisements.
''Mitt likes to say he served in government but didn't inhale,'' said one of his aides, Eric Fehrnstrom. ''Newt has taken large inhalations of Washington air.''
But the confidence of Romney supporters has been shaken. For the first time since the nomination field became set in late summer, ''it is possible'' that Mr. Romney could lose, said Vin Weber, a Republican former congressman from Minnesota.
A Scramble to Expand
Team Romney so far has been soothed by the flaws of his rivals. None can match Mr. Romney's combination of resume, presidential bearing, campaign experience, financing and organization.
Mr. Romney's staff numbers around 80 - less than half its size four years ago, but enough for the arcane tasks of fielding delegate slates, securing ballot access, planning events and amassing endorsements. It includes roughly a dozen fund-raising aides, who coordinate with regional finance consultants and a volunteer national finance team.
Mr. Gingrich's organization, beyond himself and his wife, Callista, has been tiny. He is now scrambling to expand it, while counting on online social networks and other modern communications tools to create the political equivalent of a flash mob.
''In the Internet age, it's possible there will be a lot of self-organization,'' said Joe Gaylord, a longtime confidant of Mr. Gingrich. ''Newt believes that.''
Can it work in the Iowa caucuses, which by reputation demand that successful campaigns guide supporters to protracted midwinter meetings in schools, firehouses and church basements? Can it convert popular support into nominating delegates in a fast-moving gantlet of primaries?
Team Romney can only hope not.
''There's another name for 'an unconventional campaign,' and that's 'a losing campaign,' '' said Mr. Weber, a former House ally of Mr. Gingrich who was helping Mr. Romney raise money in Washington last week. ''There are reasons we call things 'conventional' - because they work.''
But conventional tactics sometimes outlive their usefulness. Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist, said there was a ''quadrennial industry'' of paycheck-seeking Iowa operatives who profit from ''the myth that organization wins Iowa.''
Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican ad-maker, said: ''Is it helpful? Sure. But message moves people.''
For Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Murphy said, ''The issue is, does he have money for TV ads? He could.''
The Establishment
TV advertisements form only part of the campaign message. Mr. Gingrich's inclination to hubris and rhetorical excess will test his rise; so will scrutiny of his checkered personal life, speakership and lucrative consulting career.
Romney aides prefer that others carry the attack. That includes the news media and candidates obscured by Mr. Gingrich's rise, like Gov. Rick Perry of Texas.
But they may not have that luxury. They believe, for instance, that Mr. Perry has depleted his once-formidable war chest.
In the meantime, a Romney machine built on establishment credibility keeps churning. At headquarters last week, Michael O. Leavitt, a former governor of Utah and member of President George W. Bush's cabinet, shared an office with Ron Kaufman, a former White House political director for the first president Bush.
While The Manchester Union-Leader endorsed Mr. Gingrich, former Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire wrote an op-ed article in The Boston Globe criticizing him. Mr. Sununu's father, a former governor and White House chief of staff, is among several major New Hampshire politicians to endorse Mr. Romney.
Yet Mr. Gingrich, having led the 1994 Republican Revolution, boasts an organic connection to the party's conservative base that Mr. Romney cannot match. Ken Khachigian, a speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, said primary voters may care less about Mr. Romney's superior electability than about Mr. Gingrich's superior ability to articulate their ''deep animosity'' toward Mr. Obama.
''Parties sometimes make big mistakes,'' Mr. Weber said. ''Democrats nominated McGovern and lost 49 states'' to President Richard M. Nixon in 1972.
''I hope my party doesn't make one,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Biden, in Visits to Middle East and Europe, Tries to Reassure Allies of U.S. Support

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
ATHENS -- As he traded the political upheaval of the Middle East for the economic storms of Europe, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has preached a consistent message on his travels: ''The United States isn't going anywhere,'' as he put it on Sunday.
It is a challenging, even far-fetched, argument to make at a time when the United States is pulling its last soldiers out of Iraq -- scrambling the calculus of players in the region -- and when it is not offering to rescue Greece or other debt-ridden European countries. 
Mr. Biden acknowledged the need to reassure allies, noting that in Turkey and Iraq last week, every leader he met voiced uneasiness about what would happen after the American troops departed. On Monday, he was scheduled to meet with the new prime minister of Greece, Lucas Papademos; officials made it clear he was bearing good will, not loan guarantees.
''All of my interlocutors raise the same concern,'' Mr. Biden said to reporters traveling with him on Air Force Two, as he flew to Athens from Istanbul. ''What about Iran? What about Iranian influence? America leaving -- is there going to be a vacuum?''
Mr. Biden said he had pledged that the United States would stay committed to Iraq through a large civilian presence. He played down fears about Iran exploiting the American withdrawal by increasing its influence. And he said that despite Syria's prominent role in the region, he did not believe its bloody uprising would spill across its borders.
''There was a sense,'' Mr. Biden said of his meeting with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, ''that it would be able to be handled without any conflagration going beyond Syria, and that it could be localized to Syria, and that transition could take place.''
Turkey and the United States are talking about economic assistance and advice for Syria in forming a government after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad, which Mr. Biden said was ''probable.'' But he did not say whether the United States had found a viable representative of the opposition movement, which is more fractured than the one in Libya that overthrew the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
Turkey has differed with the United States about how to deal with Iran and has rejected President Obama's call for additional sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program. Mr. Biden said he and Mr. Erdogan had an honest exchange about those disagreements.
''I don't want to sound like Newt Gingrich,'' Mr. Biden said, before stopping himself midsentence, with a sheepish smile, and looking upward as if for divine intervention.
''I don't want to sound like I'm inflating my importance or relationship with him,'' he continued, ''but we have listened to each other. And he was genuinely listening to my perspective and wasn't challenging it.''
Mr. Biden also said he had acknowledged to Mr. Erdogan that ''we can't guarantee you that these sanctions are going to bring about any fundamental changes we desire'' in deterring Iran's nuclear ambitions. ''But the fact of the matter is that they are hurting,'' he said.
If the vice president had arguments to make in Turkey and Iraq, he will mainly be offering moral support in Greece. On Monday, in addition to talks with Mr. Papademos, he is to meet with former Prime Minister George A. Papandreou, who resigned amid the deepening crisis.
Mr. Biden shied away from predictions or prescriptions for Europe, though he confirmed discussion of the International Monetary Fund playing a greater role in the rescue efforts.
''All the parties know what has to be done,'' he said. ''It's not like there's a fundamental disagreement on the big elements of what has to be done to get the euro zone in shape. They all know that there's no easy way. It's going to be painful.''
