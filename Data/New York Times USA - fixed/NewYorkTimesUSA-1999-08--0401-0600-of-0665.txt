HEADLINE: Art Bought During Boom Leaves Japan After Bust

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 15

 BODY:
With the stealth of a cat burglar, famous art is leaving Japan. Only a handful of bankers and art dealers know for sure where it is going, and they are not talking.
The paintings, including large numbers of van Goghs, Modiglianis, Renoirs and Picassos that left public view more than a decade ago, are being resold abroad as a result of the country's economic slump. Their whereabouts are even more mysterious today. 
 "We have already lost so much; we are losing so much still -- and I don't mean just we Japanese," said Shin'ichi Segi, an art critic who has tried to track the migration of paintings in and out of Japan with only limited success. "The trail is going cold, perhaps forever."
Official trade figures show that from 1987 through 1991 the Japanese spent more than one trillion yen, or $8.7 billion at current exchange rates, on art. Many art dealers and scholars say the actual value was triple that amount.
Japanese collectors bought at least five of the most expensive works of art ever sold at auction, but only one, van Gogh's "Sunflowers," is still here, in the collection of the Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Company.
The other four -- a van Gogh "Portrait of Dr. Gachet"; a Renoir, "Au Moulin de la Galette," and two Picassos, "Acrobat and Young Harlequin" and "Pierrette's Wedding" -- have left Japan, apparently ending up in Europe or the United States along with countless other paintings bought by the Japanese at the peak of the bubble economy.
"There's a loss of face associated with this art," said Chieko Hasegawa, owner of the Nichido Gallery in Ginza. "The sale of these paintings sends two messages: that you have financial difficulties and that you paid too much for them from the start."
The flurry of Japanese purchases in the late 1980's and early 90's set off a wave of resentment in the art world comparable to the uproar that ensued when Japanese companies bought Rockefeller Center and the golf course at Pebble Beach, Calif. Curators and dealers regarded the Japanese purchases as losses, and indeed some of the most prominent pieces disappeared into private homes and were rarely seen.
Inevitably, the trophy prices that Japanese buyers paid for real estate collapsed. Confronted with the fact that the value of their collateral did not begin to match the value of their loans, banks began staking claims to whatever assets they could get their hands on, including art. In some cases, financial institutions even lent money to collectors expressly for the purpose of purchasing art, so that art was the collateral. More rarely, the financial institutions themselves bought paintings.
Though the rest of the world considers them treasures, here the paintings are literally bad assets, commonly referred to as "bad debt art," the legacy of an era of profligate spending and lending that many would like to forget.
To be sure, some paintings have been located. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, for instance, recently acquired 10 works from the Fukuoka City Bank, but the museum initially had to swear not to identify the specific works, the deal or the seller. Since then, however, the bank itself has talked about the sale.
But "Dr. Gachet" and "Moulin de la Galette," the two most expensive paintings ever bought at auction, have not been traced. In the spring of 1990, Ryoei Saito, then the president of the Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Company, paid a total of $160.6 million for the two paintings. Soon afterward Mr. Saito sent shivers through the art world when he said he intended to take the paintings to his grave, literally.
In 1992, however, bad debts caught up with Daishowa and Mr. Saito. His creditors cut off his control of Daishowa and seized the paintings, which then disappeared into their warehouse.
The responsibility for selling the paintings fell to the Fuji Bank, one of Daishowa's biggest creditors, and for five years, art dealers and collectors courted the bank. But Fuji held on to the paintings until 1997, when it sold "Moulin de la Galette" to an unidentified foreign buyer. Mr. Segi believes that it fetched roughly $52.1 million, or two-thirds of the $78.1 million Mr. Saito paid for it.
"Dr. Gachet" has also been sold by Fuji, art dealers say, but no one knows who bought it, or when or for how much, although dealers assume that it sold for less than the $82.5 million it cost Mr. Saito. One recent report on German television said the piece had been sold to an American investor for $43 million, but art experts are dubious.
Fuji declined to comment, as did Sumitomo Bank, the Mitsui Trust and Banking Company and several other Japanese financial institutions who have been linked to art sales.
The banks' silence is partly an effort to protect themselves. The rules delineating ownership of property seized as collateral are murky in Japan, art experts say, and bank executives place a premium on their relationships with borrowers.
And despite pressure from the Government for reform, the process of selling off "bad-debt art" is proceeding very slowly, as most negotiations do in Japan.
Christie's Japan has been paying polite calls on collectors and banks since 1992, when it became clear that an economic tailspin would start pushing sales of art bought during the bubble. Last year Christie's effort paid off when it won the right to sell some 500 works of art in the collection and warehouses of the bankrupt Lake Corporation, giving the auction house its best year ever in Japan.
Michael Findlay, Christie's international director for 19th- and 20th-century art, said the Japanese owners had been deeply disappointed by the yawning gap between the value of the art as listed in their account books and its declining market value. Christie's initial bit of business tended to be appraisals aimed at helping sellers meet their accounting needs. "If they could take a $2 million loss that year, we helped them select the painting and get it sold," Mr. Findlay said.
The art market has also started picking up steam, so that the gap between book value and market value has narrowed, encouraging financial institutions to sell.
But ownership issues still loom large, Mr. Findlay and others say. "These paintings do not belong to the banks," Mr. Segi said. "They exist in a kind of no man's land between their owners and the financial institutions that have seized them as collateral."
He said a potential buyer would have to get the approval of both the nominal owner of the painting and the financial institution holding it. The heavy emphasis on relationships in Japanese business means that many owners can choose not to sell their holdings. For instance, a bank may elect to keep a painting in its warehouse in lieu of selling it, so long as the original owner continues to make interest payments on his outstanding debts.
"A person has to die or declare legal bankruptcy before the ownership problems clear up," Mr. Segi said, and people rarely declare bankruptcy in Japan.
The death of Mr. Saito, erstwhile owner of "Dr. Gachet" and "Moulin de la Galette," in March 1996 probably had as much to do with Fuji's decision to sell them as any improvement in the art market or Government pressure, a Fuji official hinted.
The Chiyoda Fire and Marine Insurance Company, an affiliate of the Toyota group, recently arranged the sale of a Braque that belonged to Tomonori Tsurumaki, a former real estate and racetrack mogul whose business was all but bankrupt. Mr. Tsurumaki himself helped Chiyoda with the sale, Mr. Segi and others said.
Mr. Findlay of Christie's said that ownership issues are less complex than many suggest. "Anyone who can produce the work of art is in a position to sell it," he said. "In Japan, many dealers and agents peddle transparencies and color copies of works, and they are usually fishing for offers or trying to get free appraisal advice. I prefer to deal only with individuals or companies who can actually show me the works of art."
Christie's may also be deferring to the Japanese respect for relationships and original ownership. It is currently the custodian of what is perhaps the most mysterious painting in modern history, "Pierrette's Wedding," which was part of the collateral retained by Lake when the GE Capital Corporation bought Lake's consumer finance business.
The painting was taken from Mr. Tsurumaki as his business empire crumbled and was stored in the warehouse of Mitsui Trust for a time. Mr. Findlay confirmed that the painting was no longer in Japan, where it was exhibited only once before Mr. Tsurumaki was forced to part with it. But Mr. Findlay insisted it was not for sale.
"Not even in the private market," he said. "It is not being offered. I don't think this is the right time."
Has Mr. Tsurumaki requested that Christie's hold off on a sale of the elusive "Pierrette," hoping perhaps that he might one day retrieve it? Mr. Tsurumaki is not saying, and neither is Mr. Findlay.
"These paintings coming out of Japan are being bought by wealthy people who lead private lives," Mr. Findlay said. "That's not unusual. The buyers of 70 percent of the works sold at auction are not identified."

HEADLINE: ACTIVITY AT BANK RAISES SUSPICIONS OF RUSSIA MOB TIE

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER with TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Billions of dollars have been channeled through the Bank of New York in the last year in what is believed to be a major money laundering operation by Russian organized crime, law enforcement officials say.
From October through March some $4.2 billion, in more than 10,000 transactions, passed through one account, investigators said. 
 But because the account has remained open to help a continuing investigation by the Federal authorities, investigators estimate that as much as $10 billion may have flowed through the bank in that account and related ones since early last year.
Investigators say the transactions seem to add up to one of the largest money laundering operations ever uncovered in the United States, with vast sums of money moving in and out of the bank in a day. But they are quick to point out that the inquiry is still in its early stages and that they do not yet know the full scale of the operation or where the money ended up.
Yesterday the Bank of New York said it had suspended two employees whose names had surfaced in the investigation. Both are senior officers in the bank's Eastern European division and are married to Russian businessmen, one of whom is believed by investigators to have controlled one of the accounts.
The suspensions of the two women, Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky of New York, and Lucy Edwards of London, followed questions about the investigation from The New York Times. The employees have been suspended pending completion of the investigation.
"The Bank of New York has been cooperating with the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in a confidential investigation of the use of bank facilities to transfer funds from Russia to other countries," the bank said in a statement.
"There are no allegations of wrongdoing by the bank," it said, adding that no customer or bank funds had been lost.
An American Government official who follows money laundering said, "What we have here is the penetration of a major U.S. organization by Russian organized crime."
American and European officials have been concerned about the possibility that organized crime syndicates from Russia and other countries could infiltrate financial markets and institutions in Europe and the United States.
Investigators here and abroad have been examining cases in which front companies have tried to raise capital in North America for organized crime activities in Russia through stock offerings.
Since the collapse of the Russian financial system last year, the flight of money out of the country accelerated, and investigators have been on the lookout for activities they suspect are "laundering" operations.
Money laundering is a legal catch phrase that refers to the criminal practice of taking ill-gotten gains and moving them through a sequence of bank accounts so they ultimately look like legitimate profits from legal businesses. The money is then withdrawn and used for further criminal activity.
The accounts under scrutiny at the Bank of New York have been linked by investigators to a man who Western law enforcement officials say is a major figure in Russian organized crime, Semyon Yukovich Mogilevich. Mr. Mogilevich is involved in a wide range of activities from arms trafficking and extortion to prostitution, American and European law enforcement and intelligence agencies say.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation was alerted to the suspected money laundering at the Bank of New York more than a year ago by the British authorities. The F.B.I. said yesterday that it would have no comment on the investigation.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York State Banking Department declined to comment on whether they had begun their own investigations of the Bank of New York.
An initial round of Federal subpoenas issued to the bank produced 3,500 pages of transactions for one account in the name of a company called Benex, said investigators. They would say little about what information they have about Benex, its location or its activities.
A few years ago, Benex tried to get visas to the United States for individuals associated with Mr. Mogilevich, an American official said; the visas were not granted.
It is likely to take many months before the investigators sift through the documents and penetrate the complex web of offshore companies and holding companies to determine precisely where the money came from and where it went.
British intelligence reported that some of the money from the account went to pay contract killers and some went to drug barons, American officials said.
Mr. Mogilevich is considered smart, ruthless and vastly wealthy. A 1995 British intelligence report said he was worth $100 million. Last year, after an American journalist, Robert Friedman, wrote a long expose of his criminal career in The Village Voice, Mr. Mogilevich put out a contract on the reporter's life, the Central Intelligence Agency and the F.B.I. said.
The threat was picked up during a telephone intercept by the C.I.A., which was monitoring Mr. Mogilevich's phone. A European law enforcement official said recently that the contract was for $100,000. Mr. Friedman went into hiding for a while and later resumed writing.
The C.I.A. and European intelligence agencies have been intensely monitoring the activities of Mr. Mogilevich, who is 53, for five years, an American official said recently.
An F.B.I. report on Russian organized crime said that when the Soviet Union withdrew its military forces from East Germany, many Russian generals sold their weapons to Mr. Mogilevich, who in turn sold them, at much higher prices, to countries like Iraq, Iran and Serbia.
The money laundering operation was uncovered by the British authorities last summer as part of an investigation of financial activities of Russian organized crime.
While sifting through boxes of documents that turned up in the British investigation, investigators found references to a company named Benex that was linked to an American company, YBM Magnex, which was a front for Mr. Mogilevich, officials said.
YBM, based in Philadelphia and once traded on the Canadian stock exchange, was an operating company -- it made and sold industrial magnets -- and a money laundering vehicle for Mr. Mogilevich, American and British officials have said.
In June YBM pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud in Federal District Court in Philadelphia, and the United States Attorney's office there is still considering whether to indict Mr. Mogilevich.
The YBM case was one reflection of the success of Russian organized crime in infiltrating Western financial markets, American and European officials said.
But "it's a drop in the bucket" compared with what has happened at the Bank of New York, said an American official.
The account at the Bank of New York was opened by a Russian-American last year, an investigator said. He declined to give the person's name.
The volume of transactions through the accounts has been extraordinary, officials said, and often the money went in and out quickly. That should have made the bank suspicious, said an investigator.
But investigators said the bank had filed only one "suspicious activity report" with the Federal authorities -- after the authorities began investigating.
Yesterday the bank would not discuss the filing of any reports with the authorities.
If unusual activity occurs in an account, banks are required to file "suspicious activity reports" to a system monitored by the United States Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, as well as the country's five main banking regulators. The reports are confidential, and the Treasury's network declined to comment yesterday on whether it had received any such report from the Bank of New York recently.
At one time the American authorities froze the Benex account, which had $34 million in it, an investigator said. But they quickly unfroze it. Individuals close to the investigation said the Government wanted to monitor where the money was coming from and where it was going.
The accounts have been handled by Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a senior vice president of the bank in New York, said Government officials in New York and Washington.
Born in Russia, she emigrated to the United States in 1979, and after earning a master's degree at Princeton joined a management training program at the bank, according to articles in Bankers Monthly magazine and the newspaper The American Banker in 1992 and 1993 respectively.
In the early 1990's, after the collapse of Communism, Ms. Kagalovsky was put in charge of bringing in new business from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
A few years ago she married Konstantin Kagalovsky, who has been an economic adviser to the Russian Government and from 1992 to 1995 was Russia's representative to the International Monetary Fund.
Ms. Kagalovsky, 44, declined to answer any questions yesterday.
Investigators are also looking at the role played by Lucy Edwards, a vice president of the bank in London working on Eastern European accounts.
Two months ago, Ms. Edwards spoke at a two-day conference on international financial services for Scandinavian, Eastern European and Russian clients. She was the first speaker on the second day. Her topic was "Money Laundering: Latest Developments and Regulations."
Ms. Edwards was also born in Russia, an American official said, and acquired American citizenship by marriage. After a divorce, she married a Russian, Peter Berlin, and he subsequently became an American citizen, the official added. Investigators say they believe that Mr. Berlin had authority over the Benex account at the Bank of New York.
Mr. Berlin could not be located.
Ms. Edwards's assistant in London, who gave her name only as Rachel, said Ms. Edwards was traveling. She added that it was bank policy that no one on the staff could speak to reporters. After being told more details of the money laundering investigation, she referred questions to Ms. Kagalovsky.

HEADLINE: EARTHQUAKE IN TURKEY: THE OVERVIEW;
Recrimination and Rescue in Turkey; Toll Hits 4,000 -- Shoddy Housing Vulnerable

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Aug. 18

 BODY:
More than 1,000 relief workers from 19 countries joined the frantic search today for victims of Tuesday's devastating earthquake as grieving survivors raised an outcry over shoddy construction practices and lax government regulations.
 Although rescue workers continued to find people in the rubble, the death toll climbed steadily: By early Thursday, officials quoted by the Anatolian news agency put the total at 4,053 dead. 
 More than 16,000 people were listed as seriously injured.
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit warned that the death toll could rise. Rescue teams have been unable to reach some areas because roads are impassable and communications disrupted.
Parliament met in special session, and members listened gravely as the Minister of Public Works and Housing, Koray Aydin, described the extent of the calamity.
"We are facing the greatest natural disaster in the history of the Turkish Republic," Mr. Aydin said. "For the first time, we have had an earthquake that affected the area where 45 percent of the Turkish population lives."
Foreign help is especially vital because early rescue efforts by the Turkish authorities have been plagued by inexperience, poor organization and lack of supplies. In some stricken towns, newly arrived foreigners found no organized rescue efforts under way and took charge themselves, directing battalions of eager volunteers.
News commentators pilloried the Government for what they said were inexcusable lapses, both in preparing for an earthquake that scientists said was sure to come and in dealing with it after it struck.
"The rescue effort is a fiasco," one Istanbul newspaper asserted. Another said, "Rescue and relief is coming late or not at all."
Several experts blamed unscrupulous contractors and ineffective inspectors for having contributed to the scope of the catastrophe by allowing the construction of flimsy buildings.
"The inevitable happened, despite years and years of repeated warnings," said Ahmet Ercan, a professor of geophysics at Istanbul Technical University. "Officials refused to face facts. They never insisted that contractors survey the risks and build earthquake-resistant structures. Maybe after this bitter experience, we will update our regulations along the lines of Japan, the United States and Mexico."
The epicenter of the quake was near Izmit, about 55 miles southeast of Istanbul. There, an astonishing number of the destroyed buildings were new, built within the past five years.
Semiha Adiyaman, a plump and vigorous grandmother in her sixties, lived in one of five five-story apartment buildings perched on a hilltop just outside Izmit.
Today she stood by possessions that workers had extracted from the rubble: a pile of clothing, suitcases that did not close, curtains, a kitchen chair. She clambered over concrete debris to the fringes of the rock pile that was once her home.
"This is what you should look into," she said angrily, grabbing hold of quarter-inch steel rods jutting out of the concrete. "This is too thin and it was done to save money. Somebody needs to look into this and ask if the buildings were too weak."
Many other residents posed similar questions, complaining that contractors had scrimped on the amount of cement used to bind the concrete.
In Darica, a suburb of Izmit, the central shopping area reopened more or less normally today. The weekly street markets bustled, selling everything from fruit to shoes. Yet on the hilltop where Mrs. Adiyaman lived, perhaps a mile away, three out of the five identical apartment buildings had been flattened.
Fatal earthquakes are common in Turkey, occurring about once every two years, but most strike the sparsely populated east. This one hit the densely populated industrial heartland south of Istanbul.
Some neighborhoods in Istanbul were also damaged, but Tuesday's quake was not the enormous one that some scientists say is likely to strike this teeming metropolis in the coming decades.
Historic monuments like the Hagia Sophia, once the seat of Byzantine power, and Topkapi Palace, from which Ottoman sultans ruled, were left unscathed.
The United States Geological Survey first said the quake had a magnitude of 7.8, but downgraded that to 7.4, still one of the strongest of the century anywhere in the world. Turkish seismologists put its strength at 7.4.
"It's an extremely serious quake, really terrible," said a foreign diplomat who toured the affected area by car and helicopter. "You see these huge heaps of rubble and you ask, 'How are they ever going to get anyone out of there?' "
There were no aftershocks today, but many families have nonetheless chosen to remain in tents or other outdoor shelters for a few more days.
With so much effort being made to rescue those who may still be alive, there has been little time to assess long-term damage. But television films from many towns showed utter destruction that will certainly cripple Turkey's effort to climb out of the economic troubles into which it has fallen this year.
Teams of foreign rescue workers arrived steadily at the Istanbul airport. Officials carrying clipboards wandered through the arrival lounge asking passengers, "Are you rescue people?"
Among emergency workers who arrived today were 70 from the United States, most of them firefighters who rushed to Izmit.
There, the country's largest oil refinery burned through the day as emergency crews awaited specially equipped French and German planes that were used to extinguish oil well fires after the Persian Gulf war.
Nearly every European country sent money, relief workers or equipment, including Greece, which is Turkey's principal rival in the eastern Mediterranean. The European Union contributed $2.1 million. Relief planes also arrived from Egypt, Jordan, Algeria, Pakistan and Japan.
The largest foreign contributor has been Israel, which dispatched two firefighting planes, teams of dogs trained to track buried people and 350 relief workers, some from specialized military units that joined the search for survivors after two American embassies in Africa were bombed last year. Israel also pledged to send a field hospital within a few days.
Turkey and Israel have forged a strong strategic partnership in recent years, and Israel is evidently eager to show that it can be a good friend when Turkey is in need.
Turkish television stations broadcast nearly nonstop coverage of relief efforts. The most poignant scenes showed victims being brought out from the wreckage of collapsed buildings. Overwrought spectators cheered and sobbed each time a survivor was found, and simply sobbed when bodies, including many of small children, were seen to be lifeless.
Although Izmit and nearby Adapazari were the hardest hit, another focus of the relief effort is Golcuk, a port on the Sea of Marmara. The navy base there was destroyed, and local officials said 100 sailors and officers may lie beneath the rubble.
Turkey sits atop some of the world's most unstable geology. Scientists said Tuesday's earthquake was along the Anatolia Fault, a 100-mile arc that winds beneath northwestern provinces near Istanbul.
"It was certainly no surprise," said Ahmet Mete Isikara, director of an observatory in Istanbul and a leading specialist on earthquake risk. "There is no technique for predicting earthquakes, so we couldn't say when it would happen, but we knew it would, sooner or later.
"This Anatolia Fault zone is quite complex, but certainly the possibility of an even bigger earthquake, even one in Istanbul, is still there. Most probably we will get a lot of lessons from this quake. We have to; otherwise we will suffer the same thing in the future."

New Airline to Fly To New York Cities

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
A new low-fare airline said yesterday that it would fly Buffalo, Syracuse and Rochester routes within its first 18 months in business.
Pledging air fares about 65 percent lower than current prices, JetBlue Airways plans to begin operations early next year and serve up to a dozen cities, primarily along the East Coast, by the end of the first year. 
 David Neelman, the JetBlue chief executive, previously started the Salt Lake City-based Morris Air, which he sold to Southwest Airlines in 1993, and WestJet of Canada.
JetBlue's Airbus A-320 aircraft will feature 24-channel in-flight satellite television at every seat. "Upstate New York has some of the highest air fares in the entire country," said United States Senator Charles E. Schumer. "The high air fares in Buffalo have had a crippling effect on the local economy, and the prospect of adding a new, low-cost air service will provide a boost for the region's economy."
The airline, previously known as New Air, will be based at Kennedy International Airport.

Metropolitan Life Agrees To Settle Consumer Suits
Metropolitan Life Insurance agreed to settle class-action and other lawsuits accusing the company of cheating millions of customers through deceptive sales practices. 
 The settlement, which must be approved by a Federal judge, would be the latest in a series of multimillion-dollar settlements by life insurers accused of fraud. It is intended to cover seven million current and past policyholders who bought products between 1982 and 1997 and is valued at $1.7 billion. Page A1.
 
China Plans Curbs on Construction
Chinese officials announced that they would ban construction of any new factories that make a broad range of ordinary consumer items. The ban, which also covers the construction of luxury hotels, apartment and office buildings and department stores, is intended to shackle deflation. A1.
 
A $3.3 Billion Supermarket Deal
Food Lion said it planned to acquire Hannaford Brothers for $3.3 billion, forming the sixth-largest supermarket chain in the country. The acquisition would give Food Lion, which is strong in the Southeast, a presence in the Northeast and a way to gain on competitors. The deal continues the rapid consolidation of the grocery industry. C6.
 
Mob Suspected in Money Laundering
Billions of dollars have been channeled through the Bank of New York in the last year in what is thought to be a major money laundering operation by Russian organized crime, law enforcement officials say. A1.
 
U.S. to Register Money Dealers
Seeking to stem the flow of billions of dollars in illegal drug profits out of the country, the Treasury Department announced that it would require all check-cashing businesses and other money servicing firms -- which drug smugglers and dealers often use -- to register with the Federal authorities. C6.
 
News Corporation Earnings Fall
The News Corporation's earnings fell below analysts' forecasts as weak results from its Fox television network offset strong gains in its 20th Century Fox film division. The Australia-based media company, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, reported a 19.5 percent slide in after-tax earnings to $214 million, or 21 cents an American depository receipt, for the three months ended June 30. C8.
 
Pilots and American Air Still Differ
American Airlines and its pilots union failed to reach agreement over the airline's planned integration of Reno Air, which it acquired, after a last-ditch attempt by a mediator to broker an agreement between the two sides. C8.
 
Change of Control for Vespa Maker?
The Texas Pacific Group is close to a deal to spend about $650 million to acquire a controlling interest in Piaggio Veicoli Europei, the Italian group that manufactures the Vespa, a perky little Italian motor scooter immortalized in the 1953 American film "Roman Holiday." C4.
 
Iridium Proposes a Debt Swap
Iridium, the global satellite telephone company that has filed for bankruptcy protection, said it had proposed that a group of bondholders swap $1.45 billion of debt for a 33 percent stake. The bondholders have not agreed to do so, the company said, although Motorola, its biggest investor, backs the plan. C8.

The grading may betoo easy on health plans' report cards.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
NOTHING spurs college students to improve mastery of history or math as does the prospect of getting an F. And the same principle holds true, it seems, for health care plans, opening a huge opportunity for businesses to get better health care for their employees.
The National Committee for Quality Assurance, a nonprofit organization, grades about 400 health maintenance organizations covering about 75 percent of the 80 million patients enrolled in these plans nationwide. The grades, generally based on self-reported, independently audited data, cover each plan's performance on dozens of preventive and treatment measures. The committee recently released its third annual report card, and the trends are revealing. 
 The percentage of patients given beta blockers to reduce the risk of further problems after heart attacks rose to 80 in 1998 from 62 two years earlier, for example, and the portion of children who received a vaccination for chicken pox before their second birthday increased to 52 percent in 1998 from 40 percent just one year earlier. In nearly all categories, overall scores rose sharply or stayed about the same. Clearly, the students are learning to perform to the test.
Yet the gap in the scores among plans remains huge. The Blue Cross plan in Portland, Me., treated almost 100 percent of its heart attack patients with beta blockers. HIP of New York provided them to only about 54 percent. The Kaiser plan of Honolulu provided eye exams for almost 80 percent of its adult patients with diabetes; the figure for NYL Care of Greenbelt, Md., was only about 7 percent. The Kaiser plan in Denver provided booster shots for measles, mumps and rubella to about 50 percent of its patients by age 13; the figure for the Cigna plan of Cleveland was less than 1 percent.
The disparities should ring alarms among plan members. Performance matters. The National Committee estimates that more than 4,000 lives could be saved annually if the low-performing plans administered beta blockers as routinely as the high-performing plans did. It estimates that 3,000 diabetics could be spared blindness if all health plans provided eye exams as routinely as the best plans did. And there would be almost 60,000 fewer cases of relapse into major depression if every plan managed antidepressant drugs as well as the best plans did, the group calculates.
With the stark results of a national committee's research right there on paper, why hasn't the market weeded out the bad performers? There are at least two reasons.
First, the report cards are woefully incomplete. They grade treatment, not outcomes. Outcomes are what most patients care about; knowing how many breast cancers were caught early and how many women recovered successfully generally matters to them more than how many women received mammograms.
Some plans acknowledge that they can be held accountable for prescribing the right medicines, but they argue that they should not be held accountable for patients' unhealthy behavior, which they do not control. Why should they be penalized, they ask in effect, for asthma patients' refusal to give up their pet cats?
Dr. David Lansky, president of the Foundation for Accountability, a nonprofit organization that designs medical report cards, disagrees with that line of reasoning, however. "Until health plans are held accountable for outcomes," he said, "they are unlikely to take the necessary steps to make sure patients get healthy."
Another reason that health plans balk at producing data on the quality of medical treatment is that collection and analysis can be hugely expensive -- $20,000 or more for each major health problem that researchers want to study.
The National Committee does not focus on outcomes in part because it cannot venture beyond the data that health plans are willing to submit voluntarily. That limitation creates a second problem: few employers pay attention to medical report cards, according to a recent survey by KPMG. In part, that is because incomplete reports provide an unreliable guide to quality. In the survey, over 70 percent of large companies said cost was a major determinant of their choice of health plan, but less than 10 percent said data on the quality of medical care was very important.
Because employers pay little attention to data on medical outcomes, Dr. Lansky said, health plans "see no business advantage in spending the money." So plans do not produce ample report cards because employers do not use them; and employers do not use ample report cards because the health plans do not produce them.
There might be a circuitous way out of this. Some employers and local governments have asked Dr. Lansky's group to go straight to patients to seek information about the performance of their health plans. Data provided by patients, however, present problems of reliability. Also, Dr. Lansky points out that patients can turn to the Internet to solicit reviews of a doctor's treatment of their illness from independent physicians or, perhaps, patients with similar medical problems. Congress could step in, demanding that managed care and traditional fee-for-service plans provide data on outcomes. Workers could demand more information from employers.
Colleges grade students -- an unpleasant, time-consuming process -- because the best ones insist on a concrete record of their performance to show to potential employers or professional schools. In health, the best plans could also be expected to demand grades, providing the necessary data for employers to examine.
But first, employers must demand rigorous data. So far, few have. Health plans can be counted on to learn to the test. But as long as the test remains simple, there will not be much to learn.

 CORRECTION:
The Economic Scene column in Business Day on Aug. 19 about the grading of health care plans by the National Committee for Quality Assurance included an erroneous report from the committee about the kinds of inoculations received by patients in the Kaiser Permanente plan in Denver and the Cigna plan in Cleveland. The Kaiser plan provided a booster shot for measles, mumps and rubella, three hepatitis B vaccinations and one chicken pox vaccination to about 50 percent of its patients by age 13; the figure for the Cigna plan was less than 1 percent. The figures did not refer solely to shots for measles, mumps and rubella.

Generational Profile? No, It's the Sex, Stupid

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:

RUN CATCH KISS
By Amy Sohn
255 pages. Simon & Schuster. $23.
A little-known event that took place around the time that Richard M. Nixon was resigning as President was the birth of Amy Sohn, the ingenuish author of "Run Catch Kiss," a clever, awkwardly hip, flimsy novel of Generation X. The sociological astrology of Ms. Sohn's birth deserves some attention here, especially in light of the consciously vapid concupiscence of her book, which evokes the life and fantasies of a young sex columnist for a downtown alternative weekly in New York. 
 The birth date question seems relevant for several reasons. One is that Ms. Sohn has emerged as a representative of her generation, those comfortably nihilistic, politically disengaged, economically anxious urbanites about whom so much has been written. Second, Ms. Sohn actually is a sex columnist, for The New York Press, a conservative alternative weekly published in Manhattan, and the fact that there are sex columnists these days is perhaps a not extremely subtle clue to the spirit of the times.
Third, there is the theory of the end of history, which also means the end of world-historical causes and meanings. A concomitant to the end of history is a kind of spiritual inversion in which sex, for example, along with a cynical, solipsistic self-satisfaction, replaces the outward-looking idealism that was once characteristic of youth.
Well, I don't believe in generational determinism; not all people in their 20's inhabit Ms. Sohn's world of detached, hedonistic bohemianism. Still, there is something about her career so far that suggests a mini-Zeitgeist, and "Run Catch Kiss" is a good emblem of it. It is a clever and witty book, but it is also more a collection of fragments, held together by a slender strand of plot, than a fully formed novel.
The subject is sex and longing. More specifically, the subject is a young woman's desperate efforts to: 1, make it in the downtown world of New York; 2, find true love, and 3, while she's waiting, have lots of sex: sex about as mysterious and spiritually fulfilling as brushing your teeth. The Spenglerian gloom-and-doom forces among us would lament that after 3,000 years of civilization it has come to this.
There is a bright and funny side to "Run Catch Kiss," mostly in the fact that Ms. Sohn is a talented woman who writes with an energetic self-mockery. There are many clever moments in her picaresque tale of an updated Holly Golightly whose unhinged sexual experiences are material for her newspaper column. The woman in question is a recent Brown graduate named Ariel Steiner who falls into writing her sex column for a politically conservative downtown newspaper called City Week. The sex is mostly unfulfilling, but Ariel needs material, so she keeps on trying to get it, even as she worries about what her parents -- liberal and permissive, but there's a limit! -- will think.
The reason the sex is not very good is that the young men involved in Ariel's life are far too self-absorbed and egotistical to be of much use. This gives Ms. Sohn some pretty good satirical targets. Her story about the boyfriend who snorts heroin so casually he has no idea how transgressive it is serves as a commentary on the bland unawareness of Ariel's world.
"Downtown Rag Cans Fibbing Squibber" is the tabloid headline when Ariel is fired from her job as sex columnist after her editors discover she has been making up some of her sexual adventures. That's not only an on-the-mark tabloid headline but also a well-aimed dart at a kind of introverted journalistic idealism, like a thief getting morally outraged when his pocket is picked.
"I think how baseball is kind of like sex, because it's not a consistently high-energy sport," Ariel muses as she watches the 1996 World Series in a bar. "There are these intermittent surges of excitement every once in a while, followed by a steady lull for a few minutes, until the next surge comes again." Ms. Sohn's Brown University composition instructor would have given a high mark for that.
There is some fun here, in other words. Ariel, who is Ms. Sohn's narrator, likens herself to Dorothy Parker and Fran Lebowitz, and one senses more than a little autobiographical projection in this. Who knows? Maybe that thinly disguised prophecy will hold true. But so far, despite the fun to be had in "Run Catch Kiss," Ms. Sohn hasn't arrived yet. This novel is also bit like Ariel's baseball; it has a few surges, but mostly it is tedious in its adorable, hapless, nervously brash one-note-ness.
Aside from her few acidulous comments on her cohort's collective consciousness, Ms. Sohn doesn't have much to say even as she recycles herself as material, no longer for a sex column but for a sex novel. At the end of the century, after Henry Miller, Philip Roth, Erica Jong and others who have exploited the sexual confessional mode, she seems not only imitative but palely imitative as well.
Here again Ms. Sohn provides material that she aims at others but that could just as well be aimed at herself. At one point Ariel is talking about her drug-addict boyfriend, complaining that all he talks about is "what geniuses Hunter S. Thompson, Carlos Castaneda and Jim Carroll were." But, she says, "a girl can hear only so much about Thompson, Castaneda and Carroll before she starts to get a little bored."
Well, a reader can also have enough of unmodulated erotic bravado. What "Run Catch Kiss" needs is some psychological or moral depth to go with its slick, commercially oriented wit and bawdy energy. One sees in this book the beginnings of a generation-specific satire, but only the beginnings. And in a novel, unlike a newspaper column, the beginnings are not enough.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
A Luscious Journey, Exhaustively Annotated

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
It is not a good sign when the most memorable thing about an exhibition is not the art on the walls but the artist's chronology in the catalogue. Such is the case with the exhibition of David Reed's suave, technically dazzling paintings at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City.
In tone, extent and detail, the chronology offers a telling verbal equivalent of Mr. Reed's paintings: their precision, erudition, seductiveness and ambition, but also their naivete, sentimentality and pretentiousness and, ultimately, their academicism. 
 Midway through it, I thought it might be ironic, an intentional play on the convention of the artist's chronology and its inevitable inflations. But it is too long, serious and self-serving to be anything but unwitting parody. And although no author is listed, it teems with details that could have come only from the artist.
The chronology provides deep, deep background for Mr. Reed's paintings, the most recent of which juxtapose razor-edged sections of luscious, luminous paint, carefully choreographed and arranged and layered in contrasting folds, waves, brush strokes and flourishes. It outlines a lifetime of epiphanies involving natural light, art, architecture, the landscape and color, as well as significant encounters with such luminaries as Marcel Duchamp, John Cage and Anthony Perkins.
It fawns over entry-level art experiences: "1965 . . . impressed with Giotto's frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua." It celebrates routine exchanges: "1968 . . . discusses the southwest landscape, Piero della Francesca and spaghetti westerns with Philip Guston" (these were among Guston's favorite topics, and he loved to talk). Possible attendance records are noted: "1971 . . . returns 12 times to the Barnett Newman show at the Museum of Modern Art." And the tiniest of visual experiences are remembered: "In Bologna, see reflections of light connecting viewers to Ludovico Carracci's 'Calling of St. Matthew.' "
It includes quirkily intimate personal memories, most of which also involve light, color and popular culture. These strike one as the kind of tidbits that an artist might reveal, against his better judgment, to a relentlessly adoring biographer who then publishes them over the artist's protests.
All these words conduct an odd dance with the paintings, reflecting, explaining and contradicting them in equal parts. Together they present an intelligent artist, more ambitious than talented, who has always managed to upgrade his work by skillfully plucking the latest ideas from the work around him.
There are 21 canvases on view, in a reduced version of the show organized last winter at the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego. The earliest works feature repeating horizontal brush strokes made wet on wet in black on white and reflect Mr. Reed's participation in the process-oriented strategies of the mid-1970's. They are heavily indebted to the art of Robert Ryman, which developed in the early 1960's, and have quite a bit in common with the early 1970's paintings of Harriet Korman and Mary Heilmann, none of whom are mentioned in the catalogue.
The show picks up again in the mid-1980's and 90's, by which time Mr. Reed had pushed his what-you-see-is-what-you-get approach to the level of technical tour de force, achieving a post-modernist melding of the ironic and the gorgeous, the painterly and the photographic. In this he joins a disparate array of abstract painters inspired by Warhol, Conceptual Art, Post-Minimalism and post-modernist appropriation, including Peter Halley, Jonathan Lasker, Christopher Wool, Fabian Marcaccio, Richard Prince, James Nares, Albert Oehlen and Jacqueline Humphries. He also seems to have learned a thing or two about juxtaposition and punching visual windows in a surface from David Salle.
And, fittingly, the show includes two forays into video installation art: "Judy's Bedroom" from 1992 and "Scottie's Bedroom" from 1994. In these, Mr. Reed digitally hangs one of his paintings over a bed in scenes from Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo," which center, as most of the movie does, on its two main characters, played by James Stewart and Kim Novack. The scene plays on a monitor next to a wall on which hangs the actual painting over an astoundingly precise replica of the bed that appears in the movie. These amusing, self-aggrandizing exercises bring to mind Allan McCollum's "Perpetual Photos," in which the artist took interior scenes from old television shows and substituted his black, blank "surrogates" for all the artworks on the walls.
The paintings are impossibly burdened by the assumption of greatness implicit in the chronology, but its excessive detail does help one see the sheer drive that has propelled these works to their present state of precision and articulation, which constitutes a kind of subjectless, pictorial narrative. The horizontal works, which suggest writing, scrolls and film strips and seem subject to gravity, are far superior to the vertical ones. But both are amazing simply as "product," as carefully thought out, impeccably executed objects that always reflect paintings latest "issues."
The main pleasure comes from trying to figure out the forming process of these tactile yet gleamingly untouched surfaces, with their rich palettes of deep, Christmas-wrapping hues. They are full of contrasting tints and splicings of color, contrasting scales and spatial depths, contrasting fluidities. Some of the serpentine coilings are dense and smooth, like paint (or shaving cream or toothpaste) fresh out of the tube; some are rough and brushy whiplashes that conjure up more traditional notions of the artist's hand.
Usually the swirlings of paint seem more like photographs than the real thing and sometimes like negatives of photographs. They can be dark and eerie, touched with sinister Darth Vaderesque gleams of light, or transparent and laid over one another. In "No. 228" of 1986, for example, no fewer than five overlays figure in the center of a surface divided between magenta and turquoise. They can sit on closed monochrome surfaces or appear to be swamped in fluid washes of color. In "No. 283-2" of 1989-91, brushwork of pale green is engulfed by a candy pink.
In the catalogue's essays, Mr. Reed's work is placed within a vaunted tradition of artists who have aggressively used paint as paint and as image, starting with Jackson Pollock, Roy Lichtenstein and Gerhard Richter, as well as Titian and Caravaggio.
In fact his work is perhaps most accurately described as a late, late form of Color Field painting that combines the strictly controlled self-references of that style with worldly, even Pop-ish allusions -- to photography, mechanical processes and kitsch -- that the original formalists detested. As with much Color Field Painting, Mr. Reed's paintings seem turned out, each work remarkably similar to the next.
Once one has worked through the Mr. Reed's painterly pyrotechnics and immaculate presentation, there is not much left to consider. Despite their intelligence and surface lusciousness, the paintings have no inner heat. They are not compelling or expressive except as beautiful, even ingenious, puzzlelike problem-solving demonstrations. This suggests a final function for the cloying revelations of the chronology. They compensate for the consummate professionalism of the paintings, providing a sense of the personal, of a life lived, that they otherwise lack.
 David Reed's works are at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, through Aug. 29.

HEADLINE: Too Many Cranberries

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I was distressed to read that Federal environmental regulators have proposed allowing the expansion of cranberry bogs into 300 acres of sensitive New Jersey wetlands (news article, Aug. 18). Wetlands are vital to flood control and water quality. Why must they be destroyed, especially in a densely populated state like New Jersey? 
 The folly is particularly egregious when one considers the current economic plight of cranberry growers. The Department of Agriculture has projected a record crop of cranberries this year in Wisconsin, the No. 1 producer, up 2 percent from 1998. In 1997, a barrel of cranberries sold for $63.70. Last year the price fell to $41.60, and this year it is projected to be less than $40 a barrel.
Clearly the supply of cranberries has grown faster than the demand. It is foolish to destroy wetlands to raise a crop that is in oversupply.

HEADLINE: France Voices Dissatisfaction With U.S.-Led Bombing of Iraq

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 19

 BODY:
France vented long-simmering uneasiness today over the continuing American-led bombing raids on Iraq, setting the stage for what diplomats here expect to be a confrontation with the United States at the United Nations General Assembly next month.
Today was the third occasion on which the French Foreign Ministry has taken issue with the American and British bombing raids. The total raids this year have reached two-thirds the number that the United States, France, Britain and other NATO allies flew this spring against Yugoslav military forces in and around Kosovo. 
 French public opinion supported the attacks on Yugoslavia, but there is widespread criticism here of the stalemate in Iraq. Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement has often complained at Cabinet meetings that France should not support a policy that victimizes innocent Iraqi civilians without being able to do anything to shake President Saddam Hussein's hold on power.
Since mid-summer France has also been circulating detailed proposals for resolving the impasse. An American diplomat said today that the proposals were not as rigorous as British and American demands, which are that Iraq must agree to let United Nations arms inspectors search for forbidden weapons before there can be any talk of relaxing international economic sanctions.
"We don't really see a way out of this difficulty with Paris until we sit down and talk about it at high level," the American official said. "We're not really on the same track as the French."
The French say that by the time Iraq threw out the inspectors last year, they had tracked down and destroyed all the existing nuclear, biological and chemical weapons capacity they were ever going to find.
Now, French officials say, there should be a new monitoring system -- not to try to find whatever banned weapons are still hidden, but to make sure that Iraq does not try to build new factories to make more weapons. As soon as the monitors are in place, economic sanctions can be lifted, they say, 100 days at a time depending on how Iraq behaves.
Almost any inspection system, in the French view, would be better than none, and they say there is none now except aerial surveillance, punctuated by bombing raids.
The French proposal would replace the United Nations Special Commission that Mr. Hussein expelled with a new "control commission" charged, as the United Nations team was, with making sure Iraq did not again become a security threat.
"To avoid this threat, inspectors need to come back to Iraq," a summary of the plan by the Foreign Ministry says. "The return of the inspectors cannot be imposed by military action. It will be obtained only through the restored unity and authority of the Security Council."
What is needed, the plan says, is "a serious and efficient long-term armaments control system with investigation capacities identical to those of the United Nations Special Commission but with renewed structures and working methods."
Exactly what those "renewed structures and working methods" would be is not spelled out, but French officials have told their American counterparts that American and British proposals to the United Nations stand no chance of being accepted by Iraq. The French hope to get Baghdad's acceptance for their own plan.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Fall for the First Time in 4 Days

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday for the first time in four days, as traders reacted to the unexpected widening in the nation's trade deficit.
By late in the day the price of a 30-year bond was down 13/32 to 101 12/32, pushing its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, up to 6.03 percent, from 6 percent on Wednesday.
The trade deficit deepened to $24.6 billion for June from $21.2 billion in May. Analysts had expected a narrowing, with a deficit of $20.6 billion. 
 Currency traders also reacted to the worsening deficit, sending the dollar down against the yen, euro and most other currencies, and that hurt investor demand for United States Government securities, especially among foreign investors who fear possible currency translation losses when they sell their holdings.
The counterbalance to the day's weakness was that the Federal Reserve was in the market as a buyer for the second consecutive day yesterday, purchasing coupons with maturities ranging from Feb. 28, 2001, to May 31, 2002.
Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at I.D.E.A. Global.com, a financial consulting firm, said that the trade report and the weakening dollar did not have as much of an effect on Treasuries as might have been expected because market participants limited their trading ahead of next week's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
Mr. Stiles expects the Fed to raise the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans by a quarter of a percentage point and lift the discount rate that the Fed charges member banks by a similar amount. "However, I don't see how a 5.25 percent Federal funds rate is going to significantly alleviate the imbalances the Fed is worried about," he added.
In another report that traders were watching yesterday, the Philadelphia Fed said that regional business activity indicated a continued pick-up. Its index of general business conditions increased to 12.0 in August from 7.8 the month before.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Third Man

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The important thing to know is not who fired the shot but who paid for the bullet.
The novelist Eric Ambler wrote that in 1937. Ever since Dec. 21, 1988, the search for the answer has been central to the lives of 270 families -- the survivors of every person aboard Pan Am 103, mostly Americans, and the 11 Scots killed on the ground by falling pieces of plane and humans. 
 On Monday in Washington, Scottish prosecutors will talk to the families (no press) about the trial ahead in The Hague for two Libyan agents who have been indicted in America and Scotland.
I doubt there will be a person in the room, including prosecutors, or any intelligence official anywhere who does not know that Muammar el-Qaddafi commanded his agents to blow up the plane. They were on his secret service payroll.
In The Hague, he controls their mouths as if they were in Tripoli. They will deny he knew anything about anything -- if they have any interest in the lives of their families back home in Tripoli.
Some relatives of the Pan Am victims have prepared questions for the visiting Scots:
* Since a U.N. document approved in Washington and London promises that the trial will not be used to "undermine" the Libyan Government, which means Muammar and only Muammar, will you be free to follow a probing line about his guilt?
* Since the press is not around, do tell us, do you believe in fairy tales? Do you believe that two men working directly under the supervision of Qaddafi's relatives could get the money, equipment and false passports to pull the plot together in Tripoli, Malta and Frankfurt, organize explosive experts and airport connections to get the device aboard an American plane at precisely the right time, and whisk back to Libya all safe and sound -- all without a word about the operation getting through to Qaddafi, who would have chopped their fool heads off if they dared carry out, without his permission, a crime that wrecked his economy with sanctions?
* If you can't really believe such a cockamamie story, why is your Government and ours demeaning the sorrow of the Pan Am relatives by the charade of a trial?
* Since there is no death penalty in the Scottish law under which the two men are to be tried, and killers are being freed early in Northern Ireland, Israel and the Balkans, what is the longest they could serve?
* Since Scottish law permits defendants to be acquitted on a verdict of "not proven," is it possible they won't serve a day?
* Oh, and what about the long, strong belief of Western agents that Syria and Iran were also involved in the explosion plot, very much -- until the Westerners were suddenly persuaded to believe it no longer?
Never has sorrow been more bitter to the Pan Am relatives than now, when so many countries are becoming part of a conspiracy with Qaddafi to rescue him by limiting the trial to his two agents -- and accepting his golden word that he knew nothing, not a thing.
Sanctions against Libya for refusing to give up the agents were "suspended" when Qaddafi decided that, given the U.N. "no undermining" condition, the Scots could have a chance to question the two after all.
The rush to the Libyan trough began instantly. Zippo, full diplomatic ties were restored with Libya and construction and oil contracts signed.
The Pan Am families know -- as do we all, no escape -- that the international decision to accept a trial without Qaddafi even mentioned in the indictments was motivated by those Libyan contracts. Money was what our friends and allies settled for. Qaddafi got the rebuilding of the Libyan economy he had smashed himself.
For reporting that the Blair Government has evidence that Qaddafi personally ordered the Pan Am bombing, the Sunday Times of London got a formal warning that any follow-up story would result in the punitive injunctions allowed by British law. No denials; just the warning.
So far, the U.S. has not suspended the U.N.-ordered sanctions it had supported. Good; we shall see.
Sanctions are not imposed out of peeve but to restrain rogue nations, for the protection of their chosen targets. So it's a wonder to relatives of the murdered, and to me, that America's public and journalists do not think more about Dec. 21, 1988, particularly when they board an American plane, and about who owns the bullet.

HEADLINE: Linking Drop in Crime to Rise in Abortion

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE 

 BODY:
No one is certain why crime rates have plummeted in the United States over the last decade. But that fact has not prevented politicians from gleefully taking credit for the downturn, or academics from ruminating endlessly on its causes.
The newest theory about why crime is down, however, put forward in a report by two highly regarded economists, is drawing both outrage and intense debate -- even before the full report has been published or subjected to peer review. 
 In the report, Dr. John J. Donohue 3d of Stanford Law School and Dr. Steven D. Levitt of the University of Chicago contend that a large share of the drop in crime in the 1990's -- perhaps as much as half -- can be attributed to the sharp increase in abortions after the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade in 1973.
Fewer crimes are being committed now, the researchers say, because many of the children who might have grown up to commit those crimes were never born. Within a few years of the Roe v. Wade decision, which established a constitutional right to abortion, up to a quarter of pregnancies ended in abortion, statistics show.
Dr. Donohue and Dr. Levitt base their thesis on economic analyses of crime rates from 1985 to 1997, examined as a function of abortion rates two decades before.
The timing of the decline in crime, they found, coincided with the period when children born shortly after the Roe v. Wade decision would be reaching the late teen-age years -- the peak ages for criminal activity.
States that were the first to legalize abortion, Dr. Donohue and Dr. Levitt found, including New York, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii, were also the first to experience a decrease in crime. For example, in states that legalized abortion in 1969 or 1970, the researchers found, the cumulative decrease in crime from 1982 to 1997 was greater than for the rest of the nation. The decrease in murder was 16.2 percent greater, the decrease in violent crime over all was 34.4 percent greater, and the decrease in property crime was 35.3 percent greater.
Also, states with the highest abortion rates, the researchers found, had larger reductions in crime than states with low abortion rates.
The most likely explanation for these findings, the researchers assert, is that abortion has occurred selectively, decreasing the number of children likely to commit crimes as adults.
"Most of the reduction," Dr. Levitt and Dr. Donohue write, "appears to be attributable to higher rates of abortion by mothers whose children are most likely to be at risk for future crime." Teen-agers, unmarried women and black women, for example, have higher rates of abortion, the researchers note, and children born to mothers in these groups are statistically at higher risk for crime in adulthood.
The economic benefit to society of abortion in reducing crime, the researchers suggest, "may be on the order of $30 billion annually."
The conclusion of the report, a draft of which was posted on a Web site of the Social Science Research Network, is not a popular one. When it was reported in The Chicago Tribune on Aug. 8, it provoked angry op-ed columns, tirades on radio talk shows and expressions of indignation by groups on both sides of the abortion divide.
And the economists have been accused of everything from promoting eugenics to recommending abortion as a means to reduce crime.
"It takes great skill to simultaneously infuriate the right and the left," said Dr. Alfred Blumstein, an expert on crime rates and University Professor at the Heinz School of Carnegie Mellon University, observing the ferocity of the response.
In a news release, Joseph Scheidler, executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, called the study "so fraught with stupidity that I hardly know where to start refuting it."
"Naturally, if you kill off a million and a half people a year," Mr. Scheidler said, "a few criminals will be in that number. So will doctors, philosophers, musicians and artists."
Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, an organization based in Washington, commented that even if the report's findings were right, "the question in a certain sense is, 'So what?'
"I don't think it has any policy implications whatsoever," Ms. Kissling said. "Abortion is a profoundly private decision" that women make based on "their own lives and circumstances," and not public benefit.
And in a recent column, Carl Rowan wrote, "I've seen a lot of far-fetched and dangerous ideas passed off as 'social research,' but none more shallow and potentially malicious than the claim that the drop in crime in the United States can be attributed to legalized abortions."
Dr. Blumstein and other criminal justice experts acknowledged that the economists may well have demonstrated that abortion rates have had an effect on crime, though until the paper is published and subjected to academic scrutiny, they said, it is difficult to assess the findings.
But they expressed skepticism that abortion's effect on crime was as great as Dr. Donohue and Dr. Levitt posited. Declining crime rates, Dr. Blumstein said, appear to be the result of many complicated factors, including the dwindling of the crack cocaine epidemic, an improved economy, greater job opportunities for low-income youth and the steady growth of the prison population.
Changing attitudes among teen-agers and innovative policing strategies may also be contributors, other experts said.
"These are very able guys," Dr. Blumstein said of Dr. Donohue and Dr. Levitt, "and I'm prepared to believe that they've discerned an effect. But I think they've gone too far in claiming that it can account for half of the decline, when there are a multitude of effects going on that are much more proximate to the situation."
Dr. David J. Garrow, a historian at Emory University and author of "Liberty and Sexuality" (University of California Press, 1998), a history of the abortion debate, called the economists' theory "interesting and original." But he questioned the researchers' knowledge of abortion history and was skeptical of the usefulness of the report.
"The policy implication of this paper is that if you renewed Medicaid funding for abortion at the Federal level, you'd dramatically reduce crime 17 years from now," Dr. Garrow said. "But are we going to find any interest group in America that is going to make that argument? No. Neither side in the debate wants to touch it with a 10-foot pole."
For his part, Dr. Levitt said in an interview that the research was "by no means a complete explanation" and that he and Dr. Donohue were aware that "the world is complicated." He added that they did not intend their work to influence public policy. "Our paper should have little to no impact on any policy regarding abortion," Dr. Levitt said.
"There's nothing in our paper that either indirectly or directly suggests that we condone denying anyone the right to have children if they want to have children," Dr. Levitt added. "We've been accused of having a eugenic agenda and it just is not an accurate appraisal of what we're doing at all. If anything, what our paper says is that when you remove a government prohibition against a woman choosing, the woman makes choices that lead to better outcomes for her children."

HEADLINE: Imports Push Trade Deficit To a New High

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Imports surged in June, driving the nation's trade deficit to another record, as Americans, feeling flush in the strong economy, continued to splurge.
The deficit swelled to $24.6 billion, the Commerce Department reported today, an increase of 16.3 percent from the revised figure for May. 
 The sharp growth -- fueled by rising imports from Japan, China, Western Europe and Mexico -- surprised many economists who had predicted that the gap would begin to narrow because the economies of Asia and Europe were growing stronger and recovering from the economic turmoil of last year.
Imports rose almost 4 percent, to $103 billion in June, topping $100 billion for the first time. American exports, meanwhile, rose by less than 1 percent.
The trade report is the last significant economic report before Federal Reserve policy makers meet on Tuesday to debate whether short-term interest rates should be raised to slow the economy and prevent inflation from accelerating. While a widening trade gap can be a drag on economic growth, the surge in imports shows that consumers are continuing their spending spree, while saving so little, a significant concern of the Fed.
Many investors and Wall Street analysts expect the Fed to nudge its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a point, to 5.25 percent.
Cheaper imports have helped keep prices low and inflation in check, so far. But the dollar has been weaker of late, and many economists contend that the spending spree on imports may help drive up consumer prices. And sustained record deficits could cause the dollar's value to tumble further, making American stock and bond markets less attractive to foreign investors.
Indeed, the dollar extended a slide today after the release of the trade data. The dollar is now at a seven-month low compared with the yen. Treasury prices and stocks also fell yesterday.
"We now have as big of a deficit in one month as we once had in an entire year," said Clyde V. Prestowitz, the president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a research group in Washington.
The dollar often falls with a widening trade deficit because investors choose other markets when they see the deficit as a portent of possible problems.
The widening trade gap is also an economic measure that Republicans may seize upon in this campaign season as evidence that all is not well with the American economy. Sluggish exports are a sign that American manufacturing is weak. And many American laborers, like steelworkers and Midwestern farmers, consider the widening gap as a bad omen for their personal futures.
At a hearing on Capitol Hill, Catherine L. Mann, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said that though the deficit had not yet created a crisis, it was clear, from a long-term perspective, that "the United States is living beyond its means."
Ms. Mann told the members of the Trade Deficit Review Commission that the sustained rise in United States stock markets had caused investors to feel more confident about the future value of their wealth and, in turn, was prompting them to reduce the amount they save.
"Consumers are spending beyond their personal incomes," she said. "At some point in time, in my estimation roughly two years, the rest of the world will say, 'We're not so happy about lending to you anymore.' "
The bipartisan deficit review commission -- with members ranging from Carla A. Hills, who was chief trade negotiator under President George Bush, to George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers Union -- was created last year to study the causes and effects of the trade gap. The commission plans to report on its findings after holding hearings around the country.
According to the statistics released today, consumers snapped up more foreign automobiles, computer accessories and diamond gems.
The deficit with China widened at a time when the Chinese may soon try to resume talks with the Clinton Administration in their bid to join the World Trade Organization. The Administration has requested a study of how China's addition to the W.T.O. would affect the United States economy. The study is expected to be completed this month, but a spokeswoman at the Office of the United States Trade Representative said the report would most likely remain confidential.
The total trade deficit for the first six months of the year was $118 billion -- 57 percent higher than the cumulative gap for the first half of last year.
At the hearing in Washington today, Charles L. Schultze, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said the increasing deficits could eventually lower Americans' standard of living.
"It is not some catastrophe," Mr. Schultze said. "It will probably take care of itself, but in ways we don't like."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
An American In Paris

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Surely one of the oddest features of international affairs today is the fact that half the world thinks America wants to dominate everything and half the U.S. Congress doesn't even own a passport.
The gap between how foreigners see America and how America sees itself in the world could not be larger, particularly after Kosovo. China and Russia openly complain about America throwing its weight around. But there is plenty of resentment of U.S. "domination" among America's European allies as well. You can read it in the European press, or hear it in little digs like the one making the rounds over here that "the Chinese lost more people in the Kosovo war than the Americans did." 
 The gulf war showed the Euros how far ahead the U.S. military was in technological terms, and the Kosovo war showed how much wider that gap had become. This has left the Euros feeling victorious in Kosovo, yet diminished. As one British defense official remarked to me, "We have to avoid a situation where you Americans turn out the high-tech stuff and we provide the jolly good infantry."
It's no wonder the French have coined a new term to describe America today -- "the hyperpower." The term "superpower" was too small. It's also no wonder that right after NATO's Kosovo victory the European Union declared its intention to form its own military force capable of acting independently of the U.S.
This would be laughable if it were not so pathetic. The Euros will not catch America so easily. Consider just one reason: Devotees of Ronald Reagan like to credit him with the military buildup that enabled the U.S. to run so far ahead of all its allies and enemies. They are right about Mr. Reagan, but they are wrong about what he deserves credit for. The most important thing Mr. Reagan did was break the 1981 air traffic controllers' strike, which helped break the hold of organized labor over the U.S. economy.
That was critically important for spurring the information revolution in America. How so? Ask yourself this: Why is it that the Europeans have lots of money and the same access to technology as Americans do, yet most of them have been slow to absorb computers and info-technologies? Answer: U.S. companies are quick to absorb new, more productive technologies because they can easily absorb the cost of the new investment by laying off the workers who used to perform that task. And as the overall economy becomes more productive, those workers get rehired elsewhere.
The Europeans have moved slower because their rigid labor laws make it very hard, or very costly, to lay off workers. And if you have to pay for a new computer and the wages of an old worker, you are much less likely to buy the new computer. The world's eight largest high-tech companies are all U.S.-based.
The deregulation of the U.S. economy has fostered the quick adoption of new information technologies, and these new technologies have given the U.S. military its great technological leap forward -- from laser-guided weapons to stealth technology to electronic warfare. These systems are now essential for fighting wars that modern democracies will tolerate, which is to say high-tech, remote-control, low-casualty wars. Without the economic and technological underpinnings that make such weapons possible, the Euros will have a hard time catching Uncle Sam.
But just as the Euros need to understand their weakness, and how to manage it, America needs to understand its strength and how to manage it. The idea that the U.S. Congress, looking at a $1 trillion surplus, wants to cut its paltry foreign aid budget, refuses to pay its U.N. arrears, talks about free trade but then won't even expand Nafta to Chile, and treats foreign policy as a sport in which you pass sanctions against your favorite enemy, like a game of darts, should embarrass every American.
Congress is split between those who believe the U.S. should act everywhere alone and those who believe it should act nowhere. The idea of a generous America, leading where it must, sharing where it can and financing the development banks to give a hand up to those most in need, has a shrinking constituency.
It's crazy that at this moment the President has to spend his time abroad persuading foreigners that America is not a cheap imperialist, and his time at home persuading Congress that America still has a global role.

HEADLINE: Korean Famine Toll: More Than 2 Million

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 19

 BODY:
North Korea appears to be emerging from a prolonged severe famine with the help of international food aid, but four terrible years of hunger from 1995 through 1998 may have cost the country two million to three million lives, according to accumulating evidence gathered by a range of experts. Many of the dead were old people and children, or urban dwellers of any age with no way to forage off the land.
During that time, North Korea got nearly 3.5 million metric tons of food donations from abroad, mostly from China, Japan, South Korea and the United States. It still needs more. 
 "The food assistance is essential," said Catherine Bertini, executive director of the United Nations World Food Program, who has just returned from North Korea. "It is the only reason why there might be some stability now in the nutritional lives of many North Koreans.
"Two years ago we saw no food in the country at all," she said in an interview today. "There wasn't much food growing. There weren't small animals around. I remember distinctly not ever hearing a bird sing -- or seeing a bird. I can count on one hand how many oxen we saw.
"This time, there were quite a lot of oxen working in the fields or pulling carts," she said. "There were small herds of goats. We saw a lot of pigs, dogs and many small animals of all kinds. There seemed to be a stable food situation now. That does not mean that it's good. That doesn't mean that there is enough food in the country. And it doesn't mean that there aren't still children who are malnourished, because clearly there are."
Ms. Bertini said that North Korean officials now acknowledge that people are dying of starvation in significant numbers, although the figures they give are much lower than estimates by international aid experts. North Korea says that 220,000 people died in the four-year period. Outside the country, estimates range from 1.5 million to 3 million.
Andrew Natsios, a former vice president of the relief agency World Vision and the author of a new study of North Korea for the United States Institute of Peace, a Congressionally supported research organization in Washington, said Wednesday that the North Korean famine had become "one of the great famines of the 20th century."
"We now know that more than 10 percent of the population starved to death," said Mr. Natsios, who served as President George Bush's emergency aid coordinator in the Horn of Africa during food crises in Somalia and Ethiopia. He said the North Korean famine was comparable to the Chinese famine of 1958 and the famine in the 1930's in the Soviet Union. "I hope and pray," he said, "that this is the last of the great totalitarian famines whose roots lay in systemic dysfunction."
In his report, "The Politics of Famine in North Korea," Mr. Natsios said that confidence in the Government has been shaken. In an interview, he added that the country's belligerence could be an attempt to mask or deflect attention from its weakness and discord. Other experts see the North Korean missile threat as blackmail designed to get desperately needed hard currency from industrial nations in return for concessions.
The economy of isolationist North Korea, based on a bizarre self-reliant socialism known as juche, lost what shaky props it still had when the Soviet bloc disintegrated a decade ago. Its industries collapsed and its collective agricultural system was devastated when tools, fertilizer and seeds could no longer be bought and farmers started hoarding crops for their own use, sometimes in league with soldiers sent to guard the fields.
Then a series of natural disasters struck. In 1995, North Korea was driven to ask for international help for the first time. By then it was to late for many of its 24 million citizens.
Another recent study, by the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, found that between 1995 and 1997 infant mortality rates rose, family size fell and death rates across the board were at least seven times higher than those recorded by North Korea's 1993 census. The survey, published in the British medical journal The Lancet in July, was based on interviews with people who had fled North Korea for China.
Similar surveys based on varying samples have been made by the Korean Buddhist Sharing Movement, an independent South Korean organization, and by officials representing aid agencies. A former North Korean Government ideologue, Hwang Jong Yop, who defected to the south in 1997, wrote last year in a book, "North Korea: Truth Or Lies," that a high-ranking agriculture official told him that 500,000 people had starved to death in 1995, about 50,000 of them party cadres. The Government expected another 3 million deaths in the next two years if foreign aid was not sought, he said.
Although Ms. Bertini saw encouraging signs of recovery this year, North Korea will not be out of danger for a long time, she and other experts say. Typhoons are threatening crops again, and China has had a low harvest in corn, which is traded across the border unofficially by ethnic Koreans living on both sides. In the longer term, those who survived, weakened and malnourished, will find it hard to resist infections. Medicines are scarce to nonexistent and water supplies contaminated. Without a functioning economy, North Korea cannot engage in international trade or find the money to repair public utilities.
The famine, which reached its peak in late 1996 and 1997, led to acute malnutrition and loss of body mass, known as wasting, in more than 15 percent of children under 5 and stunted growth in 66 percent of that age group, according to a survey by the United Nations, the European Union and Save the Children/U.K. That study was done almost a year after the peak had passed, and many children were already dead.
Hunger also forced between 100,000 and 400,000 people to flee North Korea for China, although it is not known how many may have returned or been sent back. Official North Korean figures acknowledged about 200,000 refugees. Whatever the number, the Chinese were sufficiently concerned to begin detaining North Koreans and deporting them.
The gathering evidence of a major catastrophe has diminished disagreements about what actually happened in North Korea, Mr. Natsios said. Some relief officials were at first convinced that the famine alarm was exaggerated; others argued that it was a Government ploy to get food that would go to troops.
Mr. Natsios said that much of what was known before experts began analyzing data from refugees and others leaving the country was based on what aid workers were able to see on occasional visits to North Korea. "While these visits do provide some information," he said, "neither field visits nor the data provided by the North Korean Government about the food situation are conclusive evidence of anything, because they present conditions as the central authorities wish them to appear to the outside world."

HEADLINE: Chasing Only Bush, Forbes Presses Issues

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
In the days since the publisher Steve Forbes finished second in the Iowa straw poll, his aides have done plenty of crowing.
They have talked about a "two-man race" in the Republican Presidential primaries, reducing the eight contenders other than Mr. Forbes and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to starry-eyed asterisks. They have unequivocally designated Mr. Forbes as the only candidate with the organizational agility and economic stamina to keep pace with Mr. Bush. 
 But with the next competitive statewide contest more than four months away, Mr. Forbes faces serious tests, both political and financial, in his effort to maintain the claim that he is Mr. Bush's biggest threat.
Mr. Forbes's aides said this week that one way they would show that the Republican field had narrowed would be to draw pointed attention to contrasts between the positions of Mr. Forbes and Mr. Bush's on various issues. That approach has already prompted complaints from Mr. Bush's aides that Mr. Forbes is poised to take a negative tack and turn the race ugly.
Mr. Forbes's aides challenged that assessment.
"The only thing we'll focus on is an issues agenda," said William Dal Col, Mr. Forbes's campaign manager, "and the one who has to respond to it is the front-runner.
"He's the one who has to be overtaken. He can't keep running and hiding. Eventually, he has to address issues, and when he does, he's on our turf."
Mr. Forbes's aides would not say whether they intend to attack Mr. Bush explicitly in forthcoming advertisements.
But a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush said that Mr. Forbes seemed to be laying the groundwork for a repeat of his performance in 1996, when he unleashed withering television commercials against Bob Dole, the Republican front-runner and eventual nominee, that haunted Mr. Dole well into the general election.
"It appears that he's on the road to doing the same thing," the spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, said today.
Ms. Tucker said that Mr. Forbes's campaign had begun conducting a poll in Iowa this to week to see if voters would feel more negatively about Mr. Bush if they were given selective information about his record. She said they were told, for example, that he had advocated raising the sales tax in Texas but not that he had supported an overall tax cut.
Keith Appell, a spokesman for the Forbes campaign, said today that he would not discuss the specifics of any polls that the campaign was doing. In a sign of the intensifying friction between the two campaigns, Mr. Appell added that Mr. Bush's aides were overreacting and obviously running scared.
"They're trying to take the subject away from issues by accusing us of this, or accusing us of that," Mr. Appell said. "They're panicking a little bit because they're in trouble. Someone's come along and popped their little bubble."
That is one interpretation of Mr. Forbes's performance in Iowa, the true meaning of which has been dissected and debated more vigorously than the showing of any other candidate. Mr. Forbes won 20.8 percent of the vote, while Mr. Bush, the top finisher, won 31.3 percent. Elizabeth Dole came in third with 14.4 percent, while Gary L. Bauer came in fourth with 8.9 percent.
Aides to Mrs. Dole and Mr. Bauer and several political analysts said that Mr. Forbes's success primarily reflected his lavish spending to woo and entertain voters in a ritual that often rewards the candidates who are the most extravagant, solicitous hosts.
In national polls, Mr. Forbes continues to lag behind Mr. Bush, Senator John McCain of Arizona and Mrs. Dole. The latest survey of registered Republican voters in New Hampshire, a state with an early primary, shows Mr. Forbes near the bottom of the field, even though he has advertised extensively there.
The poll Aug. 15-17, by the American Research Group, which was released on Wednesday, interviewed 450 Republicans. Only 3 percent said they favored Mr. Forbes, putting him seventh place in a field of nine candidates. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.
"Nationally, there's no evidence that he's getting any traction," said Roger Stone, a Republican strategist. "I frankly don't know how much more this guy has got to spend before he figures out that money can't buy you love."
Mr. Forbes's aides, however, noted that Mr. Forbes's poll numbers in Iowa built steadily as he spent more time there and said that when voters in other states take as careful a look at the candidates as Iowans did, Mr. Forbes's support will grow in those places, too.
They also said that Mr. Forbes was committed to spending whatever it takes to remain competitive with Mr. Bush, who has raised more than $37 million so far. Mr. Forbes has raised more than $2.7 million, and has added more than $6.5 million of his own money to that sum.
But to keep pumping cash into his campaign, he may have to liquidate some assets, as he did in his 1996 bid for the Republican Presidential nomination. On the way to spending more than $35 million that time around, he had to sell some of his shares in Forbes Family Holdings Inc.
He estimated the amount of the company he currently owns to be worth more than $50 million, according to the financial disclosure form that he filed with the Federal Election Commission in May.
But because the company is privately held, his stake in it is less instantly converted into dollars for his campaign than are his publicly traded stocks, bonds and mutual funds, a portfolio that Mr. Forbes estimated to be worth $5.8 million to $14 million.
Mr. Dal Col declined to discuss the liquidity of Mr. Forbes's assets but said that Mr. Forbes would not come up short on money for the campaign. "He's got the personal resources," Mr. Dal Col said.
Mr. Forbes seems at least as determined as he was in 1996, and possibly more so. Then, he came across as the champion of a single issue: his proposal for a flat tax. Now, he speaks just as loudly about conservative religious themes, like opposition to legal abortion, that seem to depart from past statements that the Christian Coalition did not speak for most Christians and that Pat Robertson was "a toothy flake."
Brian Kennedy, a strategist for former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who dropped out of the race this week, said of Mr. Forbes: "He's a better candidate than he was in 1996. His agenda is much broader. His presentation is more polished."
But Mr. Kennedy added that Mr. Forbes "has a tendency to go a step too far," adding: "You saw that in 1996, with his negative advertising campaign. It ultimately sunk his candidacy."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Share Prices Move Lower On News of Trade Deficit

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
A report that the nation's trade deficit had unexpectedly worsened sent stocks into a skid yesterday and, despite a partial recovery, prices closed lower for the second consecutive session.
The market has been under pressure recently from various signs of economic recovery in Japan and Europe, where currencies tend to strengthen against the dollar as investors buy relatively more appealing foreign shares. The Commerce Department's report yesterday that the country's trade deficit had risen $3.4 billion, instead of experiencing a small decline, pushed the dollar down further. 
 That in turn set off speculation about how Federal Reserve policy makers would view this trend, a fresh source of upward pressure on prices, at their meeting on Tuesday.
"The global economy is recovering," said Lorraine Wang, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "Where we're concerned is the U.S. dollar, which is bad for inflation." The Fed is widely expected to increase the overnight lending rate a quarter-percentage point next week, and Ms. Wang predicted that the rise would not be its last.
Other analysts disagreed, but investors found little reason to buy yesterday, especially ahead of today's expiration of stock options and index options; these expirations often lead to big price swings.
With most Internet and other high-tech issues in retreat, the Nasdaq market slumped 36.30 points, or 1.37 percent, to 2,621.43, the biggest loss among the main gauges.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which was down by as much as 118 points in the morning, ended with a loss of 27.54 points, or three-tenths of a percent, to 10,963.84. Eighteen of its 30 component issues fell, though none by more than Alcoa's decline of 1 11/16 a share, to 65 3/16.
Reynolds Metals, which accepted an improved takeover offer from Alcoa, fell 2 11/16, to 65 9/16.
"The market's expensive," said Neil T. Eigen, a managing director at J. & W. Seligman. "It's very difficult to make the case that stocks go a lot higher."
Some bank stocks stood out among the day's big losers, with Chase Manhattan down 2 9/16 a share, to 82 7/16, after being downgraded by one analyst. Shares of Bank of New York fell 1 5/8, to 37, after a report that Russian criminals may have used it to launder money, and Citigroup fell 1 5/32, to 45 5/8.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 9.25 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,323.59; 277 of its components fell while 202 rose and 21 were unchanged.
Microsoft accounted for the most damage, slipping 1 3/16 a share, to 83 13/16, while Royal Dutch/Shell Group, up 1 1/16, to 64 11/16, offered the biggest lift.
One of the more optimistic strategists was James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management. He said that the economy was clearly slowing down and that interest rates were likely to ease soon, clearing the way for a resumption of the bull market.
"I think stocks will probably take off again and go on to new highs," he predicted.
At least two companies made successful market debuts. Wink Communications, which is engaged in interactive television, sold 4.75 million shares at 16, and they closed at 35 11/16. The Netro Corporation, which provides broadband wireless access, sold 5 million shares at 8, and they nearly tripled, closing at 23 1/2 on turnover of 18.8 million shares.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a moderate 684.3 million. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by 1,643 to 1,382.
Stocks fell in major European markets yesterday but gained in Brazil and rose more than 3 percent in Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: TENS OF THOUSANDS CALL ON MILOSEVIC TO GIVE UP POWER

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of people gathered on a hot night in front of the Federal Parliament to demand the resignation of President Slobodan Milosevic, but they heard an extremely mixed set of messages from rival leaders of the democratic opposition here on how to get the job done.
A crowd of at least 50,000 people -- some estimates exceeded 100,000 -- represented the largest anti-Milosevic rally since NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, which forced Belgrade's troops out of Kosovo. 
 But the opposition's rivalries and clashing strategies were also on display, with the drama of the night being the effort of Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, the largest party in the opposition, to hijack a rally he had sworn he would not attend.
In a clumsy bit of political fakery booed by many in the crowd, Mr. Draskovic, who had withdrawn his name from the list of speakers, essentially crashed the rally, coming on stage surrounded by bodyguards, in response, he said, to the demands of his supporters in the crowd. His ploy was an almost exact re-creation of a sudden appearance by Mr. Milosevic at a rally on the same spot 10 years ago.
While Mr. Draskovic was almost forced by the size of the turnout to attend, he also criticized many of the ideas of other opposition leaders, saying that early elections under fair conditions were the only sensible way to change Serbia and finally oust Mr. Milosevic.
Mr. Draskovic commands more voters than any other opposition politician, up to 18 percent of the vote in recent polls, more than those who favor the parties of Mr. Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic, combined.
Opposition politicians had been wary of calling a rally in sophisticated Belgrade, where huge street protests against Mr. Milosevic in 1996 and 1997 failed to bring him down. But the numbers tonight were enough to give the opposition a lift, despite its divisions, showing the disgust of many people at their current isolation and poverty.
But the people are also disillusioned by the divisions among opposition leaders, they said, and those were on clear display.
The organizers of the rally -- the Serbian Orthodox Church and Group 17, a confederation of economists and professionals -- are calling for Mr. Milosevic to resign and appoint a transitional Government of experts to serve for a year and then organize new elections.
The leader of the Democratic Party, Zoran Djindjic, Mr. Draskovic's prime rival, called for Mr. Milosevic and the Government to resign within 15 days or face mass protests.
"If they are still there after 15 days then Serbia will go out into the streets, not only in Belgrade, but in all towns, in 50 towns on the same day," Mr. Djindjic said. "Everybody will go out into the streets with one single message -- we will stay here until you go. It's either Milosevic or Serbia, there can be no third solution. This time we will go to the end."
But Mr. Draskovic heaped scorn on the idea of a transitional government of experts -- "of people no one had heard of a week ago" -- and said that it was clear now that Mr. Milosevic would never agree to it. Mr. Draskovic also scoffed at the idea of a new Government formed in the streets, through civil unrest, saying: "It's dust in the eyes of the people."
Mr. Draskovic called for early elections in November, as Mr. Milosevic's spokesmen are themselves suggesting, in their own effort to divide the opposition, but then urged street pressure to insure early elections if Mr. Milosevic does not grant them. And he called on "all responsible leaders of the opposition" to support his ideas.
One speaker for the Alliance for Change called for a new demonstration in Belgrade on Aug. 28, while another, for the Group 17, called for a new demonstration here on Sept. 21.
Leaving the rally, Zoran Stankovic said: "The only real message is change. It's time for this Government to go." But he said Mr. Milosevic could only benefit "when the opposition leaders speak in so many voices."
One important political leader of the Alliance for Change coalition, Nenad Canak, leader of the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, said in an interview: "The rally was fine concerning the number of people and their energy. But it was not O.K. in terms of the absence of vision, of how to focus this energy in a serious way."
As the rally gathered, Government officials continued to float the idea of early Serbian elections, perhaps as early as the first week of November, creating further divisions among the opposition.
The Alliance for Change is not ready for elections and not especially eager for them, so the Government would be calling their bluff. Mr. Draskovic, however, favors early elections to capitalize on better polling numbers.
But new elections would not affect the position of Mr. Milosevic, whose single, four-year term as Yugoslav President runs through July 2001. While the opposition is calling for his resignation or removal, early elections may divert the population from that goal.
Normally elections for the Serbian parliament and municipalities would take place in 2001, while federal parliamentary elections would take place in 2000.
It would be difficult for the self-styled "democratic opposition" to oppose new elections, though its leaders would like any vote to be supervised by outside observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and would also like to see freer, more open news media, especially television.
"Elections are the best way to sober political drunks," Mr. Milosevic's party spokesman, Ivica Dacic, said today. "Our stand is that there are many more important things than elections. But if the other political parties say elections are necessary we are ready to go to elections. But they want to come to power without elections."
Vojislav Seselj, leader of the ultranationalist Radical Party that now helps rule both Serbia and Yugoslavia, said separately today that he favored early elections to resolve Serbia's post-Kosovo troubles. He said there was no agreement with other ruling parties to call them but there was a deal to hold them if the opposition wanted them.
"We are even going so far as to say, 'Let the opposition parties name a date for the elections and we will call them,' " he said. Mr. Seselj then, impishly, suggested that local elections come first -- since the opposition has its only power base in cities across Serbia won in local elections in 1996.
They took their seats only after street protests against election fraud forced Mr. Milosevic to back down -- while saving his own seat, of course.
Mr. Draskovic's power base is the city of Belgrade, with its powerful television station, Studio B. His rivals believe that he would do almost anything to retain the station.
So to divide the opposition further, Government officials leaked a story that Mr. Draskovic had met Mr. Milosevic secretly on Monday to discuss early elections and to agree not to speak at the rally. Mr. Draskovic angrily denied the entire story, as did his top aides, one of whom said "it would be idiotic" to have had such a meeting.
Draskovic aides suggested that the leak was from Mr. Djindjic. Whatever the truth, the leak succeeded in further poisoning the relationship, if that were possible, between Mr. Draskovic and Mr. Djindjic.
"Milosevic is a master political tactician," said one senior Alliance official sadly. "He's great at changing the subject and buying time."
Even so, early elections are a serious risk for Mr. Milosevic. The Government, whose support is weak after the loss of Kosovo, could lose its majority in the Serbian parliament if the opposition could ever mount a united, professional campaign. And there is reliably said to be a debate inside the Government about the wisdom of early elections.
Some senior Government officials expressed confidence privately today that they would win a majority or could create one, despite all their problems, while some senior opposition officials also believe, with despair, that Mr. Milosevic, his wife and Mr. Seselj could retain power in a coalition.
Waiting longer, until winter bites hard and the country is inevitably short of heat and electricity due to inefficiency, sanctions and NATO air strikes, could only harm the Government's standing.
The Government had made various efforts, both subtle and crude, to cut down the size of the rally. On Wednesday night, state television announced the arrest of a Montenegrin man possessing "a highly explosive device" with a timer and warned of other possible bombing attacks at "massive public gatherings," urging caution on citizens and on parents.
The Government ordered the payment of overdue pensions for today and moved the televising of a popular lottery program from Saturday night to tonight.
But the police did not interfere with what was a peaceful rally and were not much in evidence, though riot police were stationed in buildings should they have been needed.

Moral Crisis: Yale Club Goes Casual on Fridays

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
At the Yale Club in Manhattan, in the once-exclusive domain of the jacket and necktie, there are now short-sleeve tattersalls. There are tieless button-downs. There are yellow polo shirts. There are Top-Siders, not to mention Nike Airs. Khakis have been observed in the exclusive Roof Dining Room. There are jeans.
And last Friday, egad, there was a purple Izod.
As if that were not enough, one woman actually won admission to the once-sacrosanct Tap Room in jeans, sandals and a white T-shirt. "I suppose T-shirts are O.K. now, as long as they aren't wet," said David Weild 3d, Yale '52, dressed in a dark blue suit and observing this spectacle with some amusement. 
 In case all these pret-a-porter ensembles have not given it away: the Yale Club has gone casual on Fridays, the first of Manhattan's exclusive Ivy League bastions to do so. No jacket. No tie. Its 21-member board, which unveiled the new dress code last month, did so because it does not want the club to become a, well, secret society.
"We need to engage the interest of more and more younger members, professional people who are not just lawyers and accountants but also architects and people who work on the Web," said William D. Weber, Yale '60, a business consultant in Ridgefield, Conn., who is the club's president. "We lose business when such people feel inhibited about coming to our club."
Mr. Weber declined to disclose the revenues of the privately held club, which has occupied the neoclassical limestone and brick building at 50 Vanderbilt Avenue, between East 44th and East 45th Streets, since 1915.
But do not imagine for one second that such goings-on have been unnoticed over at the Harvard Club on West 44th Street, where jacket-and-tie formality is still de rigueur in the main dining room.
"Even in the late 1990's there should be a few havens for proper attire and decorum," said John D. Sicher, a member of the Harvard Club for 32 years. "I wouldn't expect the rowdies from New Haven to understand."
Apparently, he isn't alone in his sentiment. In the midtown Ivy enclave to the west of Grand Central Station, where the clubs huddle in splendid mutuality, the non-Yale Ivies are making their last stand for manners.
Still holding the line along with Harvard is the Princeton Club on West 43d Street, which requires jacket and tie in its Woodrow Wilson dining room. United in solidarity are alumni of Columbia University, who are compelled to be united, sharing the Princeton Club as they do.
Also fighting the casual tide are the stalwarts of the University of Pennsylvania Club on West 44th Street (the library is off-limits to the tieless and jacketless) and the University Club on East 54th Street, where formality is required at all times, according to the staff. A spokeswoman not only declined to give her name or discuss the dress code, but also lectured a reporter that he was forbidden to print the very name of the club in a newspaper.
Wavering at the balance of modernity is the 6,850-member Cornell Club-New York on East 44th Street. A jacket -- but not a tie -- is required on Fridays in the formal dining room on the second floor. Acquiescing to this equivocation are some 70 members of the Brown University Club, who share the Cornell clubhouse.
But dragged right into the whole dress-down-Friday boola-boola has been the Dartmouth Club of New York, which has shared the Yale clubhouse since 1974. "We take the lead from them," said Barry Weeks, the club's executive director.
For the moment, those subversives at the Yale Club are observing at least some restraint. The casual-Friday rule is in effect only from Memorial Day to Labor Day. And not just any old "business casual" ukase will do. "T-shirts, cutoffs, torn jeans, shorts and provocative or revealing clothing are not permitted," Mr. Weber has informed the membership. The rules apply to both men and women.
(As for the woman in the white T-shirt, members speculated that she had come from the 140-bedroom members' residences upstairs, where no dress code is enforced and where members pay $105 to $215 a night.)
Mr. Weber contended that the club is "solvent," adding that a booming economy meant that "these are happy times at the Yale Club" for its 9,500 members. They pay a yearly maximum dues of $1,124 plus tax; members for less than eight years (and those who are suburbanites or out-of-towners) pay less.
And he said there had been "an unusually high level of response" to the dress-code revision. Do members feel, taking their cue from the legendary New Haven song lyrics, that the gentlemen songsters are off on a spree? Will they be damned from here to eternity?
Most of the reaction "has been positive," Mr. Weber said, "and there have been no resignations over this as far as I know."
Public recrimination would be unseemly for an institution where the entranceway letters spelling out the words Yale Club are but 1 3/8 inches high. But some diehard Bulldogs feel strongly that "the club made an error," said A. Peter Barbaresi, Class of '45, a 77-year-old real estate and construction lawyer in Rye, N.Y. "There are certain manners that should prevail in a club. I am sorry to see good taste go out the door."
Dress-down Friday "doesn't shock me," Mr. Barbaresi added, "but it disappoints me. Americans in general are not at their best when they are casually dressed. So much is failing us. Even our language is gone."
The younger generation, however, is "very much in favor of it," said Jeff Manning, Yale '81, a 40-year-old Manhattan investment banker. The casual-Friday ruling is a reflection of the fact that "the club has gotten younger," he said, adding that "the younger members are beginning to move into positions of responsibility."
Then there are the Old Blue cynosures for whom the club's dress code is not an issue. William F. Buckley Jr., class of '50, author of the 1951 polemic "God and Man at Yale," said he "never uses the Yale Club in New York."
To Mr. Buckley's son, Christopher, the dress-down change is "probably overdue," he said. "I use the Yale Club one-tenth as much as I used to because, being a member of the slobbo journalistic community, I frequently venture out without a tie, and sometimes even in jeans." He edits Forbes FYI, a Forbes magazine supplement.
Then again, the younger Mr. Buckley, class of '75, added that he "read that notice they sent out with a certain wistful, 'Well, there goes the neighborhood, why in my day we dressed in white tie to play squash.' "
He concluded: "This is what happens when you let in people from Dartmouth."
At all of the clubs these days, it is still possible to see traditionally attired older parties who appear to have fled a New Yorker cartoon. But their numbers are dwindling, and the university clubs haven't been impervious to the fashion Zeitgeist of the boomer-and-unders.
Most of the clubs have gone casual on weekends -- save at formal brunches and events. After Labor Day, the Yale Club will still permit informality in its Grill restaurant. Even Harvard has tried to get with the program, permitting "neat casual attire," its managers say, in the main bar and its Grill Room.
"Everyone recognizes this as a general trend," said Susan A. Morison, marketing director of the Cornell Club-New York, referring to the jacketless, tieless condition. "We have seen the shift in volume from the more formal area to our less formal area," she said of dining-room revenues.
Change has always come to the Yale Club gradually but relentlessly. Gone are the days when women were shunted off to the side of the lobby and rapidly elevatored to the purdah of the former Ladies' Dining Room on the 22d floor, now the Roof Dining Room. The club went co-ed shortly after Yale admitted women in 1969.
Last Friday the club declined to admit a nonmember New York Times reporter officially, but he attended as a guest of a member. Visible everywhere were the signs of rampant casualness. The formerly sacrosanct Roof Dining Room, stripped of diners by Loire Valley sojourns and Connecticut weekend getaways, held but 25 diners, 18 of them men, of whom 9 wore suit and tie.
Downstairs, in the confines of the medieval-ish Tap Room, with its beamed ceiling and leaded glass doors, only 11 of 30 men were wearing blazers or suits; 9 had ties. Many of the 15 women present were dressed more formally than the men. And all present were dining from a decidedly de-curmudgeonated menu: while the Yale Club bean soup was still available, members could also fling tradition to the winds and order a New England Seafood Wrap.
In the end, perhaps, the question is not whether casual Friday is bigger than the Yale-Harvard game, but: would the namesake donor Elihu Yale approve? "The portraits show Eli as a bewigged, fashionable 18th-century London merchant," Mr. Weild said. "He might be surprised."
Perhaps only the Whiffs -- Yale's Whiffenpoof a capella singing group -- could sum it all up: Baa, baa, baa.

HEADLINE: Democrats Again Face Voter Doubts Over Party's Values

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Every few months, small groups of local Democratic officials journey to special seminars to learn how to combat a party vulnerability: doubts among voters that the Democrats embrace mainstream family values.
Under the auspices of the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist party group, Anita F. Gottlieb, a consultant, takes the Democrats through a mental exercise designed to stop them from speaking in the numbing jargon of program names and acronyms and instead to explain policy goals with value-laden statements about social ills and about right and wrong. 
 Ms. Gottlieb tells them to visualize a "values tree." The roots are their values. The trunk is policy goals and the branches are programs. With the tree in mind to reinforce the idea that policy goals should grow from values, they write speeches to explain the ideas of their programs.
That the council feels the need to run such workshops says something about a persistent difficulty facing Democrats as they head into the next elections. Political strategists say the public once again sees the Republicans as the party of values, considering them more trustworthy on a range of moral and ethical matters like honesty, belief in God, belief in personal responsibility and knowing right from wrong.
For the Democrats, this turn of events could not be more frustrating. In his re-election campaign, President Clinton neutralized the long-standing Republican strength on moral issues like religion and violence in movies and on television by putting together a set of policies that added up to a secular family values agenda for his party.
Now, polls show that the Democrats' traditional weakness in this area has returned. And strategists say that just as many Republicans had predicted months ago, some of the party's problems stem from the public backlash against President Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky matter, particularly among the elderly.
"There's a perception problem here that the Democrats have, I think, on moral questions," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut.
"I think certainly a lot of it has to do with the last year and a half and you cannot discount that," Mr. Dodd said, referring to Mr. Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky and his impeachment.
The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found in a July poll that a greater number of people -- 44 percent -- now think that the House did the right thing in impeaching Mr. Clinton. That figure was 35 percent last December at the height of the battle.
Those figures, coming six months after the Senate trial ended with Mr. Clinton's acquittal, cannot be reassuring to Democrats. At the same time, Presidential preference polls show that Vice President Al Gore is consistently running 15 percentage points or more behind Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
To be sure, Democrats go into 2000 with advantages. Congressional Democrats have a decided edge onissues like Medicare, health care and education. And the Republican cry for deep tax cuts has not caught on with the public, according to recent polls. Many public opinion surveys show that the two parties are about even when voters are asked whether they prefer the Republicans or the Democrats running Congress.
But the Democrats' disadvantage on values could become magnified, depending on the mood of the voters, who, because of the good economy, have turned their attention elsewhere. At times this year, most particularly after the air strikes against Serbia and the shootings in Littleton, Colo., anxiety over the nation's moral compass has surged as a voter concern.
"I find as I go around Connecticut the public is really more concerned about the moral future of the country than the economic future," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat. "I think we have to speak to that."
 A June poll of 1,002 people, taken by a bipartisan team of Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, and Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, showed the Democrats' weakness and their areas of opportunity.
Asked which party in Congress better represented the values of personal responsibility, voters chose Republicans by 44 percent to 22 percent. On ethics and honesty, they favored Republicans over Democrats by 39 percent to 20 percent. On faith in God, they picked the Republicans by 40 percent to 18 percent. And on knowing right from wrong, they favored Republicans over Democrats by 35 percent to 18 percent.
Only when asked which party better represented the value of community did those surveyed select the Democrats, 39 percent to 33 percent.
The poll's margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Political strategists differ on how much to attribute these findings to disillusionment with Mr. Clinton. They also cite factors like public concern with the war in Kosovo, the Republicans' greater comfort with emphasizing God and religion, and lingering public doubts dating from the 1960's over whether the Democrats embrace mainstream values.
Changing a long-standing image of a party takes time, Ed Kilgore, the policy director at the Democratic Leadership Council, said, adding, "I think you have to reprove yourself for two to three administrations before you fundamentally change the perception of the party."
Of the council's seminars held this year in Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Utah and Wisconsin, Mr. Kilgore said: "It's a revolutionary exercise for a lot of Democrats. It's important to make it clear that your policy positions reflect values the public shares and that you are not proposing programs as an end in itself."
The Democrats are heading into the elections with strengths on an array of issues not explicitly related to values. Asked in the June poll which party in Congress would do a better job of improving the health care system, voters selected Democrats over Republicans 53 percent to 24 percent. On which party would better improve education, the Democrats won 46 percent to 31 percent. On which would strengthen Social Security, the Democrats led Republicans 49 percent to 28 percent.
The Democrats have been working on several fronts to respond to the public doubts. Mr. Gore, most notably, has been making a sustained effort to focus on values and define his own character.
He sounds remarkably like Mr. Bush when he declares that America should be judged "not merely by the value of our possessions but the values we possess." Even before Mr. Bush called for more reliance on churches and religious organizations, the Vice President said these groups should be eligible to receive Federal money to help the needy.
And in June he called Mr. Clinton's extramarital affair "inexcusable," adding that "particularly as a father I felt that it was terribly wrong."
Congressional Democrats have aggressively sought to turn the policy agenda to issues on which they believe they have the upper hand. They have pushed Republicans into high-profile legislative battles over gun control and regulation of managed health care. And in his opposition to the Republicans' $792 billion tax cut, Mr. Clinton has led the Democrats in portraying the proposal as an obstacle to reshaping the Medicare system and creating a new prescription drug benefit.
"There are two challenges," said Ms. Lake, who does polling for the Gore campaign on women's issues. "One is to talk about the issues in values-oriented terms, and two, to move the agenda from values to these other issues because we are only going to have so much credibility on values."
The exercise run by the Democratic Leadership Council is just one way that Democrats are trying to teach elected officials to show that programs like their education proposals reflect their party's values.
Republicans, for their part, say they have to be cautious in capitalizing on the Democrats' vulnerability, so that their efforts do not backfire as they have before. Campaign commercials that House Republicans ran last year alluding to the Clinton scandal were widely judged to have backfired, helping cost the Republicans five House seats. And much of the party establishment has been struggling to get safely beyond Pat Buchanan's fiery but divisive 1992 convention speech declaring a cultural war.
"Republicans have to be extremely careful," Mr. Goeas said. "Very often when they see declining moral values they get put in a box on abortion or gay rights. But when people talk values they really talk as much about civility in society and virtue in society."
Some Republican Presidential contenders like Mr. Buchanan or Gary L. Bauer or Alan Keyes, who are vying for the allegiance of the party's social conservatives, still determinedly take stands against abortion or else make a rejection of homosexuality a plank of their campaigns.
But others like Mr. Bush, Elizabeth Dole and Senator John McCain make a more broad-brushed appeal to those concerned with the nation's direction. They do not mention impeachment, but their allusions to it are clear. Mr. Bush talks of showing that "politics, after a time of tarnished ideals, can be higher and better." Mrs. Dole says, "We've been let down -- and by people we should have been able to look up to." And Mr. McCain says that to fight cynicism among young people "we must first challenge ourselves to give them an example worth emulating."
In Congress, the Republican goal is to let the eventual Presidential nominee set the party's themes and do nothing to allow Democrats to change the focus.
"The challenge for Republicans in Congress," said Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster, "is not to do anything that upsets the advantage we have on morals, integrity and ethics."
House Republicans have passed a number of measures highlighting their conservative cultural stands. They have approved a constitutional amendment against flag-burning, taken a stand to allow the Ten Commandments to be posted in schools, passed a measure prohibiting state and local governments from placing a "substantial burden" on a person's exercise of religion, and approved a bill to make it a Federal crime for an adult to take a minor across state lines for an abortion in order to circumvent a parental-notification law in the girl's home state.
Few, if any, of these measures will become law. And strategists said they were likely to become campaign issues only on a district-by-district basis, primarily in conservative areas of the South. "Clearly values is a major problem for the Democrats," said one House Republican strategist. "But because it's a major problem for Democrats, that doesn't mean you launch an expensive national campaign on this one issue."

HEADLINE: Report Says Labor Market Tight

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
The number of workers filing for state unemployment benefits rose last week, while the less-volatile four-week average declined to its lowest level in more than a quarter-century, suggesting the pool of available employees remains relatively small.
First-time jobless claims increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 287,000 for the week ended Aug. 14, the Labor Department said. Last week was the fourth straight week that first-time jobless claims were below 300,000. 
 The four-week average of claims dropped to 281,250 from 288,250 the previous week. That is the smallest number of claims since the week ended Dec. 22, 1973, when the four-week average was 280,000.
"There's very little evidence that shows conditions are easing in the labor market," said Vincent Boberski of Dain Rauscher in Chicago. "This is just going to be more justification for the Federal Reserve" to raise interest rates a quarter-point either in August or October.
Usually, when job markets are tight, companies increase wages to attract workers. That increase is typically passed on to consumers as higher prices, leading to inflation.
That has not happened yet, but it is a cause of concern for the Fed's policy-making Open Markets Committee, which meets next week to consider an interest rate increase.
The figures show "the economy is still very strong and that most firms are more focused on attracting and retaining workers than reducing staff," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Bank of America Private Bank in Jacksonville, Fla.

HEADLINE: Richard W. Jennings, a Titan Of Securities Law, Dies at 91

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Richard W. Jennings, who helped popularize the study of securities law in United States law schools and helped export concepts of market regulation to the postwar societies of Japan and Germany, died at his home in Piedmont, Calif., on Aug. 9 after a brief illness. He was 91.
At his death, he was a professor emeritus of Boalt Hall, the law school at the University of California at Berkeley. He received his law degree there in 1939, joined the faculty in 1947 and continued to teach there well after his retirement in 1975. 
Beyond the students who studied directly with Professor Jennings over the years, countless others encountered his passion for securities law by using the pioneering casebook that he wrote with Harold Marsh Jr., who taught at the University of California at Los Angeles.
A casebook is a collection of statutes, state and Federal court decisions and administrative and regulatory rules, the essential elements of any study of a particular field of law. His securities law casebook -- officially called "Securities Regulation: Cases and Materials" but known to students simply as "Jennings and Marsh" -- was first published in 1961 and is now in its eighth edition.
The fledgling field of securities law had been brought into focus a decade earlier, in 1951, by the publication of the first securities law textbook, by Louis Loss, a professor at Harvard. But it was the Jennings and Marsh casebook that allowed securities law to become a standard element of legal education.
"It was one of the most influential casebooks of all time," said Joel Seligman, dean of the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis. "After four decades, it remains the leading casebook in the field." Mr. Seligman wrote the recent editions of the study guide along with John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia University.
Richard Wormington Jennings was born on Oct. 19, 1907, the son of a banker in Bois D'Arc, Mo. A 1927 graduate of Park College in Parkville, Mo., he briefly taught high school algebra before beginning graduate studies in political science at the University of Pennsylvania. But by 1937, his imagination had been caught by the marked changes in business law that were ushered in with the New Deal and he enrolled at the Berkeley law school in 1937.
After a period of private practice and government service during World War II, he joined the law school faculty. He and his longtime co-author, Mr. Marsh, were described by friends and colleagues as "The Odd Couple." In contrast to Mr. Marsh's tough, blunt-spoken demeanor, Professor Jennings was "sweetness and light," said Richard Buxbaum, a law professor at Berkeley. As each wrote half of the casebook, "the personality of the early editions was utterly schizophrenic."
Professor Jennings's influence on securities regulation extended well beyond the classroom. In the early 1960's, William L. Cary, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission under President John F. Kennedy, recruited him as a consultant to the commission's first full-scale investigation of the securities markets in 25 years. Through his work on the study and his testimony at various Congressional hearings, he contributed to the public debate that led in 1975 to the elimination of fixed brokerage commissions on Wall Street. That change led to the collapse of many securities firms and radically altered the competitive forces in the securities industry.
"There was a time, from the 1950's through the 1970's, when there were three people who towered over the field of securities law," Mr. Seligman said. "They were Louis Loss, Bill Cary and Dick Jennings."
Professor Jennings was invited in 1961 to serve as a Fulbright professor at Tokyo University and helped introduce modern securities regulation theory to the Japanese academic community. He was also a mentor, along with Professor Loss, to an influential group of young law professors in Germany in the mid-1950's who helped add securities regulation to the academic agenda there as Germany developed into an economic power.
Indeed, it was as a mentor to young lawyers that he is most fondly remembered among his students, said Lawrence Sonsini, a partner in Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif., who was his research assistant in the mid-1960's and later took over some of Professor Jennings's classes.
"He was the one who encouraged me to develop a securities law practice at the firm when this was just beginning to be called Silicon Valley," Mr. Sonsini said. "He had a vision of what it could be.
Professor Jennings, formal and gracious, was one of the last law professors at Berkeley to abandon jacket and tie for "business casual." But other trappings of legal power did not impress him. "We shared the same office for 13 years -- books, a steel desk, some pictures -- and I don't think it had changed since he first moved in," Mr. Sonsini said.
On campus, he is best known beyond the law school for his service as chairman of the faculty senate at the height of the Free Speech Movement in the mid-1960's, a cultural collision between campus liberals and the conservative establishment in Sacramento that developed against the backdrop of the Vietnam War.
Herma Hill Kay, dean of the law school, said that his patient but authoritative leadership of a sharply divided faculty was a calming influence during those turbulent years.
In 1987, law school alumni expressed their affection for Professor Jennings and two colleagues -- Stefan A. Riesenfeld, who died earlier this year, and Adrian A. Kragen -- by raising an endowment for three faculty positions to be named in their honor.
Professor Jennings is survived by his wife of 64 years, Elizabeth Robison Jennings, of Piedmont; two daughters, Susan J. Stangeland and M. Anne Jennings, both of Berkeley; a son, W. Thomas Jennings of Sacramento; four grandchildren, and a great-grandson.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Dollar's Drop Against Yen Renews Focus On U.S. Policy

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
An apparent shift in Japanese policy and the report of a record United States trade deficit helped send the dollar lower yesterday against the Japanese yen and the new European currency, the euro.
But the dollar, despite its recent 4 percent plunge against the yen, remains healthy against the world's other major currencies. Against the euro, which was predicted by many analysts to rally after its January debut, the dollar is still up almost 10 percent this year. The dollar also rose yesterday against the currencies of two of the United States' major trading partners, Canada and Mexico. Adjusted for trade patterns, the dollar is just above its 20-year average value against all its trading partners, according to Chase Manhattan Bank. 
 "So far, there has not been across-the-board selling against the the dollar," said Paul Podolosky, a currency strategist at BankBoston.
Still, some analysts are worried that the growing American trade deficit could be a problem for the dollar in the future, as it was in the late 1980's. In addition, if the American economy begins to slow down as the rest of the world is reviving, that could put more downward pressure on the dollar as investors leave the American markets and the dollar to invest in markets that appear to have more potential for growth.
In these circumstances, however, a falling dollar would not necessarily be a problem for the United States, analysts said, as long as the decline was orderly and not extreme.
In late trading yesterday, it cost $1.06300 to buy one euro compared with $1.05230 Wednesday, a 1 percent fall in the dollar's value. Against the Japanese yen, the move was smaller because much bigger declines came earlier in the week. Yesterday, the dollar slipped to 111.40 yen against the dollar, down from 112.03 Wednesday. The dollar fell 1.8 percent against the yen on Wednesday.
It has been the selloff of the dollar against the Japanese yen that has refocused attention on the dollar and, at the same time, American policy toward it. During this slide against the yen, some analysts have begun to raise questions about Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers's commitment to the strong-dollar policy of his predecessor, Robert E. Rubin. Although Mr. Summers has supported the policy in public statements, doubts about his commitment -- even if mistaken -- have undermined the dollar a little, analysts said.
The dollar selloff and yen rally began in early July when the dollar was worth about 122 yen. Since then, the value of the dollar against the yen has declined more than 9 percent. The driving force has been the move by big institutional investors back into the Japanese stock market, which has soared this year. That move was prompted by the expectation -- based so far on just one quarter's economic data -- that the Japanese economy is turning around.
The accelerated move this week was set off by comments from Japanese officials that analysts have interpreted to indicate that the Government is not ready to intervene in the currency markets to support the yen. That is a switch from a policy of aggressive intervention to weaken the yen earlier this summer. In June and July, the Japanese sold yen for dollars six times in an effort to keep the value of the yen from rising.
The Japanese Government, through the Bank of Japan, had intervened because of the fear that the rapidly appreciating yen -- as the dollar declines -- would undermine the economy. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive and less competitive. And a slump in exports could derail what is, at best, a struggling economic recovery.
"I don't think intervention is imminent," said Karen E. Parker, director of currency research at Chase Manhattan Bank. Until this week, many traders expected intervention at the 110-yen level.
One of the reasons for the switch, Ms. Parker said, is the realization by the Japanese that intervention, without the participation of the United States, is not working. In addition, Japanese officials are hoping that their economy is on the rebound, which would make the rebound in the yen less worrisome.
With the apparent change in policy, Ms. Parker said she thought the yen could move to a value of 105 to 108 to the dollar. At that point, she said, intervention would be more likely.
The rally in the euro yesterday was started by a report that the German business confidence index, compiled by the Ifo economic research institute in Munich, rose to 93.6 in July from 92.9 in June, the third consecutive monthly gain. A strong increase in the confidence report in July helped set off the rally in the euro at the end of last month. At that point, the euro, the new currency of 11 European countries, was down 13 percent for the year. Since then, it has risen almost 5 percent.
Later yesterday, the United States Commerce Department announced that the trade deficit jumped to $24.6 billion in June, a record.
The trade deficit has not been a problem for the dollar or the American economy so far. In fact, as the deficit was increasing over the last year, the dollar was strengthening.
Ms. Parker said the deficit could be more of a drag on the dollar now, given the changing circumstances of the world economy. Last year, when Asian economies were in recession and Europe was sluggish, it was easy to attract foreign investment here to cover the deficit. But with Europe and Asia rebounding, that could get a little more difficult. And to attract investors who are seeing new opportunities elsewhere, the dollar may have to weaken, interest rates rise and stocks stop climbing.

HEADLINE: EARTHQUAKE IN TURKEY: DAMAGE;
Economic Loss Estimated To Reach Tens of Billions

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, Friday, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Economic losses caused by the devastating 45-second earthquake will reach tens of billions of dollars, according to early damage estimates announced on Thursday, and the Government probably will have to find several billion more in an already tight budget to pay for emergency reconstruction.
Rescue workers continued to pull survivors and victims from the ruins of buildings, bringing the number of dead to more than 7,000 and the injured to more than 30,000. Turkish officials said thousands were still missing, and the hope that they will be found alive is dwindling. Newspapers predicted that the death toll could soar to 10,000 or more. 
 The director of Turkey's leading observatory, Mehmet Ali Isikara, said he had detected "unusual movement" in seismic structures that could produce another tremor. More than 200 aftershocks were reported in the region on Thursday alone. In response to the warning, the Governor of Bursa, a province south of Istanbul, urged the province's 2 million residents to spend the night outdoors.
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit sought to calm rising public anger at the disorganized relief effort. Looking pale and shaken as he emerged from a crisis session, he said that although the nation was in mourning, "good news comes from all areas" as more survivors are found.
But instead of ordering an army mobilization or other drastic measures to increase the pace of the rescue effort, as some have urged, Mr. Ecevit announced only a plan to send tents to affected areas.
"Tent cities will be set up in the worst areas," he said on Thursday. "From today, they will be able to make use of health, cleaning and food facilities."
Across the quake area, people complained bitterly about the lack of relief workers and equipment. Television stations broadcast scenes of people picking through rubble with their bare hands and even fighting over scarce shovels and bulldozers. Many towns have not seen a single Government worker, and are relying on foreign volunteers or none at all.
In Izmit, near the epicenter of the quake, the country's biggest refinery continued to burn. Thousands of residents were evacuated as a precaution against explosions.
Aid workers from abroad continued to pour into Turkey. The United States announced plans to send three warships with 3,100 sailors and marines aboard. The vessels are fitted with operating rooms and medical equipment, and the crews include physicians and paramedics.
The State Department announced that five Americans were among the dead.
As the initial shock over the quake eased, Government officials and other specialists began planning what can be done to revive the shattered economy.
"The economy was already in a serious position," Prime Minister Ecevit said. "Now it will be worse."
Turkey is negotiating with the International Monetary Fund for a crucial $5 billion loan, and Turkish leaders have pledged to cut the national budget and make other reforms that may now prove difficult or impossible. At the same time, countless businesses have been destroyed, most of them small and mid-sized companies like those that have fueled this country's remarkable economic boom in the last decade.
"It's more than serious," said Abdurrahman Ariman, general secretary of the Foreign Investors Association. "The loss could be $25 billion, but the effects will be much wider than that. This is the most productive region of our country, and the destruction of infrastructure there is complete, let alone the damage that industries sustained."
"We already had serious problems in other regions, and now we have to talk about reconstructing the whole country," he said. "It's not a one-dimensional problem. It will take years to deal with, and Turkey can't handle all of it alone."
Turkey's economy has boomed for most of the 1990's, racking up growth rates of 7 to 8 percent in most years. Although there has been a slump in exports since last summer's Russian financial crisis, and a near-collapse of tourism after terrorist attacks here several months ago, most experts have agreed that the economy here is fundamentally sound and should continue to grow. But in the wake of the earthquake, no one is certain if those predictions remain valid.
"Industry has been terribly affected, and I don't know how we're going to put it together again," said Ayse Bugra, a professor of economics at Bosporus University in Istanbul. "There are all kinds of problems. Roads are a mess, and there is no rail transportation in the area even though it's the country's main industrial region.
"The destruction of the petroleum refinery will probably mean that oil prices will go up, which will fuel inflation. Many companies were not properly insured, so there will be a lot of bankruptcies and layoffs."
"But even though this is a disaster for the economy, it can be an opportunity if certain decisions are taken," Ms. Bugra said. "The refinery should definitely be moved to another place outside the earthquake zone. Incentives should be given to companies that lost buildings to relocate in other parts of the country, which would not only take them outside the danger area but would address the great regional imbalances in our economy. Insurance and construction regulations should be tightened. These would be rational steps, and now, before people forget about this, is the time to take them."
One sector of the economy that is likely to boom in the coming months is construction. Gazi Ercel, president of the Central Bank, said he expected the Government to allocate about $4 billion to rebuild ruined businesses and $2 billion to $3 billion more to rebuild the destroyed refinery.
"It's a burden on our budget, but we have a G.D.P. of $200 billion, so it should be bearable," Mr. Ercel said. "We'll also have a very low growth rate this year, probably less than one percent, but investments in construction will help somewhat. All in all, it's a sizable burden, but I think the Turkish economy, together with generous and timely foreign aid, will be able to handle it."
Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, suggested that the fund might modify its demands to take the needs of earthquake victims into consideration.
"The I.M.F. will do all it can to help the Turkish Government deal with this disaster," Mr. Camdessus said. "We stand ready to help them in any way that we can."
The chairman of Turkey's principal business association, Erkut Yucaoglu, said that even though losses would probably exceed $20 billion, the earthquake was "not completely devastating in an economic sense."
"It will slow down the economy, but we can get through it," Mr. Yucaoglu said. "I hope there will be a level of understanding abroad for the budget increases and other steps we'll have to take."
"Turkey deserves some soft loans and long-term credits at this moment to cope with the rehabilitation of various sectors of the economy, as well as funds to cope with the social side of the problem," he said. "I think foreign lenders are ready to look at things here with softer heart at this moment."

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani flew into this Southern Tier town today and announced that he had changed his mind and now supported Federal legislation designed to prop up prices for New York's dairy farmers. Mr. Giuliani said he no longer feared that the legislation would lead to higher milk costs for downstate consumers.
Mr. Giuliani's declaration -- made while attending a steak roast that has become a summer political ritual for Republican candidates and officeholders -- puts him in line with his presumed Democratic opponent in the race for United States Senate, Hillary Rodham Clinton. The First Lady declared her support for the dairy compact, an almost mandatory position in a region with many struggling dairy farmers and a beleaguered economy, during a visit to Syracuse last month. 
 "If I was in the Senate, I would vote for it," Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference at the 11th annual steak roast arranged by State Senator Thomas W. Libous, whose event typically draws more than 3,000 people with the promise of a lot of steak and just a little candidate talk. With that, Mr. Giuliani dived into the crowd to shake hands before sitting down to eat.
Mr. Giuliani said he had changed his mind after being assured by Republican members of the state's Congressional delegation that changes to the pending law, as well as regulations that would govern New York's entry into the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, would address the concerns that had once led him to oppose it: that it would lead to higher costs for consumers and raise the cost of school lunches.
The Mayor discussed his position in the midst of a stepped-up schedule of upstate visits in anticipation of a probable run for the Senate. He said he had actually announced his new position at a little-noticed speech in Cooperstown months ago.
But when reporters called Mr. Giuliani's office for comment after Mrs. Clinton weighed in the issue on July 8, his aides made no mention of the speech Mr. Giuliani referred to this evening. At the time, they noted that New York City had lobbied in Albany against the legislation that would have allowed New York to join the compact.
Mr. Giuliani's press secretary, Sunny Mindel, said she was unable to say why the position Mr. Giuliani outlined today had not been discussed at that time.
In any event, Mr. Giuliani's new stance removes what clearly could have a barrier between him and Republican leaders, such as Mr. Libous, in this part of New York.
"My earlier concerns had been satisfied," Mr. Giuliani said. "I announced that, actually, about two months ago. It was at night, it was at a dinner, and there were only two or three members of the press around and you never reported it."
The subject of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has been challenging politically, for both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani. The First Lady, in supporting New York's inclusion in the compact, found herself breaking from the policy that had been advocated by her husband's Department of Agriculture.
Mr. Giuliani had to weigh the demands of what is a very important issue upstate, where the Republican Mayor needs to do well against Mrs. Clinton, against the concerns of his current constituents, New York City consumers. Yet another political aspect of the milk compact is the fact that environmentalists support it because it assures the continued existence of small dairy farms.
The compact is scheduled to expire on Oct. 1. The legislation before Congress would renew it and enable New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania to join the cartel.
Mr. Giuliani said he changed his mind because his two major concerns had been addressed.
The first was his fear that joining the milk cartel would increase the cost of school lunch programs, because of an increase in milk costs. Mr. Giuliani said that Congressional Republicans had assured him that this would be addressed by regulations that would allow states to reimburse schools for any increases.
Mr. Giuliani said that he had dropped his concern that it would hurt downstate consumers based on the assurances of upstate Republican members of Congress, who had shown him examples of other states that had joined the compact without any increase in costs. "They satisfied me that it would in fact stabilize the price," Mr. Giuliani said.
In Washington, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said that Mr. Giuliani's administration had been on record, along with consumer groups, in warning that the higher prices for farmers would inevitably raise the price in supermarkets. "We're glad that Rudy Giuliani has finally decided to join Hillary Clinton in support of the dairy compact," Mr. Wolfson said. "The question is, why it took him so long to change his position."
Mr. Giuliani brushed off a questioner who asked if he had now adopted the First Lady's position. "I have no idea what her position is," Mr. Giuliani said.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Kiddie Pop: Raffi It's Not, But Just What Is It Anyway?

BYLINE: By ANN POWERS

 BODY:
The sound of young girls screaming has been a main energy source in pop since bobby-soxers greeted the dawn of rock-and-roll. It is amusing to watch music industry moguls and pundits fall all over themselves "discovering" that prepubescents get infatuated with prettily packaged crooners like the Backstreet Boys: just another case of short memories making things seem new.
Still, concertgoers strolling through the fairgrounds of Nickelodeon's All That Music and More Festival, nicknamed Kiddiepalooza by some, were confronted with a new twist on the teen-age pop formula. 
 The shows' teen-age and 20-something artists, including the "boy band" 98 Degrees and the collegiate chanteuse Monica, recalled predecessors ranging from New Kids on the Block to Annette Funicello. Although some of the fans singing along were learning to have crushes earlier than previous generations had, their dewy rapture was nothing new. More telling was the pleasure of the parents who took their offspring to the fair's Jones Beach stop Wednesday or its Holmdel, N.J. date Thursday, as these adults embraced the notion that loud music can be good for America's youth.
Back in rock's bad old days, children hid radios under their pillows and got their older siblings to play their Led Zeppelin records for them surreptitiously. They imagined that their first concert would transport them into a forbidden realm where people sampled illicit drugs, virginal girls considered the propositions of older men and boys gathered in the crowd to sweat out their aggression.
Even teenyboppers, whose tastes were tamer, pushed societal danger buttons by expressing a fervent sexuality. Nostalgia makes it hard to remember that Beatlemania was once considered a menace. Mild or wild, pop music has offered escape, however fleeting, from parental guidance.
The Nickelodeon tour, on the other hand, lovingly and carefully ushers children into a new style of music fandom. The festival does not feature music intended specifically for children; its artists address subjects like dating, sex and even marriage, not learning how to spell. Neither was Kiddiepalooza exactly a family outing, like a state fair, where adult activities share equal space with youthful games. Organized by a children's television network, it aimed squarely at the lunchroom set.
Some observers have cynically remarked that Kiddiepalooza's only meaning is economic, as vendors of music and concert T-shirts learn to exploit the preteen demographic. But children, and their parents, are not merely absorbing this new youth culture as product. Events like Kiddiepalooza signal serious changes in the social meaning of popular music and in the public perception of the young people who remain its most dedicated fans.
Nearly 50 years after rock's emergence, noisy, oppositionally flavored, sexually suggestive music has become a lifetime pleasure for many people, and they do not fear it when they become parents. At the same time children are maturing more rapidly, and adults feel compelled to discuss matters like sex and drug use with them earlier, and feel more comfortable doing so.
Add to this the refusal of adults to totally "grow up" and put aside pleasures identified with adolescence, and a picture emerges of a newly paced life cycle, with music grounded in rock as a soundtrack shared by all ages.
Not only are many adults now more comfortable than ever with their children's interest in pop, partly because they have been lifelong music fans themselves, but more adult-oriented musicians are also showing an interest in bridging the gap between their usual output and children's music. On both ends, the divisions between grown-up fare and kid stuff have blurred.
Young fans are being widely embraced, and not merely in the lecherous manner of heavy metal bands. Jennifer Lopez and TLC, female artists who mainly appeal to young adults, both included tender images of preteen fans in recent videos. Venerable rappers like the Sugar Hill Gang have returned as a part-kiddie, part nostalgia act: the trio has opened for teen-age bands like TN Sync, and just released the album "Jump On It!" (Kid Rhino), which transforms classic hip-hop into educational rhymes.
Alternative rock bands are also cultivating the children's market. Bis, a Scottish band whose members are 19 and 20, created the theme song for the Cartoon Network's Powerpuff Girls show. It was a natural leap for a group that regularly uses superhero imagery to promote its bright, whimsical rock. And the brothers Mark and Clay Harper have written two musical children's stories with the help of underground rock veterans like the Velvet Underground drummer Moe Tucker, the punk icon Wreckless Eric, Cindy Wilson of the B-52's, and Susan Cowsill, a former teen-age artist herself.
Throughout pop music, fans and players alike are realizing that rock's energy can be used to express emotions that are not merely adolescent.
While strains of rock and rap continue to serve teen-agers' need to rebel and establish their own identities (think Limp Bizkit), music culture in general is opening up in other directions. Teen-age bands are musically sophisticated enough to hook adult fans, while the youngest listeners are no longer stuck in the corner with their Raffi records.
This is a healthy development. Yet it raises some thorny issues, ones many parents walking away from Kiddiepalooza must have wrestled with. Bands oriented toward teen-agers may still trade mostly in puppy love, but most also embody up-front sex appeal. At Kiddiepalooza, the boy bands thrust their crotches and show plenty of muscular flesh; young female singers moan about the touch of their lovers. Monica, for example, presented herself as a kind of living Barbie, a princess in perfect outfits projecting a femininity worth emulating. She sang about respecting yourself and waiting to have sex. But she also strutted about the stage in black leather, a bona fide sexpot.
Monica was positively puritanical compared with the festival's opening act, No Authority, a quartet that incorporated male stripper-style moves with gymnastic tumbles. The members of E.Y.C., who followed No Authority, also showed off their bodies, while 13-year-old Baby DC, who played on a second stage, took a tough guy stance while rapping in a pixie's voice. These boy-men tantalized the small girls who shimmied alongside their amused mothers, some of whom probably could see the attraction in the beefcake.
These teen-age idols were far more provocative than earlier heartthrobs like David Cassidy, whose fans were infuriated when a partial nude photograph on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine proved that he actually had pubic hair. At best, their lustiness may lead to some open conversations between parents and their children, who are dealing with sex whether adults acknowledge it or not.
Yet kiddie pop feeds another, less inevitable hunger than sex, and one hopes parents are discussing this one with their concert companions, too. It preys on the urge to ascend within the media spectacle that continues to overtake public life. The aura of manufacture surrounding teen-age artists is shutting out the unkempt individuality of old-fashioned rock stars. Kiddiepalooza encouraged fans to see themselves in a similarly artificial light by offering public auditions for several Nickelodeon shows. Fans stood in long lines to sit in plastic booths and read from scripts, straining to look cute for the camera.
Rock-and-roll has always made room for cuteness, and for commerce. But its rebellious side posed important challenges to the status quo, whether they were major, like the increased visibility of African-American artists, or less earthshaking, like the triumph of scruffy outcasts in leather jackets. The music could make these inroads because of its status as an outsider art. Kiddiepalooza hardly fanned that individualistic spark; these youngest fans will have to find their own ways to ignite it.

HEADLINE: Why Nobody Likes A Loser;
Failure? No, a Bump On the Road to Success

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN

 BODY:
There is a curious inversion afoot in Silicon Valley, where Internet entrepreneurs whose start-up companies fail are more marketable to venture capitalists than those who have never failed at all. It is not how business is supposed to work, but there it is: in that corner of the economy, failure has become an asset, a resume-builder.
Perhaps in an industry where people do not know what they are doing, any experience is better than none; perhaps the willingness to fail is admired because it suggests the courage to try. Whatever the explanation, the turning of failure on its head is a reminder of Americans' incessantly ambivalent and constantly mutable relationship with the idea of not "making it." 
 Failure has been with us as the shadow of success since the republic's early days, when Benjamin Franklin lectured that "little strokes fell great oaks" -- that with enough diligence and tenacity, anyone could succeed. In the two centuries since, as capitalism has expanded its hold on American life, success has become that much more important and failure that much more catastrophic. Its definition, in fact, seems to have quietly broadened to encompass not just those who fail outright, but those who do not achieve extraordinary and public success.
As in Silicon Valley, of course, there are exceptions. In the age of instant memoirs and commercial endorsements, for example, Bob Dole, Dick Morris, and others have shown that failure can actually be profitable. Indeed, to judge from talk shows and tabloids, the only true failure nowadays sometimes seems to be obscurity.
But for most Americans the stigma of failing remains, and thus the quest to assign a moral cause for it continues. Whether the blame for those who fail to make it up the ladder lies with larger socioeconomic forces or with the individual is an unspoken subtext of the ideological battle between liberals and conservatives. It is the backdrop of countless policy debates, on subjects from welfare to how hard it should be to declare bankruptcy.
Yet while plenty of Americans have experience with failure, few like to dwell on it, at least outside their therapists' offices.
"Historians in particular and Americans in general don't like to talk about failure very much," said Scott Sandage, a professor at Carnegie Mellon who is at work on a book called "Forgotten Men: Failure in American Culture," to be published by Harvard University Press.
There are, he says, dozens of studies of the ideology of success in America, but until recently, historians have not looked at the experience of failure. Professor Sandage is doing just that -- researching not great men who momentarily stumbled, but ordinary men who despite their honest toil slowly, or sometimes instantaneously, sank.
He has dug through family papers and diaries, credit reports and letters to understand how Americans grappled with failure in a society where hard work was supposed to equal success.
The answer was usually to find some flaw in the person's character. He cites the example of Robert Brown, a farmer and planter in antebellum Virginia who was described in various business records as "one of nature's best sons" -- a decent if slightly naive man -- while he was prospering. But when he went bankrupt some of the same people described him as "a man of no energy" -- a phrase that Professor Sandage says became common in the 1850's and 1860's to describe failures who were not idlers or drunkards.
"It is a profound threat to the fundamental ideology of America if it never comes together" despite one's best efforts, Mr. Sandage said.
So when Fitch Raymond, a Cleveland grocer who failed during the Panic of 1873, requested assistance from a friend, he defended himself against the assumption that he was to blame: "I have been Struggling incessantly trying to re g ain a little foothold but without success," he wrote. "Not because I am imbecile, shiftless, lazy, listlessly, loafing about, no, not a bit of it, but the reverse is true."
Over time Mr. Sandage said, failure has been transformed from an action -- failing at a business or other venture -- to an identity. Today, being known as a "loser" and the words "I am a failure" have become common coinage.
The rise of super-successes like Carnegie and Rockefeller at the end of the 19th century helped breed the phenomenon that might be called failure through inadequacy: unless one achieved and amassed on a grand public scale, one had failed. As capitalism exploded, Americans began grappling with how to process failure in a society that held that the individual made his fortunes or broke them. The notion of treating failure as a bump on the road to success -- still very much evident today in self-help books with titles like "Failure: The Back Door to Success" -- began to emerge.
In the 1920's, the decade when President Calvin Coolidge proclaimed that "the chief business of the American people is business," a little homily called "The Failure" circulated in popular magazines, Merrill Peterson writes in "Lincoln in American Memory." It recounted the defeats Abraham Lincoln had suffered and concluded: "How would you stand in the face of such setbacks? Think it over!"
The list of Lincoln's failures continues to circulate today, most often in advice columns and motivational seminars. That it happens to be somewhat inaccurate -- some of the defeats on the list are exaggerated or did not happen -- has done little to diminish its appeal.
"The Lincoln list" embodies one of the most potent images in American life, one found in politics, Hollywood and certainly sports: the comeback. At its heart the comeback is nothing more than failing, then rising from the ashes, with victory sweetened by the defeat that preceded it.
"As a culture we are very forgiving of failure," said Steven Biel, a professor of history and literature at Harvard, "but failure has to be one moment in a larger narrative where success is secured."
Mr. Biel, the author of "Down With the Old Canoe," a history of cultural attitudes toward the Titanic, notes that when the ship sank in 1912, "everyone who looked at it tried to turn it into a story of redemption -- pulling success out of the jaws of failure." The fact that women and children were saved first, he said, was instantly spun as an example of American male chivalry.
Such public and political efforts to transform grand national failures into a narrative of triumph are not uncommon. Consider the speech William Safire composed for President Nixon in 1969 in case the men who landed on the moon had to be abandoned there. It would have been a disastrous failure, but in Mr. Safire's vision, it became a triumph of American character. "Others will follow, and surely find their way home," the speech read. "Man's search will not be denied."
"American political culture has not changed," Mr. Biel said. "It is hard to envision any national figure not returning to the rhetoric of progress -- that failure is part of the American narrative of destiny."
Still, the turns of history have forced Americans occasionally to adjust their attitudes toward failure. During the Depression, for instance, failure became so widespread that blame shifted somewhat from the individual to the system. The same is true, to a lesser degree, of the wave of downsizing earlier this decade.
Such larger phenomena may briefly elicit more public compassion. But perhaps the gentlest and certainly most honest treatment of failure comes in literature. As Willy Loman, perhaps the archetype of American failure puts it, "A man can't go out the way he came in, Ben, he has got to add up to something."
Robert Polito, the biographer of the crime novelist Jim Thompson, calls failure "one of the great subjects of American fiction" -- perhaps the great subject. From Herman Melville's "Pierre," to Hurstwood in "Sister Carrie," who descends from prosperity to a Bowery flophouse, to Dick Diver's disappearing into smaller and smaller towns at the end of F. Scott Fitzgerald's"Tender Is the Night" -- the list of fictional failures is endless. Often, Mr. Polito notes, they are exploring the burdens placed on the psyche by the enormous expectations of success in America.
In most of these books the failures are men, and Mr. Sandage said his research also revealed failure as a masculine category. "People don't fail unless they are supposed to succeed," he said, and in the 19th century and much of the 20th success was the province of white men.
But Andrew Delbanco, a professor of the humanities at Columbia University, notes that women, particularly in the 19th century, had their own kind of failure to deal with: whether they married and, in a certain milieu, married well. Again, literature tells the story: Lily Bart in Edith Wharton's "House of Mirth," for example, blows her chance to make a good match and is consigned to poverty and ultimately death.
In fact each subculture in American life -- whether gender or region, profession or class -- seems to have its own code of failure: what kinds are acceptable, how to treat those who fail, rules that protect the status of the subculture and its members. Where Silicon Valley exalts failure, Wall Street punishes it ruthlessly, observes Michael Lewis, who is about to publish a book on cyberspace entrepreneurs.
"People can't be seen giving money to someone who has proven inept with money," he said. On Wall Street, to readmit a failure would suggest that the whole business is a crapshoot, based as much on luck as skill.
Among the underclass, conversely, failure has become normalized. Sociologists like William Julius Wilson have devoted a sizable portion of their work trying to establish why the "achievement ethic," the hunger for traditional notions of success, has not permeated the inner city, or how social and economic forces grease the path toward failure.
And then there is politics, which Mr. Lewis, who spent the 1996 Presidential campaign mostly with candidates who failed, calls one of the few fields in American life with room for "noble failure" -- the principled and damned quest, waged by men like Ralph Nader or John McCain.
But even principle does not necessarily make defeat palatable. Mr. Lewis said that he wanted to title his last book, on the 1996 presidential campaign, "Losers," but his publisher refused. Mr. Lewis said he was told there is no market in America for failure.

HEADLINE: Philippine Leader Vows to Alter Constitution Despite Protests

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MANILA, Aug. 20

 BODY:
President Joseph Estrada said he would go ahead with plans to amend the Constitution, despite protests today by tens of thousands of people who said the changes could endanger the country's democracy.
The protests, in Manila and other major cities, resembled in some ways the revolt that toppled the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, with seas of yellow-clad protesters, confetti and the backing of former President Corazon Aquino and Roman Catholic Church leaders. 
 This time, however, protesters acknowledged that the issues are much less clear. Mr. Estrada, who won a landslide victory 15 months ago, remains highly popular and has pledged that only economic provisions of the Constitution will be revised to attract more foreign investment.
"We are not saying that this administration is like the Marcos regime -- but we do have cause to worry," said Mrs. Aquino, whose Government wrote the Constitution after Mr. Marcos's ouster. She and other protesters said they want to prevent a slip back into dictatorship.
However, the President said today that he plans to proceed with the amendments and insisted that he only wants to help the poor.
"I did not become President to preside over a society where the poor become poorer and the rich become richer," he said. "Why is this happening? One of the reasons is because we don't have enough money in our economy to address the needs."
Mr. Estrada argues that the Constitution is overly protectionist and must be overhauled to attract foreign investors.
He wants to remove provisions that bar foreigners from owning land and that limit foreign ownership of businesses in certain sectors to 40 percent.
The restrictions have caused the Philippines to lose out on investment to its neighbors, he says.
But critics fear that the planned economic amendments might lead to political changes once the Constitution is opened to revision by members of Congress eager to extend their terms.
"Who will control the change?" Mrs. Aquino said to the thousands of people who marched in Manila's financial district, Makati, a center of protest against Mr. Marcos in the 1980's. "There is no sound reason to tinker with the Constitution."
A large yellow banner behind her read: "Stand up for democracy." Yellow was the symbol of the 1986 revolt.
Nearby was a statue of her husband, Benigno Aquino, a pro-democracy leader who was slain on Aug. 21, 1983, as he was returning from exile in the United States.
The issue of constitutional change has sharply polarized Filipinos and reverberated in financial markets. Earlier in the week, stock prices slumped to a six-month low while the peso hit a nine-month low. Share prices later recouped some of their losses.
The proposed changes are generally backed by big business, but some smaller companies fear they may be overwhelmed by foreign competition.
Critics also have said Mr. Estrada is attempting to muzzle a critical press and has allowed a return of cronyism, in which close presidential friends receive special economic favors. Mr. Estrada has denied both accusations.
"If the situation doesn't change, it could lead to another revolt," Bishop Vicente Navarro told a rally in Kabankalan in Negros Occidental province.
Rallies -- the first large-scale protests against Mr. Estrada -- were also held in Cebu, Davao, Baguio, Bacolod, Iligan and other cities.
Mrs. Aquino and Catholic Church officials also led rallies two years ago that forced President Fidel Ramos to halt constitutional amendments aimed at extending his term.

HEADLINE: Energy From Waste

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re an Aug. 11 editorial on the improving but fragile state of the Chesapeake Bay: 
 As you note, to have a sustainable poultry industry and meet Federal water-quality goals, regulation alone is not enough. We must have land-use rules that allow farmers to continue to grow chickens for the grocery shelf and dispose of waste in an environmentally sensitive way.
Few people want to face the economic impact of putting many of these farms out of business. However, there is technology that can convert poultry waste into electricity, generating renewable energy. To make this technology economically viable in Delaware and other states, Congress recently enacted a limited tax credit for those governments that use it. This is the kind of initiative needed to meet environmental challenges at the local level.

Former President George Bush's biggest problem, an old friend of his once suggested, was that he liked policy a lot more than politics.
Nobody who has watched him would ever say that about Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who plunges into crowds -- a crowd of 10 at an airport late at night, a crowd of hundreds at a fund-raiser, a crowd of thousands at a rally -- with all the enthusiasm of Bill Clinton or Nelson A. Rockefeller or that formidable flesh-pressing Texan of yesteryear, Lyndon B. Johnson. 
 Nobody would ever mistake him for Vice President Al Gore.
It was obvious on a two-day campaign swing this week that Mr. Bush, the front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination next year, has a lot of work to do on his platform style. Ideas he expressed with vigor and conviction in a private talk in his hotel suite came out sounding tired, flat and mechanical when he tried them later on a ballroom full of 400 New Orleans-area supporters who had given him at least $1,000 each.
Nor was there much on offer for the policy wonk. He wants to set his own pace and his own rhythm, Mr. Bush said, and to that end he plans to make a half-dozen major speeches starting next month. But Mr. Bush -- now referred to by newspapers around the country not as George W. Bush or even George W. but simply as W. -- demonstrated real mastery of one-on-one campaigning.
His style is an amalgam of East and Southwest, Yale and the oil patch. Call him the Madras Cowboy.
Watch him with a classroom full of second graders in Jefferson Parish, near New Orleans. After a relaxed discussion of how caterpillars turn into butterflies, a youngster asked him why the sun had a smiling face. Beats me, the Governor replied; why does the chicken cross the road? Well, his interlocutor said, the cow crosses the road to go to the mooovies.
Good television, of course, but something more as well: it gave the Governor a chance to promote the school, Jefferson Elementary, as a prime example of the kind of public-private partnership he wants to see more of -- in this case, Lockheed Martin and Shell Oil helping a school set up a computer laboratory and Internet connections.
Watch him, again, reading with a group of mostly black inner-city 6- and 7-year-olds at the West End Center for Youth here. When "hop" and "top" sound the same, Mr. Bush asked, what's that called?
"Rhyme."
"Right. Good."
I have two daughters the same age, he said, his hands resting on the shoulder of a tiny child with red and yellow pony-tail holders braided into her hair; what are they called?
"Twins."
"Right. Great."
He told them that his dog, Spot, had been born in the White House, and assured them that, no, he had not arrived in Roanoke by limousine.
By the time he finished, Mr. Bush had worked in a pair of plugs: one for reading as the key to the American Dream, another for more Federal aid to after-school facilities wholly or partly sponsored by church groups, as is the West End Center. Then he stopped for a chat on the playground with some older youths, and as he walked back to his van, Sam Sapp, lanky and 13, walked with him, an arm draped fraternally across the Governor's shoulder.
Then on to the Farmers' Market in downtown Roanoke, which has been around since 1882. It is a traditional local campaign stop, and 250 or 300 people had gathered on a hot August morning to meet a candidate in an election that is not 3 weeks or 3 months but 15 long months away.
Mr. Bush keeps saying it is much too early for long speeches, too early for debates. But his campaign is already an industrial-strength gig, with long motorcades, a private jet, staff and security people talking furtively into their sleeves, White House-style "bibles" detailing every move and seven video cameras (not to mention still ones, tape recorders and notebooks) following along.
Not even Dwight D. Eisenhower, a victor in history's greatest war just a few years before, had this kind of entourage this early in 1951.
Nothing seemed to faze Mr. Bush in the slightest as he moved slowly past market stalls stacked high with peaches, pole beans, Japanese eggplants and Silver Queen corn, the bounty of late summer in the Virginia Piedmont. After he had spent more than an hour shaking hands, posing for photographs, chatting about the military and the local museum and the weather, kissing a baby swathed in pink (and a grandmother or two as well), complimenting Gina Thomas on her "good-looking" family of four children and signing a lot of autographs, a man handed him a $100 bill and asked him to sign that.
"You must be doing pretty darn well," Mr. Bush said.
"Not as well as you and your father," the man replied, and the Governor, laughing, gave him a chummy punch on the upper arm.
Where did this come from, a campaign visitor asked, this knack for putting people at ease, this common touch. Well, Mr. Bush said pointedly, he grew up in Midland, Tex., and not in Greenwich, Conn., like his father. Then he thought a minute and added, "I must get it from my mother."
Except for one thing, it was a loosy-goosey, laughter-punctuated couple of days. Except for one big thing: the never-ending questions about drugs. Mr. Bush tried without much success to fend them off, insisting that he would not talk in any detail about the various "things," never specified, that he did 20 and more years ago and now regretted having done.
This is the same Governor Bush, of course, who has come down hard on young hard-drug users.
"I made the decision not to play the game," he said in a long talk aboard his campaign jet. "No float-a-rumor-and-force-him-to-answer. No more trash-mouth politics. No politics of personal destruction. The baby boomers who are so eager to purge their souls send a very mixed message to the young. You know, if George Bush did it when he was a kid, why can't I?
"Another thing -- people are being turned off politics by all this negativism. I can't control the nastiness and the ugliness of the system, but I sure can do my best to clean it up. People want it to end."
Mr. Bush has staked a lot on that proposition, and he is also betting that the public is repelled by President Clinton's sexual adventures. They want to know "who you are today, not who were you yesterday," he said, "and they want someone to bring dignity back into the White House."
He insisted that he was not bitter about Mr. Clinton's defeat of his father seven years ago, even though he described that defeat as "a pretty nasty experience, limping back into Houston the night before Election Day, knowing that you were beat." If he was bitter about anyone, he said, it would be Ross Perot, who he thinks tipped the election to Mr. Clinton.
But the President's involvement with Monica S. Lewinsky "embarrassed lots of people," Governor Bush said. "They long for someone they can trust, even though they're content with the economic situation. They give Clinton credit for all this prosperity."
One such person, he said, was a woman who approached him in Iowa several weeks ago and gave him a picture of her 3-year-old son.
"She told me to keep it, that she was counting on me to remember that I had a big responsibility," Mr. Bush said. "She was saying that the President had not lived up to his, I guess. But I don't think I can get elected President just by talking about Bill Clinton. He's fading into history. His time is over."
So he talks more obliquely, about the need for a change in leadership and in the nation's values. Two of his favorite lines relate to this. Over and over, he talks about ushering in "the responsibility era" and ending the present one, when "if it feels good, you do it, and if it goes wrong, blame someone else." He promises a "fresh start after a season of cynicism." Over and over, he insists that "prosperity alone is simple materialism" and calls for "a richness beyond money" available to all.
"The worth of America has never been proven by cities of gold," he said in New Orleans, as he has before, "but by citizens of character."
Details to follow on all that, but Mr. Bush is a bit more specific about national security policy. He senses that the American military services are dispirited, "because they think their role is not valued by our leaders" and because military spending has been cut too quickly. Yet he talks of a top-to-bottom reorganization that would lead, for example, to a single fighter-interceptor to be used by all branches of service. That idea has been floated before, only to generate considerable opposition from the services.
He backed President Clinton's action in Kosovo and endorsed his refusal "to let the United Nations act as the surrogate for the United States." He took a swipe at the Administration's Asia policy, arguing that China was a competitor of the United States, not a strategic ally.
But mostly, as the plane headed for Roanoke, the Governor talked politics, swapping tales of campaigns old and not so old, victorious and calamitous. He expected more attacks, he said, like the one started last week by Marilyn Quayle, the wife of former Vice President Dan Quayle, who dismissed Mr. Bush as "a frat boy" who had accomplished very little in life.
"People have tried that before, and it hasn't worked," he said. "Ann Richards called me 'Shrub' in the governor's race, and it backfired. But I like the give and take of campaigning anyway. I grew up with it."

HEADLINE: A Good Credit History, Indeed;
Opening the Books on American Business, 1841-1891

BYLINE: By JULIE FLAHERTY 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Aug. 20

 BODY:
With his large hands clad in delicate white gloves, Travis B. Blackman gingerly opened the sheepskin-bound book and blew gently on the onion-skin-thin pages to separate them. He treated the aged volume with the reverence normally reserved for a first-edition Dickens or Hemingway.
But all this fuss over a credit report? Or rather, over 2,580 volumes of handwritten credit reports that date back to 1841 and run through 1891. As unromantic as it sounds, for people who study the wheelings and dealings of days gone by, the R. G. Dun & Company Collection at Harvard University is the Holy Grail of business history. 
 For within the books' light blue pages, written in curvaceous script, are titillating details about whether a particular businessman drank too much or attended church, if he got his money from his rich wife or his business was a front for a brothel.
Ne'er-do-wells are boldly named, like one storekeeper in Halifax County, N.C., who in June of 1873 was referred to as a "purchaser of stolen goods, a great scamp." Long before the existence of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the annual stockholder meeting, it was the credit report that told the real dirt on a business.
"These volumes represent the creation of a national business network," said Mr. Blackman, who oversees the use of the archives for what is now the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, which donated them to the university in 1962. "Every nook- and-cranny village on the frontier, somebody was there sending a report to the company."
And these days, more people are noticing. The number of people poring over the collection almost doubled over the last three years, from about 900 in 1995 to approximately 1,700 in 1998. Mr. Blackman, who must sign off on all the books and theses that quote the Dun collection, said that a few years ago, he might have reviewed one or two manuscripts a month. Now he sees five or six.
Laura Linard, director of historical collections at the library, said use has increased significantly because more scholars appreciate the worth of business records. It is the most used of all the library's historical records, to the point that Ms. Linard is a little frightened for its safety. "The collection is very, very fragile," she said. "It's in incredibly poor condition, because these books were used during their lifetime, consistently, constantly."
To scholars, the credit assessments are invaluable for piecing together American business history, in part because they avoid corporate spin and show the view of a third party -- in this case, the agents, or "correspondents," across the nation who reported back to R. G. Dun's home office on the creditworthiness of local carpenters, grocers and lightning-rod makers.
Robert C. Kenzer, a history professor at the University of Richmond, recently trawled the books for information on Civil War widows who took over their husbands' businesses. "They were broad in their perspective," Mr. Kenzer said of the Dun reporters. "They rate the elite and they rate the common people. Right next to the Rockefellers you find someone you've never heard of."
A June 1870 entry on one J. B. Alford, who sold groceries and liquors, read: "This man is said to be in thriving circumstances. He has some Real & personal estate & I think it is safe to trust him." Alas, the December 1876 entry read, "Failed abt 3 mos ago & went into Bankruptcy."
Sociologists and historians like Mr. Kenzer use the archives to study the growth of a particular industry, like pottery, or a specific topic, like Jewish-owned businesses before the turn of the century. Over the last 20 years, Mr. Kenzer has made many trips to Boston, researching subjects like black-owned businesses in the South. Once, he spent six weeks copying every page of one ledger. "It's pretty exhausting work," he said. "Fortunately, they had good handwriting."
It sounds like the kind of summer reading only a number-cruncher could love, and Harvard business students seem to agree. For although the archive is housed in the Baker Library at the School of Business Administration, it is used infrequently by Harvard's M.B.A. candidates, most of whom are more concerned with strategic mapping and venture capital than the cost of antebellum dry goods. Only scholars with very good reasons -- and white gloves -- are allowed to handle the fragile books. The library no longer allows genealogical research.
Still, there are lessons from the past that young executives could take with them into the business world. For starters, there is the danger of first impressions. One entry from June 1863 reports that a produce merchant named J. D. Rockefeller "is not much of a businessman, but had some capital, it is said, advanced by his father, who is reputed well off." He turned out to be a good credit risk; that was the year he set up a refinery that blossomed into Standard Oil.
Then there is the power of courtesy, as demonstrated in some handwritten requests for payment. Who wouldn't cave at this gentle entreaty: "If you will kindly favor us with a check at your convenience, you will much oblige"?
The Dun correspondents were often inspiring in their objectivity, for although they reported on the race or religion of a business owner, as was common at the time, those facts did not necessarily affect their rating of someone's business acumen. Women, it seems, could sometimes get credit when men could not, because, as one researcher found, they were seen as "cautious" and "economical."
Drinking was another matter. "If you were intemperate, they were not going to extend you credit," Mr. Kenzer said. Ponder the fate of G. H., an Ontario innkeeper, listed as "fond of drinking and gambling. Considered bad stock unsafe for credit."
Millennium watchers might take comfort in the business disasters of the past. Mr. Kenzer, who is starting research on the Chicago fire of 1871, said: "The problem wasn't just the people who were burned out. You don't know who you owe money to, or who owes money to you."
"It might be similar to a Y2K issue," he said. "How do you recover when you lose a lot of information?" Chicago, after all, bounced back fairly quickly.
One can get a snapshot of the early career of businessmen like Frank Winfield Woolworth, who borrowed $300 from former employers to open "The Great Five Cent Store" in Utica, N.Y., in 1879. Or of the catalogue tycoon Richard Warren Sears, a telegraph operator from Minnesota who started a business in mail-order watches and in 1887 took up with a young watchmaker named Roebuck.
Surprisingly, Lewis Tappan, the founder of what would become Dun & Bradstreet, did not like the idea of credit. Mr. Tappan was a Calvinist whose motto was "Owe no man anything but to love one another." But after a depression in the early 1800's left businesses in tatters, the practical Mr. Tappan saw that lenders needed to know whom they could trust to pay debts. Twice a year, correspondents would send their reports to Mr. Tappan's office in New York, then called the Mercantile Agency. The subscribers or their personal clerks could come to the office to hear credit reports on their business associates, read in discreet whispers.
Robert Graham Dun took over the agency in 1859, and it would be known as R. G. Dun & Company until it merged with its main competitor, the Bradstreet Company, in 1933. Throughout that time, credit reporting grew along with American business. When the railroad expanded business horizons, correspondents traveled west to report on saloonkeepers and cattle ranchers. One correspondent wrote of his work: "One method was to go on the railroad as far as possible, then to visit the towns on horseback. I traveled many miles on the hot plains of Texas by saddle, buckboard or mail hack."
Among the correspondents, usually lawyers who received fees for collecting debts, were four future presidents: Ulysses S. Grant, William B. McKinley, Grover Cleveland and Abraham Lincoln. After Lincoln's assassination, an agency clerk marked up an entry on the President, drawing a weeping willow tree and a grave marker and writing in the words: "This office has had the honor of having Old Abe as a correspondent."
Mr. Grant's commentaries could be especially colorful: He reported that a particular young lawyer he evaluated had nothing but an office chair, a barrel with a board for a desk, and a fine young wife. Still, he argued that ability and ambition were as important as capital, and recommended credit.
Executives of the last century were sometimes branded by the company they kept. In 1869, a correspondent wrote that Hannah Griffith, a milliner in Springfield, Ill., was "about to marry a fellow of no account." An entry two years later noted, with some relief, that that plan had fallen through.
Modern credit write-ups, of course, are far less prying, not even denoting whether a business executive is a Mr. or a Ms. The streamlining came about through a natural technological evolution. With the introduction of things like typewriters, telephones and fax machines to do the reporting and computers to do the analyzing, it was easier to have some sort of consistency in the reports, and easier to compare businesses within particular industries.
More important, Dun's clients started demanding more facts and less gossip. "Social mores change," Mr. Blackman said. "All of a sudden our customers stopped asking whether a person drank to excess and started asking things like 'How is World War II affecting this manufacturer?"'
Indeed, today's reports are strictly factual, with their tabulations based on bills, suits, liens and government filings, information gleaned from enormous data bases. For all its pride in its almost 160-year history, Dun & Bradstreet might like to forget the references to a Jewish business owner as "another of the tribe" or the abbreviation "col'd" after the name of every black business. But it does allow today's researchers to track the role of different races and religions in the American economy.
Should 20th-century businesses fear that future generations will entertain themselves with their credit histories? Mr. Blackman said no: New information on a company supplants the old, and when a business closes, its file is left all but blank.
"There will not be anything like this ever again, as far as a snapshot of American business history," he said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
WesternersSee a Toothless Japanese Giant

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
The proposed merger of three Japanese banks into a behemoth with $1.3 trillion in assets poses little competitive threat to American or European banks, bankers and analysts said yesterday, nor will it do much to disrupt the push by foreign banks into Japan's home market.
Combining Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan would create a powerhouse in assets alone -- not in global reach, profitability, technology or productivity. None of the banks is known abroad as an innovator. Facing loan losses at home, the three have been scaling back their international presence in recent years. 
 "Even if these banks consolidate their operations the way a U.S. bank would, which is not likely, they have pulled away from international markets, and a likelihood of a revived international push is low," said Diane Glossman, banking industry analyst at Lehman Brothers.
The subdued reaction to the planned merger contrasts sharply with the wariness toward Japanese banking power in the 1980's, when those banks financing corporate Japan's sweeping international expansion seemed poised to do to world banking rivals what Japanese electronics makers did to American television manufacturers. Even as recently as 1996, when the Bank of Tokyo merged with the Mitsubishi Bank to form what was then the world's largest bank in terms of assets, some rival bankers saw a rising competitive threat.
Japan's prolonged recession and troubled real estate loan portfolios have radically changed that image. Most foreign bankers say they are more concerned that a Japanese banking implosion might cause a world financial panic than they are about Japanese banks stealing customers from them.
"This is a purely defensive merger," said a senior executive at a leading American bank. "They are trying to protect themselves at home."
The banker said that none of the three banks were considered a sought-after partner for foreign banks. He also said that he did not expect the merger to curb the ability of foreign banks to lure customers away from Japanese banks.
Some American bankers view Japan's banking sector these days as handicapped, even crippled. The Japanese Government in recent years has continuously increased its estimate of bad loans. In February, the Government put the figure at 76 trillion yen ($600 billion), more than double a prevailing Japanese banking industry estimate.
All banks must set aside capital to cover failed loans, so every new yen in bad loans requires that almost that much be added to a loan reserve -- taking away money the banks might have been able to deploy profitably. For Japan in recent years, it has been a vicious cycle: several leading Japanese banks have flirted with falling below a widely accepted international standard for the amount of capital they have to support their loans, risking exclusion from international markets.
Most Japanese banks now promise that they will seek to reach American levels of profitability. But they have a long way to go. Some of the most profitable Japanese banks earn a 2 percent return on equity, a standard way of measuring profits, analysts say. Top American banks earn 5 to 10 times as much.
Measured by assets, many of the largest banks in the world are still Japanese -- though the recent combination of Deutsche Bank of Germany with the American company Bankers Trust made that the No. 1 contender. But sheer asset size does not really measure financial strength or sophistication.
Leading American banks now often serve corporate customers by helping them get access to stock and bond markets, rather than making loans and recording them on their books. Traditional ways of making and recording loans build assets quickly, but are not considered highly profitable. When American banks make corporate loans, they are often syndicated, or sold off to investors.
"You simply cannot equate asset size with financing power or skill sets," Ms. Glossman said. "American banks would be much larger than the Japanese banks if they did things the same way."

HEADLINE: EARTHQUAKE IN TURKEY: THE U.S. ROLE;
American Navy Ships Carrying Aid to Turkey

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Three Navy ships carrying more than 3,000 sailors and marines and tons of relief supplies are to arrive off the coast of Turkey this weekend, the spearhead of what is proving to be a large American military response to Turkey's devastating earthquake.
The Navy ships are crossing the Mediterranean and will be ready to provide medical care by Saturday evening, the Pentagon said. Pentagon officials said they scrapped plans to send several Air Force planes to Turkey to help fight fires set off by the earthquake because the fires had largely been contained. 
 The ships, led by the amphibious assault ship Kearsarge, carry 22 helicopters available for medical evacuations and have 6 operating rooms, 5 X-ray rooms and 60 hospital beds. The medical staff includes 8 doctors, 3 dentists, 88 medics and other medical specialists.
A separate 22-member Navy medical team from Naples arrived in Turkey today with 27,000 pounds of medical gear and surgical supplies, including intravenous fluids and anesthesia machines.
The Agency for International Development, which is overseeing the civilian response, said the United States had so far provided about $3 million in nonmilitary aid to Turkey.
Additional money will be committed later to support the reconstruction of towns and cities in Turkey ravaged by the earthquake.
"We're very much in the search-and-rescue phase of this operation," said Harriet C. Babbitt, the agency's deputy administrator.
The United States has depended heavily on Turkey, a NATO ally, in military operations in both the Balkans and the Middle East, and President Clinton said earlier this week that the United States "will do whatever we can to help them get through this terrible crisis."
A 70-member search-and-rescue team from Fairfax County, Va., outside Washington, has been at work in Turkey since Thursday morning, searching for survivors buried under the rubble of the city of Izmit, near the epicenter of the quake.
The team, which uses sniffer dogs and sophisticated electronic equipment in its searches, is under contract to the Agency for International Development and has so far rescued four people from collapsed buildings. It is to be joined this weekend by a second 70-member American rescue team, this one from Miami.
With whole Turkish cities in rubble, American relief officials said that Turkey's most pressing need was for tents and other temporary housing for hundreds of thousands of people forced from their homes. The Defense Department has said that it will provide up to 30,000 tents and more than 100,000 prepared meals.
Ms. Babbitt said the Administration was urging members of the public who wish to help Turkish earthquake victims to do so with money, not through donations of clothing, food or other goods that would take time to ship to Turkey. The Agency for International Development has established a toll-free telephone number to provide callers with a list of charity groups seeking contributions for earthquake relief: (800) 872-4373.

HEADLINE: Phelps Dodge Offers to Acquire Two Merging Copper Companies

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Continuing a consolidation trend among basic commodity industries, the Phelps Dodge Corporation, the copper producer, made a bid yesterday and then sweetened it to acquire the Cyprus Amax Minerals Company and Asarco Inc., which themselves had just agreed to merge. The Phelps Dodge bid was promptly rejected.
But analysts say that Phelps Dodge's all-stock bid, which started at $2.4 billion and grew to $2.66 billion by day's end, may ultimately be hard for the newly combined targets to resist given the difficult economics of the copper industry. Prices are hitting rock bottom, there is global overcapacity and there are no apparent prospects for a change in this dismal combination. 
 "The Phelps bid is a bold move; it is a complex move, and, at the end of the day, it will prevail," said Vahid Fathi, a metals industry analyst with ABN Amro in Chicago. "The combined trio would be propelled to the top of the chain as the No. 1 producer. Truly, this is remarkable."
An equally bold note was sounded yesterday by Phelps Dodge's chief executive, Douglas Yearley, who said, in a call to analysts, "We are now prepared to take all necessary steps to make this happen." Among those, Mr. Yearley said, was perhaps raising the bid again.
Cyprus Amax, which is based in Englewood, Colo., and Asarco, based in New York, yesterday reaffirmed their intention of going it alone. On Thursday, the boards of the two companies met separately, and both voted to reject the Phelps Dodge bid, saying that the directors of both companies had "determined that pursuing the Asarco-Cyprus merger was in the best interests" of both companies' stockholders.
It is unclear whether Cyprus and Asarco are simply holding out for a higher price from Phelps Dodge or if they are firm in their determination to resist it. Also unclear is whether their shareholders will allow them to continue to reject this offer. The sweetened Phelps Dodge offer would give 0.4098 share of Phelps Dodge stock for every Asarco share and 0.3135 share for every Cyprus share.
At yesterday's closing price of $59.125 for Phelps Dodge, which was up 56.25 cents, this would be valued at $24.23 for every Asarco share, which rose $4 yesterday to close at $22.4375. And it would be valued at $18.54 for every Cyprus share, which rose $2.875 yesterday to close at $17.375. The sweetened Phelps Dodge offer values Cyprus at some $1.7 billion and Asarco at roughly $960 million.
"The question of should the shareholders accept is a pretty easy one," said Raymond Goldie, an analyst at St. James Securities in Toronto. "Cyprus and Asarco have given their shareholders returns in the minus-20 percent range, while Phelps has had something like a 160 percent return in the same time period. I'd take the money and run."
If the three-way deal goes through, it would create a company that would surpass Chile's state-owned Codelco as the world's top copper producer and would unite production in the copper-rich American Southwest. Right now the world copper market is being flooded with copper from Chile and Indonesia, where the mining costs are lower and the mines are newer. Many analysts expect that copper prices, which have plunged in the last few years, should remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future. Copper has been trading at around 70 to 75 cents a pound lately, the lowest levels in over a decade.
"The world is swimming in copper," said John C. Tumazos, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein & Company. "And North American companies realize they are in big competitive trouble. It's a given that things have to change."
Mr. Tumazos, however, said that Cyprus and Asarco shareholders might be persuaded by management to give the newly combined entity a chance on its own. That would leave Phelps Dodge, the world's No. 4 producer, out of a global merger wave unless it raised its bid even further. If it did so, it could run the risk of overpaying for assets.
Yesterday's bidding was part of a large consolidation trend sweeping not only copper but all basic commodities -- aluminum, chemicals and oils. Commodity giants have been pairing up to gain market share and reduce costs in a world flooded by raw-material overcapacity and declining demand. This week, the world's largest aluminum maker, Alcoa Inc., won agreement to acquire Reynolds Metals, which would make it even bigger. This comes on the heels of a three-way merger on both sides of the Atlantic to unite a Canadian, a Swiss and a French aluminum maker into one giant company rivaling Alcoa.
Cyprus and Asarco announced their merger plans in July, and have set a Sept. 30 date for shareholders to vote on the deal. Those two companies say this union will save $200 million in costs. Mr. Fathi of ABN Amro said that a merger with Phelps Dodge could realize another $200 million in savings by eliminating redundant operations.
J. Clarence Morrison, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said a three-way deal "makes a great deal of sense" for all three companies.
"There needs to be a lot of rationalization of copper assets in the United States, and this has been discussed at considerable length through the years," he said. But when asked whether Phelps Dodge would be successful in its quest, Mr. Morrison responded: "It's too early to tell."

HEADLINE: Federal Budget Showed Deficit Last Month

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
The Federal Government had a budget deficit of $25.16 billion in July as money flowing into the Treasury slowed after an influx from quarterly income tax payments the month before. But the Government is still on track to post a big surplus this year.
The Treasury Department said today that last month's budget deficit of $25.16 billion was slightly higher than the $24.08 billion deficit reported in July 1998. 
 In July this year, Government spending totaled $147.07 billion, while receipts totaled $121.91 billion.
Government receipts from individual income tax payments in July came to $59.98 billion, after totaling $92.99 billion the month before. And corporate income tax payments totaled just $3.4 billion, compared with $39.26 billion in June.
For the first 10 months of the fiscal year 1999, which began on Oct. 1, 1998, the Government posted a surplus totaling $69.11 billion, up from the $42.98 billion surplus for the corresponding period last year.
In its midyear economic forecast, the Clinton Administration projected that the surplus, which totaled $69.2 billion in 1998, will climb to $98.8 billion in the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, and $142.5 billion in 2000. Congressional accountants are predicting a surplus of about $120 billion for all of 1999.
Last year, the Government had its first surplus since 1969. Assuming Administration projections come through, this will be the first back-to-back surpluses since 1956-57.

Latin America Confronts New Uncertainty

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Latin America's currency and bond markets came under pressure today as worries over the possibility of default by Ecuador, one of the smaller Latin countries, collided with concern that political gridlock would slow the region's juggernaut, Brazil.
Ecuadorean officials assured investors that the Government would not default on a $93.5 million bond payment later this month, but markets were skeptical. Ecuadorean bonds plunged more than 11 percent on speculation about a default. 
 An Ecuadorean default would be the first on Brady bonds, the repackaged securities designed by the former United States Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, which helped Latin America emerge from a debt crisis in the 1980's.
Brazilian markets, which often come under selling pressure when troubles emerge in Latin America, showed unusual signs of strain. Brazil's currency, the real, weakened nearly 3 percent. It fell almost 2 reais to the dollar, its lowest value in five months, before rebounding to 1.89 on news that the Government sold six-month dollar-linked bonds, offering investors protection against further falls in the currency. In New York, the real settled at 1.99 to the dollar, down from 1.94 on Thursday.
Brazilian bonds were mixed. A basket of Brazil's dollar debt lost as much as nine-tenths of a percent, according to J. P. Morgan & Company. The widely traded "C" bond gained as much as nine-tenths of a percent, to 58.813, with the yield narrowing to 16.970 percent.
In neighboring Argentina, where the economy has been hurt by a drop in commerce with Brazil, rising borrowing costs added to concern about other countries in the region. Moody's Investors Service placed the nation's credit ratings on review for possible downgrade today, a move that led Argentine bonds to fall in tandem with the debt of other Latin American countries.
Ecuador, which in population and economic might is substantially smaller than Brazil or Argentina, accounts for just a sliver of investors' holdings of Latin American securities. Yet the psychological effect of a rapidly deteriorating economy there, and of concern that neighboring countries could be influenced if it defaults, has led to a fresh assessment of risk throughout the region.
"The potential for contamination is there," said Arturo Porzecanski, the chief economist for the Americas at ING Barings. "Just like Russia showed the world a former superpower could default, Ecuador could show its neighbors that avoiding a moratorium is not sacred."
As problems in Ecuador prompted some investors to trim their exposure to Brazil, growing concern over the ability of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration to control spending led to additional anxiety. There have been several examples in recent days of pressure on Government finances.
This week, thousands of farmers marched on Brazil's capital city, Brasilia, to call for a reworking of about 11 billion reais, or $5.7 billion, in debt owed to state-controlled financial institutions. Although Mr. Cardoso refused to accede to their demands, Congress overwhelmingly showed support for the farmers. And it is in Congress that the President hopes to win approval for austerity measures to prevent a worsening of the budget deficit.
At the same time, members of Congress began considering raising their own pay. If the raises are approved, cries for similar pay increases could cascade throughout the civil service. Worries that the central Government may assume some debt obligations of state administrations contributed to the gloom over its effectiveness in dealing with these challenges.
"Brazil did a very good job handling the economy in the first half of the year, but the challenge now is political rather than economic," said Carlos Novis Guimaraes, the head of investment banking for Latin America at Lehman Brothers.
Some indicators show an improvement in the economy, among them rising direct foreign investment, which climbed 64 percent, to $17.1 billion, in the first half of this year. Such inflows of long-term capital helped fuel the second consecutive quarter of economic growth.
Yet concern over the deficit or over problems in neighboring countries could keep the central bank from lowering interest rates, now at 19.5 percent. That possibility adds to anxiety over the effect that such rates have on public finances, because the Government needs to pay higher premiums on its bonds to attract investors.
"Latin America is hurt by these momentary spikes of concern," said Thomas Trebat, an economist with Salomon Smith Barney. "But really, what we see after taking a deep breath is a region that's lagging the rest of the world into recovery. Problems that put a chill on capital flows now will be forgotten by next year."

Japan Merger Of Three Banks Signals a Trend

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Japan signaled the start of a far-reaching consolidation of its bloated and debt-ridden banking system today with official word that three of the country's biggest banks would unite to form the world's largest financial institution.
The merger agreement announced by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. and Fuji Bank Ltd. was viewed by economists and investors as a significant change, but not because of the combination's colossal size. Rather, they said it would hasten mergers among other Japanese banks, winnowing the weakest and helping to reduce what has been one of the biggest drags on the Japanese economy. 
 While executives of the three Japanese merger partners said they were determined to become a global force, American and European banks saw little competitive threat from the combination, nor did they see it as an obstacle to a push by foreign banks to enter Japan's market. Page C2.
Banks in Japan have suffered from years of bad loans, low profits and antiquated technology despite numerous Government efforts to strengthen the system. Many continue to lose money or are marginally profitable but there has been little pressure on them to find partners. Analysts said the three-way tie-up announced today, which was strongly endorsed by Government officials, suggested that era was over.
"Size of course is not everything, but this does show a major change in the mindset of Japanese bank management," said J. Brian Waterhouse, an analyst for HSBC James Capel. "Up until this year, Japanese banks were determined to be independent, and suddenly we have three major banks getting together."
The announcement caused a surge in bank shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, as investors bet that the 18 major Japanese banks would eventually fall to fewer than half that number and make the survivors far more profitable simply by reducing the number of competitors.
The three-way alliance, which the partners hope to formally establish by the fall of 2000, would create a giant with $1.3 trillion in assets, the benchmark for measuring a bank's size.
It would dwarf the current world leader, Deutsche Bank, which has $866 billion in assets, as well as the biggest bank in the United States, Citigroup, which has $668 billion. The bank would be twice the size of what is now the largest bank in Japan, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which has about $580 billion in assets.
"Although we will be the world's top bank in terms of assets, we will not remain content just at that," Masao Nishimura, Industrial Bank's chief executive, told a news conference. "We aim to be among the world's top five banks in terms of capital, profits, services and other areas."
The union of three major Japanese banks comes at a time when there have been signs of a revival in the Japanese economy, which has been experiencing the worst recession since World War II. The yen, the most visible symbol of the country's economic might, has risen to the strongest levels in seven months. Japan's stock market has soared this year on a bet by many international investors that the country may finally be turning around.
The banking merger in Japan also comes against a backdrop of consolidation among the biggest banks elsewhere. Deutsche Bank recently acquired the Bankers Trust Corporation of the United States; Citicorp and Travelers Inc. merged in the United States; UBS was created through the combination of Switzerland's two biggest banks, and Banque Nationale de Paris is acquiring control of a rival, Paribas.
Under the Japanese merger deal, the three partners will put their retail banking, investment banking, and brokerage subsidiaries under common management and cut costs by combining overlapping businesses. The banks said that by uniting, they also expected to save on the huge costs of installing new information technology.
The banks said that once the merger becomes complete they plan to eliminate 6,000 jobs, reducing the entire work force to about 29,000 people, and cut the total number of branches from the current 704 to 620.
Some analysts said that the employee reductions did not go far enough and reflected what they called a resistance on the part of Japanese banks to shed one of the biggest drains on profitability, a bloated work force.
"Despite their size, I'm rather skeptical that they can compete on an international scale unless they undertake some serious restructuring," said Toru Nakakita, a professor of economics at Toyo University. "I hate to say this but I think we've created another Titanic: we have the biggest bank in the world but it's certainly not the most competitive."
Others said that unless such mergers make banks more profitable, they would not help the banks absorb the hundreds of billions of dollars in bad debts that still litter their books. The Government has sought to help by cutting interest rates to nearly zero, which lowers the cost of borrowing for the banks, and has injected money into the largest banks to strengthen them. But many of these old debts, vestiges of loans made during the speculative real estate boom in the 1980's, will never be repaid.
"It's evident that this Government is better at reforming the banking system than previous governments," said Mary Davis, chief economist for emerging markets in Asia at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. If such mergers strengthen the banks she said, "it could be a significant development, but they've had this enormous bad-debt problem which they have just begun to address and there's so much more to do."
Despite the size of the three-way merger, industry officials and analysts said today that they doubted Japanese regulators would challenge it as anticompetitive.
"Regulators think that there are too many banks in Japan, so merging banks makes it easier to improve profits," said Yoshinobu Yamada, an analyst for Merrill Lynch. "I'd be surprised if the Government tries to block this."
Indeed, Hakuo Yanagisawa, chairman of the Financial Reconstruction Commission, Japan's regulatory body, said: "We sincerely welcome the move, which meets expectations for creating a top-notch institution from Japan that can withstand stiff international competition."
The shares of all three banks, which rose Thursday on news that they were in talks, surged today on the announcement of a deal. Shares of Dai-Ichi Kangyo gained 11 percent, Fuji rose 9.4 percent and Industrial Bank of Japan was up 10.2 percent. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's bank index, a measure of bank stocks, rose 10.2 percent.
The three banks are among 15 major Japanese banks that received 7.5 trillion yen (about $675 billion) in public funds from the Government to help resolve their huge loan problems.
In exchange for the cash infusion, the banks agreed to revamp their operations and become more profitable. The banks are now under pressure to make good on those promises.
Officials of the three banks that plan to unite said today that they would concentrate investment in computer systems for payment settlements, management of data bases, credit risk assessments and other electronic banking operations.
Most Japanese banks are far behind their foreign competitors in the use of computer systems.
Under the agreement, the three banks will jointly establish a holding company by the fall of 2000. Bank operations will be gradually integrated into the holding company over two years.
Individual shares of the three banks will be exchanged for a new share in the holding company, which will be listed on stock exchanges after the three banks exit the exchanges, the banks said.
Two other major Japanese banks confirmed today their intention to combine operations under a similar holding company arrangement, which could also lead to a merger.
In response to inquiries from local reporters, a spokesman for Tokai Bank Ltd. and Asahi Bank Ltd. said that the two institutions planned to establish a joint holding company in the year 2001. The banks originally announced their intention to form a link last September.
The combined assets of the two banks are about $531 billion, which would make the new entity Japan's second-largest bank and the seventh largest worldwide.
"It's not scale that we are aiming for in this union," said Tsuyoshi Yamashita, a spokesman for Tokei Bank.
"We are investing in our ability to offer customers a wider range of products. For example, it's too costly for us to do investment banking alone, so we are seeking mutual effectiveness with our merger."

The United States Fish and Wildlife Service now estimates that more than 1,650 breeding pairs live in North America. Experts say about 6,000 of the birds, raised in private and government centers, have been released into the wild. Falcons can reach speeds of 200 miles an hour as they swoop down on their prey, which include ducks and pigeons. (AP)

Solidarity and the Price of Apricots

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Sometimes the French really do seem to think differently.
In the country that Descartes imprinted with Cartesian logic, people side with transit workers when bus, rail and subway strikes make it impossible to get to work on time. 
 Drivers entering traffic at many intersections don't even cast a glance at cars approaching from their left. By the logic of French traffic rules, traffic from the right has priority and an accident would therefore, a priori, be illogical.
And because paid vacations have been a right only since the 1930's, and are a scrupulously observed August rite now, Paris shuts down at the height of summer, leaving hordes of tourists to fend for themselves. Therefore, the most celebrated ice cream parlor in town, La Glacerie Berthillon on the Ile Saint-Louis, is closed for vacation until Sept. 1.
And logically, at the height of the summer fruit and vegetable season, prices should be lower. But by a logic perhaps only the French can understand, fruit and vegetable producers are hoping that a new Government regulation requiring retail stores to post the wholesale prices they paid for the produce alongside the retail price -- which is always much higher -- will pressure wholesalers to pay the producers more.
What would American consumers do on learning that the price they pay for apricots at the supermarket, the equivalent of $1.48 a pound at the G20 supermarket in Paris this week, cost the store 70 cents or less at the wholesale market? Ask the store to pay more for the fruit wholesale, or to charge customers less?
"You're thinking capitalistically," a Frenchman who understands Americans well, Prof. Patrice Higonnet of Harvard University, explained to an American in Paris. "This is French republican thinking."
By Gallic logic, French consumers seeing the wholesale and retail prices on the shelves will side with underdog farmers, just as they do with underdog railway workers, and show their solidarity by pressuring wholesale distributors to be fairer to producers, explained one farmer, Guy Savanier, from his apricot orchard and vineyard near Nimes.
"The consumer will know that every product with two prices listed is a product in difficulty," Mr. Savanier said. "We hope they will buy more, which will increase demand and raise prices."
That sounded like economic logic, but Mr. Savanier hoped there would be something more. "We also expect a civic attitude by distributors, in the sense that they will accept a more equitable sharing of profit margins," he said.
Ergo, French supermarkets, the villains in Mr. Savanier's eyes, will pay producers more for French fruit and vegetables, but not raise supermarket retail prices. "We don't want consumers to pay more," he said.
Last Saturday, 200 farmers blocked the center of the historic Rhone River city of Avignon with 2,500 shopping carts to protest falling prices. The day before, the Minister of Agriculture, Jean Glavany, posted an order requiring supermarkets to list both wholesale and retail prices for peaches, nectarines, apricots, melons and pears for a month, for grapes and apples for two months, and for tomatoes and cucumbers for three months.
"We're not naive," Mr. Savanier said. "We'll see what happens and decide what to do then."
Nothing will happen, Christian de Boissieu, an economics professor at the Sorbonne, told the daily Figaro on Monday.
"The producers are counting on consumers to put pressure on distributors," he said. "But even if this solidarity mechanism comes into play, it has no way of influencing the prices paid to producers, which depend on many other factors like handling and transportation costs, without mentioning phenomena like overproduction.
"It's hard to imagine the consumer writing letters to supermarket managers accusing them of pocketing scandalous profit margins."
Chouki Abebessa, who runs a vegetable store on Rue de la Pompe in Paris, agreed. "Consumers know there's a markup, and if the quality is good enough, they're willing to pay for it," he said. "Telling them what the supermarket paid won't change anything."
Michel-Edouard Leclerc, the head of a chain of supermarkets that bears his name, called the new regulation "a political solution responding to a demand by agricultural unions that won't make prices rise."
He told the daily Liberation that when supermarkets eventually posted wholesale prices, they would be national averages provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, not the actual prices supermarkets negotiate with producers' cooperatives, which are jealously guarded trade secrets.
Mr. Savanier said heavy spring frosts last year cost him most of his grape crop, and now bumper fruit crops were making him sell at a loss.
"I got as little as 3 to 3.50 francs a kilogram for apricots this year," he said, the equivalent of about 25 cents a pound for the fruit that G20 was getting $1.48 for today. "The average loss for medium-size orchards around here this year has been 500,000 to 700,000 francs," he said, roughly $83,000 to $116,000.

AGAINST THE TIDE
 The Fate of the New England
 Fisherman.
 By Richard Adams Carey.
 379 pp. Boston:
 Houghton Mifflin Company. $23. 
 Franklin Russell, whose 1965 book, "The Secret Islands," describes the life of Newfoundland fishermen, once expressed a rather fatalistic view of human nature. He suggested that modern neurosis stems from the fact that our psyches were fashioned in a world of constant danger and struggle with the elements and other animals while throughout our history we have tried to escape danger and hardship with the artifacts of civilization. Russell maintained that we may be evolutionarily programmed so that only in primal struggle are we genuinely happy. In other words, we are either neurotic and safe, or sane and at risk.
This paradox may help to explain our ambivalent attitude toward those who still go down to the sea in small ships. We admire, and even envy, what we see as the freedom and adventurous life of fishermen, even while we suspect that they are at bottom impractical and irresponsible fellows, deliberately clinging to a dangerous and obsolescent trade whose apparent demise has probably been brought about through their own greed.
Richard Adams Carey, whose first book, "Raven's Children: An Alaskan Culture at Twilight," examined another group seemingly on its way to extinction, decided to ferret out the real story and the real people behind the crisis in the New England groundfish industry. Carey spent the 1995-96 fishing season at the elbow of Cape Cod with four fishermen from Orleans, each involved in different aspects of the local fishery. He documented their encounters not only "with the winds and tides that toyed with those boats, but also with the currents of history and the squalls of politics and economics that were as inescapable for these men as weather systems." The result, "Against the Tide: The Fate of the New England Fisherman," is deep ecological journalism at its best, an effective and compassionate chronicle of a threatened way of life, and a worthy successor to such classic portraits of American fishermen as William W. Warner's "Beautiful Swimmers" and Peter Matthiessen's "Men's Lives."
"Against the Tide" contains, among other things, an impressive amount of natural and local history of Cape Cod. For this Carey credits the rich literature of the Cape, sprinkling his text liberally with quotations from the classics of Thoreau, Henry Beston and John Hay, among others. But he himself can wax lyrical with the best of them, as in this passage describing cod coming in on hooked lines:
"Out of a void, out of a medium at once as clear as glass and as black as pitch and without length or depth, the cod came as if summoned from nothingness: a white dwarf star elongating into a comet and then taking on color, becoming instead a golden ingot, and then assuming motion and capacity and animate spirit. It was Midas in reverse, watching that gold become flesh, or something in between, actually, a third state combining the graces of both. The cod rose goggle-eyed into the air, their gills intoxicated with oxygen, their orbs drowning in light."
Carey's four fishermen emerge as both representative of their various occupations and as fully realized individuals. There is Carl Johnston, crewman and sometimes captain of a dragger out of Chatham, a survivor with "an amused and ironic perplexity at the orneriness of men and circumstance"; Dan Howes, the only native Cape Codder, a saturnine and bulldoggish man who lives in a world greatly circumscribed from that of his seagoing forebears, quahogging in Cape Cod Bay in a converted lobster boat appropriately named Last Resort; and Mike Russo, a likable young husband, father, irrepressible optimist and entrepreneur, who sets out to fish alone in the deep waters off the Atlantic shore, convinced that "everything . . . from the fall of the Roman Empire to his first cup of coffee that morning, has led inevitably to that point." With cheerful buoyancy he challenges the sea, until a day when the sea finally takes up that challenge.
But the dominant and most complex figure in the book is Brian Gibbons, a jazz-loving, irreverent, sardonic, self-educated, self-mocking, philosopher-lobsterman who quotes Norse myths, Roman statesmen, St. Paul and "The Brothers Karamazov" to express the dreams and dilemmas of all small-boat fishermen. If Mike represents the American entrepreneurial dream, Brian, Carey says, represents Jefferson's democratic vision of "an American yeoman husbandry . . . men who make a living, if not on their own small farms, then on their own small ships," independent and integrated into "a community life, finally, defined by relatives and neighbors, associations and clubs, congregations and guilds, rather than anonymous buyers and sellers." It is a vision that has been eroded, not merely by the collapse of the North Atlantic groundfish stocks, but, ironically, by regulations and programs intended to preserve that fishery.
For nearly a generation now, all America fishermen have lived beneath the umbrella, or the shadow, of the watershed Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976, which extended American sovereignty to 200 miles offshore, past the cod-rich Georges Bank. Initially seen by the fishermen as a declaration of independence from foreign factory trawler fleets and a surety for protecting the vital New England cod fishery, its legacy has been neither freedom nor protection. It has created not only endless regulatory shoals and Sargasso Seas of paperwork, as fish landings dropped drastically since the early 1990's, but also ever-smaller quotas and more restricted fishing areas and permits have been put in place.
According to Carey, the promise of the Magnuson act was fatally flawed from its conception. It sought to preserve the fishery stocks, but also to encourage technical efficiency and market demand. The result, as the former Massachusetts Congressman Gerry Studds succinctly put it, "has been a paralyzed system of fisheries management that represents everyone's perceived immediate interests faithfully, the fundamental interests not at all." New England's share of world fish markets in the 1970's was greater than 20 percent. It was one-tenth of that by the mid-1990's.
These dismal statistics have been reported elsewhere. Carey goes beyond them, insisting on a recognition of the "ruin and human costs" that lie behind the scientific reports and the political jargon of "efficiency," "consolidation" and "retraining options" that camouflage the real plight of fishermen and their families.
Despite its detailed (sometimes too detailed) and depressing history of the "slow and incremental downward spiral" of the New England fishery, "Against the Tide" is at its heart a celebration and testimonial to the grit, stubbornness, intelligence, adaptability, saving sense of humor and that inextricable combination of "love or desperation" that drives these small-boat fishermen to cling to their ancient craft.
The sea is magisterial and unforgiving, but it confers majesty and grace on those who struggle to wrest a living from it. Perhaps that is why we are loath to lose these men. They remain a part of our fundamental identity, express our deepest imperatives, if only vicariously. As Carey eloquently puts it: "A fisherman lives each day engaged with every elemental nuance of his territory, immersed in both the physics and the metaphysics of life and death, shot through with the adrenaline surge of living so near to the razor edge of mortality. He comes to personify, finally, elements of our spiritual commons. If he experiences things that most of us can no longer experience, then merely the assurance of those experiences in some men's lives -- like innocence, perhaps, or sainthood -- enlarges the boundaries of the commons."

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
A Maine Summer Yields Bargains And L. L. Bean

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
TRAVEL to a popular destination during the middle of summer high season? The very thought is enough to send a cost-conscious traveler fleeing to the couch with a box of chocolates, a heap of videos and the air-conditioner on max.
In high season, bargains dry up and hotel rooms become as hotly contested as parking spaces in Manhattan. Reservation clerks dust off that once-a-year grin, the one that says: "Discount? You must be kidding, sweetheart, I've got 10 people lined up for your single without bath." 
 But I had a seminar to attend in Maine the last week of July. I'd never been to the state and wanted to take a few days to explore after my classes ended. I figured that with a little legwork I could come up with a plan that would let me sample the Maine summer affordably without pitching a tent.
Since I was flying into Portland (I booked a round-trip ticket between Newark and Portland two months in advance for $179 on Continental's Web site), I decided to spend a four-day weekend there, rather than try to finagle a cheapie in a heavily booked resort town like Kennebunkport or Bar Harbor. I'd heard that Portland had blossomed into a livable, low-key city, an East Coast version of Seattle before the boom. It reportedly had a burgeoning restaurant scene and a lively, restored old neighborhood by the water.
As feared, hotel rooms were at a premium in Portland, but not just because of high season. Portland lost quite a few hotel rooms during urban renewal in the 1960's and 70's, and never rebuilt, so demand now outstrips supply. Even the local branches of budget chains, like the Susse Chalet, quoted me a rate of just under $100 for a single (and they didn't have space for me anyway, as it turned out). There were better deals if I wanted to stay in South Portland, or off the Interstate, but I wanted access to the walkable central city.
So I worked my way through a list of lodgings in guidebooks and in the tourist magazine published by the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Greater Portland and came up with two alternatives. The Inn at St. John, a small hotel about a half mile from Portland's museums and its shopping and restaurant district, had a single without bath available for $65 on Saturday night, and a single with bath available on Sunday for $85. I booked both, and then arranged to stay the following two nights at a hostel operated in summer by American Youth Hostels in a dormitory of the University of Southern Maine. I could get a private room with bath there for only $51, and the dorm was right downtown. While I'm usually wary of hostel stays, this seemed like one of the only inexpensive rooms to be had in Portland in July.
I arrived late Saturday afternoon at the Inn at St. John to encouraging signs: candy on my pillow, a crystal chandelier glittering from the ceiling and a warm welcome from the desk clerk, who provided travel leaflets and a downtown map. Portland is an easy town to figure out -- it is on a mile-wide peninsula that juts into Casco Bay, and the principal streets run parallel to the harbor.
After settling in I left my rental car in the inn's lot and headed downtown on foot.
In the first 10 minutes, I discovered the disadvantage of staying at the otherwise pleasant and well-priced inn: to get downtown, one passes through a dicey neighborhood of row houses frequented by vagrants, one of whom followed me for several blocks whining for money. I decided I didn't want to walk this stretch of town alone after dark.
I passed through a few small squares, spotting the large, square hulk of the Portland Museum of Art, designed by I. M. Pei Partners, and some interesting-looking restaurants. I turned right and descended a slope, following the signs for "Old Port," and soon found myself walking over cobblestone streets, among 19th-century brick buildings. The air was moist, thick with salt and fishy smells. I walked in the direction of the breeze, figuring that at any minute the buildings would break open to reveal a magnificent view of sea and harbor.
Finally, I headed down what appeared to be an alley that led onto a rickety pier strewn with lobster traps and assorted wooden boxes. Boats of all sizes clustered around the edges of the pier, and wizened fishermen in rubber aprons ignored my gaping. The Atlantic Ocean was out there, beyond the boats, but it was a rough, industrial Atlantic, not a vista you'd want to put on a postcard. Portland's harbor isn't a theme park but a working harbor -- the fish, and the fishermen, are the real deal.
This impressed me. I hung out on the Custom House Pier for a while, watching people as they swung open the wooden screen door leading into the Harbor Fish Market, to emerge later with huge cardboard boxes filled with lobsters. Across the way was a Hopper-esque diner called the Porthole, where I had a cup of coffee in the back, at a picnic table on the pier. Fat gulls landed on the planks and hooted; a chilly fog rolled in, and there wasn't a tourist in sight. On the television came the news of sweltering temperatures in New York; I ordered another cup of coffee and snuggled smugly into my polar fleece pullover.
I skipped the free coffee and pastries at the inn the next morning and took my Sunday brunch on the pier at the Porthole ($4.98 for a well-turned-out diner-style cheese omelet, toast and coffee). Afterward, I strolled Commercial Street, the avenue that runs along the docks, taking in the morning scene. Dog lovers, take note: Portland is home to a huge number of some of the most gorgeous big dogs I've ever seen in one place. The brunchtime promenade included Samoyeds, wolf hounds, huskies and retrievers of various hues, parading proudly alongside their coffee- and newspaper-carrying owners.
Greater Portland Landmarks, a preservation society, runs a walking tour of the city every morning that costs $8. I turned up at 10:30 and found, to my surprise, that I was the only taker that Sunday morning. I had a volunteer guide all to myself, a delightful and energetic fellow named Everett Perlman. He traced Portland's urban history by pointing out such details as the iron pier hooks still dangling from buildings now several blocks from the ocean (Portland's waterfront used to reach farther into the city; engineers pushed it back over the decades). Most of the building cornerstones in the Old Port area dated from around 1866, the year a whirlwind fire razed the city. Portland literally was rebuilt from the ground up, and that's why the Old Port neighborhood by the waterfront has such a uniform look -- and also why the motto on Portland's coat of arms says "Resurgam" ("I Shall Rise Again").
Mr. Perlman guided me through Portland's commercial streets of Beaux Arts buildings, and along its avenues of Victorian mansions. Just when we had walked what seemed like several miles and I was wilting, he steered me into Portland's newest attraction -- the Portland Public Market, with dozens of food purveyors at booths housed in a sleek, large structure of glass and brick. Mr. Perlman maneuvered his way skillfully through the aisles to the booths that were offering free samples of blueberry bread (scrumptious), elk meat (hearty tasting) and, finally, cheesecake.
"Izzy's cheesecake is the best in Portland," he said, but quickly cautioned me that, as a New Yorker, I might have "issues." And I did: it had a good flavor, not too sweet, but it was overly creamy.
Portlanders like their cream. The famed clam chowder at Gilbert's restaurant on the waterfront arrived at the table so thick that I swore I could have turned it out of the cup like Jell-O from a mold.
That's the old-fashioned side of Portland cuisine; the more contemporary restaurants, like David's, take standards like crab cakes and rework them into delicate, light meditations on the classic theme. My endive salad, appetizer and char-grilled salmon betrayed an intelligent hand in the kitchen, of the sort that you find at the better New York restaurants, for half as much as in New York. (My David's dinner cost around $30, with two glasses of wine.) And the fish is at least a few hours fresher.
Mr. Perlman left me with a free pass to the Museum of Art (worth $6), which I used that afternoon, wandering contentedly among a good collection of French Impressionists and American landscape painters made even more attractive by the clear Maine light in the galleries (and the absence of crowds, even on a Sunday afternoon). I thought about seeing a film that evening (downtown features are only $5), but decided to call it an early night.
I got up very early the next morning, packed and put the car into a public lot, since I was moving to my hostel room and it wouldn't be ready until 5 P.M. Then I walked down to the municipal pier and hopped a ferry to Diamond Cove, one of more than 300 islands that dot Casco Bay. Cruising the bay, and these islands, is as essential a Portland experience as taking a ferry in San Francisco. Many of the islands fall within the city limits, and lots of Portlanders are making their homes on them, commuting by boat.
It was a gray day, with thick, swirling fog, but the passage out to Diamond was smooth -- and cheap, at $7.10 round trip for the 45-minute ride. I got off at Diamond Cove and took a quick tour of the area, which once was an Army outpost and has been converted to private condominiums.
RETURNING to the dock, I found out I could take the next boat to nearby Long Island at no extra charge, and so I did, and spent another hour walking through a summer community of neat cottages and quirky gardens that led to a long, deserted white-dune beach that felt miles from nowhere.
I figured this cruise was the big adventure of my trip, but I had another one coming.
I hadn't expected the hostel room to be the Ritz, but I surely hadn't counted on a shag rug so thick with litter it looked as if someone had overturned a trash can and run. There was a dorm-style single bed, a bathroom more grungy than anything I'd had to use in India, and no sheets -- "Coming later," said the harried student in charge of hosteling.
It was too late to find another room for the night, so I tried to make the best of it, and sought out a vacuum cleaner. The hostel rep found one, and I lugged it all the way from the front desk, down several long corridors. I plugged it in. It made noise, but didn't pick up anything.
I returned it to the front desk. A change of scene was called for, so I got into my car and drove across the bridge that separates Portland from South Portland, continuing to the Portland Head Light. There I sat on a rock and watched as the sun set, sending shimmering pastel colors through the mist. The lighthouse tower blinked on and off with a comforting regularity, and I could hear foghorns in the distance. It seemed they were calling to me, sending an irresistible song: "Freeport . . . Shopping Outlets . . . Go!"
The Greater Portland Visitor's Guide had a long list of bed-and-breakfasts in Freeport, 20 minutes from Portland. The first place I called offered me a room with bath for $75 a night -- unlike in Portland, accommodations were plentiful, and less expensive. The next morning I quit the hostel and drove north. My pretty Colonial-style room at the Captain Briggs House Inn bed-and-breakfast turned out to be spotless.
Freeport's milelong Main Street, filled with outlet stores, held bargains the likes of which I hadn't seen since Bangkok. In a few hours, I'd saved enough on half-price polo shirts at Ralph Lauren, quick-dry hiking trousers at Patagonia, makeup at Clinique and umbrellas at Totes to pay my hotel bill. At midnight, I visited Freeport's most famous after-hours club, wandering the aisles of L. L. Bean (open 24 hours) trying on camouflage gear and turkey-shoot vests, checking out the latest polar-fleece parkas.
Yes, Freeport was chockablock with tourist buses. The food I tried was awful. There were no fishermen, no docks, no lobsters (unless you count plastic refrigerator magnets) and no trace of an ocean smell. Forced to choose, I'd pick Portland's real-life riches over Freeport's shopper's paradise. But I was happy to have washed up in a safe harbor, where the sheets were clean and the discounts deep.
 
The bottom line in Maine
I averaged $111.37 a day for hotel, meals and activities during my four days in Portland and Freeport, Me.
 
Transportation
I booked a round-trip fare between Newark and Portland for $179, including taxes, on Continental's Web site www.continental.com.
Hurley Travel Service in Portland, (800) 874-1743, found me a discounted rate of $26.44 a day plus tax for an economy car with unlimited mileage from Alamo at the Portland airport.
 
Lodging
The Inn at St. John, 939 Congress Street, Portland, (207) 773-6481, is comfortable, and a good value at $65 for single with shared bath, $85 with bath, plus 7 percent tax. It is furnished in a pleasant Victorian style with ruffled curtains and brass fixtures. The more costly room, well worth $20 extra, was much larger and nicer than the one without bath.
The Portland Summer Hostel, 645 Congress Street, (207) 874-3281, looked attractive on paper: a private room with bath for $51, with tax, in a well-situated dormitory of the University of Southern Maine. But maintenance of the facilities is lackadaisical, and the mattress of the old dorm bed in my grungy room sagged like a hammock.
Captain Briggs House Inn (formerly the Bayberry Inn), 8 Maple Avenue, Freeport, telephone and fax (207) 865-1868, is spotless and cheery. My room on the first floor of this beautifully restored 1853 house had gorgeous original hardwood floors, two sunny windows, a double and a twin bed and a private bath, all for $75, including full breakfast.
 
Dining
My dinner at David's Creative Cuisine, 22 Monument Square, (207) 773-4340, was a bright spot in my stay in Portland, from the endive and ripe tomato salad, with its topping of guacamole and blue cheese, to the perfectly grilled fresh salmon entree. With two glasses of an excellent California sauvignon blanc, dinner came to around $30.
The Porthole, 20 Custom House Wharf, (207) 761-7634, pulls you in with its atmosphere. The facade, on an old fishing dock, looks like a Hopper painting; the food, diner comfort fare and American breakfast standards, is good and hearty. My breakfast of eggs, toast, juice and coffee cost $4.98.
Gilbert's Chowder House, 92 Commercial Street, (207) 871-5636, a long-time waterfront establishment, serves the New England basics: fried fresh fish and impossibly thick and creamy clam chowder, distinctively flavored with a hint of bacon.
The Portland Public Market, Cumberland Avenue between Elm and Preble Streets, (207) 228-2000, is a great place to sample the city's specialty foods. Bakers, butchers and fishmongers display their wares, and sometimes offer free samples.
 
Activities
My walking tour with Everett Perlman, a volunteer guide with Greater Portland Landmarks, (207) 774-5561, revealed Portland's fascinating history and architecture. The tours, with various guides, begin mornings at 10:30 at the Portland visitors bureau at 305 Commercial Street, (207) 772-4994.
The Portland Museum of Art, 7 Congress Square, (207) 775-6148, contains a fair number of fine Impressionist works and lots of Maine landscapes by Homer and Wyeth. Admission is $6, seniors and students $5.
My ferry trip on Casco Bay was $7.10 round trip between the Ferry Terminal in Portland and Diamond Cove. Casco Bay Lines ferries, (207) 774-7871, run frequently during the day to various islands; it also offers tour cruises at slightly higher prices.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Brief Fare Deals Doing an Encore

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
SOME air fares for fall and winter, and a few Mediterranean cruise prices, are making Europe seem nearly irresistible. The low air fares were presented as short term earlier in the summer, but industry officials said that an oversupply of flights to Europe had developed with the delivery of new planes, and the airlines began gradually backing away from higher prices to try to fill the seats.
Competition is bringing a bonanza for travelers. Northwest was first with the fare cuts, but others have followed. As seats fill, of course, the good buys will fade away. But not many have so far. 
 Likewise, the cruise specials were sometimes described as an effort to recover from the period of the Kosovo bombardment, when many Adriatic itineraries were changed. But various circumstances, including itinerary changes caused by the late delivery of new vessels, have created the cruise bargains.
One example of an excellent price is Swissair's Newark-Basel round-trip economy fare of $330, plus taxes, a promotion to introduce its new A-330 Airbuses on the daily service, which has been operating for a year or so. This fare will be sold at least until Friday, with travel possible until Dec. 15. The new planes have 224 seats, with 166 in economy class; the route to Basel, a pharmaceutical center, is heavily used by business travelers. Swissair: (800) 221-4750.
Here is a small selection of some other good buys running into the fall. These are available from travel agents, the airlines or on the Web. The prices do not include departure taxes or Customs fees.
 
Discounts on Flights
American Airlines had a fistful of choices. Many of these fares for midweek travel were originally due to expire 10 days ago, but continue to be available until Aug. 31 -- and that deadline is not immutable, either. Those looking for even lower rates can buy them now for travel in November and December, but blackouts apply to the holidays. These are all seven-day advance-purchase fares. Tim Smith, a spokesman for American, said that the seats available for these prices were limited, but that many flights in the winter showed wide availability. Weekend flights, which are $50 more round trip, fill up faster than midweek ones.
On American, a New York-to-Frankfurt economy ticket is $588 for midweek travel, $638 otherwise. For travel from November to mid-March, with a holiday blackout, fares are $330 and $380.
Boston-London (Heathrow) economy round-trip fares for travel on American into October are $448 to $498, depending on the day of the week. For later travel, holidays excluded, Bostonians who want to swap their dark city for a dark city on the Thames can do it for $318 to $368. Nonstop flights from Dallas-Fort Worth, American's headquarters, to London go into Gatwick: these fares are $588 and $638 until October, $428 and $478 after that.
New York to Paris until October is $458 and $508; for November, these are $368 and $418.
Continental has a new route from Cleveland to London (Gatwick). Until Aug. 31, round-trip tickets for midweek travel between Sept. 5 and Oct. 30 cost $588. For travel from Oct. 31 to March 31, with a blackout from Dec. 17 to Jan. 2, midweek round trips drop to $428. Also on Continental, midweek travel between Newark and Paris in September and October is $458. For November, it is $368.
British Airways put some promotional fares on the market Aug. 10, with the last purchase date Aug. 31. All of the line's 22 United States cities were involved. Jill Donaldson, vice president for leisure marketing, said that the best buys involved New York departures. To London (Heathrow), the midweek fares begin at $448; to Paris, $458; to Rome, $588.
Midweek fares from Los Angeles or San Francisco to London begin at $638. From Chicago, the midweek fare is $558. Dallas-Fort Worth to London is $588, and Atlanta-London, $608. Travel on these fares is possible between Sept. 5 and Oct. 30.
It is likely that any other airline flying the routes mentioned above is offering similar prices. Ask.
An airline new to the United States, AirEurope, is offering flights between Kennedy Airport in New York and Venice, with a continuation to Pisa. To announce itself, it is offering $425 round-trip fares for travel until the end of September. The price is available until Aug. 30. The line was having some ticketing difficulties at first and apparently could not process credit card sales at Kennedy, only cash. There is a long wait on the line's number: (888) 999-9090.
 
Savings at Sea
On the Mediterranean cruise front, Holland America made schedule changes because delivery of its new vessel, the Volendam, was delayed. As a result, a 12-night cruise on the Rotterdam from Venice to Istanbul on Sept. 22 is being deeply discounted. Stewart T. Chiron of the Cruise Line, a big agency in North Miami Beach, is offering this cruise for $2,399 a person, including port charges and air fare from New York and other United States and Canadian cities, based on double occupancy in an inside cabin. The least expensive outside cabin is $2,899. The ship visits Romania and Greece before reaching Turkey. These prices were $1,500 higher when they were first posted.
Another value Mr. Chiron cited in the European cruises was a 12-night trip aboard the Norwegian Dream of Norwegian Cruise Line that leaves Istanbul Oct. 23 and ends in Civitavecchia, the port for Rome, on Nov. 4. This cruise is also sold with air fare from the East Coast to Istanbul and home from Rome. Prices per person, based on two people in an inside cabin, start at $2,652. These prices were formerly $2,600 higher. In addition to Turkey and Italy, this cruise stops in Israel, Egypt and Greece. Mr. Chiron said the Norwegian Dream was shifted from the Black Sea to this Holy Land itinerary because the line found two similar cruises were selling well. The Cruise Line: (800) 244-7447.
There are pluses and minuses to prices that include air fare. The flight may take a roundabout route. But if the flight was booked by the cruise line and is delayed, the line usually takes responsibility. On the other hand, if a cruise starts or ends in Venice, and the traveler wants to stay over, arranging the air trip separately can be an advantage. Travel agents can quote prices with and without the air fare. A 12-night Royal Caribbean Mediterranean cruise in Mr. Chiron's roster was $2,649 with air fare; $1,599 without.
 
Web Strategies
When competition drives down air fares, do Internet shoppers learn it quickly, or do they have to fill in the boxes for departure date and return date to get a picture? Suzi LeVine, a product manager for Microsoft Expedia, said clients did not have to fill in all the blanks.
Her company's home page at www.expedia.com posted a "big sale" notice on Aug. 3, with samples also on the front page. The page gave all the caveats, which at that point included an Aug. 13 closing date for the sale. A fare tracker, a service users can sign up for, will look for the best fare, she said.

HEADLINE: THE TROUBLED LIFE OF BOYS;
The Outsiders

BYLINE: By Adrian Nicole LeBlanc; Adrian Nicole LeBlanc is writing a book about inner-city girls, due out next year.

 BODY:
The fight takes place in the bright light of adult view -- on a weekday afternoon, on a tree-lined residential street, within sight of the police station and a block from the middle school. The smaller boy, about 12, waits until there is a safe distance between himself and the other boy, about 13. Then he sends a curse. It lands. He waits. No response. He follows with a homophobic slur. His opponent -- a chubby boy nicknamed Sex Machine -- finally turns around.
A freckled friend of Sex Machine's loops around him on his bicycle, lazily doing doughnuts. He prods Sex Machine chirpily: "You gonna take that? He's a punk!" Halfheartedly, Sex Machine blusters back a retort. More friends appear and cajole him, challenging him to at least pretend that he has nerve. 
 "C'mon, Sex Machine!" one shouts, then whispers to another, alarmed: "Look at him. He keeps backing up!"
Whatever started the fight is irrelevant. The friends clamber up a nearby wire fence to get a good view, hyper spiders clinging to the mesh.
Sex Machine is frightened. Despite his oversize T-shirt, you can see the rise and fall of his heaving chest. A man's voice chimes in and shouts encouragement to the smaller boy from the driveway.
"That's his father!" a boy says. "Can you believe it? He's telling him to fight!"
"That's not right," says a girl.
Borrowing from the man's confidence, the smaller boy rushes forward and swings. Sex Machine stumbles backward as he tries to duck. A woman leans out from the second-floor window of a ranch house and says, "Come in, come in," without sounding as though she means it, a weary Juliet.
Sex Machine looks desperate, flailing his arms frantically, trying to flag down a car. Luckily, one stops. Apparently, it's his mother. All the tension and fear that his body has been holding bursts into punctuated sobs. He storms around the car to the passenger side. His freckled friend, who had been cheering within inches of the action, cycles over and dismounts to say goodbye. With all the fury raging inside him, Sex Machine bellows, "You didn't help me!" then shoves him to the ground.
Antrim, New Hampshire, where the fight took place, is a long way away from Littleton, Colo., as well as from Conyers, Ga., where a 15-year-old boy shot six classmates at his high school in May. It is one of nine towns whose regional high school, ConVal, sits in Peterborough, N.H., the setting that inspired Thornton Wilder's "Our Town." But what it shares with those other places, and with countless others across the country, is a brutally enforced teen-age social structure.
Boys at the bottom of the pyramid use different strategies to cope -- turning inward and outward, sometimes in highly destructive ways. (There has been a fivefold jump in the homicide and suicide rates of boys in the last 40 years, a rise some experts attribute to increasing male depression and anger as well as access to guns, among other factors.) Most boys live through it, suffer, survive. But the journey may be especially deadly now because, as the avalanche of new "male identity" literature demonstrates, the old prescriptions for behavior no longer hold, and the new ones are ambivalent. Today's young males may be feminism's children, but no one is comfortable with openhearted or vulnerable boys.
ConVal is in some ways progressive. There are about 900 students and an administration that consciously works to minimize the ultramacho sports culture that dominates many schools. Says Bob Marshall, the head of the social studies department, who founded the football program in 1992: "We had to create a football culture. People didn't know when to cheer. We didn't even have a school song."
Even so, the traditional hierarchies operate: the popular kids tend to be wealthier and the boys among them tend to be jocks. The Gap Girls-Tommy Girls-Polo Girls compose the pool of desirable girlfriends, many of whom are athletes as well. Below the popular kids, in a shifting order of relative unimportance, are the druggies (stoners, deadheads, burnouts, hippies or neo-hippies), trendies or Valley Girls, preppies, skateboarders and skateboarder chicks, nerds and techies, wiggers, rednecks and Goths, better known as freaks. There are troublemakers, losers and floaters -- kids who move from group to group. Real losers are invisible.
Bullying, here as elsewhere, is rampant. Even in small-town, supposedly safe environments like Peterborough, a 1994 study found, the vast majority of kids from middle school up are bullied by their peers. The shaming is sex-based, but the taunting is more intense for boys -- an average high-school student, according to another study, hears 25 antigay slurs a day.
To be an outcast boy is to be a "nonboy," to be feminine, to be weak. Bullies function as a kind of peer police enforcing the social code, and ConVal's freaks are accustomed to the daily onslaught. The revenge-of-the-nerds refrain -- which assures unpopular boys that if they only hold on through high school, the roster of winners will change -- does not question the hierarchy that puts the outcasts at risk. So boys survive by their stamina, sometimes by their fists, but mainly, if they're lucky, with the help of the family they've created among their friends.
A good day for Andrew, 14, occurs when R., a boy who torments him, is absent from school, like when he was suspended for ripping the hearing aid out of another classmate's ear. R., 15, weighs more than 200 pounds. Andrew, a small boy with straight, dirty-blond hair and glasses, takes care to note R.'s better days -- say, when Andrew helps him with an assignment, when he's in a good mood or distracted by harassing someone else.
The trouble started long before the appearance of R. "First people harassed me because I was really smart," Andrew says, presenting the sequence as self-evident. "I read all the time. I read through math class." Back then, in middle school, he had the company of Tom Clancy and a best friend he could talk to about anything. He says things are better now; during school, he hangs out with the freaks. Yet the routine days he describes sound far from improvement -- being body-slammed and shoved into chalkboards and dropped into trash cans headfirst. At a school dance, in the presence of chaperones and policemen, R. lifted Andrew and ripped a pocket off his pants. "One day I'll be a 'faggot,' the next day I'll be a 'retard,"' Andrew says. One girl who used to be his friend now sees him approaching and shouts, "Oh, get out of here, nobody wants you!"
Andrew joined the cross-country team but the misery trailed him on the practice runs. He won't rejoin next year although he loves the sport. Recently he and some other boys were suspended for suspected use of drugs. According to Andrew, he used to earn straight A's; now he receives mostly C's and D's. He does not draw connections between the abuse and the changes in his life.
He also does not expect help from the adults around him. He suspects they have their reasons -- some don't care, while others worry only about physical attack. When I point out that he's being physically attacked, he imagines that the teachers think it's horsing around, although he does wonder why the teachers can see the same kid pushing other kids every day and don't just tell the kid to stop. "Maybe have a talk with him or do something," he says. "One little push isn't that much, but when it's every day, it's something." He only wishes that someone had helped in middle school, before the contagion grew. "When it first starts to happen, there's definitely something you can do," he says. "But you can't turn a whole school."
Neither does Andrew tell his parents. He believes they think he is popular. "If I try to explain it to my parents," he says, "they'll say: 'Oh, but you have plenty of friends.' Oh, I don't think so. They don't really get it." His outcast friends, however, do.
One of them is Randy Tuck, a 5-foot-4-inch sophomore with a thick head of hair and cheeks bright red with acne. He rescued Andrew from a "swirly" (two boys had him ankle up, and headed for the toilet bowl).
Randy moved from Alaska to New Hampshire almost three years ago. To his frustration, his classmates called him Eskimo Boy. Art is his solace, along with the occasional cigarette. He loves to draw. He used to sketch Ninja Turtles and now, with the help of an art teacher, he's studying anatomy. He associates with the freaks during school mainly because they let him. He says, "They are friendly, but not welcoming."
Classmates debate with Randy about his atheism, but he refuses to believe a God could arrange a life as unlucky as his. Andrew blames himself. Randy says, "Andrew's vulnerable and small and weak and R. takes advantage of that." Randy utilizes "verbal bashing" as a defense, although he admits that its powers don't prevent physical attack. R. surprised him one day in the hallway. He passed Randy, then turned around and punched him in the spine. But Randy also notes that R. can be funny. "When he's not in a bad mood, he can be very entertaining."
Andrew says that the ostracizing "does build up inside. Sometimes you might get really mad at something that doesn't matter a lot, kinda like the last straw." He could understand the Columbine killers, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, if their misery had shown no signs of ending, but Andrew remains an optimist. After all, there are some people who have no friends. "Things are not going up really fast, but they are getting better," he says. "I might have a week where they get worse, but overall they are getting better, definitely."
The quips ricochet around the bedroom like friendly-fire darts. Myles Forrest, 16, a sophomore with baby fat and sweet eyes, is one of George Farley's closer friends. George, also 16, is a floater. He has set up camp with ConVal's freaks for now. George sees weakness everywhere -- in women who look for milk cartons with the latest expiration date at the store where he works; in the unemployed drunk who receives an allowance from his working wife; in white girls who think they are cool because they date guys who are black. Softness arouses his contempt. He is no more gentle with himself. The volleying with Myles, who wears his Y2K T-shirt -- "01-01-00" -- relieves George of the clearly burdensome obligation of having so much edge.
"The end of Myles's life," George starts.
"The end of life as we know it," Myles says. The phone rings. George lifts the receiver. "Myles Forrest, loser," he announces, and so the afternoon begins.
Myles and George provide sustenance between insults. Myles fiddles with his computer -- one of two -- as George peers out over the street. "What's up with the dress?" George asks, spotting an exchange student from ConVal.
"What? He's Hindu," says Myles.
"I said, What's up with the dress?"
"It's like a cult thing," Myles says, somewhat sharply.
"That's a dress," George says, losing steam.
"It's like a cult thing. It's like a kilt."
"You know I'm messing with you, don't go getting all politically correct with me." (Later on, Myles will explain the theory of equal-opportunity hatred: "You ever notice that you can't hate a particular group, but if you generally hate everybody nobody seems to mind?") The sarcasm slows when the Quake competition begins.
It strikes me as I watch them in front of the famously violent video game that it is one way for the boys to enjoy closeness without it being threatening. The violence of the game, the state-of-siege mentality, the technical expertise required, supplant the macho expectations and give the boys a rest from the relentless one-upmanship. Rather than insult each other, they can attack the game. Soon enough, they are allies in the search for snacks, rushing down the stairs. They amble past the locked gun case behind the door leading through the playroom, to the kitchen. George sticks his head in the fridge.
"How about some of these worms?" he asks, holding a baggie of bait. "Fishing is like alcoholism. It's an excuse to drink. Or maybe they're trying to level the playing field. How hard can it be to outsmart a fish?"
"Catching it is kinda fun --" Myles tries.
"Now ice fishing -- alcoholism in the extreme," George continues. "Cold, boring, worry about falling through the ice. Hey, my girlfriend dumped me. She dumped my slacker expletive ."
"I thought you were gonna give her the --" Myles tries.
"Yeah, but she surprised me."
"Irony of ironies. So, technically, you're the loser."
"Shut up," George says, sounding sad.
"To the winner goes all the spoils of war," Myles appeals.
"Shut up," George says, relocating to the sun room. He lifts Fido, Myles's lizard.
"Watch out, George," Myles says protectively. George presses Fido into the aquarium to make the wood chips fly.
"That's cruel, stop it," Myles says, retrieving his lizard, as George moves on to his lectern, the Stairmaster.
"That cat is wishing for a tail," George says, observing Myles's tailless cat.
"To the victor goes the spoils of war," Myles sighs, mock ruefully.
"Stop defending your tailless cat," says George. "Anyways, so Colleen broke up with me."
"You already told me that," Myles says. He glances at his buddy. "I thought that's what you wanted."
"I did," George says, sounding far from sure. Now that he has been rendered single, what will come of the flirtation he lost his girlfriend for?
The new girl, a computer skateboarder chick, likes to spar. George says, "We're both the same person, but it's hard when you have two sarcastic people making fun of each other, and then they get worse and worse until --"
"Until there's no place you can go," Myles says knowingly.
"Shut up, you slack expletive ," George says, knowing, too.
Teen-agers find heroes among their friends. Tyler Snitko, 17, pulls other outcasts in, functioning as a kind of human insulation for the freaks. To each taunt he quips, "Thank you." He booms, "These are my people," opening his arms, his fingernails polished black, to embrace his fellow freaks at lunch time in what has been labeled Mutant Hall. In the presence of someone like Tyler, more vulnerable teen-agers are less likely to be picked on, and they intuitively know this.
Tyler's hero is his grandfather. Not only did the old man give him advice that he often quotes ("Sometimes there are going to be rat bastards in life, and you have to deal with them"), but he also backed up the talk with action: he gave Tyler his first set of weights.
Tyler kept his strategy secret, taking long, midnight runs because he did not want to jeopardize his affiliation with the freaks, who were supposed to be "all skinny and pale." He soon discovered that his best friend, Toffer, 17, studied jujitsu to control the anger building in himself.
Toffer knew what it was like to be excluded. His isolation began in elementary school, and only in high school, through his friendship with Tyler and with his girlfriend, Anne Baker, did the fog begin to lift. Through the worst of the ostracization, the boys had each other. Says Tyler: "Other people turned me away, like I'd bring the whole house down. He stood by me."
Toffer, whose name is Christopher Eppig, is a senior who looks very much like Jesus. He survived the solitary years by not showing emotion. He shows very little emotion now. "I think it was the fact that I couldn't completely control myself that scared me," he says flatly. "I didn't like myself because I didn't have anything. No athletics, no grades. The only thing that kept me going was that I hated them more than I hated myself.
"Before, all I knew was what people were telling me about myself, and it wasn't a positive image, and I wasn't interested in who I was," he continues. "Jujitsu gave me something else that I was, that was better and more believable."
The friendship with Tyler created elbow room. They joined the wrestling team. They formed a band named Gawd. It helps that Tyler's parents encourage his use of their renovated colonial as a social center, and that his dad quit his job as an executive to stay home full time. His parents call the arrangement a luxury, a decision they made around the time when Tyler's mother was promoted to assistant principal of a middle school. Then Tyler had the great good fortune of several growing spurts, which, at last measure, topped six feet to match the hard-earned bulk.
His upbeat personality may defuse hostility, but his physical presence is a moat. A friend who has known Tyler since childhood, who will only give his on-line name, Bladerunner, says: "He is just really nice and he sticks up for people."
Bladerunner, 17, has had his own troubles. A boy he'd met in the hospital after a suicide attempt wanted to beat him up, and for months, the tranquil New Hampshire town became a minefield for him. Bladerunner stopped visiting the park and dreaded school. The restaurant where he washes dishes was the only place he anticipated with some pleasure because his boss treats him "like a person." Otherwise, he met Tyler at the Incubator, a room where students go when they have a free period. They would get passes to the weight-lifting room.
Bladerunner didn't stick with the weights, but it mattered that Tyler encouraged him. Recently, Tyler invited Bladerunner to be a vocalist for Gawd. "I realized I was walking around people on eggshells, because I'm always afraid of what's going to happen to me, or what people are going to think," Bladerunner says. "I am going to try to take what I am afraid of and look it in the face, as much as it might physically hurt."
Even as it helps in the day-to-day of high school, bodily renovation perpetuates the hierarchy. Bulking up -- or being near someone who does -- just means the pyramid starts lower down. Tyler sees similarities between R. and himself: "He gets respected because he throws his weight around. I get respected because I don't have to." He also recognizes how the pressure to prove his masculinity drove him to objectify girls. "I treated my girlfriends really bad," he says. "I admit it. I was like, Oh, there's a pair of boobs, I'll go stand next to it. I think I'll go talk to it."
Of course, trivializing girls is a most likely result of a pecking order in which girls represent "femininity," the perceived threat to conventional masculinity, the mix of which leaves boys so confused these days. The fear of feminizing boys is embedded in the hierarchy of the social cliques: winner-loser, popular-outcast, boy-girl. "This fear of sissifying boys," says Olga Silverstein, author of "The Courage to Raise Good Men," "I think it's going to be the last prejudice to go."
The danger signs are everywhere, but only if you want to see. Banning trench coats, installing metal detectors and security guards -- the quick-fix solutions to the problem of seemingly rampant boy violence -- "becomes a weird kind of McCarthyism," says Russell Novotny, a 1999 ConVal graduate. "The only way to get kids not to hurt each other is to get kids not to want to hurt each other," a process he compares to a road. "It's the whole little-step thing. You take a little step and suddenly you are in the woods. How did I get here? We are so far into the woods. For every mile you walk, you have to walk a mile back. You can't look too far ahead or you trip over what's in front of you." Or you look at what's in front of you, a boy like J., and you don't really see him.
J., who doesn't want his name to be used, ranks as a loser. He finds temporary refuge with the burnouts, but his precarious welcome depends upon their mood and whether or not he has weed. His greatest flaw seems to be his willingness to try anything to fit in.
"That kid does whatever you tell him to do," says Josh Guide, a classmate. Past instructions are rumored to include wading knee-high in a running brook, with his sneakers and socks on, fetching sticks. He doesn't fight back when people shake him down for money. He claims to get high when a classmate sells him oregano with chives. He falls off his bicycle when the other boys are done using it and ignores the bleeding, which, during a game of basketball, stains another boy's new Tommy Hilfiger shirt.
"Now I have AIDS," the boy says, disgusted. J.'s distress is so apparent that the boy says, "I'm kidding," but his hostility is clear. This particular afternoon, J., who has ragged black hair and a crumpling smile, opens his mouth as if to speak, but doesn't. He saves his mouth for his teachers.
The week after the shootings in Littleton, Colo., ConVal High School held an assembly about school safety. J. recounts what happened in his class next period. "I said, 'I wish those kids would come over here and blow away the teachers,"' especially an assistant principal, with whom J. had a long history. J. says, "I am always in trouble, every day, for my attitude."
According to J., the classroom teacher said, "I'm kind of concerned about you."
"Nothing to be concerned about," J. replied. "Everyone hates him anyway."
"Do you want to go to the office?" she asked.
"Hell, no," he said. Then she sent him there.
Ordinarily, J. would have been sent home for cursing. He knew the drill. This time, however, he waited for the Peterborough police, who, he says, searched his knapsack and escorted him to the station, where he was charged in juvenile court with disorderly conduct. (ConVal officials cannot comment on J.'s case because he is a juvenile and because it is pending.)
That night, the police appeared at the homes of members of J.'s family with a search warrant and collected handguns and sporting rifles. The next day, news cameras greeted ConVal students in the parking lot. The print media continued the story, and J. became known as a copycat in a wider world. "It's retarded," he says. "I shouldn't have got in trouble. If it was some good kid that did it, they wouldn't have gotten in trouble." Many students feel that the administration overreacted, less because of Columbine than for the fact that even if he had meant what he said, he was an unlikely candidate to carry out that particular kind of plan. Says one parent, sighing, summing up a typical adult response, "That's just J. being J. again."
Being J., according to J., is as inevitable as his difficulty in school, which he compares to his unhappiness in his family life. He says: "I try not to spend much time at home. It's like I'm a failure. My sister is a straight-A student and everything." He doesn't get along with his stepfather. Right now, his relationship with his mother isn't good. "Whenever I get in trouble, she yells at me for 10 minutes, then she stops," J. says. "They yell nonstop, then they forget what they are yelling for. They don't even punish me. It's like a habit with them."
J. spends his days watching television. In the afternoons, he goes to the nearby basketball court. His mother tracks him down. (She declined to comment for this story.) J. says, "Then she yells at me all the way home, then I fall asleep and get up and do it all over again."
More upsetting to J. than his threat to an assistant principal -- and more memorable to many ConVal students -- was an event for which he was suspended earlier. He stepped into a bathroom to smoke a joint. It wasn't getting high, or even getting high during school, that was so problematic to the other students, but that he had selected a bathroom without ventilation that led directly into the hall where a teacher stood. J. heard the teacher but still kept smoking. "I just finished cuz I knew I was gonna get caught," he says.
"How stupid can you get?" George asks. "He just proved to everyone that he's the expletive everyone thinks he is."
Andrew ventures, "Not to be mean to J., but that's plain old stupid."
Even Tyler, who tried to defend what was left of J.'s eroding reputation, admits: "That was the stupidest thing I ever heard of. I don't even know why I tried to protect that kid."
Drugs -- at least temporarily -- blur the social lines. Boys and girls from different groups get high together; says George: "Polar opposites -- they are bound together by drugs." James Key-Wallace, a 1999 graduate, attributes the social leveling to limited distribution: "The drugs come from the same half-dozen sources. You're going to come in contact on grounds that demand respect." Says Hayden Draper, who also just graduated: "Popular kids do drugs. Unpopular kids do drugs. Everyone has their own place to get high." J., however, was all alone.
Since Columbine, the Safe School Committee at ConVal has undergone a renaissance. The Peterborough police have stationed an officer at the entrance. But many of the students believe that a shooting spree like that of Klebold and Harris's could happen anywhere. Says Toffer: "It certainly didn't happen because of the lack of a safe-school committee. Their problem was, they weren't accepted, and they weren't going to be accepted, and that's the way that our society is. There are always people that are going to be cast out and people that are cast in."
Colleen, George's ex, a slim girl with short straight hair and an easy smile, grew up down the street from J. He's generally annoying, she says. He used to sing Christmas carols on the bus in June, but he is not cruel. Everyone, she says, has their days. What J. hates is people talking down to him, so she takes care not to do that. She feels the same way when people talk down to her because she is a girl. "There are times I can talk to him about things, without it being weird and without him being a pervert," she says. It's all relative. When you are close to the bottom, there's not much room left to fit. She recalls J. at his happiest during a class he described to her, in the high school's on-site preschool, how content he felt playing among the little kids.

HEADLINE: The Mayor's Makeover

 BODY:
James Traub (Aug. 1) mixes an odd cocktail in trying to define Rudy Giuliani's strengths as weaknesses. Perhaps more remarkable, however, is the theme that the Mayor may have too strong a personality and set of beliefs for the Senate. It is frightening to read that our nation may no longer seek charismatic and virtuous leaders.
Giuliani has already given much -- not just to New York City but also to the country, in the policies and strategies that have become the accepted paradigms for urban renewal and recovery. That he is willing to accept the mantle of broader office is another sign of his strength, and one we should rush to embrace.

HEADLINE: Who's Afraid Of China?

 BODY:
Tyler's point that 1.3 billion Chinese want only to develop their economy would be more reassuring if ordinary Chinese citizens were able to shape their country's foreign and defense policies. The Chinese Government's recent record demonstrates its intent to increase its power in order to challenge America's influence in Asia.
The correct response to China's rise as a superpower is neither the fear that Tyler discounts nor the complaisant optimism he advocates. Instead, the United States should meet the challenge by defending its values and by strengthening its alliances in Asia.

THE ETHICIST: The Slacker Temp

BYLINE: By Randy Cohen

 BODY:

I have been placed in charge of a data-entry temp whose work is very shoddy. I don't want to complain about him -- who should be expected to do a good job of mindless work for low pay? But I worry that his performance is sabotaging me and my colleagues. What should I do? -- Jon Lackman, New York 
As you rightly suggest, running to the boss should be a last resort. The person to talk to first is the temp: make sure he knows what is expected of him and what the consequences will be if he doesn't deliver.
But few people eagerly work well in bad jobs. Indeed, if anyone's acting unethically here, it's your boss; it is ignoble to force people into soul-deadening, pointless, poorly paid jobs. And it is force -- people must work to live, and surely no one would freely choose to waste his days in such circumstances.
Organizing work into tedious, repetitive tasks, while profitable for the few, makes life miserable for the many; some political economists have called it a crime against humanity. The humane solution is to distribute the most tedious tasks evenly rather than dumping them on one person. But the current arrangement brings cars, camcorders and the Backstreet Boys to the millions -- myself included -- and we seem to like that.
Short of a radical transformation of the labor economy (which doesn't seem too likely), the situation at your office will continue to be exhausting for everyone involved: your co-workers, your boss and even the temp himself. And as the supervisor, you have the responsibility to see that the work gets done, so you must act. Can you persuade the temp to improve his performance? Great. Can you get him more money or rearrange his most mind-numbing tasks? Even better. But if you can't do either, and you continue to feel, as you say, that his job is so wretched that reporting him would be wrong, you can continue to work there, but you can't ethically continue as his supervisor. You can be
a soldier but not an officer.
 
We received an invitation to a surprise party for our friend Ted, given by his wife. It said: "It is a clown party! Ted is afraid of clowns!! Feel free to dress as a clown. The idea is to scare him! Adults only! We do not want children to see how terrified Ted will be by the clowns!" Not going
is a no-brainer. Should we tell him? -- M.M., Madison, N.J.
By all means, tell him about the party. And about a divorce lawyer.

HEADLINE: Newburyport, Mass., Gets Its Train Back

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE

DATELINE: NEWBURYPORT, Mass.

 BODY:
A NEW $55-million Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority train station opened here last fall, becoming another attraction drawing new home buyers to this seaside community 40 miles north of Boston.
Direct commuter service to Boston was discontinued in 1976 when the town declined to pay increased fees sought by the authority. Its restoration is part of a systemwide expansion by the transit authority in the 90's within a 50-mile radius from Boston. By the end of this year, there will be 103 miles of new track and 22 new stations at a cost of $700 million, said John Carlisle, an authority spokesman. 
 But until the station in Newburyport opened last October, the last stop on the Newburyport/Rockport Line was nine miles to the south in Ipswich. About 600 commuters a day boarded there. Now, 500 people a day board there and 575 get on in Newburyport for a net gain of 475 riders, Mr. Carlisle said.
The new service is not the only explanation for the surge in home sales here, although it has played a part. Before Joseph Mayer, 50, a financial planner, moved here from the landlocked Boston suburb of Framingham last winter, he was driving 20 minutes from home every day to get to the commuter train to Boston.
He and his wife, Deborah, were looking for a waterfront community with rail service to Boston when they bought a house under construction in Port Village here, a 42-lot subdivision. Its presence less than a mile from the new station on Route 1 impressed them. "We wanted the water for quality of life and the train because it's the most efficient way to commute to the city," he said.
Newburyport is a Colonial-era city of 17,000 with a downtown that sits on the Merrimac River and offers a view of a vast expanse of Atlantic Ocean. A two-and-a-half-acre waterfront park with a boardwalk has a harbor with public moorings for pleasure boats. The pristine Plum Island Beach is about three miles away. About five miles west of the center is the 480-acre Maudslay State Park, which has bike paths as well as open-air concerts during warm weather and cross-country skiing in winter.
Economic growth in the region is the primary cause of the surge in new housing construction, but Newburyport itself has also benefited because it can offer both urban amenities and the charm of a small seaside community. Clustered around the waterfront are dozens of early 19th-century red Flemish brick buildings with shops downstairs and apartments up.
Since the late 1960's, an infusion of about $30 million from a small cities improvement program of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has created a pedestrian mall encompassing several streets and led to the restoration of dozens of the historic brick buildings.
Now these three- and four-story flower-trimmed buildings are filled with shops, offices, apartments and a panoply of clubs, cafes and restaurants. These improvements raised real estate values across the entire city, said former Mayor Richard Sullivan, who was in office in the late 70's when much of the downtown renewal took place.
IN the last two years, construction has begun on more than 200 new homes: 120 single-family houses and 84 condominiums. This winter, work is to start on a 71-lot subdivision. In this year's first half, meanwhile, renovations have been started on 210 existing houses, including many antiques, according to Dan Raycroft, the City Building Inspector.
"Most of the new houses are being purchased by out-of-towners," he said. "There's even more new people moving here than in the real estate boom of the 1980's."
One of the draws for buyers accustomed to the residential market closer to Boston is substantially lower prices, according to Edward T. Sullivan, vice president of Hunneman Coldwell Banker, in Boston.
In this year's first quarter, condominiums in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood brought an average of $445,158 for an 1,100-square-foot unit. That compares with an average sale price of $283,056 for a single-family house, usually with at least 2,200 square feet of space, in Newburyport.
A similar disparity is evident in the market for large old downtown homes. In the Back Bay area of Boston, four large antique town houses were recently sold for $1.5 million to $6.7 million for 10,000 square feet of space, Mr. Sullivan said.
In June, Christopher and Teri Ebinger bought a three-story sea captain's house, built 200 years ago on High Street in downtown Newburyport, for $450,000. They expect to invest $150,000 more in renovations, they said. After doing basic plumbing, electrical and wiring work, they will convert the eight bedrooms on the upper two floors into three suites. They expect to be at it for five years.
Mr. Ebinger, 46, has a teen-age daughter who can walk to an after-school job in the center of town. "That makes it easy and safe for her to socialize and make friends," he said.
Newburyport prices may seem like a bargain to Boston buyers, but the increasing demand for housing here has led values to rise rapidly since the plan to restore rail service and build a new station was announced two years ago.
The average sales price of a house here so far this year was up 20 percent from a year ago. In 1998, the average sale price, $242,643, was 23 percent higher than in 1997, according to town officials and realtors. A decade ago, a single-family house averaged $153,000.
OF course, land prices have also been rising, reaching $150,000 to $200,000 for a 10,000-square-foot lot, up 25 percent from 1997, said Albert R. Symes, the Wakefield developer who is planning to build the 71-lot subdivision next to Interstate 95 here early next year.
In this rising market, therefore, most of the new single-family houses start at $400,000, while the new condominiums begin at $300,000, according to Evon Woods, a broker for Hunneman here.
Furthermore, economic growth all around this little city has enhanced its location. The job market for technology, financial service and high-skilled manufacturing workers is booming in southern New Hampshire, just over the state line. The same is true along metropolitan Boston's beltways: I-495 and Route 128, both of which are nearby.
"As long as the regional economy prospers, so will we," said David M. Tierney, a partner in Prudential Harbor Realty here.
The Mayers, who moved from Natick, were able to buy a new 3,000-square-foot house, with three bedrooms and four baths, for $459,000. Mr. Mayer recently started his own financial consulting company in nearby Methuen. His wife has set up her business, Dehaas Advertising and Design Inc., in the bedroom over the garage, which has a separate entrance.
The subdivision where they live, Port Village, is being built by the Mesiti Development Corporation of Tewksbury. Early in 1998, the company began installing roads, water and electrical systems. It is building the project in phases. Of the 16 lots in Phase One, eight homes are occupied, with five more under agreement or reserved, a company spokesman said.
Mr. Mayer, who does not make the daily commute to Boston anymore, says he has found what he was looking for in Newburyport. "We paid a lot for a life style," he said. "It's about biking to the water; the gourmet restaurants and theater downtown -- and the train to Boston."

HEADLINE: FILM;
Growing Up in Belgrade With Suitably Black Humor

BYLINE: By NANCY RAMSEY; Nancy Ramsey's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about the movie "Genghis Blues."

 BODY:
"EMBARGO, poverty, blockade, criminalization of whole society, waiting for the milk and bread in the line, billion points inflation": That's how director Srdjan Dragojevic described the past decade in his native Belgrade in an E-mail message shortly after the NATO bombing began in March. "Only thing I didn't have is -- THE WAR."
Mr. Dragojevic spent the first afternoon of the bombing with his family and friends "making barbecue on my terrace (I have huge terrace with whole city view)," he continued by E-mail. "Sausages were excellent." The next day he took his children, Irina, 9, and Matia, 7, to see a shelter. "Lots of people are hiding there, and I promised my kids that I will take them to play there in long corridors. I feel like a 'post-catastrophe-Mad-Max daddy.' " On the fourth day, he boarded a bus for Budapest, a city then full of "Serbian intellectuals with laptops trying to get visas." 
 On April 1, Mr. Dragojevic, 36, and his family were safely in New York, where his latest film, "The Wounds" (which opens Friday), was being screened at the Museum of Modern Art as part of MoMA's New Directors/New Films series and drawing comparisons to "A Clockwork Orange" and "Trainspotting." A packed audience watched the film, as it painted a violent picture of the lives, from 1991 to 1996, of Pinki and Kraut, two teen-age boys whose puberty runs parallel with the destruction of their country.
Like the films of fellow directors Emir Kusturica ("Underground," "Black Cat, White Cat") and Goran Paskaljevic ("Cabaret Balkan"), "The Wounds" is laced with irony, satire, surrealism, an antic absurdity and black humor.
"Dragojevic is one of very few people who manage to show how things look from the point of view of Serbs," said Dina Iordanova, who lectures at the University of Leicester in England and is writing a book on film and the Balkan crisis.
Pinki and Kraut's Belgrade is a world where the rules of Newtonian physics have gone awry: for every action there is an equally bizarre and unexpected reaction. Dickie, their pudgy-gangster hero, played by the film's producer, Dragan Bjelogrlic, drives a BMW and idolizes Versace. One day his girlfriend stabs him. "What character!" he cries. "I'll marry her." Kraut's granny snorts some of her grandson's white powder. "Prescription?" she asks. "No, Colombian," he replies. Pinki's father, played by the well-known Serbian actor Miki Manojlovic, rages over inflation and a broken toilet. The scene is funny, and as the audience laughs he raises a gun to his temple and blows his brains out.
After the credits rolled, Mr. Dragojevic publicly declined an invitation to speak from the podium. Instead, he suggested, "Let's turn off CNN and Serbian TV," his twin symbols for state propaganda, and "talk privately," taking a seat in the rear of the auditorium. It was a striking, moving moment, undoubtedly choreographed as his own gesture of reconciliation, conducted below the radar line of official diplomacy.
FIELDING questions from the whole audience, Mr. Dragojevic defended the film's violence and its lack of catharsis at the end. "I can't escape the subject; this is my life. If I were a Swiss director, I'd probably be making films about garden roses."
He went on, "Kids in Belgrade have no hope for the future, no heroes except for criminals.
"When I was 16, I was a punk rocker. Today, if I were 16 I would probably be a killer," he said, presenting an image hard to square with this man who has large doe eyes and a warm smile and was dressed in an Oxford-cloth blue shirt and navy blazer. Ordinarily critical of the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, Mr. Dragojevic could not condemn him now, publicly; to do so would be "giving ammunition to NATO to bomb my mother, my father, my friends." Yes, he had received money from the Ministry of Culture -- by presenting them with a fake script -- as well as private financing (the film cost approximately $800,000). No, the Government was not happy with the final product.
"We had a total media blackout," he said. "The Wounds" opened in May 1998, with a record 30,000 admissions the first week, according to Variety. Then state-controlled television and radio banned ads; newspapers were ordered not to list theaters screening it.
Official displeasure is nothing new for Mr. Dragojevic. His previous film, "Pretty Village, Pretty Flame," which reported more than 700,000 tickets sold in 1996-97, follows another pair of friends, one Serb, one Muslim, beginning in 1980. Serb soldiers pumped up on testosterone and rock-and-roll ravage Muslim villages, only to find themselves trapped later by Muslim soldiers in a tunnel, ironically dedicated in 1971 as "The Tunnel of Brotherhood and Unity."
"Some in my country said 'Pretty Village' was an anti-Serbian film, but I was attacked from abroad that I presented criminals, war and hatred between nations, and joked about ethnic groups," he said over a double espresso two days after the screening at the museum. "For me it's a kind of test. If I get attacks from both sides, it gives me proof I did the honest thing."
While Mr. Dragojevic is rooted in Belgrade's intelligentsia, part of "The Wounds" is based on his own youth. "We listened to these small criminals, who came from the other side of the trolley tracks, telling these silly macho stories, about stealing in Germany, about sex abroad," he recalled. "Sometimes they'd send us to buy beer and cigarettes. But after '91, with the closeness of the front lines, things became much more serious for kids growing up."
To cast the roles of Pinki and Kraut (Dusan Pekic and Milan Maric, respectively), Mr. Dragojevic and his assistants saw some 5,000 boys. "We found both boys accidentally," he said. "Kraut came with a friend we'd recruited. He was bloody. 'I had a small argument on the bus,' he told me. Pinki also was from the streets." Neither was going to school then, but now both want to study acting.
In late June, when the bombing had ceased, Mr. Dragojevic was more able to reflect on his life and work. He recently signed a two-year contract with Miramax granting the company first-refusal rights to his scripts and ideas; after searching in vain for a suitable apartment in New York, he and his family have rented a house in Los Angeles. "I feel like I've closed a chapter of my life," he said. "I finished my duty: I've done two films about these last eight years.
S OME people who read the first draft of 'The Wounds' like it more on paper," he said. "It's extremely funny." The film opens with the large-scale demonstrations that followed Mr. Milosevic's annulment of local elections in 1996. "There was a lot of hope then. People were doing crazy, creative things. One day hundreds of people stopped traffic, all pretending to fix their cars."
He wrote the script in two weeks; filming began in fall, 1997, with 78 shooting days. "The film is much darker than the script," he said. "As I was editing, things that promised better days disappeared. The Kosovo crisis had started again."
Educated as a psychotherapist before attending film school, Mr. Dragojevic uses that training to pull his audiences into his films. The scene, for instance, when Pinki's father blows his brains out, is intentionally manipulative: "As much as you laugh, you will cry," Mr. Dragojevic said. "You will be ashamed because of the previous laugh. I'm trying to materialize a state of mind." Living in Belgrade was "living a tragicomedy daily," he said. "One day we're living as a musical, the second day as a cartoon, the third day as a dark drama. We developed this black humor to survive."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEWS;
Collective Spaces, but Individual Visions

BYLINE: By Phyllis Braff 

 BODY:

April Gornik
Glenn Horowitz Bookseller, 87 Newtown Lane, East Hampton. Through Sept. 19. 324-5511.
 
 In the last 20 years, April Gornik has built a strong reputation as a painter of moody, introspective landscapes that create a sense of otherworldly dislocation. Solemn, with a haunting stillness, they can also seem challenging and oddly confrontational as they pit reality against imaginative visions and the privacy of dreams against the inherently public character of landscape.
Her large canvases are well known, but the smaller-scale works featured in this exhibition will come as a revelation. Their power to transport proves it is possible to detach from perceptual links to the outside world without the aid of a sizable painting surface. In fact, the smaller scale actually provides an accessible, concentrated force and makes the suggestion of mystery all the more absorbing.
Emphasizing sky, water and forest, these non-specific, unpeopled scenes frequently achieve the quality of suspended time.
Physical dimensions compress the intense light establishing the emotional spell in each painting. The illumination is broad and compelling, and sometimes appears to follow the viewer. Often, the light source is behind the configuration of trees, rocks or land masses, creating shadows that thrust into the foreground and add to the sense of visual involvement. "The Seine Imagined" and "Rocks and Reflections" are especially good examples.
Extreme tonal contrasts allow configurations to be interpreted as crisp, flat, nearly abstract shapes. Everything has equal importance across the surface and seems carefully calculated for maximum effect.
 
'As American as . . .'
Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job's Lane, Southampton. Through Sept. 19. 283-2118.
At any number of points in this large exhibition, subtitled "100 Works From the Collection," there is cause to admire the smart, sensible interpretation of the museum's holdings. The installation consistently delivers visual and intellectual messages, and it underscores the importance of context in art presentations. An obvious but nevertheless satisfying example based on strong paintings is the juxtaposition of references to artists' studios in Phillip Guston's "Visitors" and Jim Dine's "Little Blue Palette."
Basically. the show is about the subjects and themes, styles and approaches that have fleshed out 19th- and 20th-century American art. The paintings and drawings are not all first-rate, but everything plays its role in the sequences of small essays organized by the guest curator, Klaus Kertess, and the museum's curator, Alicia Longwell.
Early on, the genre paintings seem appropriate for a young nation that valued work and the rights of the individual. A nice touch is the pairing of pieces by Tompkins H. Matteson (1849) and Hughie Lee-Smith (1958), which are linked by an interest in human emotion. Although the styles are quite different, both capture moments of psychological tension between a man and a woman.
A portraiture section begins with 19th-century canvases that have rich potential for symbolic readings, and goes on to include Alex Katz and Chuck Close. In another grouping, the sitter is treated as part of a powerful composition in works by Larry Rivers, William Merritt Chase and Robert Henri.
Landscape groupings make points about attitudes, meanings and use. Seascapes raise some similar issues and are wonderfully displayed under the sweeping natural illumination that falls from the gallery skylight. Other sequences call attention to American abstraction in the 1940's through examples by Peter Busa and Will Barnet, and to gestural and organic abstraction in the next decade.
This tribute to the collection receives a vibrant boost from one of the newest additions: a bold airplane-and-ship composition by Malcolm Morley that combines psychological resonance with precise structuring.
 
'Vintage New York'
Hofstra Museum, Hempstead Turnpike, Hempstead. Through Sept. 12. 463-5672.
As a visual spectacle, New York City has long held iconic status. The richness and range of the imagery that documents its history inspired this traveling exhibition of about 70 etchings, engravings and photographs dating from 1850 to the present. Most pieces are either by anonymous artists or by those who never achieved fame, and a number of the earliest works are from 19th-century periodicals like Harper's Weekly.
Translations of newsworthy events into dramatic images provide much of the show's value. Granville Perkins, easily the most distinguished artist here, was responsible for the powerfully drawn "Brooklyn Theater Fire, 1876."
Other strong designs that convey the vitality of a special moment date from the 1880's and include depictions of the stampede and panic on the Brooklyn Bridge one week after its opening; the fireworks accompanying a demonstration by 30,000 people in Union Square on behalf of Grover Cleveland, and the huge cloth sheet -- a forerunner of a billboard -- hung in Madison Square to proclaim, "Harrison carries the state by 12,000!"
Weighing things down a bit are city images prepared in the spirit of a nostalgic souvenir, and a few mundane examples by artists intrigued the with the sculptural character of buildings observed against an unbroken sky.
Momentum revives, however, in the selections portraying social history. A view of hundreds of women sewing clothing in a department store and another of an immigrant tailor receiving garments gathered by his family are among those that make a significant impact.
Joys and fears stand out, too. A clever pairing juxtaposes a photograph of turn-of-the-century street entertainers with one of long-haired 1960's street musicians playing guitars. There is also a wonderful 1890 view of crowds cheering the carriage races in Madison Square Garden.
Major social and economic troubles receive a full measure of attention. Selections include an engraving of Wall Street during the panic of 1884 and a photograph of the same area at the height of the 1929 panic.

HEADLINE: Helping the Adoption Of Russian Children

BYLINE: By CYNTHIA MAGRIEL WETZLER 

DATELINE: YORKTOWN HEIGHTS

 BODY:
THE best thing about her family is having a mother and father and a brother, said Zoe Berman, 6, who was adopted in 1994 from an orphanage in Yoshkar Ola, a town 600 miles east of Moscow in Russia.
Zoe's mother, Karen Klein Berman of Larchmont, national chairwoman of Families for Russian and Ukrainian Adoption -- which opened its Westchester chapter in 1997 -- a support network of 2,000 members for adoptive families with children from the former Soviet Union, said: "Zoe is fantastic. She has artistic talents and athletic abilities I could never give birth to biologically." 
 Zoe is among the many Russian children adopted by American families. In 1998 the United States Embassy's immigrant visa unit in Moscow issued 4,521 immigrant visas to Russian orphans adopted by American citizens, making Russia the No. 1 source of foreign adoptions for American families.
Many adoptive parents with well-adjusted children say Russian orphans have been stereotyped as children with serious medical and emotional disorders. Dr. Andrew Adesman, director of the Evaluation Center for Adoption in New Hyde Park, said recently: "The media has concentrated on high-profile, unusual cases, which haven't reflected well on the whole adoption process. As a result, the all-important question has arisen, 'Are these children damaged goods?' All children who have spent an appreciable amount of time in an institution are at risk for developmental delays and/or emotional problems. There is neglect and undernourishment. But not every child at risk presents problems. Risk sounds scary. Yes, there are increased risks, but the majority do well."
Over the last five years, pre-adoption and post-adoption consultation services are more readily available, parents are more enlightened about risks and more children are adopted under the age of 1, Dr. Adesman said.
Dr. Boris Gindis, a psychologist specializing in international adoption evaluations and services in Suffern, said, "While there are no reliable statistics on the number of internationally adopted children in need of rehabilitative and remediation services, the majority of adoptions from overseas are rewarding, successful experiences."
Dr. Jane Aronson, director of International Adoption Medical Consultation Services in Mineola on Long Island, said: "Video and medical reports from Russia are limited, only a moment in time in a child's life in an institution. The decision to adopt is based on parents' intuition, what they see in a child's eyes. These reviews with prospective parents are tender experiences. I take them very seriously."
Terry and Francis Naumann, adoptive parents of biological siblings, Roland, 6, and Bea, 8, said, "We went into this with our eyes open." Bea was 3 when the Naumanns brought her home with her brother. She weighed 17 pounds and could not sit up. But, five years later, Ms. Naumann said, Bea is an active, normal, healthy child.
Because of the current economic crisis in Russia, a lack of food in orphanages leaves children undernourished. Many adopted children overcome their problems with affection, nutrition and perhaps remedial intervention. But some parents report a continuing effort to help an adopted child overcome early orphanage experiences.
The New York State chairwoman of Families for Russian and Ukrainian Adoption is Liz Evans of Katonah, who with her husband, Scott, have adopted two children from Russia. She can be reached at 232-9742 by those needing adoption information.
At a Fourth of July gathering here of Families for Russian and Ukrainian Adoption, where the Naumann family was the host, 22 adopted Russian children and their families had a barbecue with a group of Russian lawmakers. The Russians were visiting to learn about the American adoption process and to satisfy any doubts about the well-being of the children.
Nina Reznik, a representative from the Russian Parliament, said: "We have seen happy families and happy children. To actually see this is very important."
Barbara and Robert Wolff returned to their home in Yorktown Heights from St. Petersburg four months ago with Andrei, a 17-month-old baby with a bright smile and a round face. "He came from a caring orphanage," Mrs. Wolff said.
Ms. Naumann said: "Visiting an orphanage in Russia leaves an indelible impression on your soul. Parents going over to pick up a child bring an extra suitcase full of clothes, food and medicine."
She continued: "Families for Russian and Ukrainian Adoption is a buddy system with a Web site -- www.frua.org -- and a chat room. We help with the pre-adoptive paperwork, which can be daunting, and we plan social events where the kids can grow up knowing children who share their background." She touched her son Roland's cheek. "I just want to see more people go to Russia and get these kids," she said.
The average cost to adopt a child from Russia is $15,000 to $25,000, Ms. Nauman said. Adoptions are begun through adoption agencies specializing in international adoption.
Another organization involved in adoptions is the Bridge of Hope project, a collaboration between the Cradle of Hope international adoption agency in Washington and the Golden Bridge of Friendship, a nonprofit organization in Suffern, which brings Russian orphans 7 through 12 to the United States for a five-week summer stay. The children attend day camps and live with families that are considering adoption.
Lea Sigiel-Wolinetz, founder of the Golden Bridge of Friendship and organizer of the Bridge of Hope project, now in its third summer, said, "Our commitment is to find adoptive parents for all these children, but part of what we want is a cultural experience for them." The first year all 13 of the children that were brought to the United States were adopted. The second year 34 of 36 children were adopted. Fifty children came this year. Bridge of Hope barbecues and pool parties give prospective parents a chance to meet the children. Information about them is also available on the Internet at www.cradlehope.org and from Bridge of Hope at (301) 587-4400.
"I felt at first that maybe it would not be fair to the children to bring them here, thinking they are going to stay," Ms. Sigiel-Wolinetz said. "So we tell them they are coming for a vacation. The alternative, not bringing them, is worse. Older Russian children have virtually no chance of being adopted in Russia." All the children go back to Russia after the five-week stay. Russian adoptions, which may take several months, must be processed in Russian courts.
There is a growing trend, particularly among parents who have delayed their childbearing years, to adopt an older child, Ms. Sigiel-Wolinetz said. "Both parents and children need a second chance in their lives," she said.
George and Susan West of New Castle adopted Zhenya, now 11, two years ago through the Bridge of Hope program. Their biological daughter, Sophia, is 6. Ms. West said, "It was important for us to have a trial to check out the family dynamics. We fell in love."

HEADLINE: Island Heirlooms That Speak Volumes

BYLINE: By JENNIFER OLSHIN 

 BODY:
WHEN Bob McKay and his staff stumbled into a hidden chamber above the carriage house of the Hewlett family farm in Port Washington, they discovered a forgotten legacy. It was 1979, and this team of curators, architectural historians and property managers from the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities had uncovered a room filled with antiques spanning centuries, including the homestead's original door from 1711 and a map of what is now Route 25A, circa 1837. The trove above the carriage house linked six generations of Hewletts to their home and told stories of continuity and change in Long Island life.
Now, the society is taking a fresh look at this material in "Made on Long Island: Recent Discoveries in the Decorative Arts," on view at the society's gallery in Cold Spring Harbor. Concurrently, the East Hampton Historical Society has mounted "Made on Long Island: A Time to Remember," also focusing on the region's decorative arts over time. 
 For nearly four centuries, Long Island's shores have welcomed settlers from varied backgrounds, beckoned by personal freedoms and nature's bounty. Like the Hewletts, many Long Islanders can reconstruct their family trees, but far fewer have been able to imagine their heirlooms within the context of the region's broader history.
In the last 25 years, "we have been able to recover the lost cultural language of Long Island's earliest forebears," said Mr. McKay, the society's director. That language was first articulated in "Long Island Is My Nation," the exhibition and the accompanying book by Dean Failey, then its curator, produced by the society for the Bicentennial in 1976. The book, updated and reissued this year, serves as a guide to the current exhibitions.
"The process of discovery has been fascinating: sleuthing and poking around Long Island like detectives, piecing the history together with found anecdotes, documents and property," said Randy Staud inger, the society's exhibition installer. "The rule of thumb has always been that as long as someone has a barn, a loft or a cellar, nothing gets thrown away."
In the gallery, furniture, clocks, silver, textiles and paintings from the 17th to the 19th century breathe life into the Island's history. Groupings of material from specific families, like the Hewletts, the Coopers of Southampton, the Townsends of Oyster Bay, the Smiths of Smithtown and the Dominys of East Hampton illustrate the major stylistic influences and domestic context of the Island's cabinetmaking, metalsmithing and artistic patronage.
Lewis Samuel Hewlett, the patriarch, was an Englishman who became a prominent landowner on the Island in the early 18th century. Accordingly, the family's objects shown together offer case studies in the assimilation of English traditions into American cabinetmaking practices of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
A double-paneled blanket chest, made around 1730, is of particular interest. Painted blue-green and constructed of framed panels simply joined together with pegs or nails, it has the basic form and construction characteristics of the rural chests made by English carpenter-joiners in the 16th and 17th centuries. This chest, however, was designed with "bun feet," compressed bulbous supports that are considered a sophisticated Northern European feature. The configuration of the double-paneled facade has no direct precedents in Europe and has been found only among Quakers living in Long Island. This combination of decorative elements from a variety of sources combined Anglo-Dutch American aspects common to many Long Island objects from the earliest period, as "Long Island Is My Nation" explains.
The show also includes Long Island products more similar to European forms. Resembling twisted ropes, vigorously "sausage-turned" horizontal elements join the legs of an early-18th-century table that once belonged to the Smiths of Smithtown and has its obvious roots in Elizabethan furniture design. Similarly, a rare cabinet on display indicates the Dutch influence in New York. This carved cabinet, with its stepped and molded cornice over deep panel doors, its sturdy mortise-and-tenon joints and its ball feet, is known as a kas, meaning cupboard, and directly derived from the Dutch kast form.
By the end of the 18th century, traditional styles had begun to be replaced by more contemporary styles, inevitable byproducts of the Island's increasing population and commercial traffic. "These objects underscore the fact that Long Island was close enough to the major urban centers for trade but far enough to develop its own traditions," Mr. McKay said.
Trade across the Sound with the Connecticut River Valley, Boston and Newport, R.I., was vital not only to Long Island's grain and whaling trades but also to the development of the decorative arts. Commercial traffic resulted in a cross-pollination of design ideas, as exemplified by the cabinetmaking of the Townsend family of Oyster Bay. A group of distinctive Oyster Bay furniture made or influenced by the Townsends exemplifies the links to Rhode Island cabinetry. A carved high chest of drawers reveals characteristics reminiscent of Rhode Island design, but the dovetails and joined construction point to its Long Island origins.
Another factor that affected Long Island design was the American Revolution. The Battle of Long Island and the subsequent British occupation destroyed property, divided people and disrupted many conventional craft traditions. The years after the war and the beginning of the 19th century, however, were characterized by an unprecedented expansion of towns, with encroaching industrialization, new commercial ventures and alternative craft systems.
The Dominy shop of East Hampton illustrates the continuum of tradition and evolution amid these political, economic and social changes. This extraordinary dynasty, typical of rural craftsmen, not only made furnishings and mill parts but also were active builders, farmers and prominent citizens for nearly three centuries. At Cold Spring Harbor, clocks, chests and chairs made by the Dominys, both before and after the Revolution, show the versatility of their skills and their adaptability to the changing tastes of their local patrons. The most recent discovery on display is a lap desk, signed by Nathaniel Dominy 5th in 1849 -- the very last known chapter in the Dominy oeuvre.
While the preservation society's show celebrates a variety of decorative leitmotifs running through the larger scope of Long Island design, the East Hampton show focuses on the factors and influences contributing to the local esthetic culture. Its centerpiece is a stunning array of Dominy clocks from 1772 to 1828. With their attenuated, sparsely ornamented cases and precise manufacture, these clocks are the signature Dominy form. This lineup of clocks, rarely exhibited side by side, forms a Dominy family tree, dramatically demonstrating the passage of time and commemorating the fourth century of the town's history.
Aside from Dominy productions, this show presents a variety of themes related to the decorative arts of East Hampton. In one corner, an imaginative homage to the Rev. Samuel Buell (1716-1798) has been assembled. Buell, the minister of the Presbyterian Church and first headmaster of Clinton Academy, arrived in East Hampton in 1746 from Coventry, Conn., and his influence on the decorative elements of the church meetinghouse was considerable. His portrait is displayed along with his own chair, table, hatbox, microscope, inkwell, cup and saucer, and across from these personal items, the painted pulpit of the meetinghouse is exhibited. As the gallery label indicates, this pulpit, commissioned around 1758 during Buell's tenure and attributed to the Connecticut carver Alexander Grant, effectively transported design ideas across the Sound.
The curators of this show remind the viewer that this small town, founded in 1648, experienced the same historical evolutions as other Long Island settlements.
"There are poignant stories connected to these objects," said Karen Hensel, director of the historical society. "We have pieces here that have returned to East Hampton after many years of ownership in other towns, and we have pieces that have never left our vicinity."
This exhibition is to be the first of several at the Clinton Academy this year. In each, the core collection of clocks will be surrounded by changing exhibitions of clothing, architectural elements and furniture.
"It's amazing that everything in history has touched Long Island," Mr. McKay said. "From the European settlement on, we were the maritime cradle, the cradle of aviation, of most of the major forms of American recreation, of suburbia. We played a role in the American Revolution, and the conflicts thereafter. Its as if everything had to pass by Long Island before it was set in history."
 
"Made on Long Island: Recent Discoveries in the Decorative Arts" remains on view through Dec. 6 at the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities, 161 Main Street, Cold Spring Harbor; 692-4664. "A Time to Remember" is on view through December at Clinton Academy, 151 Main Street, East Hampton; 324-1850.

HEADLINE: A New Tax With Extra Bite;
Nassau Levy Could Affect Home Sales

BYLINE: By JOHN McQUISTON 

 BODY:
THE tight real estate market in Nassau County, where demand for homes has far outpaced supply and pushed prices to record highs, may be getting even tighter and less predictable under the new 1 percent property transfer tax approved by the Nassau County Legislature to help bail the county out of debt.
The tax went into effect last Sunday, creating a rush to contract by anxious sellers, brokers and real estate lawyers who found themselves pleading with buyers to sign sales agreements and put down their deposits no later than Saturday, Aug. 14. 
 Sellers who missed the deadline now find themselves having to share some of their profits with the county. For the average Nassau homeowner, the tax adds about $2,500 to the cost of selling a house.
Brokers, real estate lawyers, economists and legislators who oppose the tax are saying sellers may withdraw from the market until the transfer tax expires in nearly 18 months, on Jan. 31, 2001.
If that happens, it is unclear what the effect might be on housing prices. Some believe that the tax, coupled with other factors, could result in lower prices; others, however, believe that a tighter housing market could push prices higher.
The tax measure, proposed by County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta as the cornerstone of a plan to help solve the county's growing deficit -- as much as $300 million by some accounts -- is designed with hopes that it will add $60 million to the county's coffers. But that all depends on a continued strong real estate market. The combination of the tax and rising mortgage interest rates may begin to dampen sales and force prices to retreat, officials said.
Pearl Kamer, chief economist of the Long Island Association, said the transfer tax was only a small part of the real estate puzzle in Nassau. "But its impact could lead to slower home sales, especially now that interest rates have passed the 8 percent mark," she said.
"I think home sales will slow in any case," she said. "Most sellers and buyers have been trying to beat the increase in interest rates. At a rate of 8 percent or higher, many buyers can no longer afford as much house. The tax only adds to the problem."
The Long Island Board of Realtors led a coalition of organizations opposed to the tax, including the Long Island Association, the Association for a Better Long Island and the Long Island Housing Partnership. The coalition ran full-page newspaper ads calling for budget reform in Nassau, not more taxes.
"Nassau County's fiscal crisis is serious and demands creative solutions," said Randy Kaplan, a spokesman for the Board of Realtors. "Solely adding new taxes to one of the most already overtaxed counties in America is not one of them."
Dr. Kamer described the tax as inequitable in that it falls on one class -- home sellers. "And it's not an ideal revenue source for the county," she said. "It only lasts for 18 months and will not impress those who rate the county's bonds." The bonds are just two basis points from junk-bond status.
Opponents say the tax is harmful to both home sellers and home buyers in Nassau. They say that what is needed is a complete overhaul of the county's real state assessment system, not just a one-time tax fix. They note that each year, the county pays millions of dollars in refunds because of errors in an assessment system that is based on 1938 property values and is the cause of a significant number of tax judgments against the county in which property owners get refunds, with interest.
The assessment system is also the target of a Federal lawsuit, which charges that the system discriminates against minority homeowners.
Mr. Gulotta, meanwhile, remains steadfast in support of the assessment system and his new tax.
"This legislation, adopted with support from both Democrats and Republicans in Albany, as well as an overwhelming majority of the Nassau County Legislature, is important to the fiscal health of the county and is part of an overall plan to insure its long-term fiscal health," he said in a statement released by his office.
When asked if he planned to seek an extension of the tax beyond its current sunset in January 2001, Mr. Gulotta demurred.
"It is impossible to predict at this time whether any extension will be sought," he said. "We will be submitting a budget to the County Legislature in about a month, which must be adopted by the end of October. Once that budget is implemented, and we monitor the expenditures and revenues in the next year, we will be in a better position to do such an analysis."
Mr. Gulotta, a Republican who will be seeking re-election next year, is said by his critics to be pursuing a course of proposing measures that offend the fewest potential voters. Although Republicans outnumber registered Democrats in the county by three to two, Mr. Gulotta is widely seen as being in trouble because of the county's fiscal crisis at a time when its economy is enjoying a boom.
Homeowners who now hope to cash in on the boom by selling their homes at a time of record-high prices are potential voters, but only if they plan to remain in the county. If they are retirees heading, for example, to Florida or Arizona once they sell their homes, they will have no way of voting against Mr. Gulotta for the extra tax they must pay on leaving. County statistics indicate that between a quarter and a third of all home sellers leave the county.
The sellers will be able to list the tax payment as a local real estate tax deduction on their Federal income tax form, but for many retirees, it will be another bite out of their nest egg, according to opponents of the tax.
Real estate brokers and lawyers say the tax will no doubt be shared or passed along to buyers, especially in the current market, where they often end up in bidding wars and pay well above the asking price because of the limited number of homes on the market.
Brokers say they will also feel the pinch. Instead of taking the traditional 6 percent of the final price, they may be forced by sellers to take 5 percent to help pay for the transfer tax and close a deal.
Sellers of high-priced homes, especially those in the million-dollar range, are rethinking their plans to enter or stay in the present market so long as the transfer tax is in effect, brokers said.
While some buyers are being forced out of the market by steadily rising prices, those who remain are not only encouraged by the continuing strength of the economy, but are also backed by heavy profits from a still bullish Wall Street. Not even rising interest rates have curbed their desire to buy.
"But none of us has a crystal ball and can't say how long this is going to last or how the new tax will impact the market," said Kathy Borg, a director of the Long Island Board of Realtors and a broker for Daniel Gale Associates in Locust Valley, which like other agencies had a rush of clients hoping to beat the new tax.
"The real estate market is cyclical and is based on supply and demand, and right now we don't have the inventory to meet demand. It's still a seller's market, but the new tax has not made the sellers happy," she said as she helped conduct an inspection of a home she recently sold on Perry Avenue in Bayville.
Audrey Livingstone, a broker at the Century 21 Annettes Real Estate in Uniondale and the treasurer of the Long Island Board of Realtors, said that the number of sellers and buyers going to contract by last Saturday was three times normal at her agency, but that she had not detected any collapse in the market in the first few days after the deadline.
"All our sellers are still serious about selling, despite the tax," she said. "Many of them are relocating and their plans have been in motion for many months. As of now, no one has pulled out."
Frederick R. Parola, the Nassau County Comptroller, said his biggest concern about the tax was that it could have been avoided had the county administration and Legislature listened to his advice three years ago.
"The county should have held the line on spending," he said. "These things catch up with you if you don't correct them when you have the chance."
According to data based on real estate sales in 1998, Mr. Parola said the tax may provide Nassau with as much as $60 million in revenue. "But that all depends on a continuing high rate of sales at high prices," he said.
"If some people now decide to put off their sales until the end of January 2001, then the county's share would be less," he said. "It's too early to say whether the tax and rising rates will have a chilling effect on the market."
"But remember, home sales in Nassau over the last four years have seen a dramatic increase, and now homeowners find themselves sitting on a large equity. Many may still decide to jump in, despite the tax, even if they are retirees. They can get a break on their Federal taxes and still make a profit."
Mr. Parola said that the tax was only a quick fix and that what the county really needed was "probably a small tax increase, beginning three years ago." He added, "You can't balance a budget with a lot of false one-shot gimmicks."
Thomas D. DiNapoli, a State Assemblyman and the chairman of the Nassau Democrat County Committee, was among those who said the transfer tax could have a chilling effect on the housing market. "The risk is high that the tax will not produce the projected revenues," he said. "There are those sellers who may now say, 'I'm not going to give the county any more than I have to,' and wait another 18 months before they enter the market."
"Clearly, what's needed in Nassau is a well-thought out budget and an end to phony one-shot revenues," he said.
State Assemblyman Phil Boyle, a Republican from Islip, said he generally voted against any tax increase. "This tax hurts the real estate market in general," said Mr. Boyle, a real estate lawyer. "Even though I'm from Suffolk County, people selling homes anywhere think such a tax is unfair.
"And the rate, 1 percent, is a very high rate. It's out of pocket, and you pay just because you happen to live in Nassau."
Mr. Boyle noted that New York State's real estate transfer tax was less than half of 1 percent, or $4 on every $1,000.
"But it's just to early to say how this will all impact the market," he said. "The problem now is that there are tons of people looking to buy and not enough to go around. Things could get even tighter if some sellers decide to wait until the tax sunsets, and that could push prices even higher. Then again, higher interest rates could work to push them lower."

HEADLINE: Maker of Custom Kitchens Finds a Niche

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHEN Dr. Annie Kramer and her husband, Dr. Barry Kramer, bought their new house in Armonk, it was still under construction.
"We took the opportunity to finish the interior exactly the way we wanted to," Dr. Annie Kramer said. "And that meant customizing the kitchen, the library, the bathrooms, the closets and built-ins for two of the children's rooms, which was a very large undertaking." 
 The Kramers are both dentists who practice in Manhattan. Their three children range in age from 2 to 7.
"We're pretty busy, but we knew what we wanted: a wood-paneled library, an English-style kitchen, closet built-ins, desks in the girls' rooms. But we didn't have time to search for someone to carry out the project," Dr. Annie Kramer said. "Our builder recommended All Star Fabricators in Thornwood. We met with them and they immediately understood what we wanted."
Les Vissers, 51, co-owner with Peter Cuneo of All Star Fabricators, formerly All-Star Kitchens, held the first design meeting with the Kramers. The company has been in business since 1978 but is not well known since it does almost no advertising. "Customers like the Kramers come to us through word-of-mouth referrals," Mr. Vissers said.
Mr. Cuneo, 31, a native of Pleasantville, started in business as a carpenter when he was 17. "I learned woodworking from my dad, and I always wanted to do it for a living," Mr. Cuneo said. "But like most kids graduating from Westchester high schools, I felt obliged to go to college." He attended Pace University for a year before going back to All Star full time. "It was really a cabinet shop then. There were only three of us. The owner, Mauro Scopino, was really talented. He could do everything from design to building and installing the finished product."
Five years later, Mr. Cuneo became Mr. Scopino's partner. and when, in 1996, Mr. Scopino retired, Mr. Vissers bought half the company.
"This is a complete change of career for me," Mr. Vissers said. "I was in the computer industry in Manhattan until I got so fed up with the pressures and the commuting that I called a business broker to see what was out there near my home in Mount Kisco."
There were abundant opportunities, Mr. Vissers recalled. "I was offered everything from pool maintenance companies to photo stores to golf driving ranges," he said.
But All Star was different. "I've always been interested in woodworking, and when I walked through the shop and saw the machines and smelled the saw dust, I was hooked," Mr. Vissers said. "Mauro agreed to stay on for a year as a designer, and I learned a lot from him. I handle all the administration, sales and marketing. Peter takes care of production. We're a good team."
About 75 percent of All Star's work is done in kitchens, although the company also does offices, libraries, countertops, cabinets, refacing and more unusual jobs like church altars and office lobby walls.
Mr. Cuneo said that everything they do is custom built from scratch. And with the booming economy, he added, has come a booming demand for top-of-the-line projects like mahogany-paneled libraries, cherry or maple English-style kitchens with intricate cabinets, crown moldings, elaborate wooden bathroom cabinets with carved legs, and so forth.
The value of alterations and additions in Westchester is $50 million a year, judging from the number of permits issued for work of more than $50,000, said George Frank, executive vice president of the Builders Institute, a professional trade group based in White Plains.
Nationally, gross receipts for home remodeling rose by about $4 billion to $54 billion in the second quarter of this year over the same period in 1998, an 8 percent rise, according to a report released last month by the Joint Center for Housing at Harvard University.
"We're busy, but it has eased up some since we bought an expensive piece of equipment that can do the work of four men," Mr. Vissers said. The equipment, a computer numeric control machine, cost $70,000. Mr. Vissers said that despite the high cost, the machine saved the company an equivalent amount in just three weeks.
"The C.N.C. is a no-brainer," he said. "It's a computer-operated robotic arm that drills shelf holes, hinge holes and pre-drills for draw slides within one 100th of an inch."
The staff of 21 employees is made up of designers, carpenters, installers, cabinet makers and countertop specialists.
"We're lucky to have good skilled workers," Mr. Cuneo said. "They're hard to find, and so far we haven't lost anyone we've liked. We offer a good package of benefits, which is not usually the norm in a nonunion shop." Jobs are priced individually, and customers are most likely to pay anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 for custom kitchen cabinets for a small apartment.
"We can make anything in just about any style," Mr. Cuneo said. "Every piece in our factory is an original for a specific order. We have no middleman or subcontractors."
Mr. Vissers' goal, to turn a cabinet shop into a larger business, has been realized. This year, he estimated, the company will gross $2 million in contrast to the $500,000 to $600,000 it earned in 1995, the year before he arrived.
"Of course, we've been helped by the economy," Mr. Vissers said. "Yet it's a more complicated business than I had imagined. There are a thousand and one details to worry about. But we're creating something special, and the reward comes when customers tell you they love the results."

HEADLINE: A Dispute Within a Dispute on Fire Island

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
LIKE some strange sea creature on the beach, Fire Island's high-season political life can seem baffling when it washes inland. It can also have a bad smell.
The odor has seldom been stronger than in the aftermath of accusations by a newly formed group of Fire Island concessionaires and their supporters against the superintendent of the Fire Island National Seashore, Constantine J. Dillon. The group said he made homophobic remarks that it called an affront to gay summer communities in Fire Island Pines and Cherry Grove, and grounds for his dismissal. 
 The group, calling itself Beach -- for Balance, Ecology, Access, Commerce and Homes -- held a news conference on Aug. 13 to back its accusation with affidavits asserting that Mr. Dillon had told the owners of the ferry company that serves Fire Island Pines and Cherry Grove that residents' behavior was not conducive to a national park.
Mr. Dillon, who became superintendent in April 1997, emphatically denied the allegation of homophobia and said he had been talking about misbehaviors like trampling fragile dune grass and letting dogs run unleashed, not the sexual habits of gay visitors.
"It never occurred to me anyone would interpret what I said that way," said Mr. Dillon, who said he was aware of the social diversity of Fire Island when he sought the job. Mr. Dillon, 45 and a native of Groton, Conn., was previously posted as superintendent of Homestead National Monument in Nebraska.
Gay rights groups did not join in condemning Mr. Dillon, and the influential Fire Island Association, which represents the island's 38,500 property owners, said it could have nothing to do with Beach's campaign. In any event, the news conference was sprinkled with indications that Mr. Dillon's accusers were using the homophobia charge to pursue an unrelated issue: Mr. Dillon's failure to champion a $55 million to $60 million Federal beach-and-dune rebuilding project.
Much of Beach's news conference was devoted to the sand replenishment issue. The group's president, John Lund, said that although Mr. Dillon's jurisdiction was confined to the national seashore, "his decisions about beach replenishment can have an adverse effect on the entire South Shore of Long Island."
"He has been dragging his feet," Mr. Lund said. "Either he should come out and say something in favor of the project or get his superiors to do it."
The long-sought project is fervently supported by residents in the communities on Fire Island, where beach erosion is a threat to property.
"Anyone can look at the situation on Fire Island and see that this project is needed so that the island can fulfill its function of protecting the South Shore mainland communities," said Gerard Stoddard, the Fire Island Association's president.
But Mr. Stoddard drew the line on trying to force Mr. Dillon's ouster, saying the Fire Island Association had advised Mr. Lund's group that "we cannot be associated with their efforts."
"The association has been around for 50 years and we recognize that we are going to have to do business with the national seashore," Mr. Stoddard said. "And you don't do that by telling them who they should have running the park."
A draft environmental study for the project prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers is now under review by the Department of the Interior and other Federal agencies. Some on Fire Island who support the project as long overdue believe Mr. Dillon opposes it.
Mr. Dillon has said he is under strict orders from superiors to make no public comment about the project. "That's not an issue for me to address," he said. "The Secretary of the Interior is going to make the decision."
Yet feelings persist among some project supporters that Mr. Dillon should emulate his predecessor as park superintendent, Jack Hauptman, who spoke in favor of Federal action to rebuild beaches devastated by storms early in the decade.
"Since his appointment almost two years ago, Mr. Dillon has failed to take a public stand" on the project, Mr. Lund said.
To advance, the project will also need approval from the Interior Department and New York State.
The Army Corps environmental study may become public and the subject of hearings as early as this fall, though the project, if approved, is still probably more than a year away.
Mr. Stoddard said that property owners had pledged to pay up to $4 million of project costs in what he said was the "wave of the future" for coastal communities where similar projects were proposed.
The Federal Government would pay 65 percent of project costs. The remaining 35 percent would be divided between the state, local government and the property owners.
Mr. Stoddard said that even if there were no houses on Fire Island, the project would be necessary to protect the mainland from storm damage, including storm surge associated with major hurricanes.
Environmental groups opposed to the project say dumping sand on the beach would waste public money, principally benefit Fire island property owners, have unknown and possibly devastating effects on the ever-shifting barrier island and provide no provable storm protection for the mainland.
"The effect of these projects is to turn the beaches over to beach engineers," said Lorna Salzman, executive director of the Long Island Shorefront Defense Committee. "You can't protect both property and the beach at the same time."
"You are talking about a real subversion of science," she said. "The beach in its natural state is the best and perhaps the only protection for the mainland. The argument that the project would protect the mainland is totally phony."
The controversy over the project also involves delicate negotiations between the Interior Department and Army Corps over how much beach engineering is warranted in a national park that, although it is visited by more than four million people a year, places a premium on undisturbed nature and natural systems. The park contains the only Federally designated wilderness in New York.
When it was created in 1964, Fire Island National Seashore was already dotted with summer communities and Congress had recently approved a major dune building and storm protection project from Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point. It has never gotten off the drawing board. The Fire Island plan now under consideration would be an interim project to be integrated later into the larger project.
The Interior Department objected to an earlier Corps version of the interim project that would have committed Interior, the Army Corps and New York State to a 30-year maintenance program of redepositing sand and rebuilding dunes as necessary.
The revised plan soon to be made public attempts to overcome the objection by reducing the maintenance program to six years. Clifford S. Jones, the Army Corps of Engineers project manager for both projects, said the six-year term could be extended to 30 years once the larger project was approved.
The Interior Department and the Army Corps signed an agreement in June setting terms for the scaled-back interim project that would make it more acceptable to the Interior Department. Under the agreement, the interim project will not include dune building and beach widening in the park's wilderness area, nor would it foster development.
With the controversy over the interim project likely to reignite with the release of the environmental study, the concessionaires' charges against Mr. Dillon were an opening act of a larger drama.
In another layer of complication, the concessionaires also appeared to be embroiled in a dispute with Mr. Dillon over terms and conditions in their franchises to run ferry services, marinas, restaurants and other businesses on Federal land.
As superintendent, Mr. Dillon holds final authority over who gets franchises. New National Park Service rules for concessions also shift costs for maintenance and other items once assumed by the Government to the concessionaires.
Mr. Dillon said the homophobia charge stemmed from a misinterpretation of what he meant when he said at a meeting with concessionaires more than a year ago that some Fire Island visitors engaged in behavior that was inappropriate in a national park.
"I think it's a misunderstanding of that phrase 'inappropriate behavior,' " he said. "In the park system, we know internally when we say inappropriate behavior we mean chopping down trees, starting fires and letting you dog run around.
"To a person who is not in the park business, they may hear that phrase and it means something else because they are bringing their background to it."
But the group called his explanation preposterous.
"The outrageous remarks attributed to Mr. Dillon, combined with his failure to adequately address beach and dune replenishment, in addition to the numerous other concerns of homeowners, residents, visitors, environmentalists and business owners on Fire Island" had compelled his group to conclude that "Mr. Dillon is the wrong man for the job," said Mr. Lund at the news conference, held near park headquarters in Patchogue.
Mr. Lund distributed affidavits from three concessionaires attesting to Mr. Dillon's allegedly homophobic remarks.
In them, Kenneth Stein Jr., the president of Sayville Ferries, his son Kenneth Stein III and Stephen J. Rose, whose family holds a concession contract for a 44-slip marina, snack bar and general store on Federal land at Sailors Haven, said at a meeting in February or March of 1998 Mr. Dillon said that "he did not believe that the behavior and lifestyles of members of the communities of the Fire Island Pines and Cherry Grove were acceptable or conducive to a national park."
The affidavits also said Mr. Dillon proposed placing rangers on Sayville Ferries, which goes to those communities, "in order to monitor or modify the behavior of the residents in those communities."
Mr. Dillon said he proposed putting rangers on ferries to educate visitors not to feed deer, climb dunes or let dogs off leashes.
But the senior Mr. Stein said there was "no doubt whatsoever" that Mr. Dillon's remarks were homophobic. "It was a shock to us," he said.
Duncan Osborne, a senior editor at LGNY, a New York City-based fortnightly newspaper for a gay and lesbian audience, was having none of it, saying the charges reflected "a dispute that is really about the concessions."
"The charges of homophobia are really groundless," Mr. Osborne said. "It's a tactic in an economic dispute those guys are having with the National Park Service."
Mr. Dillon, who has taught sensitivity classes to park personnel on dealing with diversity, said he had no intention of resigning. "This is a great park," said Mr. Dillon, who earns $67,000 as superintendent. "I look forward to resigning on my 75th birthday."
In a statement, Dale Ditmanson, an official in the National Park Service regional office in Philadelphia, said the service would investigate the charges by Mr. Lund's group "if and when a complaint is lodged."
The statement said the service viewed Mr. Dillon "as a role model for others in addressing diversity issues."
Edie Shean-Hammond, a spokeswoman for the regional office, said no formal complaint had been received. Mr. Lund, who in addition to being president of Beach is the president of the Property Owners Association of Davis Park and a part-time captain for Sayville Ferries, said a formal complaint would be lodged.
He said the park service was aware of the allegations and should have already begun investigating. "These accusations first surfaced 15 months ago," he said. "How can they honestly say they don't know about them?"
At their news conference, members of Beach stopped short of charging Mr. Dillon with any overt action targeting gays.
But Warren C. McDowell, who identified himself as the president of the Fire Island Tourism Bureau, said last summer a ranger ticketed two men for having sex in a beach area between Fire Island Pines and Cherry Grove known as the meat rack.
Mr. Dillon confirmed that a seasonal ranger issued a ticket for creating a public disturbance to two men who were having sex next to a house where the ranger resided.
Asked whether open-air sex was inappropriate behavior in the park, Mr. Dillon responded: "People visiting a National Park have an expectation that it is gong to be a safe family experience, and rangers have to make sure that anybody visiting a national park is safe and protected."
"Activities like having sex in public is something you don't do anywhere, and it would not be appropriate in a national park either."

HEADLINE: Giving Away Greenhouses for Health

BYLINE: By RITA PAPAZIAN 

 BODY:
WHEN Douglas Jay Schwartz died in a car accident shortly before his 20th birthday in 1987, his parents, Annabel and Fred Schwartz of Westport, wanted a memorial to honor their son's life.
They established the Douglas J. Schwartz Living Foundation, which administers the Greenhouse Grants Program in conjunction with the American Horticultural Therapy Association. The foundation provides greenhouses or matching grants to purchase greenhouses to horticultural therapy programs that serve people with physical, mental and emotional disabilities. 
 Horticultural therapy teaches vocational skills, leading to employment in the horticultural industry. The greenhouses enable the therapy programs to function year-round.
Elizabeth Messer, 33, a landscape architect who teaches at West Virginia University in Morgantown, W. Va., administered the grant program this year for the therapy assocation and the Schwartz family.
Ms. Messer, a member of the association's board of directors, is familiar with the benefits that horticultural therapy can have. Her brother, Walter, 30, had a playground accident when he was 3 years old and has used a wheelchair since. Through horticulture, her brother has improved his communication skills and his ability to function more independently.
"It's a role reversal," Ms. Messer said. "These are people who have been taken care of. Now they are taking care of something. The success is phenomenal at many different levels, especially for the physically disabled who improve their dexterity. Sometimes it's as simple as their using a misting bottle."
There are other, more complex, benefits as well, said Ms. Messer who in 1993 founded and directed a horticultural therapy program at the Misericordia Home, in suburban Chicago suburb, where her brother lives.
"There's such a strong spiritual connection working with plants," Ms. Messer said. "People just feel it; sometimes they might not be able to express it."
Ms. Messer praised the Schwartz family not only because the greenhouses enhance individual horticultural therapy programs and the individuals who benefit by them, but also because the awards program gets the word out about horticultural therapy.
Karen Barnes, a spokeswoman for the Master Gardener Association of Fresno County, Calif., a 1998 recipient said, "The Schwartz family has made the commitment to better the world that we all live in and what a better way to do so than to make it possible to beautify the landscape as well as to engage the mind, hearts and hands in the healing art of horticulture."
Since its founding 10 years ago, the Douglas J. Schwartz Living Foundation has awarded 78 greenhouse grants, worth over a half million dollars. Recently, the Schwartz family announced the 1999 grant awards, totaling $48,400. This year's awards include one free greenhouse and nine 50 percent matching grants toward new greenhouses.
Rubicon Program Inc., of Richmond, Calif., will receive a free greenhouse this month. Since 1975, Rubicon has provided intensive day treatment and outpatient services for chronically disabled adults. It also responds to needs of disadvantaged, unemployed, and homeless individuals through a variety of services, including employment training, housing stabilization, money management services, and intensive case management.
Dr. Carl Gerard, who is the director of mental health services at Rubicon, said the greenhouse would be an adjunct to its Urban Garden Project, which offers horticultural therapy. The program's activities include gardening and landscape tasks under close supervision by a horticultural therapist and life-skill trainers.
"We're thrilled," said Dr. Gerard, of the greenhouse grant. "Our clients will learn to develop new vocabulary skills with the plants."
To be eligible for a greenhouse, the applicant must have or propose a horticultural therapy program and document the program with the people it would serve; demonstrate a financial need; verify staffing; and if applying for a matching greenhouse, document the availability of matching funds.
The Association of Retarded Citizens of Greenwich was one of the first greenhouse recipients. The agency, which was founded in 1951, serves 550 families with special needs. It received a matching greenhouse grant award in 1991. The greenhouse is attached to the association's administrative office building. Outside is a large vegetable garden with eggplant, corn, beans and zucchini and other vegetables. The horticultural program is under the supervision of John Ritchie, a member of the staff at A.R.C. and Walter Jamroga, a horticultural consultant of Stamford and a master gardener.
A.R.C.'s clients grow flowers and vegetables from seed in the greenhouse and then care for them during the growing and selling season.
"I love all the plants. It's one thing I'm good at doing," said Micaela Moye, an A.R.C. client who was working in the greenhouse recently, under Mr. Richie's supervision.
Knowing that the greenhouse programs are successful brings joy to the Schwartz family. Mr. Schwartz said his son was very much like his mother in his love for plants.
"Douglas loved plants; he had 30 plants in his apartment at college," Mr. Schwartz said of his son's days at Syracuse University. "When he came home, he would take more plants back to college with him. We thought the Living Foundation was the best way to keep his name alive.
"What better way to help neglected and abused youth and people with disabilities," Mr. Schwartz added. "There are 78 greenhouses out there. We're serving thousands of people, who may not have had anything to do if it weren't for horticultural therapy."
Mr. Schwartz founded and is president of Sunporch Structures, Inc., a manufacturer of greenhouse kits. He and his son Dean run the company, from offices not far from the Westport home where Mrs. Schwartz tends to her plants in her own greenhouse.
Mrs. Schwartz is known around Westport as the plant lady. She provides and cares for plants at the town's homeless shelters, the town hall, a synagogue and a church.
"They reach out to hand out, but don't pull their hands back to take," said Deborah Gilmore, an accountant in the town hall comptrollers office, filled with Mrs. Schwartz's plants. "They are just wonderful human beings."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
For Calverton, a New Focus on Making Movies

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN

 BODY:
THE sale by the Town of Riverhead of 2,900 acres it owns in Calverton is being delayed until zoning changes can be implemented. But the stage is already set for the first new occupant to move into the property once leased from the Navy by Northrup Grumman.
Under a lease signed July 20 with Lazarus Burman Associates, a Syosset developer in contract with Riverhead to purchase 472 acres of the Calverton site, Camelot Studios of Calverton will take over the 1.1 million square feet of industrial buildings once used by the military contractor to build fighter planes. Camelot intends to convert the complex, which includes huge hangars, into sound studios, which it will then rent out to movie production companies. 
 "Camelot saw the opportunity to take over buildings that would cost them $100 million to duplicate," said Jan Burman, the president of Lazarus Burman. "These buildings have few columns, very high ceilings and huge overhead doors, which makes them ideal for movie production."
Under the terms of a 21-year lease for 322 acres of the site, which was brokered for Camelot by Theodore P. Sasso and Edward F. Fitzsimons, senior managing directors at the Syosset office of Insignia/ESG, the international brokerage firm, Camelot will be paying a net rent of $3 million a year, which means that it also will pay the property taxes and all other expenses. Any improvements will also be the tenant's responsibility. Camelot has a purchase option and can build an additional 900,000 square feet of industrial buildings.
"Camelot identified this site a long time ago when it became clear that this was going to be an excessed facility," said Mr. Sasso. "What made Calverton so attractive to them is that it is much closer to European markets than the West Coast, and many of the movie producers already have homes on the Island."
Camelot's principals declined to be identified until the company moves into Calverton. However, in a written response they said that the five-member board of directors consisted of three institutional investors and two venture capitalists.
They also said that they expected to invest $10 million in improvements to the property and to start operations in the late fall, creating 2,500 jobs once the studios operate at full capacity. Rentals for the 32 sound stages that are expected to be created will range from $2,000 a week for the smallest, 3,000 square feet, to $14,000 a week for the largest, 50,000 square feet.
"Camelot is not competing with New York," the statement said. "Nothing can replace the New York backdrop. We will draw from Los Angeles and Europe and will provide location production support space for New York."
Lazarus Burman, which has formed a subsidiary, Camelot Calverton, to purchase the property, has retained about 155 of the 472 acres on which it intends to develop 1 million square feet of industrial space as it is permitted to do under the proposed zoning change. A 10,000-foot-long runway adjoining the Lazarus Burman site will continue to be owned and maintained by the town.
Mr. Burman signed the purchase contract on June 15, but the closing will not take place until the planned industrial development zoning, which must be approved by the Suffolk County Planning Department, is adopted. That approval is expected next month, said Andrea H. Lohneiss, Riverhead's Community Development Director.
Northrop Grumman closed its operations at the Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant, as the Calverton site was called, in 1996 and laid off 3,000 workers. Since then, the Town of Riverhead, which under an act of Congress received the property from the Navy at no charge, has been working to restore lost jobs and generate tax revenues. The Navy turned over ownership of the property last September.
The town's only revenue so far has been from the National Transportation Safety Board, which has been leasing one of the buildings to house the remains of Flight 800, the TWA airliner that crashed into the Atlantic in July 1996. The remains are being moved to a smaller building on the site.
A re-use strategy plan prepared for the town in 1996 by Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Alschuler, a Manhattan real estate and economic development consulting firm, proposed turning the 550-acre industrial core of the property into an industrial park that would retain the existing buildings, where up to 2 million square feet of additional space could be added, and where the the larger of the two runways would also be retained.
The plan also outlined sports and leisure-oriented uses for the remaining 2,350 acres with the exception of about 500 acres that will be set aside for parks and open space.
The Navy owned a total of 5,900 acres at Calverton, but the 3,000 acres outside the fenced-in portion used by Northrop Grumman is in the Pine Barrens and will be left undeveloped.
LAST year, town officials accepted an offer by First Industrial Realty Trust, a Chicago-based real estate investment trust, to buy 472 acres of the industrial core for $17 million.
But First Industrial, because of management changes, decided to withdraw its offer. Mr. Burman of Lazarus Burman, who had been affiliated with First Industrial but severed his relationship in July 1998, said he subsequently decided to purchase the industrial property on his own.
An offer made to the town in February by Donald J. Trump to purchase the entire site for $55 million was rejected. Mr. Trump originally wanted to bring in a car-racing operator, but when that idea failed, he proposed building 2,000 houses.
"Our plan did not contemplate 2,000 houses," said Ms. Lohneiss. "Our intent is to maximize jobs and the tax base."
The Lazarus Burman deal is one of three the town has been negotiating through its representative, Jack O'Connor, the executive managing director of the Melville office of Grubb & Ellis, an international real estate brokerage.
Two additional offers, on which contracts have not been signed, involve a total of 1,100 acres of vacant land.
Landmark National of New Albany, Ohio, a developer of golf-oriented luxury communities, has offered to purchase 800 acres for $13.6 million. It would develop the property as a 300-room hotel-conference center, two 18-hole golf courses, and up to 300 housing units for buyers 55 and older that would be grouped around the golf courses.
MHC Investments, the sports and entertainment subsidiary of Mentmore Holdings Corporation, a Manhattan-based conglomerate that owns steel, life insurance, entertainment and development companies among other entities, has offered to purchase 300 acres for $5.4 million. The Mentmore plan is to build a skating and sports complex, a family entertainment center and a baseball stadium for a minor league team.
If the two additional deals are signed, the town will still have about 900 acres for sale zoned for a mix of uses. The land which is currently on the market for $20,000 an acre, is likely to increase substantially in value, in some cases doubling in value, once all the pending deals close, Mr. O'Connor of Grubb & Ellis said.
Interest by industrial users in the Calverton site has been extremely strong, said Mr. Burman of Lazarus Burman, noting that he already had prospective users for 300,000 square feet of the 1 million square feet he intends to build. He added that he expected to have the entire 1 million square feet committed within six months.
A major attraction is the designation of 1,248 acres of the site as an economic development zone. Companies that locate within the areas they encompass receive a variety of tax reductions, job incentive tax credits, favorable utility rates and property tax abatements on new construction and improvements.
Mr. Burman said that companies he is currently negotiating with include a boat manufacturer; a high-end furniture, window and door manufacturer; a fabricator of highway signs and a picture-frame manufacturer.
Both counties already have an active film industry, a spillover from New York City's thriving film and television production activities, which often need suburban settings. Mr. Burman said that 8,000 members of the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees already live on Long Island.
Film studio companies have been querying Nassau County about another former Northrop Grumman site, this one in Bethpage, where the Navy intends to turn over 1.2 million square feet of industrial buildings on 105 acres to the county early next year.
One building of 800,000 square feet, has in particular attracted queries from film makers, said Stephen G. Latham, Nassau's Commissioner of Commerce and Industry.
The arrival of Camelot Studios in Calverton should not affect plans for Bethpage, he said. "The closer you are to the city the better it is," he noted. "But I believe there certainly is enough activity out there to allow room for both."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY;
For Hospital Services, Pleasant Settings

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
THE Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center is world famous for its research and treatment of the disease. But at 67th Street and York Avenue on Manhattan's East Side, it is distant from subway lines and can be difficult for patients to reach.
The hospital opened an outpatient clinic in June at 53d Street and Third Avenue in 190,000 square feet of space on the lower floors of what had been an office building. In doing so, it was following the trend to deliver more care to patients on an ambulatory rather than an in-patient basis, rather then admit them to hospitals. 
 It was also seeking to hold onto its share of the medical services market by establishing a more conveniently located clinic, with a friendlier atmosphere than is usually found in a typical hospital setting.
The lobby of what is formally known as the Laurence S. Rockefeller Outpatient Pavilion resembles the entrance to a good hotel rather than a hospital waiting room. Original artwork decorates the walls, soft music plays in the background and small pools with waterfalls add to a calm ambiance.
Upstairs, the diagnostic and treatment areas have been decorated in subdued tones and designed so that changing rooms are adjacent to imaging equipment, meaning that patients in skimpy gowns do not have to walk hallways.
"We tried to create an environment that was as warm and comfortable for patients was we could," said Dr. Paul A. Marks, president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering. "We wanted to make a statement that we can provide high-quality care in a warm environment."
The establishment of satellite facilities by hospitals is being driven in part by the decision of more young doctors to forgo the establishment of independent practices and instead to join groups, such as the DOCS chain in the city and Westchester County, to share costs and reduce risks.
The Memorial Sloan-Kettering treatment center is now seeing 800 patients a day. In a few weeks, St. Vincents Hospital Center will be opening its own cancer-care center in the old Port Authority building on the block bounded by 15th and 16th Streets and Eighth and Ninth Avenues.
Earlier, Beth Israel Medical Center established a broader-based treatment center in what had been the commercial space in Zeckendorf Towers on the east side of Union Square. And the Columbia Presbyterian Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital satellite occupies three floors of an office building at 60th Street and Madison Avenue to serve people who find it difficult to reach its main campus at 168th Street in Washington Heights.
Taking this trend to its logical conclusion, the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital has proposed selling its main building on 64th Street between Second and Third Avenues and using the $41 million in proceeds to establish or enlarge clinics in Harlem and other areas of the city where specialized care is hard to find.
Hospitals in boroughs other than Manhattan and in the suburbs are establishing satellite facilities as well, but the tight market conditions in Manhattan make finding suitable space a more daunting challenge.
Hospitals are setting up these satellite operations for a number of reasons, according to Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents 175 health-care facilities in the metropolitan area.
The most important is cost pressure, he said, adding that "the payers are looking for lower-cost alternatives to inpatient treatment." Meanwhile, technological developments like laser eye surgery and new types of chemotherapy enable treatment on an ambulatory basis for ailments that once required hospital stays.
The association says there were 11.04 million inpatient days at hospitals in New York City in 1990. The figure declined to 8.94 million in 1997, the last year for which statistics are available. At the same time, the number of outpatient treatments grew to 18.16 million in 1997 from 14.79 million in 1990.
Hospital managers are using these new treatment centers to hold on to their existing patients and, perhaps, take a few from their competitors. St. Vincents is opening its new cancer treatment center in partnership with Salick Health Care, a for-profit organization noted for its popularity with cancer patients.
Everyone agrees that cancer care is a growing market with an aging population. The managers hope that a new center plus the Salick touch will attract patients who would otherwise not immediately think of St. Vincents when diagnosed with the disease.
"We were a small player in oncology, only the 11th largest in the city," said Leonard Walsh, the vice president for operations for St. Vincents. "I'd be happy to push that up to No. 3 or 4."
Finding space for these treatment centers in crowded Manhattan has not been easy, hospital executives say. But it has become necessary, as small outpatient clinics at traditional hospitals have become hopelessly overcrowded.
"We were desperate for more space," said John Gunn, an executive vice president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering. "We were swinging from the rafters here." The new space was designed by the Perkins Eastman architectural firm.
In a way, Memorial Sloan-Kettering officials have the late Robert Maxwell to thank for their space in 866 Third Avenue, once known as the Macmillan Building. When Mr. Maxwell's publishing empire collapsed in the early 1990's, Macmillan was sold and its offices were vacated.
Metropolitan Life, which took ownership, put the building on the block in 1997 and the hospital bid $49.5 million for it in association with the Related Companies. However, they lost out to a $50 million offer by the Witkoff Group.
SINCE the hospital is a nonprofit institution, it pays no property tax on real estate it owns, so it was still interested in making a purchase. After considerable negotiation, Steven Witkoff decided to divide the structure into three condominiums: the retail space on the first two floors; a hotel, now a Marriott, in the building's tower on floors 14 through 31, and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering satellite sandwiched between. The hospital bought 200,000 square feet of space, with the Witkoff Group retaining the two other condominiums.
Seeing a high volume of patients at a location far from the main hospital has forced the center's doctors and managers to an all-electronic system for patient records and images. The system will offer doctors and other medical personnel the ability to access lab results, treatment histories and diagnostic images from any of 550 computer terminals in the center's facilities. Use of this system has cut the volume of paper by 40 percent since 1996, officials report.
The image of doctors peering at X-ray pictures clipped to a light box belongs to the past as well. All the diagnostic picture- taking at the center, -- X-rays, CAT scans and magnetic resonance imaging -- will be captured, viewed and analyzed electronically. And because electronic images can be transmitted more easily than a piece of film can be shipped, doctors can consult with colleagues more quickly across the country and across the world.
It was the growing volume of outpatient care for a wide variety of conditions at its main location at 16th Street and First Avenue that drove Beth Israel to seek more space elsewhere. "The buildings we were in were designed in the 1950's and they mixed ambulatory and acutely ill people in an unsettling way," said Peter Kelly, chief operating officer of Beth Israel, which is now working collaboratively with St. Luke's-Roosevelt and Long Island College Hospital under the name Continuum Health Partners.
In addition, officials wanted to eliminate a two-class treatment system, in which patients with private medical insurance were treated by private doctors, while Medicare and Medicaid patents had to wait in an outpatient clinic to be seen by residents.
After a joint venture with a nearby Y.M.H.A. did not work out, Beth Israel started shopping for commercial space, which was available and still reasonably priced in the early 1990's.
When a corporate bankruptcy left 325,000 square feet of condominium office space available on the second to fifth floors of Zeckendorf Towers, Beth Israel paid $34 million for the property. Mr. Kelly concedes that the space was not ideal, with a large central atrium, but says that the location next to the Union Square subway station, the third busiest in the city, was excellent. In addition there is parking in the basement.
And by January 1996, when the Phillips Ambulatory Care Center opened, it was clear that Union Square and its surrounding areas were well on their way to economic revival.
In addition to the area it occupies for itself, Beth Israel leases space in the building to doctors in private practice who are affiliated with the medical center. "When we suggested combining clinic patients with private patients, some people predicted it would be a mess in six months," Mr. Kelly said. "But four year later, it still looks like new."
The Phillips Center space is laid out so each medical specialty has it own small waiting room, to eliminate the "take a number and wait" feel of big waiting rooms. All the waiting rooms face the naturally lighted atrium, which has a sheet metal waterfall as it centerpiece.The space was designed by Larsen Shein Ginsberg & Partners.
The pediatric-care waiting room is furnished with a big fish tank, curved mirrors that reflect distorted images and the inevitable television screen, while the orthopedic and spine treatment areas are near a gym with weights and workout equipment.
As has become fashionable, the breast cancer diagnostic and treatment area is somewhat isolated from other cancer treatment areas. "Breast patients never see the hospital," said Marilyn Halper, executive director of the Phillips cancer center. "As a result, they feel healthier."
In all, there are 44 separate medical modules in the center, plus a store and a 90-seat auditorium for medical meetings and conferences.
MOVING medical services to more convenient locations is a reversal of a long-term development in the medical business, said Susan Parker, director of Columbia Presbyterian's 80,000-square-foot midtown care center at 16 East 60th Street, at Madison Avenue.
"In the past, poor people came to the hospital to have a clean place to get better, while the rich people were taken care of at home," she said "Now we are coming full circle."
The center was first opened in a different location in 1982 and moved to its current location on three floors in the heart of the Madison Avenue shopping area in 1994. The purpose, Ms. Parker said, "was to bring the Columbia faculty to midtown."
Like Beth Israel's ambulatory care center, the Columbia Presbyterian facility contains most medical specialties, including a center for women's health, psychological treatment and dental services.
Patients interested in doing a little shopping before and after treatments do not have far to go. Retailers including Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and Armani are right in the neighborhood. "We're in the middle of the Madison Avenue experience," Ms. Parker said.
Just as technological developments, like improved chemotherapy that reduces the side effects of drugs, have made ambulatory care for cancer more practical, developments like laser eye surgery have made community-based clinics more sensible than a central hospital for Manhattan Eye and Ear.
"In the last five to six years, there has been a paradigm shift in eye care and there is almost no need for overnight stays," said Paul Aschkenasy, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield, who was involved in the proposed sale of the hospital's 64th Street building.
"They went from having an average of 120 overnight stays to six," he added. "The new equipment is small and relatively inexpensive, so it makes sense to have four or five clinics affiliated with local hospitals in underserved areas of the city."
If the transaction, which has been challenged in court, is completed, half the building will be sold to Memorial Sloan-Kettering for an expanded breast cancer treatment center, Mr. Aschkenasy said, and the rest to private developers for probable conversion to housing.
Housing is also on the mind of officials of St. Vincents, which has many of its business offices in a former apartment building on West 12th Street. "We need affordable housing for staff, but 50 percent of this building is offices," said Mr. Walsh, vice president for operations.
Since the growth of ambulatory care will inevitably lead to a reduction in hospital beds, the space required by a hospital will shrink, allowing real estate assets to be redeployed. "If we could convert this building back to housing, we might do a floor as an inn for out-of-town patients," Mr. Walsh said.
St. Vincents has been buying medical practices and establishing clinics in the city's ethnic enclaves, which has produced some unexpected developments for an institution that is owned by the Sisters of Charity, a Roman Catholic order. "We have a clinic in Chinatown that is now open seven days a week," Mr. Walsh said. "The Asian community wants these services on Sunday. It's one of our busiest days."
The latest St. Vincents venture is its Comprehensive Cancer Center, on 15th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, in 70,000 square feet of what were once the street-level loading docks of the Port Authority's Inland Freight Station. The center is planning to start treating patients later this month, with a formal opening on Oct. 4.
Designed by the architectural firm of Gwathmey Siegel, the center has a recessed entrance so that patients arriving by car are protected from bad weather. The lobby is equipped with a concierge desk to make arrivals feel welcome.
The center has two fully equipped operating rooms and the other manifestations of hard science, but the system is intended to relieve anxiety as well as try to cure disease. In the breast-treatment area -- isolated from the rest of the center -- several medical tools and specialties have been grouped to speed diagnoses.
"The standard is to reduce the time to diagnosis," said Jill D. Anderson, executive director of the center. She said radiologists would be available to read images and pathologists to analyze cells taken for testing. "The pathologist will live here," said Ms. Anderson, indicating that the doctor's principal office will be at the center rather than the hospital. "He can read a slide and render an opinion."
She said the goal was to be able to provide a diagnosis the same day as tests are administered, avoiding the worrisome delay of five to 30 days of the past.
BECAUSE of its industrial past of the building, 111 Eighth Avenue, fitting the center into it was not simple, said Charles Gwathmey, the principal architect.
"We had to interact with existing mechanical rooms and loading docks," he said, "and there was a lot of existing infrastructure -- pipes, ducts and so forth -- that we couldn't move."
The upside was that the building is strongly built, with a higher ceiling than would found in a typical office building. This was useful for the four-foot-thick reinforced concrete wall and floors needed to shield the rooms where radiation therapy is administered.
Just as St. Vincents uses community-based clinics to draw patients into its system, Beth Israel bought a chain of primary care centers called DOCS to extend its reach into the boroughs and suburbs.
Dr. Joseph J. Sozio said he started the DOCS operation in 1983 with a formula of emphasizing convenience for customers. "We started in Westchester as a primary care office that was open from eight to midnight, seven days a week," he said. "The idea was to provide people with health care when they needed it."
The DOCS operation began as Doctors Office Center, but later the name was changed to DOCS after a legal dispute with another company. It has grown to 25 centers in Westchester, Manhattan and Brooklyn.
Most of the DOCS centers have been established near shopping centers and other retail locations, for visibility and convenience. For specialized care there are DOCS centers staffed by doctors with specialized training. Major surgery is referred to hospitals in the Continuum partnership.
Dr. Sozio said joining a group operation like DOCS is attractive for doctors coming out of medical school and training laden with debt.
"Setting up an independent practice is both capital and labor intensive and we are in the era of managed care," he said. "With something like this, you have the feel of a private practice with the support of a larger group."

HEADLINE: One Eye On the Ball, The Other On the Majors

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
DEEP below the stands at Mercer County Waterfront Park not too deep, since the stands only have one tier -- is a door with a simple plaque that says "Umpires."
The Trenton Thunder, a Class AA affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, were about to play a night game against the Reading Phillies, and behind the door the game's three umpires, one short of the four used in the majors, were suiting up. 
 The home plate umpire, James Hoye, already in his chest protector and shin guards, resembled anything but the stereotypical big-bellied, square-jawed umpire with the gruff demeanor and gravelly voice to silence whole stadiums and eject ill-tempered managers. Mr. Hoye, who would preside over two dugouts full of cocky ballplayers and savvy coaches plus 7,000 rowdy fans, was a skinny 28-year-old college graduate who looked more like a ballplayer, or even a Boy Scout, than the burly umpire a fan might see on television.
The third-base ump, David Glass, a year younger than Mr. Hoye, could have passed for a bat boy. Only the first-base umpire, Neil Taylor, 29, had a hint of a paunch. But Mr. Taylor, a Phoenix native with a baritone drawl, seemed more suited to punching cows than punching outs. Although that's just what he did, and with panache, taking a hop-step and making a compact jab of his clenched fist on one suitably dramatic pick-off play.
New Jersey has no major league franchise of its own, so the Thunder and five other teams -- one of them, like the Thunder, affiliated with big-league teams (and thus rated Rookie League through Class AAA), and four independent -- are the biggest brand of baseball that fans can see in New Jersey. And the umpires calling the games are either young men like Mr. Hoye, on an up-or-out track toward the majors, or journeymen umpires whose best calls may be behind them.
All three in the crew working the Thunder game have spent most of their young working lives umpiring, and a career in the Major Leagues is the goal. "You're not here if you don't want to be in the majors," Mr. Taylor said.
None of them started out with professional umpiring in mind, and all of them earned college degrees unrelated to sports before they enrolled in umpire school, the first step to working at any level of the minor leagues.
For Mr. Taylor, umpiring was an economic necessity while he majored in finance at the University of Arizona, where he worked the college games. "That's how I put myself through college," he said. "And then I just didn't want to do amateur ball anymore. I knew if I was going to continue I had to go professional or not do it anymore."
Mr. Glass, an Atlanta native who also majored in finance, said he took up umpiring on a lark only after he graduated from the University of Georgia. "When I got out of school, I thought it would be fun to learn how to umpire," he said. "I thought it would be a nice diversion on weekends."
Mr. Hoye said he started umpiring as a hobby and as a way to make extra money in the summer while growing up in Cleveland. He got more serious about it, he said, after entering Ohio State University, where he was a computer science major. "I started umpiring more and more, and I met some guys who worked on Columbus Clippers games in Columbus, Ohio. That's Triple A, International League. And then, I graduated in December of '94, and I went to umpiring school in January."
 
THE DREAMERS
From Extra Money to Full-Time Passion
The three young umpires on the field at Riverfront Park performed like seasoned veterans. Not one call was disputed, and no base was left uncovered. The crew also kept control of the game until a Thunder home run won it in the bottom of the 12th.
With constant hand signals, constant eye contact, and rotations that on one play precisely paralleled the base runners' double steal, the umpires interacted with a sophistication that only the keenest fan would notice, much less appreciate.
"For the most part, these umpires are pretty good," said James Gross, 70, of Ewing Township, a lifetime observer of minor league baseball. "Yeah, they really hustle. You can tell, those are the ones who are going places."
That is their hope, anyway, especially after 22 big league umpires resigned last month in what was meant to be a labor ploy of a mass resignation. Major League Baseball accepted 13 of them; a complaint by the union with the National Labor Relations Board is pending.
Mr. Hoye said "there's a real good possibility" that several of his colleagues in the Class AA Eastern League would be bumped up to AAA next year as the Class AAA umpires moved to the big leagues. "Generally, it's usually one year at each level of A," he explained, as he carved into a slice of overdone pot roast brought into the umpire's locker room after the Thunder game. "Now, there's three levels in A, there's rookie ball, low A and high A. Usually, two years of three years in Double A. Rarely does a guy go one year in Double A and then go to Triple A, just because Double A's usually the better ball, you learn a lot of stuff down here. So, usually, a guy won't be in AAA before his sixth year.
"To become a major league umpire, you start to fill in. Then they would send you to American League spring training, and then you would, hopefully, get called up during the season and fill in for vacations. That could go for six, seven, eight years, called up and down without a contract."
"By then," Mr. Taylor interjected, "you're talking 15 years, getting your big league contract then."
In May, the 230 umpires who work in the minor leagues that are affiliated with Major League Baseball voted to create their own union, the Minor League Umpires Association. They have yet to negotiate a contract, however, and Mr. Hoye said they are still looking for a lawyer.
Money, of course, is an issue.
The Class AA umpires start at $2,300 a month over their five-month season, although, Mr. Taylor noted, "We get a hundred dollars more because we're veterans of the league."
They are not paid at all during the off season. Mr. Taylor worked as a collection agent for a watch company last winter. Mr. Smith did financial consulting along with his brother in Atlanta. Mr. Hoye said, "I drove a beer truck last winter."
Their meal allowance may be what helps keep them trim. "Seventeen dollars, that's the per diem," Mr. Hoye said. "Our clubhouse dues range from $3 to $5 per day, so each of us will pay $5 per day for the food in the locker room and the guy that brings us towels. So that drops us down to $12 per day. So we're struggling."
Hotel accommodations, arranged by the home team, range from Hiltons to Quality Inns in scary neighborhoods. The three-man crew gets two rooms, so they must work out who gets the solo room. The McIntosh Inn, the hotel in Bensalem, Pa., where umpiring crews are put up for Thunder games, "could be better," Mr. Hoye said. "Sometimes you wish there was a little more of a standard, especially when you get farther up. You know, Trenton, they have 7,000 people here every night. They pack them in here, you know. So an extra hotel room, a little nicer place, you wonder."
Unlike Major League umpires, and occasionally their AAA counterparts, who fly between cities, minor league crews split driving duties, usually in vans provided by the leagues. In Class A ball, the umpires drive their own cars and submit gas vouchers.
"You have a game like tonight, and then have to drive 400 miles. Whew!" Mr. Hoye said.
 
CAREER PATH
Many Are Called, Few Are Chosen
Professional baseball's lower echelons are often lumped together as the "minor leagues" despite a widely disparate mix of leagues, some affiliated with Major League Baseball, some independent.
The teams in the 16 affiliated leagues are what make up Minor League Baseball, a trademark name of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, an umbrella group based in St. Petersburg, Fla.
Minor League Baseball umpires are employed jointly by the American or National League and by the Professional Baseball Umpire Corporation, said Pat O'Conner, the association's vice president for administration.
Much as players are drafted out of school, Minor League Baseball umpires are selected by the umpire corporation after graduation from a five-week course at an accredited umpiring school. Currently there are two such schools in Florida -- the Jim Evans Academy of Professional Umpiring in Kissimmee and the Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School in Daytona Beach.
Umpires are selected by the corporation's evaluators at camps held at end of March. The past two years, the camp was held at the Coco Expo, in Cocoa, Fla., the former spring training camp of the Houston Astros. College baseball teams provide the action.
"P.B.U.C. will tell schools how many graduates they would like to see during an evaluation period," Mr. O'Conner said. "If we know we're going to have 15 jobs, we'll invite 30 grads."
There were 37 invited this year and 35 the year before. Of the roughly 230 umpires in the affiliated minor leagues each year, 15 or so retire. Only one umpire was elevated to the big leagues in 1998, Mr. O'Conner said.
"This year will be substantial," he added, referring to the 22 resignations by Major League umpires. "We'll know at the end of this year how many umpires will be released."
As with players, minor league umpires earn far less than money than their counterparts in the majors, although the disparity is far narrower. Salaries for big league umpires start at about $75,000 a year, compared with $1,800 a month or $9,000 over the season, for umps in Rookie League, the lowest order of affiliated baseball. Class AAA pay starts at $3,400 a month. Minor League umpires get health insurance.
The professional baseball association ranks the 16 affiliated minor leagues as Class A, AA, AAA. In turn, each team is affiliated with a Major League franchise. For example, the Thunder plays in the Class AA Eastern League, and is a Boston Red Sox affiliate.
New Jersey's other affiliated team is the New Jersey Cardinals of the New York-Penn League, a Class A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals who play at Frankford's Skylands Stadium in Sussex County.
Four of the six professional baseball teams in New Jersey belong to independent leagues. In fact, half the six teams in the independent Atlantic League, founded in 1997, are in the Garden State. They are the Newark Bears, the Atlantic City Surf and the Somerset Patriots of Bridgewater. The fourth independent team, the New Jersey Jackals, who play in Yogi Berra Stadium at Montclair State University, are in the Northern League.
And while independent league teams are not officially designated A, AA, of AAA, their front offices, players, fans and umpires insist the quality of play and officiating is comparable to Minor League Baseball's, somewhere between Class AA and AAA.
Indeed, crossovers are not uncommon, and the Atlantic League's 10 full-time umpires went to the same umpiring schools attended by affiliated and Major League Baseball umpires, and most of the Atlantic League umpires once worked in the affiliated ranks.
Full-time work in the affiliated leagues is the career path to the majors. Still, most migration seems to flow from affiliated to independent ball, especially as careers head into extra innings.
 
THE VETERANS
Glimpsing the Big Time From Far Below
Michael DeCello was a 58-year-old substitute umpire for Trenton Thunder minor league games who thought his chances of umpiring a New York Yankees game had long since past. But a beam collapse at Yankee Stadium on April 13, 1998, gave him a moment in the House that Ruth Built. The collapse canceled the next day's regular season game, giving coaches a chance to evaluate prospects on their Norwich Navigators farm team in an exhibition against the Yanks themselves. But the American League umpires had decided to take the day off and their reservists in Class AAA ball were busy, so someone found Mr. DeCello.
"I was sitting in my house about 10 o'clock and my phone rang," said Mr. DeCello, an administrative analyst with the New Jersey Department of Transportation. "I says, 'You're kidding me.' So the guy says to me, 'Here's my number, call me back.' Sure enough, I got through to his office, and he explained to me he wanted me there at 11 o'clock."
"I was absolutely floating on air," he said. "The cop said, 'Where you going?' I said, 'I'm the umpire for today's game.' He goes, 'Come right in.' I parked my car right next to Joe Girardi's."
He also got to kid a good-natured Derek Jeter about Mariah Carey, hear Bernie Williams play guitar, and scoop a handful of hallowed ground from the infield. The Yankees paid him $150, far short of the $240 per day that big league umps get just for hotel and food, but more than the $65 Mr. DeCello gets for Thunder games.
"I'll tell you something, it was quite a moving experience to walk on the same spot where past umpires had called World Series games," he said. Mr. DeCello said he drove home "very slowly."
"That night I had to do a Rutgers University game in Newark," he said. "I'm sitting on the field over there and I'm saying to myself, 'Jeez I just left Yankee Stadium and here I am doing Rutgers-Newark.' It wasn't so much a letdown, it was more like, what a swing," he said. "Welcome back to the real world."
The real world for minor league umpires can be found at parks like the Atlantic City Sand Castle, home field of the Atlantic City Surf, and the brand-new Waterfront Park, home of the Newark Bears. Both teams are independent, which makes them a big step farther from the major leagues than affiliated teams are.
Unlike Mr. Hoye, the up-and-comer in Trenton, Bob Willman, 50, an Atlantic League umpire, looks like the veteran professional umpire that he is. Solidly built, with a shaved head to make him look extra tough, he is the league's umpire-in-chief. His experience includes stints in various affiliated leagues, including the Class AAA International League. In 1991, Mr. Willman worked home plate before 66,000 fans at Riverfront Stadium in Pittsburgh for a National League game between the Pirates and the Montreal Expos.
His experience also includes 17 years dealing blackjack and other games in Atlantic City, where he lives, and where his involvement with the fledgling league began a few years ago with an effort to build support for the Sand Castle. "I didn't even know what I what I wanted to do," Mr. Willman said. "I just knew I wanted to be involved."
Asked if he still thinks about the major leagues, Mr. Willman points out that he is under contract with the Atlantic League. "Right now, it's a moot point to even think about it," he said.
But one of Mr. Willman's Atlantic League colleagues, John Ramsey, does think about the majors. Mr. Ramsey, 34, who played catcher at Kearny High School and later at William Paterson College, said he had wanted to be a major league umpire since he was 19. But it was 11 years after he first attended umpire school at age 20 that Mr. Ramsey got his first professional umpiring job in 1996, in the independent Northern League. He returned a call from a league official on a Monday night, "and Tuesday morning I was on a plane to Fargo, N.D.," he said. "It was great, I was elated to be, finally, in some kind of professional baseball, even though it was independent."
His ambition cost him a fiancee. "She wanted to do stuff during the summer and I was out umpiring," he said.
And even his wife of three months, Lisa, knows that umpiring is his first priority. "She knows, we have an understanding," he said. So far, baseball has not divided the couple, who live in Montclair, and they travel together on weekends in their new Volvo, staying in hotel rooms paid for by the Atlantic League. For Somerset Patriot games in Bridgewater and Bears games in Newark, Mr. Ramsey commutes.
Mr. Ramsey said he gives "100 percent" to his day job as a sales manager with a security company, Sanitrol in Rutherford, from which he often heads directly to a night game. He said he would quit his day job if an offer came that took him closer to the big leagues. "If the affiliated ranks offered us contracts, we'd be crazy to say no," Mr. Ramsey said, sipping a beer with fellow crew members in the umpires' locker room after a Surf game on a recent Saturday night.
Mr. Hoye, the young Class AA umpire, is philosophical about his chances of making it to The Show.
"The easiest way to look at it is: Neil and I went to umpire school in 1995, and Dave went in '96," he said. "If I'm still sitting in Double A and all my class are in Triple A, and then Dave's class of '96 is all in Triple A, I might have to say to myself, 'Well, what am I still doing?' Like, hey, it was great while I tried it, but I just don't have it anymore."
 
Fighting Not to Be in a League of Her Own
 THE independent Atlantic League wants to be viewed on a par with the leagues affiliated with Major League Baseball. Perry Barber, an Atlantic League umpire, is carrying on another of baseball's struggles for equality.
Ms. Barber, 46, of Manhattan, is one of 10 full-time umpires in the Atlantic League, in which four of the six teams play in New Jersey, and one of two women known to be calling balls and strikes in professional baseball. The other, Maria Papageorgiou of Rock Island, Ill., was hired earlier this year by the Professional Baseball Umpire Corporation, run by the minor league teams affiliated with big league organizations. She was sent to Florida's sub-Class A Pioneer League. "We've been few and far between, unfortunately," Ms. Barber said.
As a trivia buff and a one-time Jeopardy contestant, Ms. Barber said she became a baseball fan after she read up on it as a trivia category in the late 1970's. "By 1981 I was completely hooked," she said. "That was the summer the major league strike happened, and I just started umpiring Little League just to have some association with baseball. I wasn't deterred by my shortcomings, although there were many people, I'm sure, who thought I should be, and did many things to try to make me feel inadequate, like I didn't belong or something. As they still do sometimes.
"The simple, cold, hard truth is there is opposition to women's participation in organized baseball, and to deny it is to have your head in the sand," she said
Ms. Barber, who said she is "married to baseball," attended the Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School in Florida in 1982, when she dragged her twin sister, Warren, along for support. She was passed over by Minor League Baseball that year, and again when she re-enrolled at Wendelstadt in '83, '84 and '85. But she starting calling intra-squad games for the New York Mets, where she met Bud Harrelson, the former shortstop and coach, who was the Atlantic League's first president.
The Atlantic League does make some accommodations for her; each locker room has a special shower and dressing area for her.
"I always tell myself," said Ms. Barber, a songwriter who used to open for a very young Bruce Springsteen. "I'll know that I've made some mark on history if I ever see myself as a Jeopardy question: 'Who is the fifth woman in professional baseball?' " STEVE STRUNSKY

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Three New Red-Brick Town Houses;
A Genteel Touch for TriBeCa

 BODY:
A row of three five-story red-brick town houses with penthouses are scheduled to go into construction next month on Reade Street in TriBeCa, the first row of new single-family houses to be built in the neighborhood in 150 years.
Named the Reade Street Houses, they will go up on a site between Greenwich and Hudson Streets, where clearance is nearly completed. Though modern in design, the houses will pay homage to a time before warehouses and office towers replaced all but a few private homes in the area. 
 "They take the classic essence of the town house and marry it with a downtown loft feeling," said John L. Petrarca, who lives on the block and is a partner at Guenther Petrarca, the architect for the project.
The developer is Downtown Development L.L.C., a joint venture of Guenther Petrarca, Wildman & Bernhardt Construction Inc. and Hamlin Ventures of Manhattan. The houses are on the market through Bruce L. Ehrmann of the firm of Stribling Wells & Gay for $4.2 million. Occupancy is expected in March.
Downtown Development acquired the 4,125-square-foot site last year from the family that ran a factory that produced pats of butter under the Cremoland name for decades. The factory closed in 1995.
After demolition for new construction began in June, the project came to an abrupt halt because of an accident on the site that proved fatal to Richard Wersan, the foreman of the construction crew. A month later the demolition work resumed.
The houses, with 25 feet of frontage on Reade Street, will have 6,700 square feet of space and basement vaults of 1,000 square feet, usable for a pool or music studio or wine cellar. Facades will feature stone and cast-iron details, blending with surrounding buildings in the nearby TriBeCa West Historic district.
The houses will have a limestone central staircase, a rear glass staircase and a private elevator. Two will have drive-in garages. A ground-floor skylit eat-in kitchen includes Bulthaup cabinets and Viking appliances.
A double-height parlor, featuring floor-to-ceiling windows, a formal dining room and butler's pantry, can be combined into a 1,338-square-foot entertainment area on the second floor. There is a fireplace in the parlor, as well as in the fourth floor master bedroom. Three more bedrooms can be found on the fifth floor. A guest room or den is on the third floor, and there are two tiers of terraces at the roof.
Although details are provided down to the polished chrome Dornbracht towel ring and Julius Blum metal handrail, buyers have a chance to custom-fit interiors over the next couple of months. The ecological design includes geothermal heating and cooling and nontoxic glues and paint.
Two similar town houses -- one the architect plans for his family on the block and an 8,500-square-foot town house at 333 Greenwich Street -- are to be completed later. Only 2,854 one- and two-family town houses now exist in Manhattan, according to the Real Estate Board of New York.

HEADLINE: THE ENVIRONMENT;
Fuel Company Proposes Dumping Dredged Silt, Touching Off a Dispute

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: SANDY HOOK

 BODY:
On a recent breezy morning, four miles east of here, the Atlantic was a deep blue under the azure sky as whitecaps and glints of sunlight danced on the two-foot chop. There was no hint of the federally designated ocean cleanup site 53 feet below the waves.
"It's as beautiful as any other surface," said Andrew J. Willner, New York-New Jersey Baykeeper for the American Littoral Society in Sandy Hook, bobbing in a powerboat. "That's the beauty -- for the corps -- of ocean dumping. It's like sweeping something under the rug." 
 Kristen Milligan, a scientist with Clean Ocean Action, concurred: "Out of sight, out of mind.".
But the dumping ground has been very much on some people's minds lately as a fuel oil company, Castle Astoria Terminals, seeks approval from the United States Army Corps of Engineers to use the site to dump 90,000 cubic yards of silt that the company hopes to dredge from its tanker berths in the Astoria section of Queens, N.Y. Environmental advocates who believe the corps is predisposed to approve the application are trying hard to make sure the issue of dumping is not swept under the rug.
The cleanup area off Sandy Hook, known as the Historic Area Redemption Site, or HARS, surrounds a two-square-mile area six miles offshore that is commonly known as the mud dump, where dumping has been concentrated throughout the century. It is a gooey patch of ocean floor used as a dumping ground mainly for toxic sludge dredged from shipping channels and berths in the New York area. Ms. Milligan said barge skippers would open their hull's bay doors like toxic bombardiers, sending mounds of contaminated mud to sea floor -- and wherever else the current carried it.
Restrictions on the type of material dredged up and permitted to be dumped were tightened by Federal regulators in July 1996, when the 16-square-mile cleanup area was designated. Even so, the Astoria silt has been judged by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency as clean enough to be dumped on top of the existing sediment. A comment period is set to expire tomorrow, although no date has been set for a decision.
Environmentalists and others opposed to Castle Astoria's application insist that the silt contains higher levels of some contaminants than is already at the dump site, and that approving the project would amount to legalizing pollution of the ocean. "You cannot clean up an area by capping it with material that is more contaminated," Ms. Milligan said.
Representative Frank Pallone and Senator Robert Torricelli are among the New Jersey officials who have written to the corps opposing the project. Governor Whitman has remained publicly neutral on the application, deferring to the judgment of the corps, for which the Clean Ocean Action has criticized her.
Castle Astoria says the project is necessary to keep the berths deep enough to accommodate the tankers. Oil carried by the tankers is then used to heat businesses, schools and hospitals that buy oil directly from Castle or from oil dealers who buy from Castle. "The city runs, to a large extent, on fuel oil, and it's got to come from someplace," said Michael Meadvin, Castle's lawyer. "It's as simple as that."
The application could also have ramifications for future dredging projects in the region, where port officials say 170,000 jobs and $20 billion in economic activity are dependent on the shipping industry.
"Dredging is vital to commerce," said Allen Morrison, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "If Castle Astoria's material meets those standards, its disposal as capping material at the mud dump, or HARS, should be allowed."
On a recent overcast morning, the steel gray waters of Castle Astoria's two berths, where Steinway Creek branches off from the East River, were not nearly as appealing as the ocean off Sandy Hook. The company's neighbors include a Consolidated Edison generating plant to the west, New York City's Bowery Bay Sewage Treatment Plant to the east and Rikers Island across the river. The Steinway & Sons piano factory next door is heated by Castle oil.
The company handles about eight million barrels of oil a year delivered on two dozen oceangoing tankers and about 150 barges, loaded onto other barges and up to 350 trucks a day in winter. The barges are not a problem, Mr. Carey said. But the tankers require a depth of about 35 feet, and the berths are as shallow as 25 feet on their southern end, which extend into the creek, a dead end, forcing the tankers, which range from 600 to 1,000 feet long, to pump their oil into forward compartments to back into the berths on an uneven keel.
Depending on how much longer the silt is allowed to accumulate, Mr. Carey said, the terminal, which employs 350 people, may no longer be viable. Castle's other terminal, in the Bronx, does not have a silt problem because it lies directly on the East River, where a current of five miles an hour carries the sediment along.
Opponents of Castle's application said there have been several oil spills at the site since the silt was tested, although company officials said only one -- in January -- occurred in the area being dredged and involved only 100 gallons of heavy-grade No. 6 oil that was fully recovered. Corps officials said they were aware of the spill and would determine whether new silt testing was needed.
The cost of dredging is about $7 a cubic yard or a total of $630,000 if the silt is ultimately dumped in the ocean. Environmentalists want the material disposed of differently, such as by using the silt to cap landfills. But Mr. Meadvin said that other methods of disposal, which would require some cleaning of the silt, costs up to 10 times as much. The company, a family-owned venture based in Harrison, N.Y., simply cannot afford it, he said.
The mud dump, an alphabet soup of PCB's (polychlorinated bi-phenols), PAH's (polycyclic aeromatic hydrocarbons), dioxin and other harmful substances, should not be confused with a sewage sludge dumping ground 106 miles off shore that is still fully active.
The chief concern of Clean Ocean Action and other opponents of the dumping is PAH's, which cause deformities in marine life. Ms. Milligan said testing indicated that PAH's were at a level of 750 to 1,500 parts per billion in the tissue of worms found in the Astoria silt. Tissue of worms at the HARS site had 550 parts per billion.
That may be so, say the dumping proponents. But the acceptable level for PAH's in marine animals is 40,000 parts per billion, as set by the E.P.A., said Mary Mears, a spokeswoman for the agency. And, Ms. Mears said, the Astoria silt is cleaner than what is at the dumping site in terms of many other kinds of contaminants.
"It's factual to say that the levels of that particular contaminant are higher than in the HARS, but it's also somewhat misleading because we don't agree with what they're saying about what the levels should be," Ms. Mears said.
Proponents of the dumping project criticized Clean Ocean Action's attack on the application, noting that the group embraced the new restrictions on the mud dump when they were announced in July 1996. Under the restrictions, dredge material is judged as category I, II or III, with I being the cleanest, and the only category permitted on the dump site. Some category I material dredged from local waters has already been dumped on the site since restrictions were tightened.
"The fact is, this is category I material and it is suitable for remediation," said Monte Greges, chief of the dredged material management section of the Corps of Engineers' New York district.
But Cindy Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action, said specific levels of contaminants for each category were not announced by the environmental agency until December 1997, when her group objected to some levels as too high.
"The bottom line is, the goal is to clean up the area out there that's harmful to marine life," Ms. Zipf said. "This does not meet that goal."

Firefighter Applicants Short of Expected Total

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:
The deadline for applying to be a member of one of the state's 69 paid fire departments has been extended two weeks until Sept. 3 because applications fell far short of the number anticipated, said Bill O'Brien, spokesman for the state Department of Personnel.
At least 10,000 applications were anticipated when the recruitment campaign began in June, but only 5,000 had been received by the middle of last week. Some 200,000 applications were made available by the state to supplement the ones distributed by local departments. 
 Approved applicants will take tests in November. The tests are the first statewide exams given in 19 years, following a long standoff with the Federal Government over the test's fairness to minorities. The new exam is made up of a physical test, a written test and a test of teamwork skills, Mr. O'Brien said.
Applications may have fallen short because of the good economy, which gives people more job options, Mr. O'Brien said. KAREN DeMASTERS

HEADLINE: Roomies on Wall Street

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
ON a Saturday afternoon that offered the first break from an 80-plus-hour work week, investment bankers lay bronzing on the rooftop terrace of 45 Wall Street. Sipping Evian and Corona beer, they took in a 29th-floor view of the landmarks of the financial district, close enough to reach out and touch: the Goldman Sachs building, the New York Stock Exchange, the World Trade Center, the J. P. Morgan building.
Other residents worked out in the building's mirrored penthouse gym, or shot pool in a wood-paneled lounge. The logos on their workout clothes formed a lineup of prestigious names: Harvard, Wharton, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch -- all alma maters and employers. 
 The residents of 45 Wall Street are relatively young. They are urban. They are brazenly professional. The converted office building in which they live, one block from the New York Stock Exchange, has become known as an upscale dormitory of sorts for armies of fresh college graduates, who invade Wall Street from the country's premier universities.
"The question here is what Wall Street company do you work for, not what do you do," said James Im, a University of Chicago graduate, who was doing stomach crunches in the gym. "Forty-five Wall is famous. It's known to be an analysts' dormitory. If you're an analyst, you know someone who lives in 45 Wall."
To most financial investors, a Wall Street analyst is a respected stock picker. But "analyst" is also the title given to the foot soldiers of the industry who fill the lowest level of the Wall Street hierarchy. They put in back-breaking hours, pull all-nighters regularly and grease the capitalist machine through I.P.O.'s and mergers and acquisitions. They are intimate with Microsoft Excel and Powerpoint. "You're in the bottom of the food chain," said Valerie Zonenberg, 23, a Harvard University graduate who has worked for two years for a major Wall Street firm and lives at 45 Wall.
When it was converted two years ago to residential use, the building, which is managed by the Rockrose Development Corporation, was designed for professionals, with home offices; some apartments even have high-speed Internet access. But few take advantage of that option. Today, half of the residents work in the financial industry. The average age is 28. The average salary is $70,000.
The address has resonance. The Wall Street subway stop on the No. 2 and No. 3 trains is beneath the building. "It's all part of the mystique: 'I live on Wall Street, I work at Goldman Sachs,' " said one recent college graduate, tanning on the rooftop of 45 Wall, where he shares a three-bedroom apartment with two other analysts for $3,400 a month. "It's a culture. You walk downstairs in the morning and everyone is in suits. You feel like you're at the center of the world. Everything happens here."
The location is convenient, even though the financial district becomes a ghost town after 6 P.M. Half the residents live less than a 15-minute walk from work. "From door to desk, it takes me 2 minutes," David Saenz, an analyst with J. P. Morgan, said during a round of pool in the lounge.
Analysts say the proximity helps ease the life style. "When you are working 100 hours a week, you want to be able to walk to work," said Ms. Zonenberg, who pays $1,400 a month for a studio apartment. "Especially when you have three hours of sleep at night, you want to be able to run home and take a quick shower."
She is one of a group of people fulfilling a high-cost, high-payoff contract. They have agreed to serve as Wall Street's drudges for two or three years, in exchange for another blue-chip credential on their resumes. For many, Wall Street is just a stop on the way to business or law school. Others will stay in the financial industry. It's a combination rat race and paper chase. The end of the road is a place in the American aristocracy, earned through grit and luck.
The doormen at 45 Wall don't find it unusual when residents stumble in at 4 or 5 A.M. Tenants regularly arrive home as others are leaving for work. "They shower, sleep for two hours, get up and go to work again," said Thomas Wright, who was on the midnight to 8 A.M. door shift in the marble and redwood lobby. Doormen often give wake-up calls to rouse the employees from their naps. "I have some people come in so disgusted, they say the job is killing them," Mr. Wright said.
The analysts concede that their salaries are comfortable for a first job, but they are quick to point out that computed hourly, they are within a few dollars of minimum wage. "The joke is a McDonald's worker makes more per hour than we do," Ms. Zonenberg said. "Eighty hours a week is two jobs."
Residents of 45 Wall say they find strength in sharing the ordeal. "When you come home at 3 in the morning, you can always expect someone to walk in at the same time, also in a suit, also as exhausted as you are," Ms. Zonenberg said. "In the elevator ride, you're too tired to talk but you give each other that nod: 'I'm there, too. Thanks for being there.' "
"I don't see how they can work 100 hours a week," Mr. Wright said. "I tell them, 'Your health comes first. I don't care how much money you are making.' "
In return for the fatherly counsel, the financial professionals offer their doormen advice of their own. "I don't know anything about investments, but my tenants told me what to do with my money," Mr. Wright related. "They said take my money out of my savings account. Now, I'm in the stock market," he said, brandishing the current issue of the Janus fund report.
In many ways, the building is a high-class dormitory at sky-high Manhattan real estate prices. The young professionals live in groups of up to five in an apartment. Living rooms are partitioned to carve out bedrooms and economize. Bookshelves are filled with textbooks from summer finance training courses like "Essentials of Accounting" and "Principles of Corporate Finance."
Like many dorms, 45 Wall even has a common area -- the rooftop lounge, complete with pool table, big-screen television and a party-size wrap terrace, which can be rented for $100 a hour. Parties are a big part of life at 45 Wall. "Before, I had sublet in a building with older tenants," said Novisi Atadika, a recent Harvard graduate, who works at Credit Suisse First Boston. "There, they posted up signs that said, 'I'm sorry, I'm having a party.' Whereas here it's commonplace to party." Instead of beer kegs and pretzels, parties at 45 Wall typically have full bars and caterers.
Children are unusual, though becoming slightly more common. Older people wandering the hotel-like hallways are presumed to be parents of residents. "You are 35 in this building, you stand out," Ms. Zonenberg said. "If you are 45, you are the parent visiting the kids, bringing food to a son."
Other differences between college and the real world: the furniture is nicer, the televisions more expensive. Ikea is the furniture store of choice for the young professionals. This being Wall Street, the building has an indoor practice golf course. It also has a dry cleaning service, critical to appearing well groomed in a culture that hasn't fully taken to summer casual. Dry cleaning bills for the young analysts can approach $100 a month.
Residents rarely cook, and kitchens are barren. The analysts eat breakfast on the way to work, lunch in the office and dinner at a restaurant, traditionally paid for by companies for employees who stay late. Even when they're not working, the residents dine out or order in. The doormen see a steady stream of pizza and Chinese food deliveries on weekends.
"I have not once shopped for groceries in a year," Mr. Im said. "It's not out of the ordinary to go a few days without toilet paper and not care enough to do anything about it." His apartment refrigerator contains water, beer and leftover Chinese food. Ms. Zonenberg ate at home so seldom that she didn't buy a dining table and chairs until eight months into her lease.
For those who actually do purchase groceries, the scarcity of supermarkets in the financial district leaves them scrambling to stock their cabinets. Many analysts will have the company cars that drive them home make a loop to 24-hour groceries and delis so they can pick up basic necessities at 2 in the morning.
"Free meals, free rides home, free cell phones and pagers -- it appears to be a glamorous life style," one analyst said. "But there's no such thing as a free lunch. It's hard work. I would give up all those free meals to come home earlier."
Residents compare life at 45 Wall to a financial version of "Friends." The narrow pool of colleges and companies makes for only a few degrees of separation between people. "It's a great way to start a conversation," Mr. Saenz said. " 'Hey, you work at Salomon? I have a friend who works at Salomon.' 'Really? What group?' "
But the intensity and sameness of the work can result in narrow discussions. "You can't say, 'I saw this movie' or 'I went on vacation' because your life is filled with work," Mr. Im said.
Unsurprisingly, 45 Wall reflects the demographics of the financial industry. There are two men to every woman. Some say the building, like the Street, has a socially conservative cast. "There are fewer other gays in the building than anywhere else I've lived in New York City," said Jim Nellis, 45, a a senior vice president at Commpeople, a telecommunications company, who is one of the few baby-boomer residents. "Wall Street is so closeted."
Ms. Zonenberg, who still keeps her stuffed animals next to her financial textbooks, said that for her a building that is an extension of college is just fine for now. "I'm not ready to be in a place where there are babies, dogs and cats and real families everywhere," she said. "We know this is not the real world."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Upstarts' Risky Challenge to Baby Bells

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
FOR a long time, investing in the local telephone business meant buying sleepy yet bedrock-solid stocks like those of the Baby Bells. Substantially protected from competition until the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Bells and other local phone companies provided steady if unspectacular earnings growth, healthy dividends and next to no surprises.
As investments, these companies are still relatively conservative and stable. But decades-old companies no longer have the local communications business to themselves. Dozens of upstarts, known in the communications business as competitive local exchange carriers (or CLEC's, pronounced "SEE-lecks"), are out to provide competition in local communications markets ranging from phone service to corporate data applications. The companies hope to use new communications technologies and lean cost structures to undercut the local giants while still making money. 
 Their stocks provide investors a new way to participate in the local end of the communications revolution, but they are also an entirely different breed of investment vehicle -- risky and erratic, because of their dependence on borrowed funds. From mid-June to mid-August, most of these stocks lost about 20 percent of their market value, though they have started to crawl back.
"They bring a lot of rocket fuel to a portfolio," said Mark Kastan, who tracks the stocks for Merrill Lynch. "They could significantly enhance performance. But it's obviously high-risk, high-reward."
Consider the RCN Corporation, one of the few upstarts that is aimed at residential customers, rather than at businesses. Along with Nextlink Communications Inc., which was founded by Craig O. McCaw, the cellular phone pioneer, RCN is one of Mr. Kastan's favorite CLEC's.
RCN's stock opened 1998 at $17.0625, climbed as high as $30.625 and then fell that October to $8.75 as the bottom fell out of the high-yield debt market. By April 1999, the shares had surged to $54.50. But with interest rates rising, RCN's shares have swooned again, closing on Friday at $39.50.
"MCI was the only competitive player on the long-distance landscape for a long time, and it was an unbelievably volatile company," said Alex J. Mandl, chairman of Teligent Inc., a local service provider that uses fixed wireless links. "In a sense, I think you're seeing a similar situation in the local environment," he said. "As 30, 40, 50 percent of the local market is occupied by new players, I think that volatility will go away."
In the meantime, said Alex W. Peters, a communications analyst for Franklin Advisors and co-manager of the Franklin Global Utilities fund, "these are high-beta stocks, so they outperform the market in good times and underperform in bad times." Among Mr. Peters' favorites is McLeodUSA Inc., one of the more established of the upstarts, which focuses on the Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions.
Perceptions of whether times are good or bad for the CLEC's tend to change swiftly, because creating local networks is very expensive. Pulling optical fiber under downtown streets, for instance, can cost tens of millions of dollars in one city. So to maintain their growth, almost all of them will have to return to the high-yield well in the next 12 to 18 months. If interest rates go up, so will the companies' cost of borrowing. Because Wall Street values them on a discounted cash flow model that focuses mostly on results in some distant year, a small change in interest rates can imply a big swing in long-term valuations. Some Wall Street analysts estimate that a 1 percent change in interest rates can result in a 15 percent change in the value of one of these companies.
But there have been other, more industry-specific concerns, too -- for example, the impact of a proposal by a coalition of big local and long-distance phone companies to lower the per-minute fees that long-distance carriers pay to their local counterparts for beginning and ending calls. In exchange, the local carriers would be able to charge their customers higher fixed monthly fees. If approved by Federal regulators, the plan would have a small but negative impact on many of the local upstarts because they focus on serving high-volume business users.
But the essential issues facing investors in all these stocks concern the basic structure of the telecommunications industry, not relatively small regulatory questions.
"Fundamentally, is the 100-year-old AT&T and Bell company network the network for the next 10 or 20 years, given the way people communicate now over the Internet?" said David C. McCourt, RCN's chairman. "If the answer is no, then a basket of CLEC's is a good investment. If the answer is yes, then CLEC's are not such a great idea."

HEADLINE: GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS;
A Suburb Sees the Future In Its Old Downtown

BYLINE: By JOEL KOTKIN; Joel Kotkin is a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy. His column on the Main Street economy appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: grassrts@nytimes.com

DATELINE: DOWNERS GROVE, Ill.

 BODY:
ELLEN K. DEAN has seen the future of this middle-class Chicago suburb, and it lies in its past.
Until recently, commercial development in Downers Grove and hundreds of similar towns across the country meant accommodating strip malls and "big box" chain retailers. But Ms. Dean, Downers Grove's economic development director, says that model is played out. If her city wants a vibrant retail future, she believes, it will find it on its old Main Street. 
 "A lot of cities are getting into the idea that the big box is the future, but I think they are becoming commodities, and their product can be gotten on the Internet," Ms. Dean said, stepping carefully through the reconstruction work the city has undertaken to brighten its downtown streetscape, including installing new sewer pipes and new pavement on Main Street. "We think specialty retailers like the ones here are the future, and so is downtown. The future is more interactive and people-friendly."
The ambitious effort to revitalize downtown Downers Grove, where many of the brick buildings date from around the turn of the last century, reflects a broader trend seen in other smaller towns around the country. Taking a cue from successful projects in big cities like Chicago, suburban communities that for years seemed content to allow malls to proliferate while old downtowns deteriorated have begun to reverse course and rediscover the potential in their historic cores. The trend is epitomized in Downers Grove, Evanston and Highland Park around Chicago, and Santa Monica and Pasadena near Los Angeles, among others.
Communities have tried to re-inject life into their downtowns before. One wave of such projects crested about two decades ago, as cities and towns in many regions tried to combat the burgeoning strength of new edge-of-town shopping centers by sprucing up Main Streets, turning busy shopping blocks into pedestrian malls and erecting parking ramps downtown. Some projects succeeded in forestalling shoppers' flight to the malls for a time, but many proved as futile as they were expensive, as vacant storefronts continued to proliferate.
More recently, urban commercial neighborhoods have turned to organizing business improvement districts, which use money from parking fees or local tax surcharges to pay for cosmetic improvements and stepped-up services like street cleaning -- but again with mixed results.
But one important factor is different this time around. The new wave of Main Street projects is a response not to the strength of shopping centers but to their perceived new weakness, prompted in part by the explosion in Internet retailing.
For the same reasons that new shopping centers once emptied old downtowns -- convenience and lower prices -- the Internet has now begun to siphon off a significant share of sales from shopping centers' big tenants. And just as important to city officials like Ms. Dean, it has cut into sales tax revenue in mainstay categories like airline tickets, books, records, clothing and, especially, cars. "I was shocked when one of our car dealers told me that 25 percent of his sales now go on the Internet," she recalled. "That's the kind of thing that makes me shake in my boots."
To be sure, many communities are still trying to attract as many new big-box retailers, strip centers and malls as possible. Towns and small suburban cities like Downers Grove still depend on them for a huge share of the sales and property taxes that finance their budgets.
Yet there are clear signs, even in a healthy commercial market like metropolitan Chicago, that this style of retail development has passed the saturation point. Richard Knitter, president of Great American Realty in Oak Park, another Chicago suburb, estimates that there are already roughly 200 giant, empty store buildings surrounded by acres of parking in the region, representing 10 million square feet, with an additional 5 million square feet due to become available in the next year.
Mr. Knitter said a number of factors are contributing to the oversupply, with revenue losses to Internet commerce fairly low on the list. He cited intense competition among national chains that has flattened many second-tier local competitors, as well as many retailers' unwillingness to occupy space deserted by failed stores.
"Some of it is superstition about going into a failed location," said Mr. Knitter, a retail real estate consultant whose firm specializes in the Midwest market. "But people often want to build their own building with their own footprint, rather than go into someone else's. A Walgreen's is always a certain number of square feet -- they don't want to change the configuration; they want them to look the same and be the same."
The casualties are scattered liberally between downtown Chicago and its western suburban ring. Some have been razed and redeveloped, occasionally by other retailers, while others have been converted into educational or medical centers. The rest remain vacant, awaiting new uses, which Mr. Knitter thinks could eventually include housing, recreational facilities or even pet cemeteries. In Downers Grove, the trend is manifested in a big store on Ogden Avenue that has been vacant for five years and in the city's failure to attract new retail development on several shopping-center-size parcels.
So the city has decided to concentrate instead on restoring Main Street to what it once was: an attractive strolling, shopping and dining destination for the surrounding region and a convenient and desirable place for singles and "empty nesters" to live.
Ms. Dean points to the many essential services found downtown -- city hall, the library and the post office are there -- and its intimate, pedestrian-friendly atmosphere, rare in newer suburbs. The 300 retail businesses operating downtown differ markedly from typical mall fare and include independent bakeries and restaurants; the city's one brew pub, the Founder's Hill Brewing Company; a consignment store; a locally owned five and dime, and a movie theater, the Tivoli, that dates from 1928. An adjacent park features a band shell for outdoor concerts.
"Downtown provides something unique -- the entertainment, meet-and-greet venue," Ms. Dean said over a soft drink at Founder's Hill. "This can't be duplicated on the Internet at all. Virtual reality is not reality. This is."

HEADLINE: Word for Word: Neology;
In the Dictionary Game, Yada Yada Yada Is Satisficing to Some, Not Others

BYLINE: By ELIN SCHOEN BROCKMAN 

 BODY:
THE people who compile dictionaries always have "news" (n. pl. Oxford English Dictionaries' in-house word for new words). But neologisms are not always newly minted. Take "yada yada yada," which long before "Seinfeld" was used by Lenny Bruce. 
 Jesse Sheidlower, the senior editor in charge of new words at Random House, became convinced of yada yada yada's staying power not only by its history, but also by the existence of well-established parallel expressions (blah blah blah, for instance). He put it in the 1996 Random House Webster's College Dictionary.
However, Michael Agnes, editor in chief of Webster's New World College Dictionary, excluded yada yada yada from his 1996 edition. And having tracked a decline in its use, he is glad that he did. "This year we would have had to take it out," he said.
New words help give each dictionary its personality. The differences among them may not be readily apparent to the average reader, but when the editors of four dictionaries provided their unabridged new word lists for comparison, there was no overlap. One of the editors, on hearing just six words from the list of a competitor, was able to guess its identity immediately.
What follows is only a brief sampling of the news. The fourth edition of Webster's New World College Dictionary, the only one represented here for which a final count is available, because it has been published, added 7,000 entries. One of them, Nunavut, just made the deadline, because the editors had to wait until Canada officially declared the new territory of Nunavut.
There are always late-breaking news, words waiting to be accepted. Oxford U.S. Dictionaries, for instance, which publishes several dictionaries including the Oxford American Dictionary and Language Guide, has this on its waiting list, pending more evidence: "Fuggedaboudit." ELIN SCHOEN BROCKMAN

Inflation? It Just Doesn't Add Up

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
BARELY a year after a worldwide deflation scare -- when markets and currencies were crashing, banks and businesses in Asia, Russia and Latin America were failing, and prices of oil and raw materials were plunging -- inflation is back on peoples' minds.
On the face of it, fretting about inflation when every major price gauge in the United States is rising just 2 percent or so a year seems a little like Uma Thurman obsessing over her weight. 
 But what concerns Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Wall Street investors is the nagging suspicion that the stellar inflation record of the last two years was mostly the product of a few lucky, highly transitory breaks -- and therefore won't last. That suspicion is likely to propel the Fed's policy-making committee toward another interest-rate increase when it meets on Tuesday.
Admittedly, the budding recovery in Asia and Europe has already blunted some of the forces that have helped push United States inflation down from 4 percent to 2 percent a year since 1997.
Energy prices -- indeed, most commodity prices other than farm products -- are already rebounding sharply after collapsing last year.
And the high-flying dollar, which helped to make imports cheaper, has recently weakened against the euro and the yen as global investors have begun to shift some of their mutual fund money away from the United States to foreign markets.
Sounds dire, right?
Actually, there are solid reasons for thinking that a return to the bad old days, when upwardly spiraling prices seemed as inevitable as the sunrise, is highly unlikely. For one thing, some of those "transitory" factors are likely to persist for quite a while longer. For another, popular expectations about inflation -- low inflation, this time -- readily become self-fulfilling prophecies. And a host of structural and policy changes over the last couple of decades have made the United States economy less inherently prone to inflation.
Even skeptics now say that the low inflation of the 1990's is not just a fluke, but rather a return to a norm that prevailed for a quarter-century, beginning in the late 1940's -- years when 4 percent inflation seemed scandalously high. As Alan S. Blinder, an economist at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said recently, "To a substantial extent, we're back to the 50's."
Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard University, until recently a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said of mainstream economists: "A lot of us were real stick-in-the-muds. We said: 'No, no, no. Here are the equations.' But other people who knew less about equations had the sense to realize that things are a bit different."
For starters, not all the good luck is evaporating. True, energy prices have jumped 24 percent since the beginning of the year. But energy wasn't a big factor in inflation's decline -- the economy uses a lot less energy than it did in, say, 1973 -- and this year's price increase isn't anything like the surges in 1973 or 1990. Most of the impact has already filtered through to consumer prices for gasoline, electricity, heating oil and air fares, adding at most a few tenths of a percentage point to the inflation rate.
The dollar's recent dip and the ballooning trade deficit have some economists, notably Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, warning of the possibility of a currency crisis. If the dollar were to take a big dive, that would indeed threaten to push inflation up sharply. But it would also provoke a sharp reaction from the Fed. And the dollar is still slightly stronger on a trade-weighted basis (that is, against a basket of currencies of America's trading partners) than it was at the start of the year.
More to the point, import prices, by far the biggest recent drag on inflation, are apt to remain under downward pressure. Their decline, it turns out, was due less to the strong dollar than to vast excess productive capacity in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere -- an excess that will not be mopped up soon, given the gradual pace of world recovery.
"It's not just the dollar, but economic incentives to increase production abroad," said Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University.
Domestically, health care costs have stopped skyrocketing and show few signs of resuming that course, despite increases over the last year in the fees that health maintenance organizations charge employers. Though the latest readings show consumer prices for medical care rising a bit faster than a year ago, few experts expect the pace to accelerate to twice the overall inflation rate, as it did in the early 1990's.
In any case, even temporary lulls in inflation can have long-term effects, by changing expectations. Americans who believed two decades ago that inflation would always rise are now expecting it to remain low.
According to the monthly University of Michigan survey of consumer expectations, ordinary Americans expect the inflation rate a year from now to be under 3 percent. (The Federal Reserve forecasts 2.5 percent or less.) "You get this extra impact," Professor Gordon said. "The biggest factor holding down inflation in the next couple of years is the lower inflation of the past couple."
But perhaps the strongest reasons for optimism are sweeping changes in the economy that have been in the works for years.
Back in the bad old 1970's, temporary supply shocks tended to produce higher inflation automatically. Since then, some long-term trends -- globalization, deregulation, the computer revolution -- have made the economy less susceptible to bottlenecks and wage-price spirals.
"One story is that we are permanently able to run the economy hotter and labor markets tighter," Professor Krugman said, "because we have a more flexible labor market, and monopoly and union power have been curbed by international competition."
Consider deregulation, which began during the Carter Administration and has since radically transformed broad swaths of the sprawling service sector, including airlines, energy, banking, railroads, telecommunications and, most recently, electricity. More competition helps rein in inflation directly, and a new wealth of alternatives keeps strikes or other disruptions from creating bottlenecks. (Remember what life was like before faxes, cell phones and E-mail?) "They all kind of connect the economy together," Professor Frankel said.
Then there's the computer revolution. Information technology helps companies do everything they do -- notably, managing inventory -- more flexibly and efficiently. But innovation is also driving down computer prices, and rapidly enough to take half a percentage point off the overall inflation rate, according to Professor Gordon.
More prosaic changes in the way the American labor market works may be as important as globalization. Alan B. Krueger of Princeton University and Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard recently published a study suggesting that a host of small, incremental changes -- including the decline of unions, the growing role of temporary-help firms, even welfare reform -- have made the labor market more efficient. That may be why an unemployment rate below the prevailing average of the 1950's and 1960's has yet to set off bidding wars among employers.
And though the labor market may be tight, American business is still operating with a lot of spare capacity, the product of an investment boom spurred by lower interest rates and a rush to embrace technology. Utilization rates remain relatively low even after eight years of economic expansion -- one reason that companies find it hard to raise prices. "That could explain why inflation is lower than you'd think just looking at unemployment," Professor Frankel said.
That investment boom has had another powerful anti-inflation effect. Productivity has been growing at around 2 percent a year, double the rate that prevailed in the 1970's and 1980's. Greater efficiency, in turn, has made it possible for employers to increase compensation at a higher pace than the inflation rate without adding much to their costs.
"We've had an acceleration of productivity growth, and it takes a while before people build that expectation into wages," Professor Krugman said.
Of course, even the most open, flexible, productive economy can suffer inflation. Inflation, as Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, has said, is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, and is therefore determined by policy makers in Washington, most notably the Fed.
Recall how the low-inflation post-war era ended: tax cuts and guns-and-butter spending under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and an accommodating central bank let the inflation genie out of the bottle even before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries quadrupled oil prices in 1973.
Putting the genie back in the bottle cost the nation a couple of nasty recessions and years of high unemployment and lost output. Today, the memory of the high human and political costs of wringing inflation out of the system help keep inflation at bay, much as memories of the Great Depression have kept deflation at bay.
Three times in 10 years, Alan Greenspan has struck pre-emptively with interest-rate increases to ward off any acceleration before it could even begin, in 1989, 1994 and now -- strikes that so far, at least, seem to have served the economy well.

Inflation hasn't been this low this long for decades. Has this run been a fluke, or are Eisenhower-era inflation rates here to stay? Some of the forces that have helped bring down inflation into the 2 percent range are starting to reverse direction, but excess capacity at home and abroad, a more flexible labor market and faster productivity growth should keep inflation from rebounding.

Japan Lets the Yen Rise, but for How Long?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE investing environment in Japan has changed in the last week, raising questions about the outlook for its currency and its stock market.
After intervening aggressively in the foreign exchange market six times in June and July, hoping to restrain the rising value of the yen, Japanese officials appear to have stepped to the sidelines. Karen E. Parker, director of currency research at Chase Manhattan Bank, said that the officials have made a "virtue out of a necessity" -- that they have decided not to intervene because the effort to restrain the yen hasn't worked. 
 Why hasn't it? Because institutional investors around the world have been rushing to get back into the Japanese stock market. And so they buy yen -- which pushes up its value -- to buy Japanese stocks.
Tokyo "won't do anything unless the Nikkei collapses," said Jeremy P. Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at BankBoston, referring to Japan's marquee stock index.
The Japanese stock market has already been very, very good to American investors who have bet on it this year. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks is up 30.8 percent, while the broader Topix index has jumped 37.9 percent. And the recent rally of the yen has turned earlier currency losses into small gains that have added to the return from the stock market. Since its low for the year on May 20, the yen is up 11.6 percent. Together, the Nikkei and the yen have produced a gain of 24.7 percent in the last two months for American investors.
If there has been a change in policy, the yen, which finished the week at 111.42 to the dollar, could get stronger, which would only add to the combined returns for investors as yen investments become worth more in dollar terms. Ms. Parker thinks the yen could soon move to 105 to 108 to the dollar. (As the yen strengthens, it takes fewer to buy a dollar.)
But a stronger yen could become a problem. It makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad, cutting into sales. And if Japan's export rebound is tripped up, the economic recovery that was suggested in first-quarter economic data may be derailed.
The Bank of Japan's attempts in June and July to restrain the rising yen were based on this fear. And, as many analysts note, the rallies of the stock market and the yen have both come on very little in the way of positive economic news.
Yet investors don't seem worried. Even while the yen has been rallying, the Nikkei has rebounded from its summer slide and now is just 435 points -- or 2.4 percent -- from its 1999 high of 18,532.58.
Elizabeth J. Allan, senior vice president at Scudder Kemper Investments and a former Japanese fund manager, is among the sanguine. Many Japanese companies have business plans based on a yen around 110 to 115 to the dollar, she said, adding, "around these levels, it is not a big deal in relation to their earnings estimates."
In addition, Ms. Allan said she thought many new investors in Japan were not just looking for quick profits in the stock market. "There seems to be a lot of buying out there, and a lot of it seems to be long-term, patient money," she said.
The patience of these investors will be tested in early September. That is when data on second-quarter economic growth will be released. First-quarter growth of 1.9 percent was a big surprise, and many economists think it overstated the recovery in Japan. The fresh data will give an indication if the trend is continuing or fizzling. An unexpectedly weak number would undermine stocks.
A TEST of Japanese intentions ought to come sooner. Since the end of 1996, the yen has not breached 110 to the dollar. If that level is passed without Japanese intervention, then it will be clear that policy in Tokyo has changed.
Japanese officials will threaten intervention, as they did on Friday. But after a while, that won't count if they don't actually do anything.
Richard Medley, president of Medley Global Advisors, a consultant to hedge funds and investment houses, said the Japanese have to intervene now to slow the yen's rise. If they don't, and if the second-quarter economic data are disappointing, there may be a destabilizing selloff in the yen -- and the stock market may follow it down.
"Its a very tough period," Mr. Medley said.

Who You Gonna Call After the Next Bust?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THERE will be a recession. That is inevitable -- if not this year, then next year or maybe the year after. The question is, how severe will it be? The answer is that despite all the fanfare about these prosperous times, the eight-year expansion walks on precarious legs, and when it collapses, getting the American economy back on its feet could be surprisingly hard and painful.
The odds are that the next recession will come sooner rather than later, and it will be different from other recessions since World War II. The response will be different, too. Many of the politicians, executives, financiers and prominent economists who have bet so heavily on the virtues of a market economy unhindered by government will probably look this time to government for extra help in mitigating the damage. Not just in cutting interest rates, but in stepped-up public spending as well as tax cuts. 
 "We will have to change the rhetoric," said Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts. "We can still say that markets play an important role, but they can't cure themselves. We will have to acknowledge that we need government for that. It's the stabilizer. And that acknowledgement will open up a broader debate about what government should do."
The strengths of this expansion are potentially destructive. They are chiefly consumer spending and business investment, both of which are based on debt. Unlike the Reagan-era expansion, which was driven by government borrowing, the current expansion is fueled by private-sector debt. Rising stock prices and, more recently, rising home prices, have encouraged the borrowing. Bubbles have developed in stock prices and real estate. And when they burst, particularly in the stock market, much of the collateral for the borrowing will disappear.
"I know of no time in the post-World War II period in which the welfare of the American economy, and for that matter the rest of the world, has hinged so much on the well-being of the American stock market," said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist.
Some of the borrowing has paid for imports, which have given Americans a great variety of inexpensive goods and services. But the imports have also created a huge trade deficit that threatens to weaken the dollar, complicating future efforts to repair a damaged economy. The June trade deficit, for example, which was announced on Thursday, was a record $24.6 billion.
"We have been running the economy on private credit rather than government debt on a very large and unusual scale," said Wynne Godley, an economist at the Jerome Levy Institute who tracks the debt numbers.
When hard times come, households and companies will almost certainly pull back on spending, investing and borrowing -- a nightmare for an economy that has become increasingly dependent on such voluntary activity. Government -- mainly Federal, but also state and local -- will suddenly be expected to take up the slack. As Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist, put it, "In the event of a recession, people turn to Government en masse."
ONLY this time, the government carries an unusual handicap, as if it were starting a one-mile race from 100 yards behind the starting line. It is deficit spending that stimulates an economy, whether it comes from the private or public sectors. Right now the private sector carries the load. In the next recession, today's cherished budget surpluses must be turned into deficits. The public sector, in effect, must replace at least some of the private sector's deficit spending.
In addition, the proposed tax cuts currently being sold as a reward for the shrinking government role in a highly successful market system must be resold to the public in an entirely opposite manner. They would become the government's way of prodding Americans to spend more and thus help revive the economy. That was the justification for tax cuts in the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon Administrations.
More government spending on housing, public works, education and income subsidies also seems likely to accompany the next recession, given the unusual nature of the current expansion and the downturn it is likely to produce.
This stepped-up government spending would be a departure from the solution applied to recessions over the last 20 years. These earlier cycles have been variations on a different theme: The demand for goods and services outstrips the supply. Prices rise. The Federal Reserve, concerned about inflation, raises interest rates to cool the demand. If demand cools too much, unsold merchandise piles up and, as companies cut back production, a recession develops. The solution: the Fed cuts interest rates to revive demand. The Fed, in this way, has played the main government role in regulating the economy since 1980.
The late 1990's are different. Supply is no longer a problem. The output of goods and services in this country and abroad outstrips demand. The economy has been booming since 1995, but inflation is not a problem with so much supply. The labor force is fully employed, and in theory at least, labor shortages should be pushing up wages and prices. But neither is happening noticeably. The danger is not that demand will outstrip supply, but that demand will collapse if the stock market does.
The Federal Reserve can probably revive demand by lowering rates, as it has in the past. But here is where the trade deficit complicates the picture.
Foreigners have been big lenders to America, partly financing the trade deficit. The percentage of Treasury securities and corporate securities held by foreigners, for example, has almost doubled since 1992. When the next recession comes and the dollar inevitably weakens, the Fed's first instinct will be to lower rates. But it will also have to contend with the possibility that the much-needed foreign investors will seek out higher returns elsewhere in the world.
The way to revive the economy is to lower rates, but the way to keep foreign lenders on board is to raise rates, or not lower them. "We could get locked into a situation where we can't lower rates," said Lance Taylor, director of the Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School for Social Research.
Thus the door may reopen to the sort of government intervention that was commonplace until the 1980's, and that John Maynard Keynes, the British economist, first spelled out in the 1930's.
"It was Nixon who said we are all Keynesians," Mr. Blinder said. "It is true now, although many people shun the label."

How Milosevic Survives in Serbia

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia

 BODY:
LAST September, when Bob Dole, the former Presidential candidate, and John Shattuck, an American human rights official, came here to press Slobodan Milosevic to relent in Kosovo, the Yugoslav President put on quite a performance.
He rejected charges of Serb abuses of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, of course, and then, acting offended, had an aide shut the doors leading to a dining room already set for lunch. Just before Mr. Dole and Mr. Shattuck left, unfed, Mr. Milosevic leaned forward and said emphatically, in his good English, "You know, I enjoy being President." 
 No one doubts him. Nor do they underestimate his tactical skills to keep the job. Defeated by NATO in Kosovo, wanted for trial on war crimes and facing a restive constituency, Mr. Milosevic will not give up the job easily. Remaining President is surely safest place for Mr. Milosevic to be.
Having survived more than 80 days of massive street protests against him in the winter of 1996-97 and 78 days of NATO bombing last spring, Mr. Milosevic is doing his best to manipulate and discredit a divided opposition.
His efforts are falling, as ever here, on rich ground. The first opposition rally in Belgrade, on Thursday night, drew tens of thousands of people demanding his resignation. But the rally also displayed and intensified the already poisonous splits in the opposition between the Democratic Party of Zoran Djindjic and the Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic.
It is indisputable that Mr. Milosevic is in deep trouble. His regime has been shaken; a few of his acolytes are breaking away; there is no longer enough money, given war damage and international isolation, to keep his network of favored business allies happy.
There are worries about a winter without enough heat, electricity and fuel for transportation, and about an economy, already in deep recession, bombed into a sort of pre-industrial stage by NATO, without enough real jobs.
After 10 years in power, Mr. Milosevic's support is at its lowest point. He and his Government, never wildly popular, are reviled by large portions of the nation. Serbs are tired of empty promises, patriotic hyperbole and failed wars that leave Serbia smaller and more isolated, its people poorer and its future bleaker.
Some opinion polls suggest that the main opposition party, Mr. Draskovic's party would win more votes than the parties of Mr. Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic, combined. According to one recent poll, Mr. Milosevic's party gets roughly 14 percent of the vote; Mrs. Markovic's, 2.5 percent.
But even Mr. Draskovic could win only up to 18 percent of the vote, and Mr. Djindjic would probably win no more than possibly 10 percent, requiring a coalition to hammer together a working majority in the Serb or Yugoslav parliaments. And it is in coalition politics -- the game of pressure, seduction, blackmail and reward -- that Mr. Milosevic is Serbia's master.
He keeps power by playing off Mr. Draskovic and the ultranationalist, Vojislav Seselj. Until recently, Mr. Milosevic retained a majority on the federal level in coalition with Mr. Draskovic and on the more important Serbian level with Mr. Seselj. While Mr. Draskovic left the Government during the war, and Mr. Seselj vowed to quit over the withdrawal from Kosovo, Mr. Seselj is now Mr. Milosevic's coalition partner in both governments.
JUST last week, Mr. Milosevic's party leaked a story that he had met Mr. Draskovic secretly to work out a deal on early elections. While Mr. Draskovic vehemently denied any meeting, he does favor early elections, and his aides blame the leak on Mr. Djindjic. Whatever the truth, the leak was a brilliant stroke to widen opposition divisions and make a bad relationship even worse.
In a formerly Communist system where little has changed in the structure of power, Mr. Milosevic and his wife hold strong, centralized cards to play: a controlled state media, business monopolies, state industries, import licenses, the army and especially the police.
Favored people who play along can make a very great deal of money, with good apartments and insider deals. Those who show disloyalty or challenge the regime are rarely arrested, but they suddenly lose their perks and face police or tax harassment. And a few -- not many, but enough to discourage the others -- have ended up dead, in mysterious circumstances.
One key official of an opposition party said in an interview that he was offered more than $50,000 to defect to Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party. He said he refused on principle. But he noted a common pattern of power, because he was also offered money, though considerably less, to defect to another opposition party, which he also declined to do.
None of this is to say that Mr. Milosevic will manage to save himself through the autumn, let alone to the end of his term in 2001 or beyond. But he has managed thus far to divide and conquer, buying time and waiting for opportunities to emerge that could leave him in place.
A senior opposition figure, speaking privately, honestly and sadly, said: "Even in such trouble, Milosevic remains the master of the political game, especially with this sort of opposition. We should be able to beat him easily, but he manipulates and discredits us. Ordinary people sense there is something wrong with this opposition. It gives him lots of games to play."

A Debate Over Wealth, Virtue and Justice

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

 BODY:
In the weeks since Congress passed a tax cut that would be the biggest since the Reagan era if enacted, Republicans have had a tough time selling the issue politically. President Clinton's threat to veto the $792 billion tax bill was hardly mentioned at the recent Iowa straw poll. But the debate among those talking about the tax cut is revealing. It suggests that class conflict continues to play a role in American politics, and that politicians may have to be sensitive to widespread resentment toward those who have benefited the most from boom times.
Tax-cut advocates are at their most awkward when addressing the fact that the tax cut showers its benefits on the rich. Their argument is that, after all, the rich pay the most taxes and thus should get the most out of a tax cut. "Heaven forbid somebody making $500,000 is going to get a greater benefit than somebody making $10,000," Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma declared sarcastically when the bill passed earlier this month. The conservative National Review asserts that the bill "cuts Americans' taxes in roughly the proportion that they bear the tax burden." The magazine adds: "No, poor people don't get an income-tax cut in this bill. But then, poor people don't pay federal income tax." 
 That is a misleading formulation because the income tax accounts for only about half of Federal tax revenues. Americans of modest means may pay little income tax, but they pay heavily with payroll deductions for Social Security and Medicare, two programs that Democrats note face insolvency unless the budget surplus is diverted to shore them up instead of being used to provide tax relief.
Over all, the Republican tax cut distributes its benefits disproportionately to the rich, making the tax system less progressive than it is now. The tax cut is actually an amalgamation of a 1 percent cut in the income tax rate and additional tax breaks for student loans, capital gains, estates, health costs and other expenses. According to the Treasury Department, the wealthiest 20 percent of American taxpayers earn 49 percent of the nation's total income and pay 59 percent of American taxes, which is logical given the progressive nature of the tax system. This top tier of earners would, however, receive 78 percent of the money from the tax cut. Similarly, the top 1 percent of Americans earn 14 percent of the nation's income and pay 19 percent of the taxes. But they would get 24 percent of the tax cut money. That is hardly returning their proportionate share.
Debates about taxes almost always start with who-gets-what and then jump to larger issues. At what point, for example, do higher taxes imposed on the rich discourage people from trying to get rich?
Many tax-cut advocates argue that the progressive income tax is inherently unfair because it is unjust to punish the energy, hard work and risk-taking that yield higher incomes. In its most exaggerated form, the argument is the one advanced by Alan Keyes, an African-American who is running way behind for the Republican Presidential nomination. He calls the progressive income tax a form of slavery. Many other politicians join with Steve Forbes in supporting a flat tax that would eliminate the idea of progressivity, which has been around since the Civil War.
The argument in favor of tax progressivity is that the rich have a greater ability to pay, and that they benefit the most from society's blessings and sound government. People who favor higher taxes for the rich also tend to view wealth as less a matter of virtuous behavior than the arbitrary nature of life. In this view, progressivity is not so much to punish the rich as to lessen some of the unfairness in the way wealth is distributed.
The final argument for a tax cut is that the revenue collected by the Government "belongs" to the taxpayer and should be returned when there is a surplus. But the national debt also "belongs" to the taxpayers. So does the obligation to keep Social Security and Medicare solvent, educate the next generation, preserve the environment and carry out other government services. The more that Americans see the debate in these terms, the greater the chance that they will continue to reject a big tax cut geared to the wealthy.

The Merger Bug Is Catching

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

 BODY:
It wasn't exactly merger mania, but there was enough dealing last week to take investors' minds off other things, like the possibility of an interest-rate increase in the United States on Tuesday.
 The biggest announcement came from Japan, where the Industrial Bank of Japan, Fuji Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank announced an alliance on Friday that would create the world's largest financial institution. 
 Garry Evans, a strategist at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd., told Bloomberg News that the alliance "will be the first of a number of consolidations and big mergers in the next couple of months."
 In Europe, a couple of deals captured the eyes of investors. Manager Magazin, a German monthly, reported that two large utility companies, Viag and Veba, were in advanced merger discussions. The companies denied the report. In France, Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux said it would buy the shares it does not own in Tractebel, Belgium's biggest utility.
 And in the United States, Phelps Dodge, a big copper producer, said on Friday that it was making an unsolicited bid for Asarco and Cyprus Amax Minerals. The day before, Alcoa and Reynolds Metals came to terms on a merger agreement. MICKEY MEECE

HEADLINE: In Calcutta, Writer's Joy Is in Deeds, Not Words

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Dominique Lapierre has ranged over several continents in his best-selling books on modern history, but only one place has never let go of him. More than two decades ago, after the publication of "Freedom at Midnight," the story of Indian independence, Mr. Lapierre went back to India to try to share his success with the people who had inspired his work.
"It was the beginning of an adventure that never stopped," he said in an interview during a recent stopover in New York. He was on his way home to France with his wife, also named Dominique, after talking to business executives in Aspen, Colo., about the private aid projects the couple finance. 
 The projects assist the lepers of Calcutta and the poor fishing communities on islands in the Ganges delta, where old ferry boats have been converted into floating clinics.
"The boats serve 900,000 inhabitants of 57 islands not on the map of the world," he said. "These people do not exist." They are so poor they cannot eat the fish they catch, he added. They are without transistor radios to warn them about cyclones; they fall prey to tigers, snakes and, overwhelmingly, to tuberculosis.
Mr. Lapierre, 68, calculates that he has spent $5 million on his small and largely unpublicized projects, drawn from royalties on his books and those, like "Freedom at Midnight," that he wrote with the American writer Larry Collins. Along the way he has learned some hard lessons, he said. He has come to distrust official foreign aid -- from governments, the United Nations and big international agencies. He says his misgivings were borne out in his now-abandoned efforts to get help from the European Union.
"One of their requisites is that 60 percent of the amount they will give you will have to be in fixed assets," he said. "That is, they'll force you to build an institution. To buy ambulances -- things that they can see. What we need is to buy drugs, to hire doctors, to hire teachers.
"The result of this thinking is that the third world today is absolutely full of empty, useless, unoccupied, lavish installations where there are no longer any doors, any beds, any windows, any patients, any doctors, any drugs. Because after the glorious inauguration of an institution, with all the media and the politicians, one year later it's a vacuum."
Without local involvement, he says, the projects turn derelict.
The Lapierres -- she works with women on basic literacy, education and health programs that complement his projects -- have also had their share of problems with India. In the 1980's, the state government of West Bengal opposed plans to film his novel of slum life in Calcutta, "City of Joy," in that city. They thought it would make the city look bad.
Mr. Lapierre, who is impatient and dismissive of bureaucracy and something of a street fighter when challenged -- a lot of people find his intensity and his big personality overwhelming -- overcame those obstacles. He is triumphantly amused that a sign outside Calcutta's airport now welcomes travelers to the City of Joy.
He has been less successful in dealing with India's pervasive corruption. His clinics, all run by Indians, are entitled to free medicine from the Government for 300,000 tuberculosis patients. "We never -- never -- get more than 10 percent," he said. "The rest is stolen on the way. So we are forced to buy drugs on the open market, which is a drain on our budget."
The Lapierres operate their private aid project on a minimal budget, they say. "We have no office," he said. "We have no staff. When we travel to India, Dominique and I, we pay our own tickets, economy class." Three years ago, they sold a large house in St. Tropez and moved to a smaller one. "Royalties are not eternal," he said.
The Lapierres, who also give poor village women small dowries to allow them to marry a bit above the lowest rungs of life, say they have been changed forever by their experiences in India, especially by their life in Calcutta while he wrote "City of Joy."
"One morning I was awakened by a procession passing by in the alley with drums and songs and people chanting," he recalled. "I said, 'What happens here today?' Do you know what they answered? 'We are celebrating the birth of spring.' In a place where there is not a tree, not a flower, not a leaf, not a bird, not a butterfly, they celebrated an event they would never see."
When they left India soon after, the Lapierres had 30 pounds of excess baggage "in gifts from people whose average resource for survival is, I would say, about three U.S. cents a day," he said. The generosity of the poor has never waned, he said, although 350 million Indians go to bed hungry at night. "These people are the real heroes of the planet."
"When we come back to Paris," he said, "finding a parking space on the Champs-Elysees is no longer a priority."

HEADLINE: On Top of the World, Stuck in Traffic

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Lindsey Cigarran never thought she would spend her 20's trapped in a Saab convertible. But the 24-year-old group manager of Beyond.com's entertainment software division commutes an average of two and a half hours every day to and from her San Francisco apartment and an office in Sunnyvale, Calif.
"It is a full-on nightmare," Ms. Cigarran said recently. 
 So much so, she rented a room near work where she sleeps when she is too tired to make the 40-mile drive home. Most of her driving time is spent talking on her cellular phone with clients. And she has taken to hoarding secret routes, like an alley behind a gasoline station near work that is a shortcut to the highway.
For many professionals at dot-com companies in the expensive Silicon Valley, the boom in the Internet has resulted in a commuting bust, forcing them to funnel onto increasingly congested highways in and around the Bay Area. From San Francisco to San Jose, the expanding economy has created a traffic jam of unprecedented proportions.
Statistics tallied by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, a regional management group, show that the percentage of freeways in the Silicon Valley region receiving the worst possible congestion rating has tripled in the past four years, to 46 percent. That is akin to hooking up a fast computer with a slow modem; almost half of all freeway drivers poke along at less than 35 miles an hour.
"It's gotten pretty bad," said Carolyn Gonot, manager of the authority's congestion management program. She knows firsthand. Ms. Gonot, who drives to work in Silicon Valley from the East Bay, acknowledged that she traveled in off-peak hours, saving as many as 10 hours weekly. "I'm a test case," she said. "We promote flex time."
Business leaders in Northern California worry that traffic-clogged freeways are eroding their wine-sipping, khaki-wearing, laid-back quality of life that residents have come to expect, threatening the area with a tied-up traffic fate similar to that facing their brethren in the Los Angeles basin.
The area is doing its best to cope with the influx of new people: The San Mateo Bridge, which connects the East Bay with Silicon Valley, is being expanded to six lanes from four. Several cities shuttle passengers to commuter train stations, the cost partly borne by some local companies. And a 1996 half-cent sales tax will pay for a variety of freeway projects.
"Of course there will be an impact when a person only has time to work, drive and sleep," said Steve Tedesco, a California native and president of the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce. "They don't have time to get involved in their communities. They can't get home in time for Little League games."
Congestion is likely to worsen as communities use new-found riches (also a result of the Internet boom) to fuel a construction frenzy. A range of projects now on the horizon have several of San Francisco's leaders predicting traffic catastrophe in the near future: Caltrans, the state's highway construction division, will soon embark on a large project that will include demolishing and rebuilding several blocks of the elevated freeway that feeds into the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.
Many believe the project will create long-term chaos in a region where traffic already creeps for hours on end. The Harrison Street ramp -- a major downtown exit for morning commute traffic -- is scheduled to be closed for four and a half years. And several development projects, including office buildings, hotels and a new ball park in the South of Market neighborhood of the city, have led city officials to forecast the elimination of more than 10,000 parking spaces, 6,000 of which will be permanent.
"It seems you don't have to worry so much about drunk driving anymore," said Gary Skraba, a Los Angeles marketing executive who travels to the Bay Area several times yearly for business. "You have to worry about road rage."
Doug Wills, a San Francisco native and group manager of corporate public relations at Cisco Systems, lasted only four months when he moved back to his hometown last year to be near his wife's restaurant. Sometimes it took him two hours to drive the 50 miles to Cisco's headquarters in San Jose. His wife, Nasreen, had it just as bad: It took her 40 minutes to go across town.
"It doesn't make sense," Mr. Wills said. "It shouldn't be this difficult to get to work."
So 16 months ago, the couple packed up their furniture and moved to a house in Silicon Valley. His commute is shorter, and his wife's 30-mile train trip to her restaurant takes about the same time as her old 4-mile trip across town.
Some drivers have come up with interesting ways to live in the fast lane, particularly in the troublesome rush hours. It is common to see drivers putting on makeup, checking stock quotes on their laptops, even lifting hand weights.
"You have to figure out how to make those hours productive," Ms. Cigarran said. "There are times when you don't have an extra five minutes to comb your hair."
John Marren, an investment banker at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter who is based in Menlo Park, said he had, on occasion, asked a junior banker to accompany him to a meeting to take advantage of the speedier commuter lane.
A number of Silicon Valley's luminaries, including the venture capitalist John Doerr, now use car services so they can work or read on their commutes.
Corporate executives who do not want to drive themselves have their own strategy for coping: high-brow hitchhiking. Every morning, scores of them, like Francis Torrence, a lawyer at Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather & Geraldson in San Francisco, line up near a commuter train station in Oakland to catch a ride. Passengers mill about until drivers, whom they do not know but who want to save the $2 San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge toll and use the commuter lane, pick them up. An unspoken etiquette has evolved among repeat carpoolers.
"Everyone says 'Good morning,' but usually people don't talk," Mr. Torrence said. "Drivers pick the radio station. And generally the bus terminal is where people bail out."
For many, the daily Silicon Valley commute is likely to get worse before it gets better, leaving some to wonder whether the plugged-in driving life style will end.
"If you're looking up a phone number that's one thing," said Kimball Brown, a computer analyst at Dataquest, a market research concern at San Jose, "but if it gets to the point of using a spreadsheet, I'm sorry, but that's going too far."

HEADLINE: For Jews Around World, Borough Park Is the Place to Shop

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

 BODY:
It was only noon and Motty Notis was already halfway into his race along 13th Avenue in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn. Sacks of electronics, Judaic books and a wide-brimmed black hat were strewn about the trunk of his rental car, and arrangements had been made to ship dozens of other items.
But with one hand on the steering wheel and the other hand holding the cell phone through which his wife in Los Angeles gave more orders, Mr. Notis set off again. There were silver Kiddush cups to buy, possibly a camera and, if he had time to get them, some of those nice white shirts he liked could be jammed inside his bag before his 8 P.M. flight home. 
 "It's the best place to buy everything for a Jewish household, so people from all over the world come to shop," said Mr. Notis, a 26-year-old general contractor, before zooming off in his car. "A lot of people fly in to shop in the morning and are back on a plane by the afternoon. This is just the beginning for me. I've still got to get a gift for my wife -- it's her birthday."
At first glance, the central shopping district of Borough Park would not seem world-class. Parking is difficult, upscale restaurants are few, and there are none of the famed stores that draw shoppers to Manhattan -- like Bloomingdale's, Barneys and Tiffany.
But driven by the density of its Jewish population and an entrepreneurial spirit among its business community, especially over the last few years, Borough Park has become what the Lower East Side used to be: the place for Orthodox Jews to shop. On any day but the Sabbath, the mile-long strip of storefronts is teeming with people in search of everything from kosher groceries and refined flatware to electronic equipment. The reason they come, they say, is simple: to get high quality, great selection and competitive prices.
But unlike the Lower East Side of decades ago, 13th Avenue has developed a global reach, because of the ease of air transportation and the Internet. Many of the businesses have their own Web sites.
The area has become so bustling that a 52-room kosher hotel opened three weeks ago on 13th Avenue, the first hotel to rise in Borough Park in more than a decade and one of the few to be built in Brooklyn.
"It has become our Manhattan," said Max Schwartzberg, who came to Borough Park from Tel Aviv to shop and conduct business, and was staying at the hotel. "I swear, 50 percent of the people on my flight were coming here to shop."
Mr. Schwartzberg represents only one strand of a diverse and far-flung clientele that can be found walking in and out of the stores. The shoppers may be Hasidim: Bobovers, Satmars, Viznitzers or members of smaller sects in New York. Or they may be modern Orthodox, coming from Belgium, France, Israel, South America or anywhere in the United States.
The neighborhood itself, which began attracting Jewish immigrants around 1900, now holds the largest concentration of Jews in the country and has become one of the world's most Orthodox. Much of the commercial growth has been created by members of a younger generation who prefer to do business with other Jews. Many have become entrepreneurs, according to Egon Mayer, the director of the Center for Jewish Studies at the City University of New York and the author of a book about Borough Park called "From Suburb to Shtetl" (Temple University Press, 1979).
"It is an ethnic village that has been able to broadcast its wares," Professor Mayer said, "a community that was historically much more insular but is now being able to make its presence known through the world."
In doing so, it has also become one of the richest Jewish communities, drawing many banking concerns. Charles J. Hamm, chairman, president and chief executive of the 45-branch Independence Community Bank, said he opened the bank's first branch on 16th Avenue 10 years ago and then opened another on 13th Avenue in 1997.
"We went from zero deposits to more than $350 million in these two branches," he said, adding that the average branch has around $110 million in deposits. "It's just a hotbed of merchants and one of the most vital economic locations in the United States."
Most days, shoppers cram the sidewalks, and cars back up for blocks as everyone converges on the busy thoroughfare. At the many groceries and bakeries that dot the avenue, a dozen kinds of gefilte fish and rugelach line the shelves, while every form and size of modest clothing -- from felt bend-up hats to the long black coats called kapotes -- can be found at haberdasheries and tailor shops. Silver shops line the avenue, catering to every conceivable religious and social occasion, while some of the country's largest selections of Jewish books, records and videos can be found -- or, increasingly, ordered over the Internet.
"In places like London or Paris, you don't have the concentration that warrants this diverse array of specialty goods: I mean, where can you get a fur streimel?" asked Professor Mayer, speaking of the beaver-wrapped hats popular among some Hasidim. "I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes."
Professor Mayer can point to his own cousin in Sao Paulo, Brazil, who said he came to Borough Park five to six times a year to stock up on kosher food and other Jewish goods.
That cousin, Sandor Friedlander, said in a telephone interview that he could not find many kosher items in Brazil, adding that he tended to keep a low profile about his trips so that neighbors would not pester him to bring back items for them, too. "I have enough orders for my own family," he said.
But it's not only out-of-towners who are attracted to the variety offered in Borough Park. "I came from Flatbush to buy my granddaughter an engagement gift," said Eva Fertszfeld as she shopped in one silver store. "You just can't find this selection and price anywhere else."
While the Lower East Side's commerce has ceased to be Jewish except for a few bakeries and stores, Borough Park's wares continue to expand. Doron Food Corporation, which makes a kosher frozen pizza that is shipped around the country and to Canada, is moving its 5,000-pizzas-a-week operation from lower Manhattan to Borough Park. The move was partly to get more space and partly for the name recognition the Brooklyn area had around the world for fine kosher products, said Ari Fishbaum, who owns the business with his brother, Eddie.
Last month, several local developers opened Avenue Plaza Hotel, an eight-story kosher hotel at 13th Avenue and 47th Street. After three weeks in operation, half its 52 rooms are occupied. And it is booked solid from the end of this month through mid-November, said Nathan Tessler, the general manager, even though its rates -- from $150 to $450 a night -- rival those of many hotels in Manhattan. He said the owners were considering doubling its size within two years.
The hotel offers many things those Manhattan hotels lack, including a kosher kitchen and a mezuza outside each door. During the Sabbath, when Orthodox Jews honor the prohibition against labor, an elevator automatically stops on every floor so that no button has to be pushed, and a hotel staff member can be called to turn lights on and off for guests. The hotel keeps nearly 30 folding beds on hand for the many large families it expects to stay during weddings and bar mitzvahs, and has a baby-sitting and crib service and will soon begin offering guided tours of the neighborhood.
Mosha Reich, a real estate developer from Tel Aviv, heard about the hotel from friends before his latest trip to New York and quickly booked a room. "I used to stay in Manhattan, but there I can only find a couple of places to pray, so every day it is a problem," he said. "Here everything is nearby. I don't think I would ever go back" to Manhattan.
Such sentiments have fed the growth of local businesses, many of which have tailored their appeal to overseas customers. Eagle Electronics, which has an international mail order and Internet business from its 13th Avenue store, does such a brisk trade in the 220-volt appliances used overseas that many are displayed in its windows.
Eichlers, one of the largest sellers of Jewish books in the world, sits across the avenue at 50th Street and last year doubled its size. It now carries about 50,000 Hebrew and English books and offers about 200,000 other Judaic items like Kiddush cups and prayer shawls. About 30 percent of the store's business comes from out-of-state customers, while the eight-month-old Internet site -- which also draws from two smaller satellite stores in Manhattan and Flatbush -- accounts for nearly 15 percent of all mail-order sales, said Moish Perl, a manager.
The store's prices help to draw many Europeans and Israelis, said Mr. Perl, noting that one volume of the Schottenstein Talmud costing $80 in Israel can be bought in his store for around $35.
Another store that says it undercuts European prices is Mostly Music. The store's manager said it charged about 10 percent less for compact discs than a customer might pay overseas. The store, one of the largest Jewish music stores in the world, recently tripled its size and now carries more than 10,000 Jewish titles, from wedding music to rap. All of its inventory can also be bought over its new Internet site.
Since few storefronts are available, some entrepreneurs are buying out longtime merchants. Sara Kasten and her family took over a basement variety store called All in One last month after noticing that people were buying suitcases at the 11-year-old business and then filling them up with merchandise there before flying back home. They have not changed the name or the merchandise, and more than half the store's business is now from tourists, she said.
On most Sundays, Ms. Kasten said, "You can't even walk down the street, it's so packed."
So some shoppers, like Mr. Notis, were happy to be out on a weekday to avoid the crush. After two nights in the Avenue Plaza Hotel and hours buzzing in and out of stores, he finally found a birthday present for his wife: a cherry wood jewelry box.
"Just a day at the mall," he said, looking at the box before getting ready for his flight. "Now I'll have to come back and buy some jewelry to fill it up."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL BRIEFING;
Angry Words Flutter Once Again in Dixie

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
In South Carolina, where the Civil War started and sometimes seems never to have quite ended, the fighting has flared up again.
This time, as so often in recent decades, the issue is the Confederate flag. A hundred and thirty-four years after Appomattox, it still flies over the Capitol dome in Columbia. 
 Blacks and many New South Southerners see that as a gratuitous insult. Old South Southerners tend to see it as heritage on parade and, in some lingering cases, as defiance.
Earlier this year, the N.A.A.C.P. called for an economic boycott of South Carolina, beginning next January, to force the state to remove the flag. Some organizations planning to hold conventions in the state have since canceled them even though the boycott has not officially begun.
But the flag nevertheless has stayed up. Only the State Legislature can order its removal, and so far a majority of its members have not been moved by a few convention cancellations.
Now comes Dick Harpootlian, the chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party and a flag opponent, with a plan he contends will break the impasse.
Democratic legislators who want to keep the flag up, he says, should be singled out for defeat by the party in next year's primary elections. Without Democratic votes, he argues, Republicans in the Legislature -- they are the flag's staunchest supporters -- could not muster enough votes to keep it flying.
"This ought to be the litmus test for candidates," he told the party's executive committee last week. "We'll take them individually and beat them. We see the enemy and it is us."
Some Democrats countered that the enemy was, in fact, "us" -- one Dick Harpootlian.
Kevin Geddings, the chief of staff to Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat, accused Mr. Harpootlian of irresponsible "political hyperbole."
"This doesn't get us anywhere near a compromise that someday will bring the flag down," Mr. Geddings said, alluding to efforts by the Governor to find a middle ground in the flag fight, perhaps by moving it to a memorial park.
The Governor has been working on the issue since the day he took office, having won election last year when the incumbent Republican, David Beasley, lost a bid for a second term after running afoul of both flag proponents and opponents.
Mr. Harpootlian, always outspoken, always politically testy, always spoiling for a fight, said that his only interest was keeping the party on a course true to its core beliefs and a course that would build up the party after years of decline.
That was not good enough for State Representative Marion Carnell of Greenwood County, one of the pro-flag Democrats.
"He's going to destroy an already-weakened party," Mr. Carnell warned.
But it was more than good enough for Republican leaders. They invited threatened Democrats to join the G.O.P.

HEADLINE: Corporations Battling to Bar Use of E-MailFor Unions

BYLINE: By NOAM S. COHEN 

 BODY:
The organizing drive among the engineers at the Pratt & Whitney factory in Palm Beach, Fla., was a home-grown affair. The leadership of the aspiring union, the Florida Professional Association, knew it had a difficult job, and in an early appeal stressed that "just because we are seeking change doesn't mean we're radicals."
While they may not have been radicals, they did employ a novel tactic: they sent their appeals to all of the factory's 2,000 engineers at their company E-mail addresses. 
 "We got away with about 10" of the mass mailings, said Kenneth Coolidge, the union treasurer, "before the company found out and objected." Those objections led to the suspension of Mr. Coolidge and the union's president, Brian Waldron, for using the company's E-mail system for what was deemed personal business.
Last month, more than two years after the suspensions, the union in Florida agreed to withdraw a complaint accusing Pratt & Whitney of using unfair labor practices in return for the company's pledge to allow the limited use of its system for such E-mail in the future. And both sides along the labor-management divide are looking to this settlement for signs of how friendly an environment cyberspace -- particularly the cyberspace surrounding corporate offices and factories -- will be for the labor movement.
While some union officials have been emboldened by the settlement and the Government's decision to side with the suspended employees, others say they will tread lightly until there is a greater consensus about the rules for contacting employees via corporate E-mail addresses. And all the while, companies are fighting to keep their systems off limits.
E-mail has become common in many workplaces that unions are eager to organize, including those at software companies and in other high-technology industries. And unions have found it an unusually effective organizing tool, one that combines the intimacy of a conversation, the efficiency of mass-produced leaflets and the precision of delivery by mail to work forces that are often widely dispersed.
"It saves time, it saves money," said Michael Blain of the Washington Alliance of Technical Workers, or Washtech, a affiliate of the Communication Workers of America that is trying to organize software workers in the state of Washington. "We can reach 1,300 people by just hitting 'send.' "
The union leaders at Pratt & Whitney, a unit of the United Technologies Corporation, who ultimately failed in their drive to organize the Palm Beach plant, said they had used E-mail to respond quickly to management statements. "If you get the information out quick, the bureaucracy has to be more accountable," Mr. Coolidge said.
Companies may find it galling to see unions capitalize on corporate E-mail systems to organize workers. When nonemployees send E-mail to organize, some say, that should be considered trespass, and when employees receive union E-mail at work, it will invariably be read on company time, a practice that they say labor law should prohibit.
"E-mail from unions does interfere with employers' expectation that work time is for work," said Frank C. Morris Jr., a lawyer who represents management in labor disputes. "The unions are trying to make extraordinary use of a tool that didn't exist until recently for their benefit."
Companies also contend that any mass E-mailing, even if about work conditions or union organizing, is an intrusion comparable to the "spamming" done by commercial outfits. Intel recently persuaded a California Superior Court judge to order a former employee, Ken Hamidi, to stop sending E-mail messages to its employees by invoking common law about trespass. (Mr. Hamidi has appealed the ruling.) According to court papers, Mr. Hamidi sent more than 30,000 E-mail messages about the company's employment policies in six bursts between 1996 and 1998 while avoiding the company's efforts to thwart him.
The California court's decision has angered free-speech advocates who say E-mail is useful precisely because it is not trespassing.
"E-mail is potentially a solution to previously insoluble dilemma," said Lewis Maltby of the American Civil Liberties Union's employment rights office. "Employees have a right to organize and employers don't have to allow trespassers. But now employees have a way of learning about unions without trespassing on the employers' property."
Some organizers are eager to test how far they can go. "We have E-mailed, and thought about using E-mail in organizing drives," said George Kohl, research director for the Communications Workers of America. "But the context we work in is that we don't own" the company's E-mail system.
Tellingly, the union did not contact anyone at a corporate E-mail address during its successful campaign this month to organize 10,000 passenger service employees of USAirways Group Inc. Instead, it relied on a bulletin board at the union Web site, Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman, said. "We don't use corporate E-mail," Ms. Johnson said. "We just think there are better ways to do it without the risk."
A more common use of E-mail at the Communications Workers of America, said Suman Ray, a research economist there, is to build up a network among people already committed to the cause. That way there is no concern of antagonizing noncooperative employees who might inform management about the unsolicited messages.
At the Microsoft Corporation, for example, Washtech organizers have collected a list of 1,300 supporters, including nearly 200 people who gave Microsoft E-mail addresses. (While the other 1,100 presumably work at Microsoft and other software companies in the area, organizers said, most gave home E-mail addresses.) "We don't worry about sending to Microsoft addresses," Mr. Blain said, although he added that he thought the company had the ability to block out any messages coming from Washtech.
Referring to the National Labor Relations Board, he added, "That's not the direction the N.L.R.B. is heading, and if Microsoft were to discriminate, that is illegal." A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on the company's policy.
Even at unionized companies, there are no clear guidelines for union access to corporate E-mail systems; increasingly it is becoming another bargaining issue.
A shop steward of the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association, which represents engineers and technical workers at the Boeing Company of Seattle, was recently given a written warning for sending a message to 80 or so workers about "a workplace issue at that location," said Phyllis Rogers, the union's general counsel. She said the union understood that such communication would be permitted if directed at fewer than 200 people.
Ms. Rogers said the union, which represents 25,000 professional workers, mainly in the Puget Sound area, had formed a negotiating committee to address the issue. The union's current contract expires on Dec. 1.
A Boeing spokeswoman, Amanda Landers, would not discuss the specific dispute but said that in general, Boeing allowed nonbusiness E-mail only for "incidental, personal use." Ms. Rogers, the union lawyer, said, "We are offended that our correspondence should be considered the same as any other E-mails, because we have a legal relationship with the company."
In the Pratt & Whitney case, the company conceded in an E-mail dated July 6 that employees can use E-mail to "initiate a response or reciprocal discussion, relating to terms and conditions of employment, and the employee's interest in self-organization" as long as the use was "occasional, incidental and infrequent." But since that agreement was made without a ruling from the National Labor Relations Board, which referees union organizing, it is not precedent-setting.
"These cases are bubbling up," said Fred Feinstein, the general counsel for the labor relations board, whose office decides whether to file complaints against companies for unfair labor practices. In a recent report summarizing important issues coming before the board, Mr. Feinstein made it clear that he considered the right to use E-mail to be protected under the National Labor Relations Act, relying on distinctions from a time when factories were the new battleground.
Mr. Feinstein said he believed that in at least some cases, E-mail is best compared to "solicitation," one-on-one conversation typically permitted in factories during work breaks anywhere on company property, instead of "distribution" of literature, which can typically be more closely regulated. (Of course, this presumes that a union's E-mail message would be read by workers during a work break.)
Mr. Morris, the management lawyer, objected to this reasoning and said unions "have had the benefit of a Clinton-appointed N.L.R.B. that has not taken into account the costs." He said it was foolish to apply Industrial Age examples to new technologies and said Congressional legislation might be the best way to devise rules to protect companies.

HEADLINE: Britons Skirmish Over Genetically Modified Crops

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: PICCOTTS END, England, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Fields of shin-high wheat, a carpet of white daisies, wild clover underfoot, lazy oaks overhead: Bob Fiddaman's farm at the end of a winding lane curbed with hedgerows provides an unlikely battleground.
But that is what it has become since Mr. Fiddaman offered to devote some of his land to test planting of seed crops that have been genetically modified -- G.M. in the shorthand of the battle-hardened. 
 He and three other farmers whose willingness to take part in the Government-run trials was made public last week have been targeted by protesters who have already invaded other such plantings, trampling and ripping up roots in fields of oil seed rape and corn.
"It's quite likely there will be some sort of direct action against the crops at some point," said Andrew Wood of the protest group Genetic Snowball. "The public has made it clear they don't want G.M. crops, and there is no need for these tests."
The protesters' acts of destruction, while illegal and extreme, are an expression of the widespread opposition to the introduction of genetically modified crops in Europe and particularly in Britain.
Genetic modification of food has been a relatively unquestioned phenomenon in the United States and Canada, with altered ingredients in a range of processed food from soft drinks to beer to breakfast cereals. It is also common in animal feeds and soya, corn and cotton seeds.
But its arrival here has set off alarms and united demonstrators from lapsed causes into a powerful protest movement against what they call "Frankenstein food" and the large multinational companies promoting it.
There is no government agency in Europe of the regulatory rigor of the United States Food and Drug Administration to build consumer confidence, and government approval can arouse as much suspicion as it can provide reassurance. This is nowhere truer than in Britain, where the public is sensitized by the outbreak of mad cow disease in 1996 and the Government's tardy conclusion that it was something that could harm humans.
"Let's face it, there are a lot of considerations in Britain that don't apply elsewhere," Mr. Fiddaman said, "the fact that we are an island, the fact that agriculture is not spread out across broad spaces but is close to inhabited areas, and the whole tradition here of wanting to keep land pure and unspoiled even by conventional agriculture."
A new MORI poll says 79 percent of the British public think that genetically modified crop testing of the kind Mr. Fiddaman has agreed to should be stopped. Major food manufacturers, supermarkets and fast food chains have already announced the removal of all genetically modified ingredients from their products sold in Britain.
The Government of Prime Minister Tony Blair, though on record as in favor of genetically modified foods, has been forced by political pressure to impose a set of largely unenforceable regulations on food outlets demanding that they identify on menus items that may have traces of genetically modified soya or wheat.
One of the central tenets of Mr. Blair's self-described "modernizing" program is the determination to see Britain become a country in the forefront of technological innovation, and he has been caught out by the furor over genetically modified food.
The British press has seen the issue as one for crusading journalism, and the scare headlines and wide publicity given to selected scientific studies alleging danger prompted Mr. Blair to accuse newspapers and broadcasters of fomenting "hysteria" and "skewing" coverage away from the more numerous studies finding no fault with genetically modified food.
It has been a moment where the Blair Government's vaunted ability to capture the public mood has failed it, in the process reinforcing some underlying concerns about the otherwise popular Government -- that it is cocky, beholden to big business and subservient to the United States.
The issue of scientifically altered food is the subject of a growing political dispute between Europe and America. Last month, Washington imposed tariffs on food imported from members of the European Union after the Europeans banned the importation of American hormone-treated beef. The World Trade Organization has declared the European ban unjustified because there is no scientific evidence that hormone-treated beef is unhealthy.
Monsanto, the American food company behind much of the genetically modified food in Britain, has seen a large public relations program aimed at halting its demonization by the British public have just the opposite effect.
The genetic modification at issue is a way of adding genes that confer resistance to insect, fungal and viral pests to plants that might otherwise die or require heavy doses of pesticides. It can also, as in the case of Mr. Fiddaman's crops, foster herbicide-resistance, meaning that weeds can be killed with a single spray that leaves the crops standing.
Objections to genetically modified food rest on the broad claims that genetic manipulation is an act against nature, that the food it produces is dangerous and that its cultivation damages the environment. There is scant scientific evidence to support any of these conclusions, and farmers like Mr. Fiddaman argue that only field tests, the procedure the protesters seek to halt, can come up with rational answers to people's worries.
The protesters who have destroyed test sites say letting them proceed would allow the escape of transplanted genes from crops to related wild species and contaminate the environment. Recent laboratory studies at Cornell University showing that monarch butterflies were stunted and killed by eating pollen from genetically modified corn received enormous attention here.
The first case to arouse concern was a study conducted by Dr. Arpad Pusztai, a 69-year-old scientist with the Rowett Research Institute in Aberdeen, who told a BBC television documentary last August that the British public was being used as "guinea pigs" for the testing of genetically modified food. He said he based his conclusion on tests he had conducted in which rats fed genetically altered potatoes experienced stunted organ and brain growth and breakdowns in their immune systems.
He was immediately dismissed by Rowett, where he had worked for 36 years, and he was criticized by fellow scientists for going public with tests that had not gone through the standard procedures of peer review and publication. Sir Robert May, a noted biologist who is the Government's chief scientist, called Dr. Pusztai's research "garbage." The Royal Society, Britain's senior scientific academy, examined the study and said it was "flawed in many aspects of design, execution and analysis."
The scare has mobilized a late-arriving consumer movement in Britain and galvanized people with broad anti-establishment concerns beyond food safety, ranging from anger at the growing industrialization and corporate control of British agriculture to opposition to the construction of new highways in rural areas.
They have received the backing of Prince Charles, a passionate organic farmer, who scheduled a meeting with Dr. Pusztai and expressed sympathy for his findings and decried the reaction of other scientists to his study.
Mr. Fiddaman, 54, has been farming the same land since 1971. He pointed past a tractor and a tool shed to the field where he is about to start planting genetically modified winter oil seed rape. "The protesters say they believe these crops may be dangerous, but they refuse to let us go forward with the testing to see if they are right," he said.
"If I am wrong, I'll have to accept that," he said, "but I wouldn't be offering the fields if I thought it was going to produce contamination." The owners of adjacent fields have backed his decision.
The seeds come from AgrEvo, a German joint venture of Hoechst A.G. and Schering A.G. They give the plants a tolerance for a herbicide that kills all the weeds around them, thereby allowing Mr. Fiddaman to reduce the amount of pesticides he will be spraying. Genetically modified food promoters argue that in this way their produce actually benefits the environment.
Scientists will be visiting unannounced throughout the yearlong process, and their findings will go to the government technical bodies judging the tests.
The police have been caught by surprise or unawares in past attacks, which are often conducted at night by people in full body anti-contamination suits and goggles.
Thirty people, including Lord Peter Melchett, 51, the executive director of Greenpeace U.K., were arrested in Norfolk last month after they destroyed a field of crops. Lord Melchett described the act as one of "decontamination" and said his organization was dedicated to ending "the whole program of commercialization of G.M. pollution disguised as science."
The owner of the field, William Brigham, 59, said: "This has nothing to do with genetically modified organisms. It's whether we want democratic government in this country or anarchy."
The local police have promised Mr. Fiddaman a quick response if he calls with reports of trespassers.
"But there's not much I can do," he said, "The fields are only protected by hedgerows. I don't mind their opposing the tests, but I find their vandalism abhorrent. If they want to come and stand over there with protest flags, I don't mind. But they shouldn't trash the land."

HEADLINE: Study Says Welfare Changes Made the Poorest Worse Off

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Changes made three years ago have succeeded in cutting the welfare rolls but have driven the poorest families deeper into poverty, while slightly raising the incomes of those who are somewhat better off, said a study released today by an organization that opposed the law.
"The conventional wisdom here in Washington is that welfare reform is an unqualified success because caseload reductions have been so dramatic," said Wendell Primus, a researcher at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research organization that released the study and is hoping to re-examine the definition of success. 
 "We are not saying in this report that welfare reform is terrible," said Mr. Primus, who resigned a top post with the Department of Health and Human Services to protest President Clinton's signing of the welfare bill three years ago today. "We're saying we have to bring more balance to what welfare reform is all about."
Others argue that most families are better off over all.
The biggest problem, opposing camps agree, is that many families who leave welfare are not getting food stamps even though they remain eligible for the benefit. In 1995, 88 percent of poor children benefited from food stamps. By last year, the number had fallen to 70 percent.
Welfare caseloads have been cut nearly in half since peaking in 1994.
"More Americans are enjoying the freedom of independence from the chains of welfare," Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, said in a statement. Mr. Archer is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversaw the welfare overhaul. But a report from the committee and testimony from the Clinton Administration earlier this year acknowledged that the poor were losing ground.
"There are people at the bottom who are worse off," said Ron Haskins, staff director for the committee's welfare panel, who helped to write the welfare law. "We need to do something about that." But Mr. Haskins said that more people were better off.
Using Census Bureau and caseload data, the study examined families headed by single women and found that their economic situations generally improved from 1993 to 1995. But in the next two years, the poorest 20 percent of these families lost an average of $577 a year, with incomes falling to $8,047 annually. Typically, these families had left welfare but had not made up lost benefits with wages. The situation was worse for the poorest 10 percent, who lost an average of $814 a year.
The problem, both sides said, involves those people who are forced off the rolls but have not figured out how to support themselves.
"In the old days," Mr. Haskins said, "nobody cared about them. They just stayed on welfare forever. Now, even to stay on welfare you need a certain level of competence. There are things you must do. If not, they cut your benefits."
The report found that families in the next income tier came out ahead, but only by an average of $110 a year, raising their average annual income to $15,857. These families were able to replace welfare with work and benefited financially, if only slightly, but would have fared even better had they kept the food stamps they were entitled to receive. They lost an average of $530 in food stamps from 1995 to 1997, the report showed.
Mr. Primus suggested that given the strong economy, they would be doing even better.
But Mr. Haskins said the law was designed so people would replace welfare with work. "The system is working exactly the way you drew it up on the chalkboard," he said.
Mr. Clinton also has expressed concern about declining food stamp rolls. Speaking at a welfare-to-work conference in Chicago this month, he called it "the only piece of troubling news in this whole happy scenario."
He said the Administration had not been able to determine why the rolls were falling, although some officials believe families do not know that they remain eligible for food stamps.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
One Republican Trailblazer Joins Forces With Another

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Republican pollster Linda DiVall and the Republican Presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole are, in many ways, an odd couple.
They differ in style, with Ms. DiVall's blunt, matter-of-fact demeanor containing none of the sugary flourishes that garnish Mrs. Dole. They disagree on some issues, with Ms. DiVall supporting a woman's right to a legal abortion and Mrs. Dole expressing deep moral qualms about it. 
 In fact, after Ms. DiVall was hired to work on Mrs. Dole's bid for the Republican Presidential nomination earlier this year, a few Republicans contacted the Dole campaign to protest the decision.
"They didn't think I was conservative enough," Ms. DiVall said over lunch last week, smiling wryly at the thought.
The criticism, Ms. DiVall said, ignored her work in the past for politicians who are not exactly considered moderates -- the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich sprang quickly to her mind.
More important, the critics were missing a larger point that spoke to just how hard Ms. DiVall would be willing to fight for Mrs. Dole, just how much Ms. DiVall cared about this candidate's success.
For Ms. DiVall, the Dole campaign is not just another contract, another source of income, another line on her resume.
"It's history," Ms. DiVall said, referring to the fact that no one before Mrs. Dole had attempted "a serious, viable female candidacy" for the Presidency. "To be part of that was something that I thought would be terrific."
So much so that in January, on the day after Mrs. Dole announced that she was going to leave her job as president of the American Red Cross, Ms. DiVall visited the organization's headquarters to introduce and pitch herself to Mrs. Dole.
It was a case of one Republican trailblazer hooking arms with another. In 1985, when Ms. DiVall started her firm, American Viewpoint Inc., which has offices in Alexandria, Va., she was the first female pollster in the Republican Party to strike out on her own.
Today, Ms. DiVall, 46, is one of the half-dozen best-known pollsters in the party. Because she is the only woman on that list, she is assumed to be particularly attuned to the way female voters feel about Republican candidates.
Over the last two decades, women have generally shown a stronger preference for Democrats. That gender gap has been a subject of enormous frustration and intense study for Ms. DiVall, whose own lifelong allegiance to the Republican Party arises from her belief that the Federal Government should be leaner and less quick to assume that it has the prescriptions for all social maladies.
A significant part of the gap, Ms. DiVall said, has to do with women's less certain purchase on economic security and more ingrained roles as caretakers. Those realities, she said, incline women to expect the Government to play an actively protective role that is more in line with Democratic ideology and oratory.
But, she added, another force pushing women away from Republicans is more easily fixed, and that is what she described as the "judgmental, intolerant, scolding and dour" attitude that too many Republican politicians project.
Much of the polling she has done for Republicans is intended to help them find the right terms and tenor for articulating their smaller-Government message without seeming callous. Ms. DiVall similarly coaches candidates who oppose abortion on less preachy enunciations of their beliefs.
"There's not always going to be a softening," Ms. DiVall said, referring to a candidate's position. "And I'm not trying to do that.
"But I'm trying to say that there are others out there with different views, and they are not irrelevant."
SHE would rather be golfing. When she left Mount Prospect, Ill., the Chicago suburb where her mother and her father, an extremely successful accountant, raised her and two younger sisters, she headed to Arizona State University with the goals of "getting rid of my hay fever and becoming a professional golfer."
"I failed on both counts," she said.
A political science professor with his own polling company exposed her to that line of work, which appealed to her appreciation for measurable truths.
"I thought, who could possibly dispute the person who had the numbers in a campaign?" Ms. DiVall said. "Little did I know."
Ms. DiVall, who is unmarried and childless, first did research and other work for the Republican National Committee and for the National Republican Congressional Committee. By the time she struck out on her own, she had made all the right moves.
"She was a real pioneer," said Christine Matthews, 35, a Republican pollster for another company. Additionally, Ms. Matthews said, "She challenges the party's status quo, and she challenges assumptions that the party can't be inclusive."
Ms. DiVall can often be found with a five iron at the Mount Vernon Country Club, which allows women to play golf at any time of the weekend -- not just during prescribed periods of the day -- unlike some other clubs around Washington.
She loves the game enough that last year, when a political trade journal asked her to name her favorite books, she listed "Ben Hogan's Five Fundamental Lessons of Golf" alongside the Ayn Rand novel "Atlas Shrugged."
Ms. DiVall knows that Mrs. Dole lags far behind Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the polls, but she is not discouraged. She said that Mrs. Dole could yet prove to be a magnet for those who do not typically vote Republican.
"Anybody's who's paying attention to this race is probably guilty of deviant behavior," Ms. DiVall said. "Most voters won't tune in until a year from now."

HEADLINE: Career Singed in Global Bank Fires

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN with RAYMOND BONNER 

 BODY:
Seven years ago, Natasha Gurfinkel, a young executive at the Bank of New York, joined an elite contingent of American bankers sent to Russia and earned an important break in her career.
Her mission was to help the new Russia create a Western-style banking system, and her self-assured, savvy touch impressed top bankers and regulators on the trip. Only a few months after her return, she was promoted to head the bank's division for Eastern Europe. 
 At 37 she was taking on a big assignment for a woman at a buttoned-down New York bank.
But she seemed perfect for the job. Fluent in her native Russian and able to move seamlessly from Wall Street to Moscow, she built a lucrative business for the bank. New Russian companies needed access to American money and American banks, and Ms. Gurfinkel became known as banker who could get things done.
Back in New York she was a prominent member of a generation of young Russian emigres who, armed with Western educations, were rising through the ranks of companies angling for business in Russia and Eastern Europe.
Whether it was a dinner speech with a Russian leader or a black-tie Russian ball, Ms. Gurfinkel was an important presence, especially after she married Konstatin Kagalovsky, a onetime reformer in the Kremlin who had become a wealthy Russian businessman.
"Everyone knew her," said the former chairman of a major Western bank that does extensive business in Russia. "Number one, because of her husband."
But last week Ms. Kagalovsky was suspended by the Bank of New York, and she is a central figure in what Federal investigators suspect could be one of the biggest money laundering schemes in history. Investigators say billions of dollars may have been channeled through accounts at the Bank of New York by Russian organized crime as well as by embezzlement from Russian companies.
"This is a serious thing," Ms. Kagalovsky said during a brief telephone conversation during the weekend. "They've told me not to say anything. I'm just sorry about the whole thing."
Ms. Kagalovsky is not the only bank executive involved in the investigation.
Lyudmila Edwards, known as Lucy, has been suspended as well. Ms. Edwards, 41 and also Russian-born, was a vice president in the bank's London office working for Ms. Kagalovsky.
The scope of their role in any money laundering is unclear. The suspensions from their jobs do not mean that they are guilty of wrongdoing.
Wall Street companies have a long history of singling out "rogue employees" who once raked in big profits as the masterminds of financial scandals. It is a strategy often embraced by companies anxious to insulate themselves from lawsuits and other trouble that can follow embarrassing disclosures.
Last week, Government investigators raided Bank of New York offices in New York and London, seizing documents from the offices of Ms. Kagalovsky and Ms. Edwards.
The British police also searched the apartment of Ms. Edwards and her husband, Peter Berlin, who had authority over one of the accounts that authorities are examining -- an account through which $4.2 billion in laundered funds is believed to have passed.
The Bank of New York said last week that it had been cooperating with the Federal investigation of the matter, which involves the use of the bank to transfer funds from Russia to other countries. The bank said there were no allegations of wrongdoing against it and repeatedly declined to comment further. Nor have the women have been accused of any wrongdoing.
The class of "New Russians" that Ms. Kagalovsky and her husband belonged to emerged in Moscow in the early 1990's as Russia threw open its its economy to foreign investment.
These younger Russians, many of them with high-paying jobs that their parents never dreamed of, were in the vanguard of Russia's embrace of capitalism. They could be picked out by the cell phones, luxury automobiles, private security guards and pricey restaurants they favored.
Western bankers said Ms. Kagalovsky was a well-known member of that world when she visited Moscow, often adorned in expensive fur coats. Her husband, a former Russian Government official, was a senior executive at Menatep, a now-insolvent Russian bank. He is now the vice chairman of Yukos, a major Russian oil company.
All of that was a long way from Ms. Kagalovsky's modest beginnings. Born in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, in 1954, she attended what was then Leningrad State University and earned the equivalent of bachelor's and master's degrees in Oriental studies.
In 1979 she immigrated to the United States and eventually enrolled at Princeton University, earning a master's degree in Near Eastern studies. In 1986 she joined the Irving Bank Corporation, which Bank of New York acquired in 1988.
At the bank, she worked for Vladimir Galitzine, nicknamed Mickey, a Russian emigre with a royal pedigree who headed its Eastern European business. Both reported to Alan R. Griffith, head of international banking, and Ms. Kagalovsky quickly won Mr. Griffith's favor.
"Natasha was more pushy, whereas Mickey was more of a gentleman," said a former Bank of New York employee familiar with Ms. Kagalovsky's rise at the bank.
People who know Mr. Galitzine said family problems in the early 1990's distracted him from his work and he began ceding more authority to Ms. Kagalovsky.
By 1992 she successfully leapfrogged Mr. Galitzine and won control of the Eastern European division, although the two executives are said to have remained friends. Mr. Galitzine declined to comment on any aspect of the investigation.
Like Ms. Kagalovsky, Ms. Edwards was born in Leningrad and worked at Irving Bank, ending up as an assistant to Ms. Kagalovsky and Mr. Galitzine.
She was born Lyudmila Pritzker in 1958, and might have spent her entire life in Russia had she not met a young American in the merchant marine in 1977. Although she was only 19, she married him that year at the American consulate in Leningrad, a relative said.
The couple moved to America and lived in Illinois briefly before moving further west. She became an American citizen in 1981, but her marriage was troubled. She and her husband were divorced in 1987, and Ms. Edwards moved to the East Coast, eventually landing a job in banking.
At the Bank of New York, Ms. Edwards worked hard enough to win the London assignment, and she impressed competitors.
"She was very outgoing, a spunky woman, who really wanted to take care of her clients," said a rival banker who competed for business in Russia. "She was very professional. People liked her."
A few years ago, Ms. Edwards married Peter Berlin, a Russian who acquired American citizenship through his marriage to her. And Mr. Berlin's own business pursuits appear to be one focus of the Federal money laundering investigation.
Mr. Berlin, 44, operated Benex, a company he appears to have run in part from his home in Queens with a telephone and a personal computer, an investigator said. For a period, Mr. Berlin also ran a travel agency in New Jersey, also under the name of Benex, said a Brooklyn investment manager who occasionally used his services.
It was account records related to Benex that sparked the money laundering investigation. The first Federal subpoenas produced 3,500 pages of documents related to Benex, investigators said.
Among the services Benex provided was getting visas to the United States for associates of Semyon Yukovich Mogilevich, whom the authorities suspect of being a Russian organized crime leader, said an American official.
Neither Mr. Mogilevich nor Ms. Edwards or her husband could be reached for comment. In the past, Mr. Mogilevich has denied any ties to organized crime.
Federal investigators also are trying to determine whether some of the money channeled through the Bank of New York came from Menatep, where Ms. Kagalovsky's husband once worked. Western investors and the Russian regulatory authorities suspect Menatep and related companies of having looted money from Russia, allegations the companies have denied.
Mr. Kagalovsky could not be reached for comment.
In the meantime, Ms. Kagalovsky said she had retained Stanley Arkin, a New York criminal defense lawyer noted for his involvement in high-profile financial fraud cases. Mr. Arkin declined to comment on the case.
In the end, Ms. Kagalovsky may wish she had examined some of her clients more closely, although doing business with Russian companies is never an easy matter. As Ms. Kagalovsky said in a 1993 interview, Russian companies are not known for disclosing very much.
"You have to understand business needs and try to assess whether they will survive the coming years, often without the benefit of annual reports or any written material," she told the newspaper The American Banker.

HEADLINE: Hardened by Their History of Hardships, Russians Simply Stretch the Rubles Further

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 22

 BODY:
By early evening, there was already a crush of young professionals, families and couples lined up to eat at Arkady Novikov's newest restaurant.
For 130 rubles a plate (slightly over $5), Mr. Novikov was offering an oriental buffet of stir-fried vegetables, topped with a mound of sliced meat. Festooned with colorful banners and other trappings from the East, the restaurant has been a huge hit since it opened near Pushkin Square a month ago. 
 For a time, it had looked as if the financial crisis that struck Russia last August would sound the death knell for restaurants like Yolki-Palki, Mr. Novikov's chain of Moscow eateries aimed squarely at the small but emerging middle class.
The plunging ruble was sending costs through the roof and scaring away customers. Mr. Novikov's restaurants, established to serve cheap food to the middle class, would soon be serving expensive food to the poor, the 37-year-old restaurateur said glumly at the time.
One year and several prime ministers later, Mr. Novikov has weathered the storm. By substituting home-grown produce for imported ingredients and trimming his staff, he has managed to hold down prices. Instead of collapsing, Yolki-Palki has even managed to expand.
The devaluation of the ruble dealt a heavy blow to the nation. Russia's economic reformers were discredited. The capital's fledgling financial sector was hit by sweeping layoffs. The purchasing power of Russian consumers dwindled. And the ranks of the poor swelled.
But by using the particularly Russian talent of adapting to seemingly any hardship, many people have managed to cling to vestiges of life before the crisis. Some enterprises have even prospered, with the weakened ruble protecting them from competition from foreign-produced goods, both at home and abroad.
The crisis has made a cynical public even more distrustful of the Government and its seemingly endless promises of economic reform. But a strange mixture of self-reliance, humor and weary resignation have kept a nation famous for revolutions from falling apart.
"Russians lost confidence in their country's future a year ago, and they still have no faith in the Government," Yevgeny Yasin, a former Economics Minister under President Boris N. Yeltsin, wrote in Moscow News. "They also have more self-reliance."
Before the crisis, the basic precepts of the Russian economy were very different. Russia's leading politicians and the International Monetary Fund cast the ruble as a pillar of political stability.
A free-falling currency, one Clinton Administration official warned ominously before the devaluation, might even lead to "Indonesia with nuclear weapons."
Then came Aug. 17, 1998, a day that Russians refer to grimly, the way Americans might think of the 1929 stock market crash, when the Yeltsin Government announced that it would no longer try to prop up the ruble. Panic swept the capital as the ruble begin to slide from its exchange rate of 6 rubles to 1 dollar to a rate of 20 to a dollar and even more.
Russians raced to retrieve their savings from the nation's poorly regulated banks, only to find that the banks had shut their doors. Shop shelves were picked clean as consumers frantically bought foreign televisions and old Soviet-era staples like salt and toilet paper, fearing a return to the shortages of old.
The rich were humbled but still managed to hang on to their place at the top. Virtually none of the nation's oligarchs -- the tycoons who dominate the economy and politics -- were displaced.
For the poorest, life was so hard before the devaluation that many barely noticed the crisis. None of them had credit cards, and they lived off the potatoes and vegetables from their modest kitchen gardens.
The most dramatic effects were felt by those in between: the small middle class and the large number of working poor. As unemployment rose and employers sought to cut costs by slashing wages, millions of Russians slid from a threadbare existence into absolute poverty.
A year ago, 33 million people -- 22 percent of the population -- had incomes below $6 a month, the official poverty level, according to the Russian Government. Now 55 million people -- 37 percent of the population -- live in poverty, according to Government statistics.
The political consequences were also huge. Sergei V. Kiriyenko, the pro-free market Prime Minister, was ousted. Yevgeny M. Primakov, a former Soviet official, was installed in his place.
Mr. Primakov's approval ratings rose after he declared that he lacked a master plan to pull the economy out of its crisis; the public had become so mistrustful of the Government that it preferred inaction to bold new policies.
"No one I know expects anything from the Government or any other authorities," said Tatyana Tolstaya, one of Russia's most trenchant writers. "People try to survive without the Government as much as possible."
Surviving has not been easy, particularly in the far-flung ruins of the Soviet state, where electricity and hot water are often a luxury. And even in better-off cities like Moscow, the rising costs of gas and food have prompted concerns about a return of inflation. But for many Russians, the hardship may remain but the sense of panic has gone.
Eya Motskobili, a 37-year-old journalist at Kommersant, one of Russia's leading financial newspapers, typifies the stoicism of many middle-class Russians.
Her monthly salary was slashed from more than $1,500 a month to $250. Long years of toil went for naught when her bank refused to return $8,000 in savings. And it became harder for Ms. Motskobili to find the imported medicine that her mother needs to battle cancer.
"We were just beginning to feel like we were living in a European country, so what happened was a real blow," she said bluntly but without bitterness.
By cutting back on vacations, shopping at secondhand clothing stores and buying food at wholesale markets, however, she has managed to cope.
It is not an isolated story. Russian television recently highlighted a former business manager who pumps gas for a living. He was depicted not as a failure but as a hardy and philosophic survivor.
The middle class -- a group whose family incomes may have been $1,000 a month or more before the crisis, and who became accustomed to Western appliances and vacations abroad -- may have only a fraction of the money it had a year ago. But it still has middle-class values and has struggled hard to preserve what it could of life before the crisis.
New Zhigulis, the boxy Russian automobiles, have displaced foreign cars as prestige automobiles. Hotels at the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi have served record numbers of guests as Russians have cut back on more expensive vacations in Spain and Greece.
Use of the Internet has also soared as Russians look for the latest financial news and for an escape.
Having regained some confidence, some people are able to joke about the crisis, and one of the most popular Web sites is a collection of black humor about the debacle by Artemy Lebedev, a leading graphic artist (http://www.tema.ru/roboty).
"I never miss a chance to take on a subject, but the idea was to make people think that the crisis was not the end of the world," Mr. Lebedev said.
One of Mr. Lebedev's parodies shows the "consumer market basket" after the crisis. It is an empty basketball net.
Public opinion polls also indicate that many Russians have regained their equilibrium, shaky as it was.
Right after the August 1998 crash, 60 percent were pessimistic about Russia's future, according to the Vtsiom polling organization. Now the percentage of pessimists has dropped to 54 percent, about the level before the crisis, returning Russia to its unusual version of normalcy.
"The August crisis was a great economic shock, but the psychological shock was even stronger," said Yuri Levada of Vtsiom. "But after several months the country began to calm down."
As Russians have honed their survival skills and the Government has dithered over its economic strategy, some of the nation's industries have begun to revive on their own.
The weakening ruble has raised the price of imported goods, protecting domestic producers of cars, sausages and yogurt from foreign competition. The currency devaluation has also made Russian commodities more attractive for foreign buyers, helping exports like timber and steel.
The petroleum industry received a badly needed lift as the price of oil rose. Falling oil prices were one factor that worsened the effects of last year's economic crash.
In contrast, production of many consumer goods is down because the average Russian has less money to spend.
Lyudmila Kazmina, a 72-year-old pensioner, knows that trend well. She sells romance novels and calendars outside of her Moscow apartment house to supplement her monthly pension of 500 rubles, which was worth nearly $100 before the crisis but is now worth only $20.
These days, her customers are far more careful in parting with their rubles than they used to be. And on one balmy day last week, she had trouble making a sale.
"Practically everything we had this morning we still have," she said. "I wouldn't say life has become that much worse, but it's become more complicated. People spend more money on food and on what they absolutely need to buy. So they have less money to spend for this."
At the Yolki-Palki chain, Mr. Novikov has worked hard to to cut costs and keep his clientele.
Mr. Novikov, who studied cooking at a Soviet institute as a young man and was once rejected for a job at McDonald's after that fast-food chain began to penetrate the Russian market, is an energetic businessmen. He pioneered a series of expensive theme restaurants before starting the mid-priced Yolki-Palki chain two and half years ago. But Yolki-Palki was threatened by the crisis. As with many restaurants at the time, most of its food came from foreign suppliers. Now almost 90 percent is produced in Russia, a major cost savings.
Still, the effects of the crisis have lingered. Because he has held prices down and some customers have drifted away, Mr. Novikov estimates that revenue is down about 30 percent.
Profits are down. But at least there are profits, enough that Mr. Novikov has expanded the chain to nine restaurants. His enthusiasm for business, however, is tempered by uncertainty over the future.
"You really have to be prepared for anything in this country," he said. "And you have to learn to rely on yourself."

HEADLINE: Peace Deal May Be Near for Ethiopia and Eritrea

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: ON THE BADME PLAIN, Eritrea, Aug. 20

 BODY:
He is a carpenter who became a sniper but who is now very tired of shooting people in this largely overlooked war, deadlier by far than Kosovo.
"Personally," said Feshtsion Tesfaldet, his finger on the trigger and his body tucked in a sandy trench here, "I don't want to see anyone else get killed." 
 Rifle fire still rings out and mortar rounds still drop down, but after 15 months of a particularly senseless conflict, the killing may in fact stop soon along the disputed border of Eritrea and its larger neighbor, Ethiopia. Eritrea has accepted all points of a peace plan. Ethiopia is asking questions about only a few details.
Nothing is certain, but President Clinton said last Monday that, "believe it or not," a deal seems near between the two allies of the United States on the Horn of Africa. He then mentioned the war's most ghastly aspect: 70,000 soldiers had died, he said, though his estimate was higher than most so far.
Before the war began in May 1998, few countries held as much promise as Ethiopia and Eritrea, both poor but industrious and growing economically. And so the war -- fought in trenches with sickening numbers of casualties -- has been a depressing rebuke to so many hopes for Africa.
The nations' allies watched in horror as Ethiopia and Eritrea turned their strengths against each other. They bought millions of dollars of warplanes and tanks and dug trenches. Ethiopia apparently spent thousands of young lives in human-wave assaults on Eritrea's positions, and bodies still lie in plain view, rotting in the rain.
The carnage has been great, and the distrust remains high between the two nations, once so close that the war felt like a domestic spat come to blows. That has made peace hard to find, even now when the disagreements have dwindled to a relatively few technicalities.
"We have never been so close to a peace agreement as now," said one Western diplomat in Eritrea. "Which doesn't mean we will have peace in the next few hours."
Neither nation will discuss the details that divide them. But they agree on much of a plan drafted by the Organization for African Unity and pushed by the United States and the United Nations. The plan calls for a cease-fire; for both sides to withdraw from disputed territory along their 625-mile border; and for outside observers, possibly United Nations peacekeepers, to monitor the accord.
Meanwhile, the United Nations will finally do what did not happen when Eritrea became independent from Ethiopia in 1993: demarcate the border, based on old maps drawn up by Eritrea's colonizer, Italy. The question is especially tricky here along the Badme plain, where the war began and which both sides claim as their own.
In May 1998, after a series of border incidents, Eritrean soldiers marched into the town of Badme, wresting it from the Ethiopian administration. Ethiopia declared war. On the surface, the battles were over Badme, but they were fueled by long tensions over trade and how to live in the same region as equals.
In the peace plan, diplomats say each side wins something. But many Eritreans say Ethiopia comes out on top because Eritrea must withdraw first from the parts of Badme it still holds, a tacit admission that it was first to use the might of its military to settle a border question. Ethiopia can also administer areas it once held while the borders are drawn up.
"It's the most suitable compromise, especially for Ethiopia," said one Eritrean soldier, Girmay Ogbu, 35, here at the front. "If they don't sign this, the world will realize that Ethiopia doesn't want peace."
Still Ethiopia has not signed off on the plan.
Selome Taddesse, a spokeswoman for Ethiopia, noted that her nation had accepted the bulk of the plan last year, when Eritrea had not. She said Ethiopia was "100 percent committed" to the plan but had questions that must be answered by the Organization for African Unity.
"Our questions are very specific," she said. "Our opinion is, the more we are specific, the more there is a guarantee for peace."
Diplomats say two major issues concern whether Ethiopian authorities may carry guns when their administration returns to Badme while the border is being drawn, and what power the outside observers will have to act on complaints by Eritreans living, at least temporarily, under Ethiopian control.
Many people in Eritrea, a proud nation of fighters, believe, though, that Ethiopia's objections mask an intention to reignite the fighting once the rainy season ends in September.
For 30 years, Eritreans battled against Ethiopia to win independence. They beat the former dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, in 1991 alongside a group of Ethiopian rebels who are who now in power in Addis Ababa.
But Eritrea's departure left Ethiopia landlocked, and there is still is some sentiment in Ethiopia that Eritrea should not have been allowed its independence. Eritreans believe that Ethiopia may want to either reclaim Eritrea or replace its current Government, led by President Isaias Afwerki , with one friendlier to Ethiopia.
"What's wrong with Ethiopia is they think they can easily disintegrate Eritrea," said Mehretu Ghebretensae, an Eritrean journalist and former fighter. "They think that by changing the Government they can recolonize Eritrea. That's impossible. Eritrea is in the blood of every Eritrean."
Ethiopia denies that it wants either to take territory or to topple Mr. Afwerki. The goal, officials there say, is to prove that Eritrea cannot use force to settle political problems, such as who owns Badme.
Along the front here -- where soldiers still skirmish at night from trenches only 50 or so yards apart -- the Eritreans say they are skeptical that Ethiopia really wants peace. Some say Ethiopia will not stop until it captures Asmara, Eritrea's capital.
As gunfire blasted between the trenches, Capt. Gebrehiwet Abebe, 39, said Ethiopia's leaders fear peace because that means they will have to explain to the people the enormous number of soldiers killed.
Neither side will release figures, but many analysts here and in Ethiopia estimate that at least 40,000 people have died in the war -- and most believe that Ethiopia suffered by far the higher casualties because it was largely on the offensive. One diplomat here estimated that Ethiopia had lost three soldiers for every Eritrean who died.
"They don't want to answer that question," Captain Abebe said. "That's why they don't want peace. But with pressure from the outside world, it's possible."
But Eritrea's leaders may too have to answer to their people once the war is over. Its losses on the battlefield may not be as high, but many Eritreans have died fighting for a piece of land that may, in fact, end up belonging to Ethiopia.
That could mean trouble for Mr. Afwerki. And it is a possibility many soldiers here, who have watched friends die for Badme, do not like to contemplate.
"We know it's our land," Captain Abebe said tightly. "Don't ask that question."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
In Hamptons, Open a Wallet, Open a Road

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
THE people of the Hamptons have it in their power to help all Americans, and, in the traditional spirit of the Hamptons, they can make out quite nicely themselves, too. They can show everyone else how to end traffic jams.
Instead of relying on failed strategies -- building more highways, trying to limit sprawl, exhorting people to drive less -- Hamptonites can buy their way out of traffic. They can afford to adopt economists' favorite method of unclogging traffic: road pricing. 
 If slots on highways were priced like airline seats or telephone calls, traffic would not come to a standstill at rush hour. The rates could be raised during peak periods to prevent demand from exceeding supply. The theory has always made wonderful sense, but until recently it seemed much too complicated to try on a real highway.
Now road pricing has become technically feasible thanks to electronic toll systems. Some, like EZ Pass, use radio waves; others, like one used on a tollway in Toronto, photograph each license plate. In the newest systems, drivers don't even have to slow down for the toll to be recorded.
With the technological problem solved, the only remaining obstacles are political. Once drivers are accustomed to the free use of a road, they are outraged by the idea of paying for it. In most places, politicians who supported a new toll would be accused of gouging the middle class and banishing the poor.
But the Hamptons are a special place. The New Yorkers who brave the bumper-to-bumper traffic on Route 27 could not object convincingly to a toll. How could they complain about price-gouging when they're paying $50,000 a month for a small beach house that is not even on the beach? How could they pretend to care about excluding the poor when they are headed for towns zoned to keep out the middle class?
The logical place for a toll is at the entrance to the Hamptons, where Route 27 crosses the Shinnecock Canal and narrows from four lanes to two. You could start with a toll just at peak hours on weekends. Although some Hamptonites doubt that any toll would make a difference -- one investment banker told me he would not be deterred by anything less than $1,000 -- road experts are confident it would not take much.
"Even in a wealthy area like the Hamptons," said Peter Samuel, the editor of Toll Roads Newsletter, "I suspect that a couple of bucks would be enough to make a difference. After all, you don't need to deter many people. Just getting 20 percent of the drivers to avoid Route 27 at peak times could get traffic flowing much more smoothly."

 HOWEVER much of a toll it takes -- $2, $5, $25 -- there could be protections for the non-rich local residents and workers. There might be no toll on the alternative route across the Shinnecock Canal, the Montauk Highway. Or perhaps both routes would be tolled, but the locals would be exempted, just as they're now exempted from the fees summer renters pay for parking permits at the beaches.
Daniel B. Klein, an economist at Santa Clara University, points to a precedent in New York State last century, when private turnpikes allowed free passage to people living within a mile of a toll gate. But it would make more sense, he said, to give the locals some incentive to stay off the road during peak hours.
"You might charge locals at a discount rate -- say, 50 percent of the toll, or maybe just 10 percent," Dr. Klein said. "There still might be complaints from locals who have to cross the canal frequently. But if they're using the road a lot, they'll appreciate how much time they've saving. They might be paying only 10 percent of the toll each trip, but they'll be reaping 100 percent of the benefits of improved road conditions."
As a further enticement, the locals could be allowed to pocket the toll revenues. The money could be divided up equally among all local drivers, so that EZ Pass (or whoever operated the system) would mail out an annual rebate check to drivers living east of the canal.
Some of the money might also be earmarked for a popular local cause, like buying up farmland so that it is protected from developers. That way the locals could enjoy more open space in their towns without having to pay for it. And the visiting drivers could finally enjoy some open space in front of their windshields.

HEADLINE: Study Calls for Limits on Hearing Tests at Birth

BYLINE: By ERIC NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
A new study, running counter to the nationwide move toward routinely testing all newborns for hearing problems, argues for testing only those infants known to be at risk.
Prompted in part by advocates for the disabled, who point to the longstanding failure of doctors and parents to detect many cases of hearing loss until a child is 2 or older, hospitals across the country have begun routinely screening children shortly after birth. Some 20 states have passed laws requiring the screening, and Congress is considering taking action. 
 The new study, in the current issue of The American Journal of Otology, suggests, however, that the effort is neither economical nor the best method to insure that infants with hearing problems receive the appropriate care.
Instead, the authors said, hospitals should focus their resources on newborns known to be at higher risk because of factors like family history, low birth weight and herpes infection. They also urged that primary care physicians and other people in contact with children be better trained to detect the signs of deafness in those not considered at risk.
"I really believe that the primary care physician has the key to this problem," said Dr. Paul R. Kileny, a co-author of the report, who is director of audiology for the University of Michigan Health System.
About 1 in 1,000 babies born in the United States each year is deaf or has a serious hearing disorder, while perhaps 4 or 5 others have a less serious condition.
Left undiagnosed for too long, the disorder can cause problems with language development, education and even social skills. But with early detection, doctors can provide hearing aids for infants just weeks old, and cochlear implants for children over 18 months.
After studying more than 2,100 high-risk babies born at the University of Michigan hospital in a 10-year period, researchers found that 6.4 percent were suffering from at least some hearing loss.
The doctors used an auditory brain stem response test, which measures brain activity in infants exposed to sounds. When they calculated the cost of testing all of the high-risk infants, they found that each diagnosis cost about $3,000 -- far less than if every newborn had been tested.
Saving money, however, is not the only issue, said Dr. Kileny. Because many cases of deafness have a delayed onset, he said, routine screening of all newborns could give a false sense of security for infants who pass the test but then develop problems later.
Dr. Kileny said he believed universal screening was a fine ideal, but an impractical one. He and other experts said this was nevertheless the trend in American medicine.
In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki is reviewing a bill, approved by the Legislature, that would require hospitals to screen all infants for hearing problems or give them a referral.
"I think the train is down the track for very good reasons," said Evelyn Cherow, director of audiology services for the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Ms. Cherow's group has long advocated universal screening.

HEADLINE: When Ironman Race Is Just a Warm-Up

BYLINE: By LIZ NEPORENT 

 BODY:
The Ironman triathlon consists of 2.4 miles of swimming, 112 miles of cycling and 26.2 miles of running. That might seem to be about the upper limit of human endurance, but not for Patricia Buttenheim and Ann Snoeyenbos.
Ms. Buttenheim, a 38-year-old registered nurse from Brooklyn, and Ms. Snoeyenbos (pronounced snow-yen-BOSS), a 35-year-old reference librarian from Manhattan, are training to become the first American women in five years to complete a Double Ironman. 
 Yes, Double Ironman. That's 4.8 miles of swimming, 224 miles of biking and 52.4 miles of running. And as Ms. Buttenheim is quick to point out, those events are consecutive. (The women's record, set by Tina Bishoff in 1994, is 22 hours, 7 minutes.)
On Saturday, the two women, who are friends, will be among the two dozen or so entrants in the 12th annual Odyssey Double-Iron Triathlon in Colonial Beach, Va., organized by Odyssey Adventure Racing of Virginia Beach.
Ms. Buttenheim and Ms. Snoeyenbos are members of the New York University Triathlon Club in Manhattan. They began training for the competition about six months ago.
Each weekday they awaken at 4 A.M. to cycle 40-plus miles around Central Park, then do an hour and a half of yoga and strength training before heading off to work; in the evenings, they run or swim for one to two hours.
On the weekends they travel all over the country to participate in a 50-mile races, 100-mile bike rides, or four-mile swim contests. Ms. Buttenheim said, "We just completed a single Ironman as our last long training day before the big race."
While it might seem a foregone conclusion that the women are pounding their bodies to a pulp with this grueling training schedule, neither has had any serious physical setbacks.
To Benjamin Gelfand, a physical therapist, who is the author of "A Return to Glory Days" (Simon & Schuster, 1997), a primer on prevention of athletic injuries, this is not surprising.
"Ultra athletes learn to adapt their form and body mechanics so that they become very efficient," he said. "This economy of movement probably protects their joints and muscles from excessive overuse."
Because long-distance athletes move at relatively low speeds and intensities, he added, their injuries may be slower to develop and thus easier to head off.
Still, Ms. Buttenheim acknowledges that with all the running, it is hard to keep her feet from turning to hamburger.
She spends about $11 a day on foot-care products like moleskin, blister pads and Epsom salts. Chafing and chapping around the thighs and along the bra line are sometimes a problem as well, Ms. Snoeyenbos says.
Both women say that a big reason for undertaking this endeavor is to prove that ordinary people are capable of performing extraordinary feats.
Indeed, both are average athletes with the statistics to prove it. Last year they underwent extensive physiological testing as part of a study at Teachers College, Columbia University, on the nutritional needs of female endurance athletes. Their scores for parameters like body fat percentage, lung power and cardiovascular capacity were unremarkable.
Even so, and even though only 33 percent of double Ironman competitors make it across the finish line, both Ms. Buttenheim and Ms. Snoeyenbos say they are confident they can go the distance.
"It helps that we've trained safely and sanely and that we have total support from friends and family," says Ms. Snoeyenbos. Still, neither expects to finish in less than 30 hours.
The goal in the Double Ironman is to keep moving for the entire 30-plus hours, if at all possible. And some people do stop to sleep. But for those who are serious competitors, stopping is not an option.
Last year, Ms. Buttenheim and Ms. Snoeyenbos were "handlers" for a participant in the race. All participants have a handler or team of handlers to supply water and food and to keep them from wandering off the course should they become disoriented.
Ms. Buttenheim and Ms. Snoeyenbos say this race is just the beginning of their ultradistance careers. They have their eyes on the Eco Challenge, a multiday "adventure" race held in a different place each year.
There's also the Fifteenfold Triathlon, a race 15 times the distance of a single Ironman. The women's record, which stands at 403:01:54, has gone unchallenged since 1992.

From Homeless to House-Proud: Brazil's 'Other' Music

BYLINE: By Larry Rohter 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil

 BODY:
It was logical and fitting that when the Sao Paulo State Symphony Orchestra inaugurated its striking new concert hall here in July, the centerpiece of the debut program was Mahler's Second Symphony. That work, after all, is known as the "Resurrection," and both the Sala Sao Paulo and the orchestra that now resides there were celebrating a rise from the ashes.
Just a few years ago the orchestra, founded in 1953, was practically homeless. At one point its 97 members were reduced to rehearsing in a school auditorium, their schedule dependent on the willingness of the school's principal and parent-teacher association to make space available. 
 But that was before the government of Brazil's most important state began an effort to persuade John Neschling, a Brazilian conductor living in Switzerland, to lead the orchestra. Initially reluctant, he acquiesced in 1997 only after the authorities agreed to a series of basic conditions, one of which was a permanent home for the orchestra.
Anticipating doubts about selling such a project, Mr. Neschling, 52, took an approach calculated to appeal to Brazilian sensibilities, urging officials to consider "what happens to a good soccer team if it doesn't have a stadium," as the maestro recalled in an interview here early this month. "It made them understand we needed a place to work."
That place turned out to be a cavernous abandoned train station on the faded outskirts of downtown that was designed in Louis XVI style in the 1920's. The choice may have seemed odd, but when the American acoustic consultant Russell Johnson arrived to supervise the project, he quickly discovered that the dimensions and characteristics of the station lent themselves to the ambitious vision.
"More or less by accident, the original architect made this mammoth waiting room almost the same length and width as a handful of the great old concert halls in Europe," Mr. Johnson said in a telephone interview from New York City, where his company, Artec Consultants, is based. "And of course it has plenty of height, which enabled us to put in a ceiling that goes up and down, so we can adjust the acoustics of the room to the events going on onstage."
This all resulted in a 1,509-seat hall whose most innovative feature is its flexible ceiling, composed of 15 motorized and individually controlled panels whose position can be changed in minutes. A new rear balcony and boxes seating spectators except when a choir is required were installed around and behind the main stage without disturbing the 32 imposing Greek columns that remain the hall's most distinctive visual attraction.
The revamped building also has ample rehearsal rooms and a recording studio. Work has begun on a documentation center and archives devoted to Brazilian composers of the 19th century and earlier, including Carlos Gomes and a group of largely forgotten mulatto musicians of the 18th century described by Mr. Neschling as "liberated slaves who wrote first-class music, church choirs and Te Deums."
Although Brazil has always been a very musical nation, building a top-flight orchestra was a huge challenge: even though it seems as if every one of the country's 165 million people plays an instrument or sings, the musical energies are directed almost exclusively at popular music, not the classics.
"I had to convince people that classical music is part of the musical expression of a country anywhere in the world," Mr. Neschling said. "I had to remind people that the language of the classics is as important as the language of pop and that Brazil had this language for three centuries but forgot it." As a composer he wrote the scores for such films as "Kiss of the Spider Woman" and "Pixote."
For state officials who provided $35 million for the renovation, the hall is a symbol of even grander aspirations. Sao Paulo is Brazil's richest and largest city and state, with 18 million people in the metropolitan area and 16 million in the interior. It is an industrial, financial and agricultural powerhouse that in the words of Rodolfo Konder, the municipal secretary of culture, yearns to be recognized as "a world-class city."
The city has been regarded as the country's foremost cultural center since at least 1922, when the series of exhibitions and seminars known as Modern Art Week established a national agenda for literature, art and music for decades to come. Abroad, however, Sao Paulo has always been overshadowed by its flashier, more exotic and better-known rival 200 miles to the east, Rio de Janeiro.
Marcos Mendonca, secretary of culture for Sao Paulo state, said: "We want to transform the city's image so that it is not only a great economic center but has an intense cultural life. We want people to come not just to do business."
To attract local audiences that do not normally attend symphony concerts, ticket prices have been kept low, with the best seats selling for just over $10. The city and state have also sought to encourage private sector support for their plans with tax laws that offer rebates to companies contributing to the arts.
Indeed, the state and city authorities envision the project here as the anchor of a much larger complex of museums and galleries. Next door, for instance, the headquarters of the political police during military rule from 1964 to 1985 are being converted into a conservatory and theater, though Mr. Mendonca promised that "a few of the cells where prisoners were held will be preserved for historical reasons."
Mr. Neschling and state officials are clearly looking forward to presenting his orchestra to audiences abroad and showing off the hall's acoustics to visiting foreign orchestras. "There is a circuit, and I want us to be on it," said Mr. Neschling, a Brazilian who was born and reared in Rio de Janeiro.
The Sao Paulo State Orchestra plans to tour Latin America in 2001 and Europe in 2002. Performances at the Sala Sao Paulo by the Vienna and Royal Philharmonic Orchestras are scheduled this year, and the Berlin and Chicago orchestras are due here in 2000.
Mr. Johnson said the auditorium "may turn out to be one of the really top-flight concert halls anywhere in the world acoustically, including in Europe."
Musicians who play here regularly seem to agree. Darrin Milling, a bass trombonist who is one of several Americans and Russians Mr. Neschling has recruited for the orchestra, said, "What is truly unique and a great advantage with this hall is the ability you have to tailor the acoustics to the audience and the piece."
"I sit there in amazement that I am playing in one of the best concert halls in the world," added Mr. Milling, 31, who has performed with the Philadelphia and New World Symphonies. "I've played in places like Cologne and at the Kennedy Center, and for me, this is the dream gig."
In addition to the infusion of foreigners, the reshaped orchestra includes 16 Brazilians who had been playing in orchestras in Europe or the United States but who welcomed an opportunity to come home. Mr. Neschling maintains that his ensemble is already "one of the 50 best in the world" and, aiming high, cites the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Fritz Reiner as its model.
"Sao Paulo is not less important than Chicago," he said. "So why not have an orchestra like Chicago?"

HEADLINE: High Clouds, No Storm In Sight

BYLINE: By Alan S. Blinder; Alan S. Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton University, was vice chairman of the Federal Reserve in the mid-1990's.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
One thing an economist should never predict is the future. Ignoring that wisdom, I'll boldly do just that: in February of next year, the current economic expansion will, at 107 months, become the longest in United States history.
How much beyond that can the good times roll? No one knows, of course, but we can venture some educated guesses about what could end the party. 
 Macroeconomic folklore holds that expansions don't die of old age; they die because the Federal Reserve kills them. This aphorism summarizes two statistical regularities. First, the mortality table of economic expansions is unlike that of humans: the odds that an expansion will end do not increase significantly as it ages. Second, almost every American recession since World War II has been preceded by tighter monetary policy -- that is, higher interest rates.
The current expansion may also end that way, but so far the nation has been blessed by a nonhomicidal Federal Reserve.
True, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has repeatedly emphasized his concern that extremely tight labor markets may trigger a surge in inflation. But that hasn't happened yet. As the mild-mannered report on the Consumer Price Index released last Tuesday reminds us, this expansion has been different. We are now midway through the ninth year of unbroken growth, yet inflation is lower than when the boom began. There is no convincing evidence that pay is rising faster than is consistent with inflation in the 2 to 2 1/2 percent range.
I wish I could tell you why inflation has been so tame, but no one has a full explanation. Part of the answer, however, surely is a fortuitous series of what economists call favorable supply shocks, that is, special factors that push inflation down. The usual list includes cheaper imports, a product of the rising dollar from spring 1995 until summer 1998; falling energy prices in 1997 and 1998; declining inflation in the health care industry (until last year), and extraordinarily rapid drops in computer prices. To this, add a much-ignored fact: the Bureau of Labor Statistics responded to criticism that the C.P.I. overstates inflation by introducing a series of modifications that reduce measured inflation.
Today there is worry that the marvelous era of favorable supply shocks may have run its course. With the dollar down slightly over the past year, import prices are creeping up. Oil prices are rising (though only modestly), not falling, and health care inflation appears to be back. The Government has completed its changes in the C.P.I., so there will be no more help from that quarter. Only one item on the list of anti-inflationary supply shocks remains: plummeting computer prices.
So it is hardly surprising that the inflation rate has crept up a bit since last winter. But the Fed understands that these benign influences on inflation were transitory. It should not be panicked by the slightly higher inflation rate that logically follows as our fabulous string of good luck runs out. Despite a small quarter-point interest rate increase at the end of June, and another one widely expected today, there are no signs of murder in the Fed's eyes.
So if it's not the Fed, what other grim reapers might bring this aged but virile expansion to an end? Historically, the second most likely culprit is a big spike in oil prices -- as happened in 1973, 1979 and 1990. Far be it from me to predict the course of Middle East politics, but the oil-shock scenario does not look very likely.
Beyond that, history points to rare instances in which growth was halted by a sudden (often unexplained) drop in some component of spending. Inexplicable events are, by definition, unpredictable. But when I peer into my admittedly cloudy crystal ball, the most likely source of such a drop in spending is a stock market crash. Yet I'm not convinced that even a sharp correction would be enough to stop this juggernaut economy in its tracks.
No, this doesn't mean the business cycle has been repealed; this remarkable expansion will not last forever. But there is nothing on the horizon proclaiming that the end is nigh.

HEADLINE: A Flight of Money

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Aug. 22 Week in Review article "Who You Gonna Call After the Next Bust?" discusses the next recession with clarity.
However, it is not, as you suggest, a foregone conclusion that foreign investors will flee the United States if and when the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates to revive demand after a stock market collapse. Those investors will likely stay the course for reasons beyond the purely economic. 
 A significant part of our attraction for foreign investors stems from our stable political system and our resilient marketplace. These attributes will, as they have in the recent past, soften the impact of any recession and shorten its life span. And they will serve us and foreign investors well when the next downturn arrives.

HEADLINE: Schroder Moves, and So Does Germany's Center of Gravity

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Aug 23

 BODY:
Almost a decade after the fall of the wall that divided Germany and Europe, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder took up residence here today, inaugurating the first Berlin-based Government to rule the country since Hitler's collapsed at the end of World War II.
Because the enormous new chancellery opposite the Reichstag is not yet ready, Mr. Schroder was obliged to move into the refurbished former office of Erich Honecker, the East German leader, a curious twist on which he chose not to dwell today. 
 The Chancellor's arrival was a low-key occasion. There was no ceremony at the Brandenburg Gate, no political rally, no pomp and circumstance -- as befits a shift of which most Germans are proud but whose historical symbolism remains too charged for broad public celebration.
As Mr. Schroder began governing from Mr. Honecker's former office, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer moved into a remodeled building next door that once housed Hitler's Reichsbank. After protracted discussions over the last decade, Germany has decided that some former Nazi buildings will be used as ministries.
"Democracy has won and therefore these memories are not threatening," said Franz Muntefering, the Transport Minister, who has organized much of the 375-mile move eastward from Bonn. "On the contrary, it is useful to be aware of them and not to try to run from history by destroying the buildings."
Eberhard Diepgen, the Christian Democratic Mayor of Berlin, welcomed the Social Democratic Chancellor in a small ceremony during which Mr. Schroder cut a cake decorated with bears -- the symbol of Berlin. He said the city would become "one of the great world metropolises -- if it is not one already."
The Chancellor appeared to be indulging in a little diplomatic hyperbole, for much of Berlin remains a building site, the hum of economic activity is not yet widely discernible, chic streets number one or two at most, and the city does not yet offer direct flights to the United States.
But Berlin has something else -- a sense of being wide open, of beginning life again -- that perhaps no other European city offers to the same degree. Few would argue with its potential.
Mr. Schroder added that the arrival of the Government was a "historic moment" -- the completion of a decade-long transition during which Germany had undergone "a peaceful and successful revolution."
Peace has indeed prevailed since the Berlin wall fell in November 1989, but the integration of east and west has not been as smooth or as successful as Helmut Kohl, the former Chancellor, predicted at the time.
Indeed, Mr. Schroder's failure since taking office last year to make any dent on high unemployment, particularly in the eastern part of the country, has been a major reason for a sharp plunge in his popularity. Recent opinion polls have shown that only 23 percent of the electorate approve of the way he has governed.
Certainly, he has had trouble stamping his authority on Germany. One television station, RTL, is now preparing a soap opera based on the Chancellor and his life called "Wie war ich, Doris?" or "How was I, Doris?" after the reported propensity of Mr. Schroder for asking his wife, a former journalist, how he has fared in public appearances.
The soap-opera plans have outraged Mr. Schroder, who canceled an interview with RTL this week, but it appeared to reflect some of his difficulties.
In the new capital, the Chancellor is clearly hoping to turn the corner. He has never concealed his mild contempt for Bonn and his strong desire to be in Berlin, and he has suggested repeatedly that the new "Berlin Republic" should provide a catalyst for reconciliation of east and west that has proved so elusive up to now.
But whatever the symbolism of Berlin, the economic and political reality facing Mr. Schroder is harsh. As five important state elections loom over the next two months, he is trying to move his Social Democratic Party sharply toward fiscal conservatism against resistance from many party members and from labor unions.
His Finance Minister, Hans Eichel, has proposed budget cuts of more than $15 billion, including a two-year freeze on pensions, and Mr. Schroder has resisted repeated calls for a tax on large fortunes that was promised during his election campaign. Those policies, welcomed by big business, have drawn fire from the Chancellor's party.
Today, during a quick visit to the western town of Saarbrucken, where political resistance to his ideas has been particularly intense, Mr. Schroder made it clear that he would not waver and said he planned to revise his party's 40-year-old manifesto before the end of the year.
"We want to look afresh at how the basic values of this party -- which in themselves are not in doubt -- can be achieved," Mr. Schroder said.
Mr. Schroder is expected to govern from his temporary offices for at least a year. The new chancellery was enlarged after Mr. Kohl insisted that it should be as tall as the Reichstag to symbolize a balance between the executive and Parliament. As a result, the project was delayed and the cost has increased by 15 percent, to about $250 million.
The Chancellor has recently expressed a personal view that the building is rather large. It is in fact about three times the size of the former chancellery in Bonn.

HEADLINE: New Take on Perpetual Calendar;
If This Is Taipei in 2002, Are Businesses Open on Friday?

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
For the financial services industry, the emergence of global capitalism has unleashed a new horror: global holiday schedules.
Say you are in Warsaw on a particular Wednesday, trolling for business opportunities. It is a short hop to Lithuania, so why not call on a few bankers in Vilnius? 
 Here's why not: that Thursday is a holiday in Lithuania, and when Lithuanian holidays fall on a Thursday, the Friday after is also declared a holiday. Yet if you were going there on the previous Saturday, you would need to know that it became a normal working day. Got that?
And though inadvertently landing in Vilnius on a four-day weekend is a mere waste of time, consider the coming millennium celebrations. Financial caretakers are trying to close out important transactions before the end of the last business day of 1999. But just when will that be? New Year's Day falls on a Saturday, and some countries do not provide a weekday off when holidays fall on a Saturday. Except lately, several of those countries have decided to make Friday, Dec. 31, an ad hoc holiday.
Fortunately for the tacticians and quartermasters of international finance, there is Paul Spraos.
Mr. Spraos, 40, is the London-born founder of Swaps Monitor Publications Inc. in New York, which publishes a newsletter covering the exotic world of interest-rate swaps and other financial derivatives. Since 1992, Mr. Spraos has also produced an international holiday calendar, which heroically tries to identify all the holidays -- "bad business days," he calls them -- that will occur in more than 100 countries over the next 100 years.
On Sept. 8, Mr. Spraos (rhymes with "house") will begin offering his calendar over the Internet -- at the site financialcalendar.com -- a step he says will make it far easier for him to deal with the growing tendency of local governments to tinker with their holiday schedules.
"Holidays are changing more and more frequently, at a rate that would amaze people who don't follow this," Mr. Spraos said.
Various financial centers, he said, "are changing their weekends, introducing or deleting a holiday or adding the millennium holiday."
"Or maybe their soccer team just qualified for the World Cup," he added, "and they've declared a spontaneous holiday."
Why do such far-distant holidays matter so much?
Swaps and other financial derivatives can span many decades and typically involve large sums -- $100 million is routine. The price of a swap is determined by calculating the current value of all the payments to be made over the life of the deal. If some future payment dates fall on local holidays, the cash will not start earning interest as promptly as anticipated, throwing the price calculations out of whack.
"We need to know holidays approximately 30 years out," explained Larry Weissblum, a vice president at the capital markets unit of Sumitomo Bank and a subscriber to Mr. Spraos's calendar.
The millennium countdown would have been even more worrisome without Mr. Spraos's service, added Adrienne Mageras, the operations support director for General Re Financial Products, a global derivatives dealer. "You need to know that you can't make payments on that day in that particular country -- and we've had six or seven centers declare millennium holidays in just the past two months," she said.
Beyond the derivatives markets, banks and other financial institutions try to estimate their cash needs and anticipate their cash receipts -- and both will be affected by future bank closings in the various countries where those institutions do business.
"You may be expecting a payment on a particular day, but if it's a holiday you won't get the money," Mr. Spraos explained. "At best, it's an inconvenience. At worst, it costs you real money. And the reverse is equally true: if you are the one obligated to make a payment on a particular day and it's a holiday, you may not realize that the payment was actually due the previous day."
As curious as it seems, creating a list of future holidays in individual countries around the world is anything but straightforward, as Mr. Spraos discovered in October 1991 when he accepted a friend's challenge to develop a global calendar. "We thought we would turn the calendars out and have them laminated to send around to our subscribers as 'freebies' for Christmas that year," he recalled.
That was when he began to appreciate that "holidays are not unambiguous creatures."
Indeed.
Muslim and some Asian holidays are determined by the lunar calendar but may vary from country to country based on local lunar observation. Last spring, for example, the same Muslim two-day holiday varied by as much as five days among the 18 Muslim financial centers monitored by Mr. Spraos.
Moreover, each country has its own quirky way of determining when holidays will be observed. In France, for example, banks and the union representing their employees negotiate the bank holiday schedule each year. Sometimes different financial institutions within the same country even observe different holidays. And roughly 20 percent of the official announcements of future holidays turn out to contain errors, Mr. Spraos discovered.
Even weekends are defined differently from country to country. In Taiwan, the weekend consists of every Sunday and the second and fourth Saturday of each month; in Malaysia, the formula is every Sunday and the first Saturday. And then there is Lithuania, with its occasional one-day weekend followed by a four-day weekend.
Mr. Spraos said he soon realized that assembling a reliable financial calendar was going to involve so much research and labor "that it would be foolish to give it away."
Instead, in 1992, when he published the first edition of his financial calendar, in book form and on CD-ROM, he offered it for sale. It sold well at $50 a copy, and the price was soon raised to $200. Eventually, he began to feed the data to his corporate subscribers electronically, so they could incorporate it into their own computer systems.
The Internet was a logical next step, he said. It will allow customers to choose whether to pay a flat monthly fee or pay each time they seek specific data, and it will offer subscribers enhanced software that will allow them to pose their own questions to the holiday data base.
Already, more than 100 large financial institutions around the world, including most of the largest derivatives dealers, rely on the calendar to help them avoid running afoul of the countless holidays that will occur over the next century.
Well, actually, only one of Mr. Spraos's customers -- he will not say who -- subscribes for the full century's worth of data. Most are content with the next two or three decades -- a blessing for Mr. Spraos, since computer limitations restrict his Internet service to 30 years of holidays.
Over the years, Mr. Spraos has gradually expanded the scope of the calendar. The original version listed 18 financial centers, with a "center" defined as a category of financial institution in a particular place. (Banks in New York would be one center, for example, and the New York Stock Exchange would be another.) The current calendar encompasses 251 financial centers in 103 countries.
Countrywide holidays are simply impossible to provide, Mr. Spraos explained. Just in New York, the New York Stock Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the major New York banks all differ slightly in the holidays they observe. Many countries have regional holidays that affect banks in one city but not in another.
According to Mr. Spraos, Nepal has the highest average number of "bad business days" each year, with 26.5 weekdays off, although it observes only a one-day weekend. Romania has the fewest, on average, with 5.2 weekdays off.
Some future holidays -- like those negotiated bank holidays in France -- defy accurate calculations. Mr. Spraos deals with them by declaring them "asterisk holidays," those for which he estimates a multiday range during which the holiday is most likely to fall based on historical data.
Of course, there are always the unexpected holidays: a sovereign dies, and the next day becomes an unscheduled holiday. But Mr. Spraos termed his calendar "as accurate as you can reasonably get for any prediction of future events." It will be more accurate still, he said, once the Internet version is up and running.
That debut is going to have to wait until after Labor Day, however. Mr. Spraos, an avid bicyclist, is taking a holiday.

To avoid miscues amid the growth of the global marketplace, financial institutions need to keep close track of holidays around the world. Paul Spraos has produced an international calendar looking forward as much as 100 years. Calendar fo May 2014 lists countries that 15 years from now will celebrate a multitude of holidays during the month. (Source: Swaps Monitor Publications)

Shares Surge With Dow Climbing 199.15 to a Record Finish

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The stock rally yesterday lifted most sectors, with fledgling Internet companies, battered drug stocks and multinational consumer companies all rising.
The Dow Jones industrial average soared to a record as investors banished fears that the Federal Reserve would repeatedly raise interest rates in an effort to quell inflation. The Dow rose 199.15 points, to 11,299.76, easily surpassing its record close on July 16 of 11,209.84. With yesterday's gains, the Dow is up 23 percent this year. 
 Broader stock indicators also jumped sharply, though they remained below their record highs, set in mid-July. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.61, to 1,360.22, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 71.24, to 2,719.57. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained 2.87, to 437.25.
The rally yesterday occurred on extremely light volume, as many traders were on vacation and many investors stayed on the sidelines, awaiting the Fed's announcement on interest rates this afternoon.
Most economists expect the central bank to raise rates a quarter of a percentage point, matching the increase imposed on June 30, but there is a growing belief that the Fed may hold rates steady after today.
Financial and technology companies benefited most from yesterday's rally.
J. P. Morgan soared 6 13/16, to 139 3/4, and American Express gained 3 1/2, to 146 3/8, pacing the Dow to its new heights.
Internet stocks buoyed the Nasdaq. Amazon.com rose 4 15/16, to 118 3/8, and Yahoo shot up 7 1/8, to 152 1/8.
Merger activity helped enliven trading. Shares of United Water Resources jumped 2 7/16, to 33 1/2, after the French utility Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux began a $35-a-share bid to acquire the 67 percent of the company that it does not already own.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 682.7 million shares.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Ecuador Seeks To Ease Fears It May Default

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Hobbled by a failing economy, Ecuador said today that it planned to renegotiate its foreign debt when a payment falls due next week but did not intend to default.
In a brief press statement issued in Quito, the Ecuadorean capital, Finance Minister Ana Lucia Armijos said the Government of President Jamil Mahuad "will propose a coordinated restructuring, using market mechanisms" in repaying $6 billion worth of so-called Brady bonds for which the country has contracted. But she added that the Government "will not in any way declare a unilateral moratorium regarding the payment of external debt." 
 The amount due at the end of this month is $94 million, but fears of an Ecuadorean default have contributed to market instability throughout Latin America in the last week, affecting much larger and more diversified economies like those of Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.
No country has ever defaulted on Brady bonds, which are financial instruments devised by the United States with the specific purpose of preventing default. There is fear that a suspension of payments by Ecuador would deeply hurt the psychology of the market and lead to a withdrawal of foreign investment from Latin American countries. Such a withdrawal could create a new round of market instability and raise the cost of borrowing for all emerging-market countries, damaging them further.
Brady bonds, named for Nicholas F. Brady, who was Secretary of the Treasury in the Bush Administration, were created in response to the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980's. They allowed 18 developing countries to package defaulted loans into new bonds that are backed by United States Treasury securities.
The fears about Ecuador's ability to pay its debts have been building for weeks but grew acute last Thursday, when Ecuadorean officials suggested that they might be forced to seek a "deferral" of the payment due on Aug. 31.
Under the terms of a Brady bond deal negotiated in 1994, Ecuador has a 30-day grace period before it would be declared in default. Indeed, there was speculation in international credit markets today that the Ecuadoreans would invoke that 30-day period.
"We all know that under current circumstances it is not easy to pay our external debt, as we also have an internal debt," Modesto Correa, the acting president of Ecuador's central bank, said on Friday. "It's up to the Finance Minister to see whether we pay, not pay or defer our debt."
Ecuador's total public debt is about $13 billion -- more than 100 percent of the gross domestic product of the Andean nation of around 12 million people. Interest payments due in 1999 are estimated at $280 million, or 42 percent of the budget. Foreign-currency reserves were just under $1.3 billion as of Friday, down 30 percent from a year ago, but cannot be used to pay foreign debts because of a provision in the nation's Constitution.
Ecuador's economic crisis is partly rooted in longstanding problems beyond its control, notably low prices in recent times for its oil and agricultural exports. The economy is forecast to contract 7 percent this year, and inflation is expected to reach 55 percent or more, the highest in Latin America. Some have even noted the damaging effects of El Nino, the climate system that has altered temperatures and rainfall patterns.
President Mahuad, in his weekly radio address and in other statements over the weekend, sent mixed signals on how officials might proceed. While he emphasized that "Ecuador is not considering avoiding its commitments," he said he was "working so that Ecuador can pay what debt it can, as much as its economy can permit," through "market mechanisms that permit paying less for the debt."
A delegation from the International Monetary Fund flew to Quito over the weekend to meet with Mr. Mahuad and other officials. Negotiations have been under way for a $400 million loan to help cover the country's credit needs for the next 18 months, but have been slowed by the unwillingness of the Ecuadorean Congress, which is dominated by the opposition, to take action on such matters as tax changes, banking legislation and Government subsidies.
Today, however, stock, bond and currency markets in Latin America rose after Ms. Armijos's statement. Ecuador's currency, the sucre, improved in New York trading to a rate of 10,700 to the dollar from 11,455 on Friday. The Brazilian real also recovered somewhat, settling at 1.8710 to the dollar, compared with a low of 1.99 on Friday. The Mexican and Argentine stock markets each rose more than 2 percent.
"Investors can see there are clear and distinct differences between countries," Deputy Finance Minister Miguel Kiguel of Argentina said in Buenos Aires. He acknowledged that the Ecuadorean crisis "will have a short-term effect" on other countries, but argued that Ecuador's relatively small size and unusual circumstances should prevent the kind of panicky market selloff that might come if a larger country were at risk of defaulting.

HEADLINE: Congressional Myopia on Foreign Aid

 BODY:
Foreign aid is not among Washington's most popular causes. But it happens to be one of the more effective investments in long-term global security that America can make. Yet Congress now proposes to cut some $2 billion from President Clinton's already modest $14.6 billion foreign aid request for next year, much of it from crucial crisis prevention programs. When the foreign aid bill goes to a House-Senate conference committee next month, the Republican Congressional leadership should work to reverse these shortsighted cuts. What cannot be restored then should be included in a supplemental foreign aid bill later this fall.
Today's foreign aid dollars can help prevent tomorrow's wars, as President Clinton noted in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars earlier this month. That surely applies to $1.3 billion promised to Israel and the Palestinian Authority for meeting the security costs of the Wye peace agreement and improving the living standards of the Palestinian people. Yet for the second budget year, Congress has withheld financing for this program. 
 There are also obvious dividends for American security in programs designed to help Russia dismantle its cold war nuclear arsenal, safeguard bomb plutonium and employ former weapons scientists in new fields. Yet both the House and Senate want to impose steep cuts in these areas and would also trim money for supporting reform in other former Soviet states. The House would also cut appropriations for World Bank aid to the very poorest countries and continues to hold up paying America's back dues to the United Nations.
Some American foreign aid money has been wasted in the past. But that is no reason to starve the entire program. Congressional opponents argue that approving Mr. Clinton's full request for foreign aid would violate current budget caps. But such arguments never stop legislators eager to add defense funding or vote unwise tax cuts.
Reducing nuclear dangers in Russia, supporting peace agreements in the Middle East and Africa and helping the poor emerge from poverty are sound investments. Congress should heed Mr. Clinton's appeal and providing adequate money for these programs this fall.

China has said that the 29-year-old American, Daja Mizu Meston, a Tibetan linguist from Newton, Mass., was injured while trying to escape police officers in a region of western China where the Government is carrying out a population resettlement project opposed by human rights groups and environmentalists. 
 The State Department said today that it had no evidence to contradict the Chinese account that Mr. Meston, who is now hospitalized and under police guard, jumped or fell in his escape attempt on Aug. 15.
But a department spokesman, James Foley, said that "we're not drawing any definitive conclusions about the circumstances of his injury until we've had an opportunity really to explore the matter with him."
"Our view is that, as soon as his medical condition permits, the Chinese authorities conclude their actions against him and indeed release him and allow him to leave the country," he said. Mr. Foley said that although Mr. Meston was apparently not paralyzed, he had suffered "serious back injuries" and was in urgent need of specialized spinal treatment outside of China.
China has said that the police were seeking to question Mr. Meston and an Australian colleague about their activities in a remote area of Qinghai province, which is geographically part of the Tibetan Plateau.
The World Bank is considering a proposal to offer $40 million in loans to what the Chinese Government describes as an anti-poverty project in the province. The project involves the construction of a dam and irrigation works, and calls for the relocation of 58,000 impoverished farmers from eastern Qinghai, mostly Han Chinese and Hui Muslims, to an area farther west in the province populated largely by ethnic Tibetans.
Human rights activists and environmental groups have charged that the project is an effort by Beijing to dilute the Tibetan population in the region and undermine Tibetan culture, and the World Bank has held off on final approval of the loans.
The Australian, Gabrielle Lafitte, was allowed to leave China last weekend after the intervention of the Australian Government.

HEADLINE: Turk Minister Criticizes Government's Response to Quake

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, Aug. 23

 BODY:
A Cabinet minister asserted today that the Government's response to last week's earthquake was "a declaration of bankruptcy for the Turkish political and economic system."
The statement by Tourism Minister Erkan Mumcu was a sharp departure from the defensive tone that officials had been using. His comments, and others today, suggested that at least some senior political leaders shared the bitterness and anger felt by many of the victims. 
 "All ideological arguments were flattened by the earthquake," Mr. Mumcu said in a speech in Ankara. "Lying under the ruins is the Turkish political and administrative system."
A member of Parliament from a district near the earthquake zone, Ibrahim Yasar, was equally forceful in expressing frustration with the Government's response to the quake, which has been widely criticized as slow and disorganized.
"I am not saying that the civil defense organization collapsed," Mr. Yasar said. "It did not exist. I saw that there was not the slightest bit of preparation."
Even President Suleyman Demirel, who telephoned a newspaper editor during the weekend to complain about what he said was negative coverage of the Government's relief effort, seemed chastened today.
"I want to tell my people that there will be better coordination among state institutions," a grim-looking Mr. Demirel said after emerging from a meeting with seismologists in Istanbul. "Foundations of buildings will be reviewed. We will follow movements under the earth more carefully. We will build structures that can resist earthquakes."
Mr. Demirel rarely apologizes for anything and usually portrays the Turkish state as sacred and all but infallible. His customary attitude reflects a widespread sense among Turks that attacking Government institutions is dangerous and unwise. Among political and military leaders in general, self-criticism is an exceedingly rare quality.
The Government's faltering response to the quake has infuriated many Turks. More than a few victims seem to have lost much of their respect for the ruling elite.
"This is the first time I have seen such rage against the state and politicians," one news commentator wrote in a column published today. Another wrote: "It is very clear that after this earthquake, Turkey will never again be the same. The millennium came to Turkey a year before other countries."
But not all Government officials have softened their views. Health Minister Osman Durmus has ridiculed those who have called for his resignation because of positions he has taken in the days since the earthquake last Tuesday.
Mr. Durmus, a member of the rightist Nationalist Action Party, has asserted that Turkey does not need medical aid from the United States, that Turks should not accept blood donated by Greeks, that sending portable toilets to the earthquake zone was unnecessary because there were sanitary facilities in many mosques and that foreigners should not be allowed to deliver relief aid because they "do not suit our culture."
He also scorned Turkish volunteer groups that appeared in devastated towns long before Government workers, saying they were "putting on a show."
Faced with growing calls for his resignation, including one in a newspaper editorial headlined "Shut Up and Go," Mr. Durmus replied at a news conference today, "I take being called ignorant and racist as a compliment, and thank them."
The latest death toll from the quake, reported today by the official crisis center, was 12,148. A United Nations official in Geneva said he had received a message from the Turkish Government on Sunday night asking for help in obtaining 45,000 body bags, suggesting that officials fear that the toll may rise much higher.
In what some relief workers described as a near-miracle, Turkish and Israeli teams found a small boy today beneath the wreckage of his home in the hard-hit town of Cinarcik. He was rescued at midmorning after surviving for six days.
"A Turkish team discovered him, and they screamed for us to come and help," one of the Israeli rescuers, Noam Amit, said in an interview with Israel Radio. "We heard the baby calling out, and then we called back through a hole in the rubble. The Turkish team called out to him in Turkish to come closer to us."
The child, identified by the Israeli Army as Ismail Cimen, 4, was taken to a hospital in Istanbul and was expected to survive. Rescue specialists said small children can sometimes survive under rubble longer than adults because they dehydrate less quickly and need less air and space to live.
The Turkish military, which has been criticized for reacting too slowly to the quake, continued to expand its role today.
Gen. Hayri Kivrikoglu, a senior commander assigned to help direct military operations in the disaster area, said troops would set up 500 tents a day in the area for the next 10 days. He said every site would be equipped with running water, toilets, electricity and medical supplies.
"To a large extent, the search and rescue operations have now ceased," General Kivrikoglu said. "There are cases of theft, but we have increased guard and patrol duties. We are not allowing people to wander the streets after midnight."
Heavy rain fell on parts of the earthquake zone today, creating new health problems in towns where sewer systems have been destroyed. Doctors and medical technicians were told to watch for signs of epidemic disease, but they have found none yet.
"The correct response is the provision of clean water," said Erik Noji, an official of the World Health Organization, "and there is plenty of clean water there."
Government officials said that Aug. 30, the national holiday that celebrates a key victory in Turkey's independence war, would be marked this year as a day of commemoration for earthquake victims.
The Interior Ministry ordered nightclubs to control the volume of their music for the next 45 days and to avoid creating "the image that there is a great deal of enjoyment or entertainment."

HEADLINE: Congress Seeks Wide Sanctions For Drug Trade

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Congress is close to forcing a major expansion of economic sanctions against international narcotics traffickers and the businesses that work with them.
Legislation to impose such sanctions on drug criminals throughout the world passed the Senate easily late last month. Administration officials said that, after initially opposing the measures on practical and foreign policy grounds, they have now begun to work with legislators to fashion a bill that both the House and the President could support. 
 The sanctions have won some support among businessmen and government officials in Colombia, where the United States has imposed them by executive order. But the legislation to extend them worldwide is being strongly opposed by the Government of Mexico and a few of that country's biggest companies.
"The Mexican Government has repeatedly expressed profound concern about the negative consequences that may arise from the implementation of such a proposal," Mexico's Ambassador to Washington, Jesus Reyes Heroles, wrote on July 27 in a confidential letter to the White House drug-policy director, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey.
The sanctions would bar drug traffickers and their associates from doing business in the United States, cut off their access to American banks and freeze any assets they may have deposited here. American firms that continue to work with companies linked to the traffickers would be subject to civil and criminal prosecution.
President Clinton first levied such penalties in 1995 against the four main leaders of Colombia's Cali drug cartel. In a subsequent letter to Congress, he promised, "I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to apply economic sanctions against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their violent and corrupting activities as long as these measures are appropriate."
Since then, the Treasury Department, which administers the sanctions, has built a list of almost 500 relatives, associates and mostly Colombian companies linked to the traffickers. More than two dozen of those companies have ended up liquidating their assets, officials said, while others have had to reorganize or change their names.
But Clinton Administration officials have hesitated almost from the start of the program to extend it to drug criminals in other countries, and particularly to those in Mexico.
In part, their concerns have been practical: Before acting against the Cali cartel, United States officials had been able to analyze reams of the group's secret business records that had been seized in raids by Colombian police teams backed by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the C.I.A.
By contrast, the most powerful Mexican drug gangs are believed to have hidden their wealth in mazes of front companies, aliases and associates that the American authorities have not yet been able to penetrate. One C.I.A. effort to dig into the possible drug connections of one of Mexico's most prominent business dynasties ended after an agent in Mexico was threatened while trying to search public records, officials said.
More importantly, perhaps, some senior Administration officials have also worried about the political and economic impact that the sanctions might have on a country that is the United States' second-most-important trading partner after Canada, officials said.
"There are parts of this Government that are very nervous about doing anything like this with Mexico," one senior State Department official said. "There is no question that it will raise the tension level some, and there are always some people who think it may undermine confidence in the economy."
If finally approved, the legislation that passed the Senate on July 21 and a similar bill pending in the House would essentially force the Administration to do what it has done with Colombia on a global scale.
By Jan. 1, 2000, and by every year thereafter, the legislation would require the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a list of major international drug traffickers after consulting with the C.I.A. and the Departments of Justice, Defense and State.
That list would then be vetted by the White House drug-policy director and sent to the President. By March 1, the President would have to produce a final list of traffickers to be sanctioned, as well as a report to Congress explaining his reasons if he has decided to leave off any of the accused traffickers suggested by his aides.
The legislation would freeze the assets of the traffickers and of any companies that they may partly own or control and prohibit American businesses from working with them. It would also cover the American assets of any person or company that aids a trafficker's illicit activities.
As a practical matter, the annual publication of such lists would probably only be the start of a process of investigation, congressional and Administration officials said.
The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control now has only about six or eight officials assigned full-time to implementing the sanctions. Even if new funds are appropriated to pay for the collection of intelligence on the traffickers' business assets and associates, it could take years to develop evidence strong enough to withstand a challenge in court.
So far, there have been very few such challenges from Colombia. Two of the teen-age daughters of the Cali cartel chiefs, both of them American citizens, fought successfully to be struck from the list of the traffickers' known associates. About 10 others have been removed from the list after severing their ties to the cartel or establishing their innocence, officials said.
A Colombian official who discussed the sanctions on the condition that he not be identified said that although the Government of President Andres Pastrana supported the American sanctions, it was eager to be more involved in drawing up lists of the traffickers' associates so as to insure that innocent businesses were not hurt by being linked to drug trafficking. Mexican officials and businessmen said they were fighting the legislation in part on similar grounds.
"If you're a legitimate company and you're targeted, you should have a way to defend yourself before you get on the list," said Luis Calvillo, a spokesman for one of Mexico's biggest international transportation companies, Transportacion Maritima Mexicana, or T.M.M..
Both T.M.M. and the Mexican Embassy in Washington have been campaigning strongly for detailed amendments to the legislation, with lobbyists for T.M.M. working to organize a coalition of like-minded American businesses. The Mexican firm, one of Latin America's largest shipping companies, has complained that it has been unfairly linked to drug trafficking by United States intelligence documents in the past.
In interviews, two Republican sponsors of the sanctions legislation, Senator Paul D. Coverdell of Georgia and Representative Porter J. Goss of Florida, said they would readily consider changes to strengthen the safeguards for law-abiding companies. They added that they were confident that the legislation now has enough bipartisan support to win approval.
"We have suggested for a long time that this be used," said Mr. Goss, who, like Mr. Coverdell, will likely be among the legislators who reconcile the Senate and House bills. "The Administration would go a little way but they didn't want to go too far. We got tired of waiting for them."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
It's the Dog Days for Treasuries as Yields Won't Budge

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Yields on Treasury securities hovered at their lowest levels in a month again yesterday, supported by investor optimism that the Federal Reserve, which was expected to raise interest rates today, would not do so again this year.
The price of the 30-year bond rose a scant 1/32, to 102 1/32, leaving the yield unchanged from Friday at 5.98 percent. 
 Buying yesterday was also briefly influenced by the dollar's early weakness against the yen, even though it later recovered. Foreign investors are always wary of Treasuries when the dollar is down against other currencies because that situation raises the possibility of a loss when investors convert dollar proceeds into their own currencies.
Many investors and economists expect the Fed to raise the Federal funds rate, the overnight lending rate among banks, by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 percent, when the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets today.
"However, there's more uncertainty about other related issues," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., "such as the nature of the operating policy directive adopted at the F.O.M.C., when the Fed might raise its current 4.5 percent discount rate and the Fed's future actions at the following F.O.M.C meeting on Oct. 5."
Mr. Harris said he did not expect the Fed to announce a tightening bias, even though such a directive initially sent a misleading signal to the markets after the previous committee session on June 29 and 30, when the Fed also tightened. At that time, the financial markets initially rallied on the hope the Fed was finished tightening.
Adam Blankman, a Treasury market analyst with Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said: "The focus will be on reading smoke signals from the wording of the announcement, the policy directive and the discount rate. We believe the Fed is apt to tread cautiously in order to leave all the options open."
Even so, Mr. Blankman predicted the increase expected today might be the lone policy move for the rest of 1999. "We doubt the F.O.M.C. will back itself into a corner by issuing an overtly friendly message about the future course of policy," he said.
"At most, the Fed could note that inflation is still tame and that G.D.P. growth was appreciably slower in the second quarter." Mr. Blankman added, referring to the gross domestic product. "The Fed may prefer the short and sweet approach in order to keep the market from making any unwarranted assumptions."
He said the international environment remained a wild card for Treasuries. "Weakness in the dollar is still a source of concern, and the market will continue to eye prospects for intervention by the Bank of Japan," he said.
The Treasury will auction two-year notes tomorrow. "The day after the presumed Fed rate hike," Mr. Blankman said, "so a dismal auction would not be a surprise."
Yesterday, the weekly bill auction was weak -- especially in the shorter bill, which was awarded at 4.85 percent, while the six-month bill came in at 4.95 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.761	97.498	High Rate	4.85%	4.95%	Coupon Yield	4.99%	5.16%	Low Rate	4.78%	4.87%	Median Rate	4.82%	4.94%	Total applied for	$22,509,424	$24,318,662	Accepted	$11,440,924	$11,372,412	Noncompetitive	$1,294,587	$1,169,752	

Both issues are dated Aug. 26, 1999. The three-month bills mature on Nov. 26, 1999, and the six-month bills mature on Feb. 24, 2000.

HEADLINE: Do More to Aid Nourishment Of Very Young, U.N. Tells Iraq

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan told the Iraqi Government today that it could be doing more to help mothers and children under the program that allows Iraq to export oil to raise money for food, medicine and other essential goods.
In a report to the Security Council on the program, Mr. Annan also asked that the Council's sanctions committee stop blocking the export to Iraq of goods like water and sanitation equipment. Most of the holds put on contracts come from representatives of the United States or, occasionally, Britain, the countries that take the hardest line against Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein. 
 The oil-for-food program was started in 1996 to ease civilian suffering under sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Mr. Annan's report precedes an impending debate about how to deal with Iraq now that it has ended arms inspections -- which would have allowed sanctions to be lifted once questions on nuclear, chemical, biological and missile programs had been answered. As the debate nears, the Iraqis, faced with evidence that they have stalled at least parts of a relief program, still face these questions. Even so, they continue to hold the United States responsible for the deaths of thousands of Iraqis under the sanctions.
As officials of the oil-for-food program explained today, Iraq's revenues from oil exports have risen sharply in recent months with higher world oil prices. But the Government has actually been spending less on nutritionally enhanced food products that would benefit women and children in central and southern Iraq, where 85 percent of Iraqis live.
At current oil price levels, Iraq stands to make as much as $6.3 billion in oil sales in the six-month period ending in November, Secretary General Annan said in the report. Officials here said that Iraq had so far budgeted only $6.6 million in nutritional supplements for mothers and children, down from $15 million when the program began in 1996.
In northern Iraq, program officials said, the United Nations and Kurdish officials decide what to buy. More money is allocated there for foods like milk fortified with nutrients to fight malnourishment.
Mr. Annan's report echoes and broadens findings of a report released two weeks ago by Unicef, the United Nations children's fund, which surveyed the health of Iraqi children under 5.
Benon Sevan, director of the United Nations Iraq program, said today that the Iraqis had not heeded earlier recommendations to increase orders of special nutritional products.
"In the light of the Unicef survey," Mr. Sevan said, "there should be serious attention given to targeted feeding programs in order to achieve immediate benefits."
The Secretary General's report faulted Iraq for other omissions in its civilian aid programs. It deplored conditions for Iraqis and United Nations-appointed foreign experts at Mina al Bakr, where a large part of Iraqi oil exports are loaded. Um Qasr, through which imports pass, is also deteriorating, slowing quality testing as goods arrive. Both are under Iraqi control.
The quality testing is in itself a problem. The report cited four-month delays in exams of tuberculosis and diphtheria vaccines intended for Kurdish regions, where the United Nations mandates that 13 percent of oil earnings be spent.
According to the report, the Iraqis have also been ordering smaller quantities of essential foods for the public -- among these cheese, milk and lentils or beans -- which has lowered the number of calories provided in monthly food rations in Government-controlled areas.
Although holds have been put on contracts for water and other supplies, goods that do arrive do not always get distributed quickly, according to the report. A drought in Iraq has worsened water problems.
Iraq has persistently complained about the quality of goods imported under the program. The Secretary General said in his report that Iraq, which chooses the suppliers, should "procure better-quality commodities through more reliable and reputable contractors."

Stock Markets Surge As Interest Rate Fears Ebb
After weeks of directionless and confused stock trading, investors swaggered back into stocks, surer than ever that the Federal Reserve would raise rates for the last time this year at today's meeting.
The turnabout in investor mood sent the Dow Jones industrial average to a record high of 11,299.76, up 199.15 points, or 1.79 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.77 percent, still below its high, reached on July 16. The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.69 percent. Page A1. 

Bond yields hovered at their lowest levels in a month amid optimism over interest rates. The yield on the 30-year Treasury issue held steady at 5.98 percent. C8.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
THE MARKETS JUMP AS THE FED PLANS TO MEET ON RATES

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Investors swaggered back into stocks yesterday, surer than ever that the Federal Reserve Board, at its meeting today, will raise rates for the last time this year.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high of 11,299.76, up 199.15 points, or 1.79 percent. The average has risen 23 percent so far this year, well above its 16 percent gain during all of 1998. The Standard & Poor's 500 index also rose 1.77 percent Monday, but remains 4.1 percent below its high reached on July 16. 
 The turnabout in investor mood comes after weeks of directionless and confused stock trading. Having peaked in mid-July, most of the market indexes fell as investors grew concerned that rising commodity prices and labor costs as well as strong economic growth around the world would push the Fed to take a more aggressive stance on rates. A slight weakening in the dollar, which could push up prices of imported goods and make United States stocks less attractive abroad, was also a worry.
Traders feared that the Fed's quarter-point increase in rates on June 30 would be followed by similar increases at its meetings in August and October, increases aimed at cooling an economy in danger of overheating. But over the last week or so, a consensus started to build that a quarter-point increase today might be enough.
Helping investors to regain optimism was a trickle of economic data indicating that inflation was still under control and that growth in output was slowing. Bond traders, hyper-vigilant for inflation harbingers, have liked what they have seen in the numbers as well. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged yesterday at 5.985 percent, down from 6.277 percent Aug. 12.
"Interest rates have stopped going up," said Alan W. Kral, vice president at Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen Inc., a money management firm in New York, "so people can focus on earnings growth. If we don't have to worry about interest rates, the market ought to do well, and people are getting a jump on that."
Mr. Kral noted that by all accounts, third-quarter earnings at American companies will be robust, thanks mostly to rebounding global economies in Europe, the Pacific Rim and Latin America. The results will look especially good against the third quarter of 1998, when economic crises in Latin America, Russia and East Asia dragged down corporate profits. A slight weakening in the dollar will also contribute to better sales of United States goods abroad.
As a result, most economists believe that corporate earnings will rise about 15 percent in the second half of 1999 from the second half of 1998. If fulfilled, those predictions could become fuel for even more stock market gains.
Of course, the recent view among investors could quickly turn to ash if economic data in coming weeks showed an economy that was a bit too heated. Traders will pore over this week's news releases -- particularly the growth rate of orders for refrigerators, washing machines and other durable goods, out tomorrow, and the revised gross domestic product growth for June, out on Thursday. If either number comes far afield of investor expectations, inflation fears could be reignited.
And it is a fact of life on Wall Street that investors always believe immediately before a Fed meeting at which rates are expected to be increased that the increase will be the last. Indeed, in June, after Mr. Greenspan and some of his colleagues had warned investors that rates were likely to rise, most analysts said that increase would be the last for a while.
But stock investors seem now to believe that the Fed is simply trying to slow the economy down, and betting that it will not go too far and bring it to a halt. As they grow more comfortable in their view of the Fed's abilities to fine-tune the economy, they may be happy to buy stocks even if they cannot rule out a third rate increase.
"I believe that we're going to have a U.S. economy that stays stronger for longer and that we will be in a longer tightening cycle," said Stefan D. Abrams, chief investment officer, asset allocation, at Trust Company of the West in New York. "But people should not confuse a longer tightening cycle with a Draconian body slam by the Fed. They're not trying to break the back of inflation, all they're trying to do is keep us on a path to a soft landing."
Yesterday's move in the Dow came as many on Wall Street were on vacation. Some 683 million shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange, a respectable if not torrid day. The Nasdaq Composite rose 71 points, or 2.69 percent on the day.
One reason investors have become more confident about guessing the Fed's behavior is that the bond market has become a leading indicator in recent years. Back in the 1970's and early 80's, the Fed would move, and bond traders would follow.
No longer. In the spring of 1997, just before the global economic crisis began and well after bond yields had begun to rise, the Fed raised rates. By the fall of 1998, bond yields had plunged when the Fed finally eased to help stem the growing panic in world markets.
"My answer to what do you think the Fed is going to do is look at what the bond market has already done," said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. "The real interest-rate-setter in this country is the bond market. They speak daily and they speak clearly. If there was an inflation problem, they have addressed it."
With inflation fears on the shelf, at least momentarily, investors' focus will shift to identifying which industry sectors or stock market groups will be the top performers going forward. The move yesterday in the Dow average, which has twice the percentage gain of the S.& P. 500 so far this year, continues a broad shift in market leadership away from the kind of high-powered growth stocks that investors have favored for the last five years and into more mundane, manufacturing companies that have been much less popular. Drug companies, for example, are down more than 5 percent this year, while the chemical sector is up more than 32 percent.
Even as investors celebrated yesterday, market strategists warned that a weak dollar remained a concern. "The dollar is the one thing that keeps me awake at night," Mr. Abrams said. "It has been the linchpin of the stock market for the past five years. If the weakness is contained, we're O.K. If it gets out of hand, it's a huge negative for interest rates and stock prices."

Shakespeare Does Malaysia

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia

 BODY:
The first lesson they teach in columnist school is that even if you have mixed opinions about some issue -- and you are torn 50-50 -- when you write the column you have to come down 100 to 0 for one side or the other. The case of Malaysia compels me to break that rule.
The issue is this: In the wake of the Asian financial crisis, Malaysia's mercurial Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, spurned the advice of the I.M.F., the U.S. Treasury and many economists and adopted capital controls to stabilize his country's currency and protect it from speculators. Thailand, Korea and Indonesia, by contrast, kept their economies open, liberalized their political sectors and took the I.M.F. medicine. 
 So who won? For now, everyone. All four countries are recovering, and Dr. Mahathir boasts that his much-derided capital controls have worked just as well as the cures that all the economists were trying to foist on him. This Malaysian case has significance because it could encourage other countries to adopt capital controls, rather than the Anglo-American model of steadily opening up to free flows of capital.
Is Dr. Mahathir justified in his boasts? Now we come back to the lead of this column: the answer is yes and no.
Capital controls can never be a long-term solution for an export-oriented economy such as Malaysia's. They are instituted to buy time to stabilize an economy. So the real question is, How has Malaysia used the time since Sept. 1, 1998, when it barred foreign investors from taking their funds out of Malaysia for a one-year period after their investment in order to curtail the movement of hot money? Answer: Economically, Malaysia has used the time pretty well. Politically, it has gone backward.
Economically, one has to give Dr. Mahathir his due. When he put on the controls, he wisely fixed the Malaysian ringgit at a low rate -- one that has made Malaysia's exports quite attractive, prevented the rise of a black market and been easily defensible with conservative fiscal and monetary policy. Several Malaysian businessmen told me this fixed, cheap ringgit has allowed them to plan again. Malaysia's economy should grow 2 percent this year (pre-crisis it was at 8 percent), the local stock market has perked up and some foreign investment is coming back.
Also, the state has begun forcing the merger and restructuring of weak banks and corporations. This is critical, because it was the excessive lending and borrowing of these institutions, and the lax oversight of them, that got Malaysia in trouble in the first place, with overbuilding. The restructuring, though, remains limited. Still, all in all, Dr. Mahathir is entitled to boast on economics -- a little.
But not on politics. Dr. Mahathir's decision last year to oust his popular deputy and emerging rival, Anwar Ibrahim, on sodomy charges has embarrassed many Malays and engendered a sense of political risk here that is still keeping many foreign investors away. (Mr. Anwar, who was making a bid to oust Dr. Mahathir, says he is being framed because he was about to expose high-level corruption.) This political turmoil is the main reason Malaysia has to pay 1 percent more for its foreign borrowings than its neighbors. The whole sordid Anwar case has rattled the country. As one Malaysian intellectual put it: "The message is that if this can happen to Anwar, what about mere mortals like us? So you better keep your mouth shut."
I believe that while Malaysia is recovering from the immediate economic crisis, the only way it will return to sustained high growth, and prevent another crisis, is with improved productivity and efficiency. That requires political reform -- in corporate governance, in the judiciary, in regulatory institutions, in the free flow of ideas. All of these have been undermined by the Anwar case.
"It's a Shakespearean tragedy," a Malaysian woman friend remarked. "The truth is Anwar and Mahathir made a good team. Mahathir had the courage to make bold economic reforms, even create a multimedia super corridor. And Anwar combined a sense of Islamic tradition and Asian renaissance that appealed to the young and middle classes that Mahathir's own economic reforms gave birth to. Without Anwar, things are out of balance. The two of them are destroying each other and unmaking their own achievements. I think the only hope for Mahathir is, when the Anwar trial and elections are over, if he really makes an effort to redress the damage done to our institutions by this whole affair."
And what are the chances of that? I'd guess about 50-50.

The Least In the East Set to Meet

BYLINE: By ALEX YANNIS 

 BODY:

MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER
 The league's hottest teams are D.C. United with five consecutive victories and the Los Angeles Galaxy with four. The coldest teams are the MetroStars and New England, which have lost a combined 16 straight games and will meet tomorrow night at Giants Stadium with plenty at stake.
 The MetroStars' loss in Los Angeles on Saturday night was their ninth in a row and tied the league record for consecutive losses, held twice by the Revolution, who will come into the game against the MetroStars with seven straight losses. 
 Without a regulation victory since May 15, the Metrostars (5-19) are without a realistic shot at the playoffs and are getting close to mathematical elimination. The Revolution (8-15) has not held a lead against an Eastern Conference team since its victory over the MetroStars on July 4.
 Both teams have had little success in the league's four years of existence because each has misjudged the ability of its foreign players. The latest mistake by the Revolution was the trading of Ariel Graziani, who was sent to Dallas for Leonel Alvarez at the trading deadline 11 days ago.
 Alvarez was a steady influence in his years in Dallas, but Graziani is starting to show why he was the league's first $2 million acquisition last month. He led Dallas to victories over Colorado and Chicago in the last two games with two goals and an assist and was voted the league's player of the week.
 
UNITED STATES
 The official Iraqi News Agency reported that the United States and Iraq were in the process of arranging for a series of games, with the proceeds going to charity, but the United States Soccer Federation, the governing body of soccer in this country, denied the report yesterday.
 We haven't contacted Iraq for any such games, and we have no plan to contact them in the future, said Jim Moorhouse, the spokesman for the federation said from its headquarters in Chicago. We don't know where that report came from. There is no truth to it.
 Iraq is still under economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and the United States has no diplomatic ties with Iraq.
 
EUROPE
 Representatives of six of the continent's top teams met yesterday in Zurich with the FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, to discuss their demands for limiting the number of times their players can be called to play for their national teams.
 Blatter told the group of wealthy clubs that FIFA's ruling executive committee would study a proposal to reduce to four days from five the period for which they will have to give up players for official international games.
 The AC Milan representative, Adriano Galliani, said the clubs were in principle not opposed to the idea of the World Cup being played every two years, provided the overall calendar could be properly synchronized, FIFA said in a statement.
 The clubs also repeated calls for national associations to take over responsibility for players' salaries while on international duty. A.C. Milan, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Olympique Marseilles, Porto of Lisbon and Real Madrid were represented at the meeting with Blatter.
 
ENGLAND
 Manchester United defeated Arsenal, 2-1, on Sunday on two goals by Roy Keane. It was Arsenal's first loss at home since December 1997 and tarnished Arsenal's ambition for the title in the Premiership. Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, called the defeat a psychological and mathematical blow to his team.
 Wenger was particularly annoyed that United had escaped punishment for some harsh early treatment of Patrick Vieira, but when his French midfielder was involved in a near brawl late in the match, Wenger claimed to not have seen the incident. A video replay showed Vieira's head-butt barely missing Keane after the two clashed in a tackle.
 Off the field, the oversaturation of foreign players in England has become an issue. Gordon Taylor, the head of the players union, suggested that no more than two foreigners be allowed on each team in the Premiership and one on each team in the First Division.
 There were only 11 foreigners in England in 1992, but the number this season has grown to more than 200. Taylor also suggested stricter regulations for agents, stating in an article in The Sunday Mirror that a clean police record was the primary requirement for agents.
 
CORNER KICKS
 Brazil strengthened its position atop the FIFA world ranking released last week by reaching the finals of the Confederations Cup. Brazil now has an 87-point lead over France, the winner of the World Cup last summer. The United States was the biggest mover among the top 100 nations by jumping to No. 20 from No. 30 with its third-place finish in the Confederations Cup. ... The Spanish champion, Barcelona, started defense of its title on a winning note Sunday with a 2-0 victory at home against Real Zaragoza. Real Madrid also got its season off to a winning start on Saturday with a 2-1 victory at Mallorca. Kasey Keller and his newly promoted club, Rayo Vallecano, made a spectacular start in the Spanish League, defeating the perennial contender Atletico Madrid, 2-0. ALEX YANNIS

HEADLINE: When the Face in the Crowd Is Grandmotherly

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

DATELINE: LENOX, Mass.

 BODY:
At his sellout Tanglewood concerts over the July 4 weekend, James Taylor, crooning "Sweet Baby James," whisked his audience back to the mellow 1960's and 70's, when the Berkshire Mountains were a magnet for young vagabonds craving music and the other arts in rustic surroundings.
Now the first of December was covered with snow 
 And so was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston.
Lord, the Berkshires seemed dreamlike on account of that frosting,
With 10 miles behind me and 10,000 more to go.
As they looked around, more than a few of those squeezed into the middle-aged mosh pit at the foot of the stage or sprawled on Tanglewood's plush lawns must have wondered where were the legions of the young -- vagabonds or simply weekenders -- who gave the Berkshires much of their coltish spirit in those days. Of course, Mr. Taylor is now 51 and most of his longtime fans are lawyers, managers and entrepreneurs, people who, if they do wander about, do so in Lexuses and Ford Explorers.
But the fact is that at all the locales that have made the Berkshires an unrivaled summer paradise for culture seekers -- at Tanglewood's classical concerts, the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, the Berkshire Theater Festival, the museums -- the crowd is even further along in years. These serene hills are increasingly populated by lifelong followers of music and theater who started traveling here from New York or Boston a generation ago but are now gray-haired second-home owners and Florida snowbirds who summer in the condominiums that sprouted in the Berkshires in the 1980's. Young visitors seem to have become an endangered species. "My wife said to me the other day, 'Look at all the old folks,' " said Murray S. Katz, a retired Manhattan controller who has a Stockbridge condo. " 'This is turning out to be an old folks' home.' "
His wife, Natalie, was exaggerating for effect, but surveys taken by the area's worried cultural institutions show that the summertime population is definitely skewed toward the golden years.
Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, found that 64 percent of its ticket buyers was over 55 and only 10 percent under 30. At Jacob's Pillow, 63 percent of the audience is over 50 and only 12 percent under 35. Statistics for decades past are hard to come by -- Tanglewood did not conduct demographic surveys in years past -- but local cultural managers and tourism officials say they are struck by the age change in their audiences, even if those audiences are growing.
The concern here is not for this summer or next; with the economy stubbornly robust, the stages and concert halls have drawn record crowds.
But the cultural managers are doing some deep soul-searching about why young people are no longer coming in droves, and they are thrashing about for inventive ways to lure them. While the managers love the financial support that older attendees bring in, they worry that a scarcity of young people now could jeopardize the size of audiences 20 years into the future, and more immediately, sour artists whose enthusiasm thrives on looking out on a varied crowd.
"It's a little like biodiversity," said Ella Baff, executive director of Jacob's Pillow. "It's a healthier planet if you have more species. I can say the same about audience development."
While the graying of the audience for so-called highbrow culture is a much remarked phenomenon, the street scene in the Berkshires shows how these changes affect the personality of a region. On the picturesque sidewalks of Lenox and Stockbridge and at popular dining spots like the folksy Carol's and the more decorous Red Lion Inn, young couples have been replaced by middle-aged or older foursomes. The Berkshires, which Arlo Guthrie helped make famous with his droll tribute to Alice's Restaurant (where you can get anything you want, 'cepting Alice), is now a place where a Sophie Tucker imitator can put on 10 shows and know they will be well attended.
Even more stark an emblem of the changing demographics is what happened to the legendary Music Inn, where budding singers like Joan Baez, Carly Simon, Don McLean and Bruce Springsteen entertained swarms of sybaritic flower children. Its site at the Stockbridge Bowl is now a complex of 72 condominiums averaging $400,000 in price and owned by retirees like the Katzes.
Only Great Barrington, a once gritty town that has been gentrified with cosmopolitan restaurants, seems to have a youth scene, mostly of local teen-agers who loiter in front of the shops on Railroad Street until the police, worried about staider tourists, chase them away.
"It's really hard being this age in this town," said Bessie Cherry, a 19-year-old waitress at the Helsinki Cafe.
Ms. Baff and other institutional managers offer a number of reasons why too many young people spurn the Berkshires. "I think a lot of it has to do with money," Ms. Baff said. "It is expensive to buy a house here. It is expensive to rent a house here. It is expensive to stay at a bed and breakfast. You have to have a certain amount of disposable income to participate in the leisure and cultural life of the Berkshires."
Summer rentals range from $3,500 to $8,000 a month, and professional bed and breakfasts start at $125 a night. The cultural institutions whose high quality and variety have given the Berkshires a summertime flavor found nowhere else in the country contribute to the expense. Front-row seats in Tanglewood's music shed are $74, though admission to the lawn is $13.50. Jacob's Pillow prices range from $35 to $60.
Although Berkshire County's year-round population of 140,000 has always been heavily working-class and middle-class -- Pittsfield was until recent years a leading manufacturing center for General Electric -- affluence streamed in with the proliferation of condominiums and second homes in the 1980's. Even many of the drifters of the 1970's settled in to become prosperous artisans and shopkeepers.
"A lot of places like this start with the hippies, then the shrewd, the sun-tanned and finally the wealth comes," said George Wislocki, president of the Berkshires National Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.
The Hamptons are far more expensive as a summertime getaway, but they have always had one irresistible attraction for the young -- miles of beaches for surfing and body flashing. The Berkshires, with their lakeside slivers of beach, have had to compete by offering a quieter cultural cornucopia. Loud behavior in these surroundings would be as gauche as interrupting the playing of a string quartet.
"It's a different tribe here," said Ariel Orr Jordan, a 52-year-old psychotherapist pecking away on his laptop on the porch of the Red Lion. "You associate the Berkshires with laid-back Norman Rockwell country. In the Hamptons the tribe is very narcissistic. It's all about showing yourself, a peacockery culture -- the absolute manifestation of the pre-eminent religion in the United States -- the religion of looking good. In the Hamptons you shop and you show up. Here you can't shop, and there's no place to show up."
There is a more insidious reason for the Berkshires' difficulty in luring the young, one that echoes what is happening to the audience for traditional culture across America. The most common factor in determining who attends Tanglewood "is not age or affluence," said Mark Volpe, managing director of the Boston Symphony. "It's primarily whether they've been exposed to school music programs, and whether they've had music in their lives."
Cutbacks over the last two decades in Federal and local financing for music, art, drama and dance programs in schools have produced a generation less versed in and intrigued by offerings like classical music and theater. Mr. Volpe, who is 41, remembered that his high school in Minneapolis had two orchestras and five bands when he attended. It is now down to two bands. Others lament the demise of television variety programs like "The Ed Sullivan Show" that once introduced young viewers to ballet and opera with palatable morsels in between the circus acts.
Whatever the reasons, the cultural institutions know that something needs to be done, but done carefully. They do not want to alienate their core older supporters and donors, but at the same time they know they need to cultivate future consumers. So they have begun taking carefully calibrated gambles, like Jacob's Pillow's occasional scheduling of more accessible folk dances or the Web site that Tanglewood has set up to make ordering tickets easier for computer users, who tend to be younger.
At the Berkshire Theater Festival, Edwin A. Jaffe, a retired manufacturer, and his wife, Lola, are paying for 80 local high school students to see the season's four different plays.
"We're bringing down the age," Mr. Jaffe joked as he watched his proteges march in for a performance of a Joan Ackermann play, "The Batting Cage."
TDK, the audiotape manufacturer, pays for free Tanglewood tickets for children. This season more than 10,000 children have attended, bringing along their relatively young paying parents. Julianne Boyd, the artistic director of the Berkshire Stage, a five-year-old company whose recent production of the musical "Mack and Mabel" was well received, lures young parents by operating a nursery for two performances a week.
One of Ms. Boyd's long-term strategies is staging separate, leaner productions in the Sheffield high school cafeteria, using local teen-agers or actors in combination with professional directors and choreographers. Not only do the four-week runs train the youngsters in stage discipline, but they cultivate young audiences as well. The group's production of the musical "Grease" has played to sold-out, markedly younger houses.
But interviews with young people indicate that the Berkshire cultural groups may have to try a lot harder. Leigh Marchione, a 21-year-old shop clerk in Great Barrington, said that tickets to shows she would have loved to see, like Gwyneth Paltrow in "As You Like It" at the Williamstown Theater Festival, were snapped up by subscribers or seasoned ticket buyers.
Jacob Braun, a 17-year-old piano student at the Tanglewood Institute, the Boston Symphony's school for high-school-age musicians, wonders why more pieces by modern composers like Bartok are not mixed in with the standard symphonic warhorses at Tanglewood.
Seth Rogovoy, pop music critic of The Berkshire Eagle, thinks that Tanglewood and other stages should consider putting on more adventurous popular programming as well, perhaps not a rap group like Limp Bizkit, whose audience might be rough on the grounds, but a gentler act like Alanis Morissette that could draw young listeners.
"The cultural institutions seem to be myopic in their catering to an older audience," he said.
Many here hope that last season may have marked the peak of the graying curve. Dave Rothstein, who owned the Music Inn until it closed in 1979 amid local complaints about rowdy, drugged-out spectators, said he has been heartened by reggae and folk music concerts at the Butternut ski basin in Great Barrington and by a proliferation of new jazz and rock bars.
Kate Maguire, producing director of the Berkshire Theater Festival, said that when she saw the festival's production of the Orson Welles play "Moby Dick -- Rehearsed," during its closing week, "my insides did a belly flop."
"I looked around and the audience was young -- 30 to 40 years old -- and their hair was a lot longer and they had a lot of it," she said. "And I said: 'My goodness. This is a huge transition.' "

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Arts pages yesterday about the aging of the cultural audience in the Berkshire region of Massachussetts misidentified an environmental group whose president, George Wislocki, commented on the phenomenon. It is the Berkshire Natural Resources Council, not the Berkshires National Resources Defense Council.
The article also misstated the name of a theater company that lures young parents by operating a nursery during some performances. It is the Barrington Stage Company, not the Berkshire Stage.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK;
The 'Do It Yourself' Winery

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

DATELINE: OAKVILLE, Calif., Aug. 21

 BODY:
Route 29 is the Yellow Brick Road of California wine. Between the city of Napa and the town of Calistoga, about 20 miles to the north, 29 is a display of some of the world's most beautiful and prosperous wineries. From May to October, the road is packed with tourists come to gape at these temples of the good life, with their manicured vineyards and welcoming tasting rooms.
Hardly any of the tourists bother to glance at the Napa Wine Company here as they drive by. It's not hard to understand why. Compared with the sleek Opus One and Robert Mondavi wineries just to the north, the Napa Wine Company looks like a truck terminal. But in fact, many of the most sought-after wines -- the wonderful, little-known labels sold through exclusive mailing lists -- are made right here behind these unprepossessing walls. 
 Pahlmeyer Winery, the Lamborn Family Wine Company, Fife Vineyards, La Sirena, the Staglin Family Vineyard, Larkmead Vineyards, Mason Cellars, the Bryant Family Winery, Anthology, Azalea Springs, Buehler Vineyards, Broman and Stone Creek are just a few of the 50 or so wines made in this industrial-looking space. Larger wineries like Domaine Chandon, Benziger and Mumm Napa Valley also use the Napa Wine Company from time to time for part of their winemaking.
The Napa Wine Company is what is known in the trade as a custom-crush operation. "Custom crush" may sound like a hug from Jesse Ventura, but it means making wine in someone else's winery. For a small winemaker, the economic benefits of this are obvious. The capital investment in winemaking equipment -- crushers, fermenters, bottling lines and such -- is considerable: hundreds of thousands of dollars, whether the goal is to make 100 cases or 100,000.
For a fee, the Napa Wine Company can handle the entire winemaking process from the time the grapes arrive at the winery door until, two or three years later, the bottled, aged and labeled wine heads off to customers or wholesalers.
Charges are based on the number of tons of grapes crushed, the number of gallons of wines stored and the number of bottles filled and packaged. Special crushing methods will cost more.
"Prices can vary a lot," said Robert Lawson, the general manager, "but it usually averages out to about $24 a case.
Jason Pahlmeyer of the Pahlmeyer Winery in St. Helena, Calif., is a customer and avid fan of the Napa Wine Company. "A lot of my colleagues are not eager to have it known that they use Napa Wine," he said. "They want to keep that image of the little stone winery with the ivy and bougainvillea all around, and let's face it, Napa Wine is not the prettiest place around."
But that does not mean that the company is not modern. "They've got a press over there that cost about $1 million to install and $60,000 a year to maintain," Mr. Pahlmeyer said, "and they have a state-of-the-art Italian bottling line I could never match -- nor would I want to. There's no way I could afford equipment like that for my little operation, and I have one of the bigger boutique wineries."
Mr. Pahlmeyer makes about 5,000 cases of wine a year, but his only long-term capital investments are his barrels and a gadget he inserts in the Napa Wine bottling line to position his labels properly.
Because of an unusually cool summer, the 1999 harvest is about three weeks late, but Napa Wine is busy scheduling the arrival of grapes for dozens of growers.
"All we ask is 24 hours' notice," said Mr. Lawson, the company's general manager. "Traffic can get heavy when the grapes start coming in, and the growers tend to get nervous. We tell them to be patient, that everyone will be taken care of."
Napa Wine has three winemakers, including Mr. Lawson, plus several dozen assistants, but each client must have its own consulting winemaker. The consulting winemakers, who have included such stars as Tony Soter, Heidi Barrett, Helen Turley and Cathy Corison, may take over most of the winemaking tasks or merely direct them. They also return regularly to check on their wines as they mature in barrels.
For the most part, Napa Wine employees said, their relations with the consulting winemakers are good, but some, not to be named, can be arrogant and, they say, unreasonable. "Most of them hope one day to get their own wineries," one Napa Wine staff member said. "Some, we're glad when they do."
The Napa Wine staff, most of whom have been working in Napa Valley wineries all their lives, plot their winemaking schedule with military precision.
"We know what varieties will mature first and in what parts of the region," Mr. Lawson said. "Sauvignon blanc comes in first, then Napa chardonnay, then up-valley zinfandel. Pinot noir should be next, then Sonoma chardonnay, followed by Carneros chardonnay and Sonoma Coast pinot noir. Finally, we get cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc."
By Federal law, wine for commercial use must be made in a bonded -- that is, licensed -- winery, and each of the small wineries that use the place have their own bond number assigned by the Federal Government. At harvest time, many wineries can be making wine at the same time in a 24-hour-a-day operation.
When one of them is making wine in the plant, workers paint a yellow line on the floor, and that becomes that particular winery's bonded quarters for as long as the job takes, even if it's only for an hour or two. When the wine is moved into barrels for aging, the storage area then becomes the bonded premises.
"This is a very popular way to make wine," said Stephanie Grubbs, Napa Wine's sales and marketing director. "We usually have a waiting list of 10 to 15 prospective clients."
The Napa Wine Company is not alone in the custom-crush business. There are competitors in both the Napa Valley and in nearby Sonoma. In addition, many larger wineries rent out their services.
Napa Wine is owned by the Pelissa family, farmers and grape growers in the Napa Valley for four generations. The present winery was built in 1870 and had been owned by Heublein & Company, which used it to make chardonnay for its Inglenook brand. The Pelissas, who own some 650 acres of grapes in the Napa Valley, bought it in 1993 and turned it into a custom-crush business.
Earlier this year, catching on to a trend of their own making, the Pelissas began to market their own wines under the Napa Wine Company label, a 1997 sauvignon blanc, a 1997 pinot blanc and a 1996 cabernet sauvignon. With an eye on making top-quality wine, they are now competing with their own customers, all to the benefit of the wine drinker.
 
Tastings
Balancing Act
 
Mount Horrocks Clare Valley Late-Harvest Riesling 1998, Southeast Australia. About $18.
 NO one can resist a sweet dessert wine. I'm not talking about some sugary plonk fortified with 20 percent alcohol; it's easier to knock yourself out with a hammer. No, I'm referring to the viscous, golden late-harvest wines made entirely from overripe grapes.
The best are the sauvignon-semillon blends of Sauternes and the rieslings of Germany, Alsace and Austria. American versions often lack the acid needed to balance the sweetness.
This riesling from Australia is the nearest thing I've seen to a great German beerenauslese, a rare late-harvest wine that usually commands a high price. The winemaker, Stephanie Toole, achieves a balance of high sugar and intense acid that they'd be proud of in the Rheingau. A connoisseur's confection.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Chairman of WPP Group raises the ante, the incentives and the potential payout.

BYLINE: By Andrew Ross Sorkin 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
TO the British tabloids, Martin Sorrell is no ordinary advertising executive. He is "Mr 35M," as the bold-faced headline read in The Sun last week. At the end of next month, Mr. Sorrell, chief executive of the WPP Group P.L.C., will receive shares of the company worth about 35 million pounds ($56 million) as part of a much-disputed performance-based compensation package that he created four years ago.
And if he has his way, he and 14 other top executives could collect 100 million pounds ($160 million) more as part of a new compensation plan he introduced last week. 
 The board of WPP, which owns the J. Walter Thompson Company and Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, will not vote on the compensation plan for several weeks, but the issue is already stirring discussion in Britain's advertising community.
A $56 million payday in the United States may not raise too many eyebrows for a chief executive of a major company with offices all over the world, but in Britain, which keeps a watchful eye over "fat cat" compensation packages, Mr. Sorrell's deal is far from commonplace.
While senior executives at Omnicom and Interpublic in the United States have become rich as the value of their stock options has climbed with the market, most advertising executives in Britain tend to get standard salaries without lottery-like stock options or huge bonuses.
Unlike the stock option plans that American executives often get, however, the incentive plan that Mr. Sorrell is proposing has a couple of strings attached. The proposal would require executives to sink almost a year's worth of their salaries into the company beyond any profits they might have taken previously from shares of WPP and would require them to stay locked in four years. In addition, the company has to rank as the No. 1 or No. 2 advertising and communications company in the world, based on its share price and reinvested dividends. If the company falls short of that goal, the executives would still be eligible for smaller compensation.
It is a risky gamble for Mr. Sorrell, 53, and his 14 colleagues because the advertising business, so often fickle, is hard to predict as companies move their accounts from agency to agency.
"The word entrepreneur means risk taker," Mr. Sorrell said in an interview last week. "I'm committing virtually all of my net worth to the company."
He added, "I'm not cashing in to reload," explaining that he is not going to sell any of the shares he will get next month.
Mr. Sorrell has been a bit of a gambler since he took control of WPP in 1986. He engineered the first hostile takeover of an advertising agency, J. Walter Thompson in 1987, and then two years later bought one of Madison Avenue's most famous names, Ogilvy & Mather, for an astonishing figure at the time.
The buying spree pushed WPP to within an eyelash of going under, as debts taken on during the acquisition binge were aggravated by the worldwide advertising recession.
Now that Mr. Sorrell has succeeded in bringing WPP back from the brink, he wants in on the action. "From a personal point of view, I always wanted a major equity stake in a company," said Mr. Sorrell, who left Saatchi & Saatchi to take the reins of WPP. "I'm trying to put us on par with our U.S. competition."
As he proposes radically changing the compensation structure, others in Britain's advertising community question whether the creative side of the business will suffer.
"They will ask whether an incentive scheme which is linked entirely to WPP's stock price will serve to further erode the creative standing of the two networks by making City and Wall Street performance, rather than advertising pedigree, the prime motivator," wrote Caroline Marshall, deputy editor of the British trade magazine Campaign.
And, she added, "There will, of course, be concerns from those in adland who resent Sorrell's formidable unseen influence or who detest his financial leverage over treasured advertising icons like J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy & Mather."
But for Mr. Sorrell, all of this is just business as usual. "If you look at the holdings of my peers, compared with me, the compensations are not dissimilar," he said. "But I'm putting my money where my mouth is."

HEADLINE: Schools Rank First As Spending Priority

 BODY:
Citizen support for education spending has risen over 25 years, to rank first on a list of national spending priorities, according to the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
In 1973, when the center began its general population surveys, drugs and crime ranked highest, with education sixth, when people were asked whether the country was spending too much, too little or the right amount. The next-ranking spending priorities last year were health, the environment, crime and drugs. 
 In 1972, the proportion of families with children under 18 was 55 percent; in 1998, it was 38 percent, noted the 1998 report, released last week.
Whether one's view of schools is liberal or conservative, based on improving job prospects or on raising standards, school spending "is a tool that everyone can navigate even though they use the tool in different ways," Tom W. Smith, director of the survey, said in an interview.
He said that unlike support for welfare spending, which rises or falls with the economy, in education spending, "the pattern of increase we've seen indicates that this is not something tied to the business cycle."
Education appears to represent a new American spending priority, important not just for its own sake but as essential to the American labor force, Dr. Smith said.

HEADLINE: Aid Preferred To Vouchers In New Survey

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
An overwhelming majority of Americans prefer allowing government to improve and strengthen public schools rather than giving parents tuition vouchers for private or church-sponsored schools, according to a poll released yesterday.
The poll, conducted this summer by the Gallup Organization for Phi Delta Kappa, a professional association of educators, found that 70 percent of respondents favored the government's improving public schools, while 28 percent preferred vouchers. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. 
 But the poll also suggested that the very word "vouchers" is politically loaded. When asked specifically about vouchers to pay for all of the tuition, 47 percent of respondents were in favor and 48 were opposed. Last year, 48 percent were in favor and 46 percent were opposed.
It was the second time since the poll began addressing the issue in 1993 that "vouchers" was introduced into the questions to reflect the growing trend of using government-issued notes to pay for tuition at private or church-sponsored schools. The first time was last year.
The use of vouchers has inspired considerable political and legal controversy, especially in church-related schools.
Some critics argue that issuing vouchers for religious schools violates the separation of church and state. Proponents say public schools will benefit from the competition, which will also serve poor students by enabling them to attend schools with higher standards.
A small majority of Americans continues to favor allowing parents to send their children to any public, private or church-related school if government pays all or part of the tuition. Fifty-one percent of respondents favored the voucher concept and 47 percent opposed it.
The latter findings represent a slight increase in opposition to vouchers over last year, when 51 percent were in favor and 45 percent were opposed. The figures represent a reversal of opinion since 1996, when 43 percent favored vouchers and 54 percent opposed them. In 1997 the results were almost evenly divided.
The poll also found divisions among Americans on the issue of tuition tax credits. The public more strongly supports -- by 57 percent to 47 percent -- partial tuition credits over full tuition tax credits.
The public showed strong support for providing public school services to children who are schooled at home. Ninety-two percent favored providing special education services; 80 percent supported allowing home-schooling teachers to take part in public school teacher development activities; 74 percent supported allowing home-schooled students to participate in public school extracurricular activities. But most expressed a strong desire to see the students adhere to the same standards as public school students.

If it seems that airline flights have been crowded
in recent months, guess what? They have been.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
IF you wonder whether the flights you have been on in recent months are always crowded, or whether you are just a victim of bad timing or bad luck, the load factors -- the percentage of available seats occupied by paying passengers -- for most United States airlines last month are revealing. So are the year-to-date load factors.
Every major carrier had load factors at least in the 70's in July, and most had them in the mid- to high-70's. Two airlines, Trans World Airlines and Northwest Airlines, had them in the 80's that month; T.W.A.'s 2.4 million domestic passengers resulted in what the airlines said was its "best month in modern history" for domestic boardings. 
 Other airlines also broke records in July. The 79.1 percent load factor at Delta Air Lines' for example, was the highest for any month in its 70-year history, while the 77.8 percent at Continental Airlines was not only the highest of any July in its history, but its second-highest month ever.
And don't think you can easily get an overnight "red eye" flight or a Saturday flight, both of which used to be readily available because few business travelers flew then. Now they have to fly when there are seats. On several recent Saturdays, for example, occupancies on Delta flights have averaged above 80 percent, and on a recent Saturday reached 86.1.
"The Internet has driven people to what used to be underused flights, because those fares tend to be cheaper and passengers are willing to fly at those times for a bargain price," said John Kennedy, a Delta spokesman.
The only two major airlines whose year-to-date passenger loads were below 70 percent are America West at 67.4 percent and Alaska Airlines at 62.1 percent.
The annual average load factors hovered in the high-50's and low-60's throughout the 1980's. In 1994 they rose to 69.3 percent and thereafter began their ascent into the 70's, where they remain today. What this means, of course, is that packed airplanes are not just the result of the luck of the draw but a permanent condition for most passengers, at least until the economy weakens.
 
Airline Update
Anyone who joins the British Airwaysfrequent-flier program and then takes a trans-Atlantic flight on a full-fare business-class round-trip ticket, or two one-way tickets (either way, the cost is $5,366 between New York or Newark and London), will receive two free coach tickets to almost anywhere in the world. Now for the fine print: Passengers must travel by Dec. 15, 1999, and no later than Dec. 31, 1999, they also must write a note, letter or treatise expressing their opinion of British Airways' business class. The free tickets are valid for travel between Jan. 15, 2000, and Dec. 15, 2000.
Airtran is the latest airline to offer 10 percent discounts for travel booked over its site on the Internet (www.airtran.com). Airtran's hub is in Atlanta and its destinations include Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Miami; New Orleans; Orlando, Fla.; Savannah, Ga., and Tampa, Fla. Fares require at least a three-day advance purchase, but do not require a round-trip purchase or Saturday night stay.
Beginning next February, Aloha Airlines will fly from Hawaii to the mainland for the first time in its 53-year history. Using the new Boeing 737-300's, it will fly two daily round trips -- between Honolulu and Oakland, Calif., and Maui and Oakland. If customers find on-time performance, baggage handling or customer service lacking, Aloha said it would give them a free one-way inter-island ticket.
 
Mystery Deal
Analysts are not all convinced that the Carnival Corporation will succeed in buying Princess Cruises, but neither do they think it is a pipe dream, especially since Carnival confirmed that it had held talks with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Princess's British owner. Yesterday, Tim Gallagher, a Carnival spokesman, said that the talks had occurred "earlier this year," adding that there were no talks currently and the company had no comment on whether it had made an offer.
Princess expects delivery of seven new ships between next year and 2004, and that hardly seems like the action of a company wanting to sell. On the other hand, when Carnival speaks, much of the cruise industry rejoices or trembles. Its 35 percent market share is far and away the largest, as is its fleet of more than 44 ships, with 9 on order. Princess, by contrast, has a 15.5 percent market share and nine ships plus the seven on order. And a British newspaper, The Daily Mail, reported that Carnival offered $11 billion for Princess.
If Carnival does buy Princess, within three years it is likely to command at least 50 percent of the worldwide cruise market. If it does not, Carnival still has come a long way since its inception in 1972. It acquired its first ship -- the Empress of Canada -- from Canadian Pacific for $5 million. Renamed the Mardi Gras, it promptly ran aground on its maiden voyage from the Port of Miami.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
With No Surprises, the Markets Show Restraint

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Financial markets got what many investors interpreted as an all-clear signal from the Federal Reserve yesterday, as the central bank indicated that its latest quarter-point rate increase would be enough to slow economic growth and keep inflation in check. But the reaction was subdued in the stock and bond markets because many had anticipated the Fed's announcement.
"The markets are seeing this as a 'we're done for now' kind of signal," said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He and other Fed watchers said, however, that they could not rule out a third rate increase by the Fed. The first in this series came on June 30. 
 "The economy remains very strong, and the balance of inflation risks continues to edge higher," Mr. Berner said.
Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, agreed. He said that stocks with high price-earnings ratios and those dependent on discretionary consumer spending, like autos and retailers, would be vulnerable if market sentiment swung back to the view that a third rate increase was in the offing.
The Dow Jones industrial average, after jumping 199.15 points to a new high on Monday, dropped 16.46 yesterday, or two-tenths of one percent, to 11,283.30. The Dow was down 10 to 20 points before the Fed announced it was raising its interest rate target, the Federal funds rate, on overnight loans between banks, to 5.25 percent.
Right after the news, the Dow fell just over 100 points before rebounding. The Wall Street saying that covers such selling on what would be considered good news is "buy on the rumor and sell on the news"; that is, buy when you expect the news to be good so that you can take some profits when the news is good.
The other major stock indexes finished higher, though they dipped temporarily after the announcement. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks closed up 3.28, or two-tenths of one percent, to 1,363.50; it was up about 3 before the announcement by the Fed at 2:15 P.M. The Nasdaq composite index ended at 32.80, up 1.2 percent, at 2,752.37; it was up about 25 before the announcement.
In the bond market, the price of the 30-year bond rose 23/32, to 102 24/32, as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.93 percent, from 5.98 percent on Monday. The bond was up about 13/32 before the announcement.
The price of the two-year note, which is more sensitive to Fed interest rate moves, rose 3/32, and the yield dropped to 5.58 percent, from 5.64 percent on Monday.
The dollar was little changed on the news, falling against the Japanese yen and the euro. In emerging stock markets, the benchmark Mexican and Brazilian indexes fell after the announcement but were still up for the day.
The signal from the Fed policy makers came in the statement released by the Federal Open Market Committee after yesterday's meeting. "Today's increase in the Federal funds rate," the statement said, "together with the policy action in June and the firming of conditions more generally in U.S. financial markets over recent months, should markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward."
This was a far more positive signal than the Fed gave when it made the June rate increase. The statement released then said the committee "recognizes that in the current dynamic environment it must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth."
Louis Crandall, the chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, warned against assuming that the Fed would not raise interest rates again before the year is over.
He said one indication was that the Fed had also raised its discount rate, the rate charged on loans to member banks, a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent.
He argued that this was an aggressive move, indicating that the Fed was worried about inflation, so another rate rise should not be ruled out.
In past episodes of raising rates, Mr. Crandall said, the Fed had waited longer and until the spread between the discount rate and the target Federal funds rate was much wider before raising the discount rate.
Mr. Crandall also pointed to a very small word change in yesterday's statement from the June statement. In both, the Fed referred to the three quarter-point rate cuts that were made last fall in an effort to calm the financial turmoil around the world after Russia defaulted on its debt and devalued its currency.
In raising the Federal funds rate in June, the Fed said that much of the financial strain from the fall of 1998 had eased and, therefore, "the full degree of adjustment is judged no longer necessary."
In yesterday's statement, the Fed said, "The degree of monetary ease required to address the global financial market turmoil of last fall is no longer consistent with sustained, noninflationary economic expansion."
Mr. Crandall said that the change from "full degree" to just "degree" could be taken as a signal that the Fed would take back all those rate cuts, which means one more rate increase.
When you just have the Fed's statement to go on, he said, "that is the sort of fine distinction that you can't ignore."

HEADLINE: A Cautious Rate Increase

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board is acting cautiously in trying to slow the American economy and head off a resurgence of inflation. Investors appear to be confident that such a gradual approach will have a minimal impact on the economy. In the near term, they are probably right.
The Fed yesterday raised the Federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow from each other, by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 percent. It also raised the discount rate, at which banks borrow from the Fed when they are in severe need of capital, by the same amount, to 4.75 percent. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had signaled the increases in Congressional testimony at which he warned that the economy was growing too rapidly to prevent inflationary pressures in a very tight labor market. As a result, the Fed's move yesterday surprised no one. 
 Wall Street now expects that the Fed is through raising rates for the rest of this year, and that the next meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee, on Oct. 5, will be a non-event. It also believes that neither corporate profits nor financial markets will be damaged by higher interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at a record high on Monday, slipped a bit yesterday, but the more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes advanced. Bond prices also rose, sending long-term interest rates down a bit even as the Fed was pushing up short-term rates.
Last year, with the domestic economy strong but fears of worldwide recession intense, the Fed cut interest rates three times. In explaining its decision to raise rates yesterday, the Fed said that "the degree of monetary ease required to address the global financial market turmoil of last fall is no longer consistent with sustained, non-inflationary economic expansion." Still, the fact that the Fed sees no need to reverse all of last year's cuts is viewed by Wall Street as a sign that Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues are not going to spoil the party that has sent stock prices to unprecedented valuations and roused fears of a financial bubble.
It is possible that the Fed will be forced to tighten credit again this year, even if inflation does not accelerate. That could happen if the dollar comes under pressure. It has already begun to weaken against both the Japanese yen and the euro. That weakening might be the first indication that investors are beginning to move capital overseas, a potentially serious problem given that the United States must continue to attract large amounts of capital to finance its big trade deficit. Higher interest rates are one way to attract that capital, and a very weak dollar might force the Fed to raise rates again.
The Fed is acting responsibly in trying to slow the economy gradually. President Clinton and Congress should cooperate by pursuing a lean fiscal policy. In particular, as Mr. Greenspan has asked, they should avoid tax cuts that would unnecessarily stimulate the economy and increase the chances that the Fed will have to raise interest rates again.

HEADLINE: Statement by Fed Panel on RateIncrease

 BODY:
Following is the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for the Federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 5.25 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 4.75 percent.
With financial markets functioning more normally, and with persistent strength in domestic demand, foreign economies firming and labor markets remaining very tight, the degree of monetary ease required to address the global financial market turmoil of last fall is no longer consistent with sustained, noninflationary economic expansion.
Today's increase in the Federal funds rate, together with the policy action in June and the firming of conditions more generally in U.S. financial markets over recent months, should markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward. As a consequence, the directive the Federal Open Market Committee adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the near term.
In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is the interest rate that is charged depository institutions when they borrow from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

After 13 years without a strike, the Ford Motor Company is facing labor troubles in the United States and Canada even as labor relations at the General Motors Corporation are finally starting to improve after 19 strikes over the last five years, union officials and auto executives say.
The increasingly contentious issues facing Ford are making it less likely that it will be chosen by the United Automobile Workers union this year as the first auto maker to negotiate a pattern-setting, three-year national contract for the industry, they said. The U.A.W. conducted talks first with Ford in 1993 and 1996, and Ford used both opportunities to conclude deals that helped it and hurt G.M. and the Chrysler Corporation, which has since become part of DaimlerChrysler A.G. 
 Ford wants to sell or spin off its auto parts division and has been reluctant to commit itself recently to building more vehicles and engines at less efficient factories. Both moves have alarmed local union officials, who have put pressure on the U.A.W.'s national leadership to take a tough stance.
Ford has been negotiating lately to merge the auto parts unit with the Lear Corporation as part of a complicated stock deal. Those talks are now focused on finding a way to make sure that the transaction is tax free, but no deal is likely until after the expiration on Sept. 14 of the U.A.W.'s contracts with Ford, G.M. and DaimlerChrysler, people close to the negotiations said.
It now appears possible, although still not certain, that the U.A.W. will negotiate first this year with DaimlerChrysler, leaving for later in the autumn the difficult issues at Ford and the complicated but less contentious issues at G.M. The union has taken a renewed interest in the talks at DaimlerChrysler despite the death earlier this month of Jack Laskowski, the union's vice president for DaimlerChrysler issues.
The talks at G.M., while complicated and hard to resolve quickly, have been going well. "They seem to want to work with us," much more so than in the past, said a U.A.W. negotiator.
Basil Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, said in an interview that he wanted to hold talks first with Ford this autumn. This would make it unlikely that the U.A.W. would also negotiate first with Ford. The American and Canadian unions have a history of not negotiating with the same auto maker at the same time because the American union is so much bigger that the Canadian union might then receive short shrift.
Mr. Hargrove said that if the U.A.W. chose Ford, he would most likely choose another auto maker. But Mr. Hargrove works closely with the U.A.W., and his willingness to express a preference for starting with Ford so close to the expiration of the labor contracts suggests that the U.A.W. will not select Ford, although he added that he did not know what the U.A.W. would do.
The Canadian union also tends to hold short strikes every three years before reaching contracts, often against the first company with which negotiations are held. That is mainly because Canadian labor laws effectively prevent local units of unions from staging walkouts in the middle of a contract. But the result may be to ruin Ford's remarkable string of strike-free years.
Sean McAlinden, the manager of automotive economic studies at the University of Michigan and an adviser to the auto makers and the U.A.W., said that the Canadian laws made it likely that Mr. Hargrove would call a strike at Ford. "It forces him to do some sort of walkout every three years to show he has some teeth," Mr. McAlinden said.
The U.A.W.'s contracts do allow such strikes for health and safety reasons. U.A.W. local units in Flint, Mich., cited such reasons a year ago in a strike against G.M. that crippled the company's North American operations for nearly two months and measurably slowed the American economy during the second and third quarters.
In Canada and in the United States, the unions are demanding substantial wage and pension increases in addition to continuing the job security provisions that have been a staple of national contracts over the last two decades. The auto makers are enjoying record sales and have accumulated huge cash reserves -- $24 billion in the case of Ford.
"The companies are doing very, very well," Mr. Hargrove said. "The companies are making a lot of money and the workers are entitled to share it."
Higher wages would put Ford, G.M. and DaimlerChrysler at a disadvantage in competing with imports from countries like Korea and Germany. But Japanese auto makers now assemble the majority of their vehicles in the United States and tend to match wage increases in Detroit so as to forestall unionization of their American factories.

HEADLINE: Few States Are Using Settlements In Tobacco Suit to Cut Smoking

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Despite overwhelming evidence that anti-tobacco campaigns reduce smoking, most states are in danger of wasting an opportunity to fight death and disease with money from the tobacco industry, Federal health officials said today.
Only 6 of the 46 states that participated in last year's $206 billion settlement with tobacco companies have made major commitments to use their windfalls to cut down on tobacco use, Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a conference in Florida. 
 The hesitation is especially frustrating because statistics show that aggressive anti-smoking efforts sharply lower the ranks of tobacco users, Dr. Koplan told the National Conference on Tobacco and Health in Kissimmee. "We have nothing to show when we prevent something," he said. "All you can show are fewer smokers."
And fewer early deaths from lung cancer, his colleague Michael Eriksen added in an interview.
Dr. Eriksen, director of the C.D.C.'s Office on Smoking and Health, said the states must wrestle not just with a public-policy question, but something more basic: "This raises fundamental issues about where your moral values are."
To Dr. Koplan and Dr. Eriksen, the statistics are irrefutable. They cited California, Massachusetts and Oregon, where higher tobacco taxes were enacted in recent years after anti-tobacco advertising and educational campaigns were undertaken.
Per capita cigarette consumption declined 16 percent in California from 1992 to 1996, the officials said, and 20 percent in Massachusetts for the same period.
Kentucky, probably the state whose economy is most dependent on tobacco, has the highest smoking rate in the nation, Dr. Eriksen said. In 1996, nearly 26 percent of adults in the state smoked, and 47 percent of students in grades 9 through 12 reported having smoked in the previous month.
"It's deplorable that we have the highest youth-smoking rate, but understandable given our culture," said Amy Barkley, head of Kentucky Action, a tobacco-control coalition.
Kentucky is second only to North Carolina in tobacco production, but Kentucky's economy relies on it more; two-thirds of the farms in the state grow tobacco.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide detailed recommendations for states on how to combat tobacco use. The greatest emphasis is on preventing smoking among teen-agers.
The six states that the agency said had made anti-tobacco, public-education commitments in line with its recommendations are New Jersey, Hawaii, Vermont, Minnesota, Maryland and Washington.
Four states -- Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas -- entered into earlier settlements with the tobacco companies. The settlements, arising from the public-health costs associated with tobacco use, are to be paid out over 25 years. (New York is to get about $25 billion, New Jersey $7.6 billion and Connecticut $3.7 billion.)
The states are not bound to use their settlement money fighting tobacco, or on health programs in general, for that matter. They can use it to build schools or to reduce debt -- all worthy goals, Dr. Eriksen conceded.
Or, he said, they can use it to help people live longer. Unless things change, Dr. Eriksen said, five million Americans who are under 18 will die prematurely because they smoke.

HEADLINE: Court Is Not Sympathetic To Lawsuit by Legislators

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Legislators hoping to overturn a law that withholds their paychecks when the state budget is late got little encouragement from the state's highest court in oral arguments today, as four of the seven Court of Appeals judges voiced skepticism at their challenge.
In December, as part of a bargain with Gov. George E. Pataki that raised lawmakers' salaries for the first time in a decade, the Legislature passed a law providing that if a budget was not in place by the April 1 deadline, legislators would not be paid until one had been passed. Fourteen Democratic Senators and Assembly members sued, and won a ruling at a trial court that the law violated the State Constitution. 
 But today in the Court of Appeals, Judges Joseph W. Bellacosa, Howard A. Levine, Richard C. Wesley and Albert M. Rosenblatt repeatedly put the plaintiffs' lawyer, James D. Herschlein, on the spot, poking holes in his case. While the give-and-take of oral arguments is no guarantee of how a court will eventually rule, today's session revealed a core of doubt on the court.
Only one member of the court, Judge George Bundy Smith, expressed sympathy with the plaintiffs' claim that the new law could coerce legislators into voting for a budget they did not approve.
In its first year, at least, the law clearly failed in its intended purpose: to speed passage of the chronically late state budget. Instead, lawmakers completed passage of the budget on Aug. 4, 126 days into the fiscal year, tying the state record for tardiness. Many legislators borrowed money, and some suggested that the new law only served to intensify the tensions between the Legislature and the Governor, whose pay was not withheld.
Many legislators who voted for the pay-withholding measure hoped that it would be struck down in court. The 14 plaintiffs in this case either voted against it or were newly elected in November and had not yet taken their seats.
Their lawyer, Mr. Herschlein, contended that the new law violated the constitutional separation of powers by transferring power from the Legislature to the Governor.
But that, Judge Bellacosa countered, turns the usual separation-of-powers argument on its head, because in this case the Legislature imposed the new condition on itself and was asking the courts to intervene. "This seems to be saying to the judiciary, 'Rescue us from ourselves,' " he said.
When judges noted that none of the plaintiffs claimed that the law had coerced them into accepting the budget, Mr. Herschlein said, "I certainly don't expect the legislators to come in here and say, 'You know what? I fell down on my constitutional duty.' "
"I don't have to prove coercion," he said. "I have to prove the possibility of manipulation of a vote."
Mr. Herschlein tried, without much success, to turn the court's attention to his claim that the new law violated a provision in the State Constitution that prohibits any change in legislators' compensation during a two-year term. He cited a case from the 70's, in which the Court of Appeals ruled that the Assembly Speaker, Stanley Steingut, could not strip away members' stipends for leadership positions and committee chairmanships in mid-term -- a case he called the foundation for his appeal.
But Judge Wesley dismissed the analogy to that case out of hand. "In 'Steingut,' the problem was that the Speaker held all the cards," he said.
Under the new law, the paychecks are to be withheld until the State Comptroller certifies that a "sufficient" budget has been passed. Mr. Herschlein maintained that the provision improperly gave new powers to the Comptroller, but again he met with skepticism.
This year, Comptroller H. Carl McCall made that finding "within minutes or hours," Judge Bellacosa said. "Doesn't that make it look like, sound like, ministerial?" he asked, rather than like a substantive new role.
Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye and Judge Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick gave little indication of their thinking in the case. Only Judge Smith voiced some accord with the plaintiffs' arguments. "Why isn't this economic coercion?" he asked of the new law. "Why should I as a legislator have to worry about whether my family can eat," if that is a consequence of not voting for a budget?
Solicitor General Preeta D. Bansal, defending the law for the state, maintained that it did not improperly change legislators' compensation during a term. The amount, she noted, did not change, only the terms of its delivery, and that was decided in December, during the last term.
The court's ruling is expected this fall.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Praises Huge Tax Cut That G.O.P. Passed and Mrs. Clinton Scorns

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani offered strong praise yesterday for the $792 billion Republican tax cut passed by Congress this summer, saying it would be "great" if the plan became law. With his remarks, Mr. Giuliani drew a clear distinction on what could be a central issue in a race against Hillary Rodham Clinton for United States Senator.
Mr. Giuliani had until now refrained from offering an opinion on the tax cut, the largest in nearly 20 years. President Clinton has pledged to veto it, and prospective Democratic Congressional candidates, Mrs. Clinton among them, have attacked it as a threat to such programs as Medicare and Social Security. 
 The Republican Mayor, first in an interview on MSNBC and later at City Hall, said it was unlikely that a tax cut of this magnitude would become law. But he urged Congress to reach a compromise that came close to the $792 billion Republican plan, rather than a $300 billion alternative put forward by Democrats.
"I certainly would support a lot more than the $300 billion and a lot closer to the $800 billion that the Republican leadership wants, and if they can get all of it that would be great," Mr. Giuliani said in the television interview. "But I would be willing to compromise some of it, if you got kind of close to it, but not at $300 billion."
Mr. Giuliani has long pressed for tax cuts as Mayor. But the $792 billion Congressional tax cut, which Washington Republicans would like to make a central issue in the 2000 Congressional elections, has posed a potential problem for him as he contemplates a race in New York. Political strategists in both parties say tax cuts are not a particular compelling issue in the state.
Mr. Giuliani has been attacked by conservative Republicans for failing to endorse the bill. Mrs. Clinton has attacked the tax cut as a threat to the nation's economy and domestic programs, in what her aides said was an attempt to force Mr. Giuliani to take sides on the issue.
The First Lady's political aides seized on Mr. Giuliani's remarks as soon as the MSNBC interview was broadcast. "Finally Rudy Giuliani shows his true colors," said Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign press secretary. "Hillary Clinton opposes this irresponsible scheme because it would threaten economic progress and jeopardize Social Security, Medicare and education."
At City Hall, Mr. Giuliani said he was prepared to accept a smaller tax cut, but he called the Democratic proposals meager. "If you want to do tax cuts, you have to always recognize that you should ask for more, be willing to settle for less, but not settle for insignificant amounts, which is what the President's proposal right now would be," Mr. Giuliani said.
He said the most important taxes to cut, for the sake of New York State, were the capital gains tax, which he said was crimping business development, and the income tax.
Mr. Giuliani also offered support yesterday for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a Republican candidate for President, in his refusal to answer questions about past drug use, and the Mayor criticized the news media for raising the issue. "This is for the purpose of just hounding the man; this is a game," Mr. Giuliani said.
The Mayor volunteered that he himself had never tried marijuana or cocaine. "I've answered that before, and I regret actually having answered it," Mr. Giuliani said. "It's really none of your business if I did or I didn't."

HEADLINE: FED, AS EXPECTED, RAISES KEY RATES BY QUARTER-POINT

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates today by a quarter of a percentage point, the second increase in less than two months, saying the action should help avert inflation while allowing the nation's long economic expansion to continue.
Brushing aside arguments from farmers, labor unions, manufacturers and some politicians that there was no inflation to fight, the central bank said it would increase the main rate it controls, the Federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks, to 5.25 percent from 5 percent. It also said it would raise its more symbolic discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system to 4.75 percent from 4.5 percent. 
 The Fed said the risks of inflation should now be "markedly" diminished, a statement that investors and analysts read to suggest that further rate increases this year, while by no means out of the question, were less likely.
Although relatively small, today's increases were intended to slow the economy by putting upward pressure on borrowing costs, or at least to help lock in a general rise over much of this year in the rates set by the financial markets. Mortgage rates, for example, have risen substantially this year, but their future course will depend largely on the bond markets' assessment of the risks of inflation and higher interest rates. Banks quickly raised their prime lending rates to 8.25 percent from 8 percent, a step that will result in higher rates on some consumer and small business loans.
Stocks seesawed after the Fed's announcement and ended the day mixed. But analysts said the hint that further rate increases might not be necessary was good news for investors, who have bid stock prices up to record levels recently on the assumption that the central bank could control inflation without a protracted series of rate increases. Apparently driven by that reasoning, bond prices rose today, pushing long-term rates down slightly. Page C1.
In a statement, the Fed portrayed its decision as another step in reversing the three quarter-point rate cuts it made last fall, when the global financial system was threatening to seize up and other countries were looking to the United States for help in keeping their economies afloat.
The global crisis has largely passed, and in the meantime the American economy has continued to expand robustly, setting off some tentative warning signals about inflation but generating almost no actual inflation so far.
Having now taken back two of last fall's three rate cuts, the Fed distinctly left open the possibility that it could raise rates a third time this year. Economists said the central bank could still increase rates another notch at its next meeting on Oct. 5 or the subsequent meeting on Nov. 16 if economic data showed inflationary pressure in the form of a sharp decline in unemployment, further big wage increases or a substantial rise in the Consumer Price Index.
But its statement suggested that the Fed saw its work as more likely to be finished for the year, with any threat of inflation now contained.
"You'd have to view the odds of an Oct. 5 rate hike as considerably less than 50-50 at this point," said Bill Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs in New York. "Obviously it depends on the data, but most likely the Fed is done for the year."
The Fed's statement said that with financial markets having recovered, economies worldwide bouncing back and strong growth in the United States creating an extremely tight labor market, "the degree of monetary ease required to address the global financial market turmoil of last fall is no longer consistent with sustained, noninflationary economic expansion."
In what analysts said was an important shift in tone by the central bank, the statement added that the combination of the two rate increases by the Fed plus a rise in recent months in the longer-term rates set by the markets "should markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward."
The central bank said it had adopted a neutral outlook about the need for any changes to monetary policy over the short run, meaning that it did not see any clear evidence now that it would have to raise rates again. But it is unclear how much value that stance has in predicting the Fed's decision when it meets in October because it adopted a neutral position after raising rates a quarter-point on June 30 and went on to raise rates again today.
The central bank's action drew criticism from a variety of interest groups and politicians who traditionally oppose higher rates.
They said today that the increase was unjustified at a time when overall inflation was nearly dormant and the prices of farm products and some other commodities were falling or depressed. They said most companies had little ability to raise prices because of intense competition and had proved determined to absorb cost increases by increasing their efficiency.
"At a time when inflation is almost dormant and when foreign markets are only now beginning to emerge from recession, this decision is a disappointment," said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the rate increase would "increase the likelihood that our national economic progress will continue to fail to benefit fully those at the lower end of the economic spectrum." Steve Forbes, the Republican Presidential candidate, said the Fed was turning a mighty economy into "the economic equivalent of the Titanic."
But economists on Wall Street said the Fed was doing the right thing to fight inflation before it took root because price stability has been the foundation on which the long expansion has been built.
"I'm right with the Fed on this issue," said Allen Sinai, an economist at Primark Decision Economics in New York, adding that the central bank had to act early because "inflation is a glacial process, loaded with inertia."
As it has for the last several years, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee came into today's meeting facing a raft of somewhat contradictory economic data.
Although it slowed in the second quarter and faces potential trouble from a rapidly expanding trade deficit and a weakening dollar, the economy appears to have regained momentum over the summer. Industrial output last month rose to its highest rate in more than a year. Housing starts remain strong and retail sales are robust. Demand for imports was strong, and rebounding economies in Asia and Europe mean better prospects for exporters.
With growth strong, job creation has remained brisk, and wages rose last month at a pace that while gratifying to workers was seen by some economists as the first signs of a possible inflationary spiral. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has repeatedly focused in his public comments on the depletion of the labor pool and the possibility of an excessive surge in wages as the most immediate inflationary threat to the economy.
Still, inflation by nearly all measures has remained controlled, if not dormant, leaving the Fed in the position of fighting what critics consider a phantom menace.
The Fed has had to weigh several other tricky issues in setting policy. It would clearly prefer not to have to raise rates later this year at a time when the Year 2000 computer problem could be having real or psychological effects on the economy and the financial markets. Some analysts said the Fed might have decided to tighten policy today to reduce the need to do so late in the year.
The central bank also continues to grapple with the relentless rise in stock prices, seeing both a threat to financial stability in the possibility of a market crash and a "wealth effect" that fuels consumption at a time when the Fed is trying to slow the economy.
Rising interest rates generally dampen enthusiasm among investors, but Wall Street has so far been undaunted by the two rate increases, at least partly offsetting any slowdown the higher rates might bring.

HEADLINE: Pataki Used Vagaries of PAC Laws for Presidential Hopes

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's two political action committees, one in New York and another in Virginia, were established in January to promote what he called a "positive message of change" by helping like-minded Republicans win office around the country.
But their reports show that the Pataki PAC's used the vagaries of Virginia and Federal election law to put corporate money and large individual donations behind Mr. Pataki's brief hopes for the Presidential nomination. Many other politicians have taken similar advantage of the laws. Here is how things worked in Mr. Pataki's case. 
 Corporate funds and individual contributions of more than $5,000 to a Federal political action committee are barred under Federal law. One of Mr. Pataki's committees is covered under Federal law. But the other, organized in Virginia, is subject to that state's much looser laws. In Virginia, there are no limits on the size or sources of contributions to PAC's. So the Virginia committee raised $395,300 through June 30, while the Federal PAC raised only $185,702.
The Federal version of the Pataki PAC announced that it planned to give 75 percent of its donations to state (as opposed to Federal) candidates. That stipulation allowed it to take money from the fatter Virginia PAC for 75 percent of its "expenses," a word that political figures tend to define quite flexibly.
The promise to donate to state candidates in turn enabled Mr. Pataki to use the Virginia-raised money for any political expense he chose, including the costs of pursuing his own Presidential ambitions. Now that he is no longer pursuing that goal, he can use the money for anything else he wants.
But the commitment to state candidates meant that Bell Atlantic's $50,000 in corporate funds helped pay the bills when Peggy Noonan, a speechwriter for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, sat down with Mr. Pataki last winter and discussed several speeches that he wanted to give. She was paid $10,000, and 75 percent of that came through the Virginia PAC.
Similarly, Stephen Moore, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, was paid $15,000 last winter to work with Mr. Pataki on a tax-cutting plan. The Governor finally proposed it at the Detroit Economic Club on June 24, one month after he had abandoned his own Presidential ambitions and endorsed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for the Republican nomination. Of that sum, $11,250 came through the Virginia PAC.
The same formula was used to pay at least $10,115 for the Governor's travel costs, and an additional $2,617 to reimburse his communications director, Zenia Mucha, for travel and telephone expenses.
The Federal PAC's promised contributions to candidates for state office, which opened the door to transferring money from one PAC to another, have not materialized. So far, Mr. Pataki's Federal PAC has given nothing to state candidates. But Adam Stoll, who runs the political action committee in New York City, said both PAC's may "quite possibly" make further donations this year. The Virginia PAC has given $31,600 to nine Republican legislative candidates in Virginia.
Virginia's light regulatory touch has won it the nickname "the Cayman Islands of campaign finance," and Mr. Pataki is hardly the first out-of-state politician to discover its uses. Two Republican Presidential hopefuls, former Vice President Dan Quayle and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, each moved more than a million dollars in the last several months through Virginia PAC's to aid their campaigns. And Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader from Mississippi, has established a PAC, the New Republican Majority Fund, in the state.
Not only are such practices legal in Virginia, they also do not come close to violating Federal election laws, under which "soft money" of the sort collected in Virginia plays an increasing role.
The only illegal contributions shown in the Pataki PAC reports were two contributions of $12,500 each to the Federal PAC in New York City from Reba White Williams, a Republican candidate for the New York City Council, and her husband, David Williams, head of Alliance Capital Management, a mutual funds company. The donations violated the law because they exceeded the $5,000 limit on contributions to Federal PAC's.
But the Pataki camp will hold on to those contributions anyway. Mr. Stoll said those contributions would become legitimate when $7,500 from each of them was transferred from the Federal PAC to the non-Federal PAC in Virginia.
The Virginia PAC also allows Mr. Pataki to skirt New York's regulations, which are much less strict than the Federal ones but still have some limits. In New York, for example, corporations can contribute a total of $5,000 a year to all candidates and committees, with few exceptions.
The records of both political action committees offer a revealing glimpse into the convoluted, loopholed ways of campaign finance regulation, or, in Virginia's case, deregulation.
The Pataki contributions came from a variety of donors: a former Iranian finance minister who became an American citizen; 46 pharmacies in New York that appreciated legislation that Mr. Pataki signed allowing them to keep Medicaid business, and Bell Atlantic, the largest private employer in New York State, whose executives say they think the Governor has done a good job.
Sometimes, a donor is impressed with the recipient, as in the case of Jim Wilkes, a Florida trial lawyer who predicted that Mr. Pataki would be a "very important national figure" and showed great interest in nursing home problems.
Sometimes, Mr. Pataki had stuck by the contributors in their hour of need. Craig Burridge, executive director of the Pharmacists Society of the State of New York, said the Governor was popular with the group's members because he signed legislation on Medicaid business.
So, the 46 pharmacies from Rego Park in Queens to the Adirondacks and their political action committee gave the Virginia PAC $53,950, and at least 4 more pharmacists gave the Federal PAC a total of $2,250.
The Virginia records, not posted electronically like Federal campaign data but available for viewing in a cramped office in Richmond, also show that the non-Federal PAC in Virginia took in nearly two-thirds of the money, or $395,300, and transferred more than half of that, $219,821 to the Federal PAC in New York. It took in all the corporate money, including the $50,000 from Bell Atlantic.
The biggest contributor was Hushang Ansary, a former Iranian finance minister and, as an American citizen, a generous donor to various Republican campaigns. He gave $20,000 himself and an additional $50,000 through the oil equipment company he owns, IRI of Houston.
The Virginia committee also donated the $31,600 to nine Virginia legislative candidates, all of whom face competitive races this fall with both houses of the General Assembly tightly contested between both major parties. The Federal PAC gave $2,000 to former Gov. George F. Allen of Virginia, running for the United States Senate, and $1,000 to Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, who faces a tough race next year.
Those contributions to Federal candidates came in "hard money," the dollars that must be collected in amounts of no more than $5,000 from an individual.
Hard money must also be behind such items as an "in kind" contribution of $5,000 to the Bush for President operation. That represented part of the costs of the event at which Mr. Pataki endorsed Mr. Bush. Because $5,000 is the limit on how much a Federal PAC can give or a campaign may accept, the remaining $9,899 of the event's costs, listed as "lease equipment," was billed to the Bush campaign. Mr. Stoll said the debt had been paid.
While Mr. Ansary and IRI ignored repeated requests for comment, Bell Atlantic was more forthcoming. Explaining the $50,000 corporate donation, Mark Marchand, director of media relations, said Governor Pataki "asked us to contribute to this fund."
He added: "Our feeling is he is a good governor. He has done a good job thus far, cutting taxes and other employment costs. As the state's largest private employer, that's important to us. We support his efforts to rejuvenate the economy and to help like-minded politicians."
Mr. Marchand said the donation had nothing to do with Bell Atlantic's efforts to get New York's Public Service Commission, whose members the Governor appoints, to allow it to enter the long-distance telephone business.
"We're always going to have issues before the regulators," Mr. Marchand said. "This is unconnected to it."
Among the other largest donors to the Virginia and Federal campaigns combined were Bay Networks, a Billerica, Mass., investment company, which gave $35,000; Peter B. Lewis, chairman of the Progressive Insurance Company of Cleveland, $25,000, and Stephen Rosenberg of Greystone & Company, a New York investment banking company, $25,000.
Michael Maher, an Orlando, Fla., lawyer, gave $10,200. Philip Damashek, a New York lawyer, donated $10,000. So did Jo Ann Murphy of Scarsdale, N.Y., who identified her employer as Value Xpress and her occupation as banking.

HEADLINE: Why Should Europe Follow Our Lead?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, Aug. 20) criticizes "rigid" European labor laws for reducing the Continent's productivity relative to the less regulated United States. 
 Economists used to dismiss data showing that productivity growth since World War II has been much faster in Europe than in the United States as evidence only that it is easier to play catch-up than it is to be at the technological forefront. However, recent data show that several European countries, including France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium have matched or even exceeded the United States' productivity levels. Mr. Friedman may not like European-style labor protections and social services, but his argument that they have prevented Europe from matching the United States' level of economic efficiency is unfounded.

HEADLINE: Why Should Europe Follow Our Lead?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman's suggestion (column, Aug. 20) that recent gains in productivity and technology in the United States are a result of weaker unions and the lack of strong labor laws is misleading. 
 Countries like Norway and Sweden, where more than 90 percent of the work force is unionized, have been successful in using and adapting technology without significant layoffs. Their approach has resulted in sustained productivity and competitiveness without the need for layoffs. Does displacing workers in the name of technology really help our communities or corporations in the long run?

HEADLINE: A Domestic Sort With Global Worries

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When President Clinton made a televised address to the nation about Kosovo last March 24, he uttered a sentence for which he was belabored that day and every day for the next 10 weeks, until he finally declared victory on June 10: "I do not intend to put our troops in Kosovo to fight a war."
On May 18, with the outcome of the bombing campaign still in serious doubt, the President sharply altered course with the comment, "I don't think we or our allies should take any options off the table, and that has been my position from the beginning," which of course it had not. 
 It was Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, known as Sandy, who wrote the initial offending sentence. Both he and his boss saw fairly quickly that it was a mistake, because they realized that having plunged into the conflict with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, there was no acceptable alternative to a NATO victory. If ground troops were needed to get the Serbian tanks out of Kosovo, then ground troops it would have to be.
Mr. Milosevic may well have held out longer than he otherwise would have because he believed that he faced no danger of land combat, and he certainly gained time to savage ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and drive them out. Mr. Berger told a friend as early as April that he should have put in something about leaving all options on the table.
He did not do so, Mr. Berger said a few days after the bombing had stopped, because "the American people would not have supported the war without European participation, and we never could have gotten all 19 allies on board at the outset if they thought we had any plan to use ground forces." In keeping with that view, Mr. Clinton cut his rhetorical cloth to fit the politics of both NATO and the United States.
The explosion of criticism crossed party and ideological lines. In an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal, Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser, accused the Administration of indulging in "a new technological racism" based on the premise that the life of "one American serviceman was not worth risking in order to save the lives of thousands of Kosovars." The Economist headlined an editorial, "A Bungled War." Michael Kelly, a columnist, suggested that a ham and cheese sandwich could run foreign policy better than Mr. Berger and his colleagues.
Mr. Berger's place at the nexus of Kosovo strategy was no surprise, nor was his concentration on the political aspects of the matter. Widely regarded as the President's closest foreign-policy aide, perhaps the most influential national security adviser since Henry A. Kissinger, he is at bottom a political rather than strategic figure. Unlike the professors, diplomats and military officers who have for the most part preceded him in his job, he made his way to the White House by way of the salons and back rooms of Democratic politics while pursuing a public career as a trade lawyer.
"He has the lawyer's inherent caution," said John Dyson, a New York investor and political operative who has known Mr. Berger since college. "The craft is a tactical craft. You focus on the downside, always worrying about avoiding negative results."
Beefy and chubby-cheeked at 53, serious and formal in dark suits and white shirts, Mr. Berger makes a sharp contrast to his elfin predecessor, Anthony Lake, whom he served as a deputy during Mr. Clinton's first term. Mr. Lake wore professorial tweeds. He was so seldom seen in public that friends called him "the submarine." But Mr. Berger's is a familiar face on television and on Capitol Hill, where he has built strong links to both parties.
 
The Style
A 15-Hour Day, And a Modest Ego
In the first term, Mr. Lake and the other main foreign-policy figures were older than Mr. Clinton. Now they are contemporaries. Mr. Berger, who has known Mr. Clinton since the McGovern Presidential campaign of 1972, helped him in small but important ways at low points in his career.
He has a closer relationship to the President than Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who is better at formulating policies than in selling them to Mr. Clinton, or Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, a Republican who spent the first Clinton term in the Senate.
It is difficult to find anyone who knows him who does not like Mr. Berger personally. You might as well try to find someone who doesn't like Sara Lee.His ego is of normal dimensions. He buys his reading glasses at the drug store. In a city where backbiting is the preferred contact sport, he is widely considered a gentleman. In a culture of 12-hour-days, he regularly puts in Stakhanovite stints of 15 and 16, fueled by endless glasses of iced coffee, which he took to drinking when he gave up smoking. Colleagues worry that he might fall victim to the same tensions as Leon Fuerth, Vice President Al Gore's foreign-policy counsellor, who suffered a heart attack this year.
But Mr. Berger gets very mixed reviews as a security adviser from those outside his immediate circle. A European ambassador said he lacked "the indispensable ability to see around corners, to anticipate events and to see how one problem relates to another." A friend and sometime Administration colleague said Mr. Berger lacked strategic vision but "wants to be accepted as a kind of Sandy Kissinger."
Mr. Kissinger himself commented rather condescendingly, "you can't expect a trade lawyer to be a global strategist."
Dick Morris, Mr. Clinton's former political guru, wrote recently that "there are hundreds of members of the Council on Foreign Relations who know more about foreign policy than Berger," but he added that Mr. Berger was "just right" for the President's concept of foreign policy which, he said, centers on domestic political and economic considerations, not on strategy.
In his defense Mr. Berger's friends note that Mr. Clinton's attention to events abroad is intermittent. One retired American diplomat blamed "a disastrous Balkan policy in which every aspect has been treated incrementally" mostly on the President. During the Lewinksy matter, a Cabinet member added, "The whole rhythm of the Government was thrown off, because the big guy had something more important on his mind than any foreign-policy crisis -- a 900-pound gorilla that was always in the room with him, named impeachment.
Finally, Mr. Berger has to deal with a world seismically remade by the end of the cold war.
"Everyone wants a new framework for American foreign policy," said Harry McPherson, a Texan who worked in the Johnson White House and has closely watched all the White Houses that followed his. "Well, great. But who has produced one? Sandy's a carpenter, not an architect, like everyone else these days. He's a good one, and that may be the best we can hope for now."
As things turned out in Kosovo, Mr. Milosevic buckled under the pressure of bombardment. But it was "an exceptionally close-run thing," a senior Administration official said, with talks about peace terms taking place at the same time as discussions about sending in the troops if no agreement was reached by the end of June. And the allies were unable, in the end, to prevent the slaughter of many of the Kosovo Albanians they acted to protect.
Mr. Berger said "the President truly believed, as I believed and no more than three other people in America did, that air power would prevail."
But it is not yet clear that the war has been won. It is not clear how many ethnic Albanians will ultimately be able to rebuild their lives, or how successful the NATO alliance will be at achieving the multi-ethnic society it says it wants for Kosovo. There is little prospect of stabilizing the Balkans, an important goal of American policy, without a stable Serbia. Yet that land is in ruins, Mr. Milosevic remains in office and Mr. Clinton has vowed to give only minimal rebuilding aid as long as he clings to power.
 
The Beginnings
Small-Town Kid, Solid Democrat
Mr. Berger grew up in Millerton, a then-isolated rural community of 900 people in the dairy country of Duchess County, N. Y., northeast of Poughkeepsie. His father died when he was only 8, and his mother ran a struggling Army-Navy surplus store. From his mother, he inherited the habit of hard work and a love of order; he still makes lists each Sunday, in his immaculate handwriting, of things to be done the following week.
The Bergers stood apart from the Millerton mainstream, as Democrats in a town where "people gave parties when F.D.R. died," and as Jews in the WASP heartland. Mr. Berger took his religious training from a rabbi in a nearby hospital for the mentally retarded. Young Sandy Berger had another distinguishing feature: he was a fervent Brooklyn Dodger fan in a Yankee town.
"Where I grew up is very important to what I am," he said. "My perspectives are still more Millerton 1960 than Washington 2000. The small-town sense of community and social responsibility -- that's the lasting imprint of Millerton on me."
Mr. Berger likes to tell about visiting an aunt in Brooklyn when he was 10 and sleeping fitfully all night because of the fire and police sirens. When he asked her about them, she answered, "Oh, you get used to it." But when a siren sounded in Millerton, he said, "You knew that you'd know the people whose house was on fire, so you never got used to it."
At Cornell University, his good nature and his organizational ability led him into student politics. As head of the interfraternity council, he came under the sway of an assistant dean, Albert Miles, who interested him in questions of social justice. He asked civil rights leaders like Stokely Carmichael to Cornell to speak, he fought discrimination in the fraternities, closing down one that barred blacks from a party, and he persuaded James Perkins, the university president, to fly to Cornell a group of black schoolchildren from Brooklyn who had created a black history project that no one had come to see. The project was displayed at the Student Union.
Also at Cornell, where he met his wife, Susan, with whom he has lived in the same unpretentious house for 26 years, Mr. Berger encountered an important intellectual mentor, George McT. Kahin, a historian of Southeast Asia. He took the course on Vietnam taught by Professor Kahin, whose books became the testaments of the anti-war movement. His opposition to the war derived from that course, he says today, as does his habit of "questioning everything that I read."
But he never marched against the war, preferring, as he put it, to work within the system, first as a summer intern in Washington for Representative Joseph Resnick, a millionaire television-antenna manufacturer from the Catskills. At Harvard Law School, he volunteered first for Eugene McCarthy, then for Robert F. Kennedy, displaying the kind of pragmatism that sometimes gets him in trouble in his present job with more ideologically rigorous types.
Four years later, on the dovish McGovern campaign, he met a man wearing a Colonel Sanders white suit, Bill Clinton, and the two quickly became buddies. Senator McGovern's ignominious defeat is regarded by most politicians as an instructive example of what happens when a candidate totally loses touch with an electorate, but Mr. Berger views him as an "inspiring" leader, describing the 1972 fiasco as the result of tactical errors.
The dovish theme continued at Hogan & Hartson, one of Washington's premier law firms, where Mr. Berger, who represented Japanese and other clients, talked often with the firm's most eminent figure, former Senator J. William Fulbright, the godfather of the anti-war movement. When he went into the State Department in the Carter Administration, he fought in the trenches alongside the dovish Secretary, Cyrus Vance, against the more hawkish national security adviser, Mr. Brzezinski, and resolved to do all he could to avoid such fights if he ever found himself in a position of real power.
However much he may have hated the Vietnam War, along with most of his peers, Mr. Berger is in essence a consensus-seeker and a deal-cutter, and work as a trade lawyer strengthened those tendencies. His contacts with Asia gave him a profound belief in free trade as a means of knitting the world together - a view that would color his subsequent attitudes toward China, the issue on which he has probably spent more time than any other in the White House.
 
The White House
A Friend of Bill's Who Never Left
Except for the Carter Administration, the years from 1968 to 1992 were Republican years, but Mr. Berger found ways to keep a political oar in. He formed an important alliance with Pamela Harriman, the Washington social doyenne, writing speeches for her to give her the cloak of political gravitas she longed for, and benefiting, in turn, from her wealth and connections.
One button on Mrs. Harriman's telephone in her elegant Georgetown residence was marked "Sandy."
When Mr. Clinton lost a re-election bid in 1980, he persuaded Mrs. Harriman to put the young ex-Governor on the board of her political action committee, which came to be a major fund-raising arm of the Democratic Party. That gave Mr. Clinton a reason to come to Washington to schmooze. Eight years later, when Mr. Clinton muffed a big chance, delivering an agonizingly boring speech at the party convention in Atlanta, the Berger-Harriman team stepped in again, organizing a midnight dinner to pick up the Clintons' spirits.
When Mr. Clinton ran in 1992, Mr. Berger joined him as a senior foreign-policy adviser. When he won, Mr. Berger helped persuade him to send Mrs. Harriman to Paris as Ambassador. Mr. Berger was offered the national security adviser's job but demurred on the grounds of limited experience, suggesting Mr. Lake instead. Mr. Berger became Mr. Lake's deputy.
But during Mr. Clinton's first term, says a person who held a senior position during that period, "everyone with a problem in the security area went to Sandy -- honest, helpful Sandy, who never lied -- and he built up a tremendous amount of credibility that helped him enormously once he took over." He has worked hard to maintain his network, talking by telephone as many as a dozen times a day with Ms. Albright, meeting once a week for breakfast with her and other security "principals" like George J. Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, and visiting Capitol Hill often.
Senior officials in the State Department and the Defense Department praise Mr. Berger's trustworthiness and his ability to run meetings, though some of the generals and admirals are not entirely comfortable with him or any of the old anti-war crowd and their brand of cautious interventionism.
The bonds of friendship between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Berger -- one of the few who has served the entire two terms at the White House under four chiefs of staff -- have held, even in bad times, such as the town meeting on Iraq in Columbus, Ohio, in May of last year, conceived in Mr. Berger's office, which ended with Mr. Cohen and Ms. Albright being shouted down. Mr. Berger himself describes the event as "a complete fiasco."
Nor is there any sign that Mr. Berger's standing with the President has slipped because of the Administration's difficulties with China, the country with which he is most closely identified. It is the country whose development, he once said, "will have the biggest impact on our children."
To shape that development, Mr. Berger has championed a policy of engagement, in which the United States has tried to bind China to the United States through economic and security arrangements. But a lot of things have gone wrong lately, from illicit Chinese campaign contributions to the Democrats to the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
Mr. Berger's biggest setback on the China front came when he was unable to persuade President Clinton in April to sign a trade deal during Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's visit to the White House. Despite his clout with Mr. Clinton, he was outflanked on this occasion by John S. Podesta, the White House chief of staff. Mr. Podesta had the foresight to win the backing of a man even more influential than Mr. Berger, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and they persuaded the President to hold out for more concessions to placate Congress. Despite efforts to regroup, no treaty has been signed yet.
Even worse for Mr. Berger personally were charges that he reacted too passively when told about the suspected Chinese theft of nuclear secrets. He insists that he acted properly when told of the charges, even though he briefed Mr. Clinton only very tardily, after March of this year, on detailed charges that Mr. Berger had learned of in July, 1997. Asked if he felt that he had dropped the ball in any way, either in terms of substance or in terms of appearances, he replied, cold-eyed, "No."
Mr. Berger's cherished reputation on the Hill has nonetheless taken a hit, with several influential members of Congress calling for his resignation. These calls have subsided, but he remains "very exposed and very vulnerable on this," according to a government China specialist who admires him.
"He is the best link we have with China," the specialist said. "But he is viewed by our critics as someone who cares more about China than the United States, and that limits his ability to take initiatives with China. You need to explain the bombing, but you can't send Sandy to Beijing."
There is also an inescapable sense that the Administration makes policy on the fly.
Michael McCurry, a former White House press secretary, concedes that "we don't have a new definition of the U. S. role in the world yet." In some moods, Mr. Berger sounds as if that's fine with him. In 1991, he said during a panel discussion that most "grand strategies" were after-the-fact rationales developed to explain successful ad hoc decisions.
He said in a recent conversation that he prefers to "worry about today today and tomorrow tomorrow."

Mr. Berger's biggest setback on the China front came when he was unable to persuade President Clinton in April to sign a trade deal during Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's visit to the White House. Despite his clout with Mr. Clinton, he was outflanked on this occasion by John S. Podesta, the White House chief of staff. Mr. Podesta had the foresight to win the backing of a man even more influential than Mr. Berger, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and they persuaded the President to hold out for more concessions to placate Congress. Despite efforts to regroup, no treaty has been signed yet.
Even worse for Mr. Berger personally were charges that he reacted too passively when told about the suspected Chinese theft of nuclear secrets. He insists that he acted properly when told of the charges, even though he briefed Mr. Clinton only very tardily, after March of this year, on detailed charges that Mr. Berger had learned of in July, 1997. Asked if he felt that he had dropped the ball in any way, either in terms of substance or in terms of appearances, he replied, cold-eyed, "No."
Mr. Berger's cherished reputation on the Hill has nonetheless taken a hit, with several influential members of Congress calling for his resignation. These calls have subsided, but he remains "very exposed and very vulnerable on this," according to a government China specialist who admires him.
"He is the best link we have with China," the specialist said. "But he is viewed by our critics as someone who cares more about China than the United States, and that limits his ability to take initiatives with China. You need to explain the bombing, but you can't send Sandy to Beijing."
There is also an inescapable sense that the Administration makes policy on the fly.
Michael McCurry, a former White House press secretary, concedes that "we don't have a new definition of the U. S. role in the world yet." In some moods, Mr. Berger sounds as if that's fine with him. In 1991, he said during a panel discussion that most "grand strategies" were after-the-fact rationales developed to explain successful ad hoc decisions.
He said in a recent conversation that he prefers to "worry about today today and tomorrow tomorrow."

 CORRECTION:
A profile on Aug. 25 about Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, referred incompletely to the context of a comment he made in 1991 that "grand strategies" were mostly rationales developed after the fact to explain successful ad hoc decisions. Mr. Berger made that remark at a panel discussion in which he talked about the 10 years in which he was developing an international law practice for his firm, Hogan & Hartson. After the article appeared, his office said his comment applied only to the specific work of putting together a law practice and not to his vision of American foreign policy in his current job.

HEADLINE: Following the Money, Through the Web

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
WITH the 2000 Presidential race cranking up especially early, the denizens of that fabled ZIP code, 90210, are beginning to do what they do best in every election cycle: dust off their checkbooks and let their money fly.
If money is the mother's milk of politics, then 90210 is one of the biggest cash cows around. That Beverly Hills ZIP code gave more to Federal candidates last year than any other in California, by a long shot, and more than most other ZIP codes in the country. This year, the rich and famous are starting early: Candice Bergen has given the Gore campaign $1,000, Rob Reiner kicked in $2,000, Jack Nicholson gave $250 and Hugh Hefner $1,000. 
 Barbra Streisand, one of 90210's biggest givers in 1998, with more than $38,000 in donations, has also given Al Gore $1,000 this year, though she has since switched her address to Santa Monica (90401). Warren Beatty, a 90210 resident who says some people are urging him to run for President himself, has given nothing to anyone -- perhaps deciding to save his money for his own bid.
Where does this information come from? The Web, of course, where technology is shedding new light on political contributions. Once hidden in dusty archives and often kept in hard-to-find spots that politicians did not make any easier to locate, campaign finance records on the state and national levels are now available on a growing number of user-friendly Web sites.
And, of course, it is not just the rich and famous whose donations can be tracked but everyone's -- even yours and your next-door neighbor's. All campaign donations are considered public information, and the records are readily available for public view.
This technological development is adding a new dimension to political discourse. Where political races once focused primarily on personalities, partisanship and issues, an awareness of -- and concern over -- the role of money in politics has grown. In large part, technology is driving and accelerating the debate by providing more and more information.
Hardly anyone knew who gave money to Franklin D. Roosevelt or Dwight D. Eisenhower or Harry S. Truman. But that ignorance -- which was sometimes the result of political calculation -- has been replaced by a new transparency.
The Internet is making it easy for journalists, competing candidates and ordinary citizens to connect the dots between politicians and their sources of money. And that has come about despite efforts by many in Congress to keep the activities of the Federal Election Commission, the Government agency that collects much of this data, to a bare minimum.
"Now people can sit at their terminal and pull up all this information," said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington policy research group. "For the Presidential race, you don't have to leave your work station, and this means the barriers to getting this information have been substantially removed. This is an extraordinary development. Anyone, anywhere in America, can click onto one of these Web sites and see who is behind their lawmaker. And they couldn't five years ago."
"I don't want to sound pie-in-the-sky," continued Mr. Lewis, whose group has state-level campaign finance information on its Web site, www.publicintegrity.org. "But this brings democracy and accountability much closer to the average citizen. Frankly, it's wonderful."
To some, however, it is not so wonderful. As the availability of financial records has grown, so have attempts to evade disclosure. In the last few years, independent advocacy groups have cropped up to to sponsor televised political attack ads that are not connected with any candidate or party. These groups enjoy legal protections that allow them to stay out of Government records and spread their money in secrecy.
"One of the unintended effects of this new visibility is a growth in some of these subterranean activities," said Kenneth Gross, a Washington lawyer who specializes in election law.
Right now, there are around a half-dozen campaign finance Web sites, each offering slightly different information or different ways to connect candidates and dollars.
Some sites focus on the relationship between campaign donations and votes on Capitol Hill. Others provide information on every shred of campaign finance data filed with the Government, including copies of the often-obscure filings. Still others focus on candidates at the state level.
Ground zero for all this information is the Federal Election Commission. Each Federal candidate and party must provide filings with the commission on how much money is raised, who donated it and how the money is spent.
For decades, the information was stored on paper in one spot in Washington or on computers that required a trip to the commission's offices to use. But in the 1996 elections, the commission began putting much of the information on line, though the site was not easy to use then.
Campaign finance rules adopted after Watergate limit individual contributions to $25,000 a year. They permit individuals to give no more than $20,000 to a national party, $5,000 to a political action committee and $2,000 to a candidate -- up to $1,000 for the primary and $1,000 for the general election. Corporations and unions are prohibited from donating to Federal candidates.
Those restricted contributions are often called hard money. By contrast, soft money is the name often given to what individuals, unions and corporations can give in unlimited amounts to national party committees for "party-building" activities. While ostensibly earmarked for generic activities like voter-education programs, soft money has become a way for big donations to go almost directly to candidates.
Whether hard or soft, all donations must be reported to the elections commission.
At www.fec.gov, everything anyone could possibly want to know about Federal election rules and donations is available. And, borrowing some of the user-friendly techniques of campaign finance Web sites run by public policy groups, the commission has made its site much easier to navigate. It is now easy for anyone to punch in a person's name under the View Contributions category on the home page (try William Gates, for instance) and see their donations.
The site lets a person view the actual documents filed by the candidates (for instance, the page listing Mr. Gates's $3,000 donation to the Republican Majority Fund, a political action committee, in which Mr. Gates describes his occupation as "C.E.O."). And, unlike on other Web sites, all spending data and every document filed by candidates and political committees with the Government can be seen.
"We always thought of ourselves as being responsible for providing the basic raw material at this Web site," said Robert Biersack, the site's Webmaster. "We also want to provide a very close, visible connection to the original source document. The connection between computer data and the original document is very important to us."
"What's also new is the way our data interrelates," Mr. Biersack added. "You can go to a candidate's filings and then find out who else is giving to that candidate or committee in a stream-of-consciousness way."
The granddaddy of all independent campaign finance Web sites, and perhaps the most comprehensive, is www.tray.com, which was set up in 1996 by two former Federal Election Commission employees who formed a Washington research firm called Public Disclosure Inc.
Their site takes often-fragmented commission data and organizes the information into an accessible, logical and simple-to-use format. Whether it's following individual donations, looking at the Clinton legal defense fund, tracking the 2000 Federal candidates or exploring soft money donations, the site is a one-stop shopping center for campaign finance data.
For instance, in the section about the 2000 Presidential race, a search for information about Dan Quayle shows not only donations, but also transfers to his campaign from party committees as well as all his disbursements and the locations of all his contributors. The contributor list can also be sorted by employer and occupation.
The page on Senator Phil Gramm Republican of Texas, shows donations back to 1980 and links to political action committees that have given to Mr. Gramm, the Texas Republican. It also includes money he has given to other candidates and his personal financial statement.
"We're interested in putting this information out without any spin," said Tony Raymond, who founded the site with a former commission official, Kent Cooper, "because we feel the dollars speak for themselves."
Mr. Raymond said the site was averaging around 7,000 to 12,000 visits a day early this summer, a number that he said would "go through the roof" when the 2000 election got into full swing later this year.
At the Web site for the Center for Responsive Politics (www.opensecrets.org), the emphasis is on the correlation between contributions and votes in Congress.
The site has easy-to-read reports on different industry groups and which candidates got their contributions. And its candidate profiles are comprehensive, showing raw data for who gave money as well as data for industry groups, presented with colorful graphs and charts.
The site shows, for instance, that George W. Bush, the Republican Presidential hopeful, is getting more money from every sector of the economy -- except labor unions and lawyers -- than any other candidate, including Vice President Al Gore. While Mr. Bush has received more than $1 million from the oil and gas industry, Mr. Gore has received $56,700; while the health care industry has given Mr. Bush more than $1 million, Mr. Gore has received $340,000.
"We are building a sandbox for people to play in," said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. "We want people to grasp things easily. That's why we use lots of charts. We want people to see what they got from their candidates from all this money spent. After any vote in Congress, we want people to know whether money bought something or failed to buy something."
Has all this disclosure and potential public scrutiny made some donors squeamish? The answer is: sort of.
And one side of politics that often does not show up on campaign finance sites involves issue advocacy groups. In the last Presidential election, such groups poured millions of dollars into television advertisements attacking candidates or praising them -- but without expressly advocating a candidate's election or defeat. Because the groups operate independently of the candidates and their ads do not contain the words "vote for" or "vote against," the law does not require that they register with the F.E.C. or list their donors.
"I suspect that all this Internet data is leading to some of the current pressure to move donations off the radar screen," said Trevor Potter, a Washington lawyer and former Federal Election Commissioner. "A lot of people who didn't want their activities disclosed in the first place are more threatened and trying more vigorously to avoid that spotlight."

HEADLINE: In America;
A Nation Losing Its Citizens

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
In the bitter cold of a January day in 1961, with snow on the ground and a crystalline sky overhead, a day on which the world's most powerful men were dressed in morning coats and top hats, a young President declared that the "torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans," and he urged his fellow citizens, the young in particular, to join with him in the great work of the nation.
You could still talk like that in 1961. Idealism had not yet suffered the near-fatal wounds of the decades that followed. An awful lot of people, young and old, found themselves responding as John F. Kennedy said, "With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own." 
 "John Kennedy drew a whole generation to public service," said Patricia McGinnis, who heads the Council for Excellence in Government, a nonpartisan group in Washington that works to improve the quality of government and the relationship between government and the people it serves.
"President Kennedy encouraged people to participate, and I think that was his greatest legacy," she said. "Where is that leadership now?"
A national poll sponsored by the council and released last month found that a large majority of Americans now feel disconnected from government. And in what appears to be an ominous trend, it's the younger Americans who feel the most estranged.
The poll was conducted by Democratic pollster Peter Hart and Republican pollster Robert Teeter. It found that more than twice as many Americans (64 percent) feel "distant and disconnected" from government than feel "close and connected" (30 percent).
Americans for the most part view government, especially the Federal Government, as remote and far more responsive to special interests than to the public interest. And the scandals that have erupted around one top official after another -- from Watergate to Monicagate and beyond -- have further turned people off.
Said Mr. Hart: "Voters see all of the transgressions or supposed transgressions going on in political life and they say, 'Why should I participate?' "
What is most pronounced in the poll is the degree to which younger Americans feel out of touch with the government. A report that accompanied the poll said, " The gulf between the citizens and their government grows larger with each successive generation."
In the lowest age group surveyed, 18 to 34 years old, 68 percent of the respondents said they felt disconnected from government.
The authors warned: "If each new generation continued to form a weaker attachment to government than the one before, the country would fairly soon find that only a small minority of citizens was connected to and involved with government."
The report is titled "America Unplugged -- Citizens and Their Government." It found that a majority of Americans tend to think in terms of the government as opposed to our government, and said: "To talk about government as "ours" is to state -- even if unconsciously -- a sense of ownership, and perhaps also a sense of belonging or involvement. People who think in terms of the government, by contrast, are revealing their feeling that government is not accountable to them."
Over several decades in this century Americans were drawn into closer contact with the government, and to a certain extent each other, by major crises, including two world wars and a Depression.
"Government was very important to people," said Mr. Teeter. "Almost anything people wanted, whether it was the civil rights movement or the environmental movement or whatever, government was what they turned to as the vehicle to do it."
There is no sense of crisis at the moment. The economy is humming, the stock markets are high and inflation is low. But there is more to the life of a great nation than the bottom line. We have shown that we can be prosperous, but it's hard to imagine how we can be better without more citizen involvement in what John Kennedy saw as a great and joint endeavor.

HEADLINE: U.S. Lawmaker Faults Japan for Halting Food to North Korea

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 25

 BODY:
A United States Congressman sharply criticized Japan today for cutting off food aid to famine-stricken North Korea as millions of tons of surplus rice are sitting in Japanese warehouses.
The Congressman, Tony P. Hall, a Democrat from Ohio who has a long history of fighting world hunger, passed through Tokyo today on his way to North Korea, where he plans to begin an unofficial visit on Thursday to survey the famine situation and deliver medicine donated by United States religious groups. 
 "North Korea has sent out an S O S that it can't feed its people, and Japan, the world's largest donor, is ignoring that cry for help because of political reasons," Mr. Hall said in a meeting with reporters. "The Japanese are sitting on a tremendous amount of food which they are using as a weapon while millions of people are starving."
Mr. Hall said that Japan had stockpiled between three million tons and five million tons of rice after having a bumper crop. He suggested that Japan sell the rice surpluses at "friendship prices" to international aid organizations.
"Humanitarian aid should be given in an unconditional way," Mr. Hall said. "If any of you have seen people starve to death, you'll never forget it."
The Japanese Government ended its relief aid to North Korea last August after North Korea test-fired a medium-range ballistic missile that flew over the Japanese mainland and into the Pacific Ocean. A spokesman for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Japan had no plans to resume food aid to North Korea.
"We are waiting for a constructive signal coming from North Korea to improve the bilateral relationship," said Akitaka Saiki, a deputy press secretary. "So far, that signal has not come from the North Korean capital."
Before the 1998 missile launching, Japan supplied North Korea with 500,000 pounds of rice and a $500,000 contribution to United Nations aid organizations in 1995; $6 million to international aid agencies like the World Food Program in 1996; and $27 million to the food program and $841,389 in medical assistance to the International Red Cross in 1997, according to the Foreign Ministry.
An official of the Agriculture Ministry, who requested anonymity, said that bumper crops during the last four years had allowed Japan to stockpile almost three million tons of rice. The official said the ministry planned to reduce those reserves to about two million tons of rice by the end of this year through crop reduction.
The official said that such large surpluses of rice are not necessarily available for donation, as Japan often uses them to offset shortages.
Mr. Hall's comments on aid echo those of Catherine Bertini, executive director of the United Nations World Food Program, who after a recent trip to North Korea said that there were signs the famine situation was improving but that people were still starving and that more aid was needed. Ms. Bertini called on the United States, Japan and other countries not to end their aid to North Korea, even if it launches another missile.
Some experts have estimated that between two million and three million people, mainly old people and children, died during the worst years of the famine, from 1995 to 1998.
While Mr. Hall was critical of Japan, he also had strong words for North Korea. He said that he would use his fifth visit to the Communist-run country to warn officials that if they proceeded with plans to test-fire a new long-range missile their country would suffer dire consequences.
"My message to North Korean officials will be very simple," Mr. Hall said. "Don't fire the missile. You'll be really, really hurting yourself if you do."
The United States, which Mr. Hall said supplied 83 percent of all aid to North Korea last year, has threatened to end its assistance if the missile is fired. South Korea said it would end its agriculture and economic development programs to the North, while Japan has threatened to cut off the flow of financial remittances from North Koreans living in Japan.
Mr. Hall said he was convinced that if North Korea proceeded with the missile launching, the Republican-controlled Congress would suspend all United States aid to the country. "The votes are already there and I'm afraid there wouldn't be much we could do to stop it," he said.
The Congressman said that on his last visit to North Korea, last year, he saw North Korean children with patchy hair, protruding bones, open sores, and other signs of severe malnutrition.
He said the Government was distributing what officials there called "substitute food" -- dried leaves and straw, so coarse that even cattle would not eat it.
Mr. Hall said that medicine and medical supplies were so scarce in North Korea that many operations are conducted without electric lights or anesthesia and that gauze and cotton balls are washed and reused.

HEADLINE: What the Apollo Means for Harlem

 BODY:
Harlem was once the center of life for the African-American middle class and a storied gathering place for artists, writers and musicians. Middle-class flight, business closings and the urban disorders of the 1960's robbed the district of its grandeur and have presented a formidable challenge to private entrepreneurs and government agencies that have been striving to restore Harlem as a desirable place to live and work in Manhattan.
No institution personifies Harlem's problems -- or its promise -- more clearly than the Apollo Theater, a music venue whose name is recognized around the world but whose management has consistently failed to maximize the theater's value or keep it in good working order. In addition, the board that now runs the theater has been sued by the State Attorney General, who has accused it of questionable fiscal practices over a period of several years. 
 The theater is owned by the state but operated by the nonprofit Apollo Theater Foundation. The suit accused the foundation's board of failing to collect millions of dollars owed it by Percy Sutton, a businessman and former Manhattan Borough President, whose company produces a weekly variety program for television at the theater.
The Attorney General, Eliot Spitzer, has offered the Apollo a chance at commercial success -- and a way out of legal trouble -- saying he will drop the lawsuit if the foundation's board yields control to the entertainment giant Time Warner. The agreement requires Mr. Sutton and associates to pay the foundation about $700,000 and stipulates that the foundation expand its board, giving Time Warner power to appoint the majority of the members. Charles Rangel, Harlem's Democratic Congressman, would also be required to step down as the board's chairman.
Last week the relevant parties seemed to have agreed on a settlement that would bring the theater a fresh infusion of both cash and talent and get Mr. Spitzer to put aside the suit. But the settlement was derailed by some of the board's more powerful members. As the current chairman, Mr. Rangel has a special responsibility to put aside political gamesmanship and sign this agreement promptly. Time Warner has threatened to abandon the deal if there are more shenanigans.
If the settlement goes through smoothly, Harlem's commercial area could get a boost that might entice other companies to follow Time Warner's lead. But if the board drags its feet or the deal falls through, the negative fallout could harm both the Apollo and the prospects for an economic recovery along Harlem's business strip, 125th Street. Put another way, the deal sets the tone for the entire revitalization effort.

HEADLINE: Gore Cultivates the Idea of Change

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Tucked into Vice President Al Gore's stump speech these days is the germ of an idea that his aides say will grow into a full-blown campaign theme in the months ahead: that Mr. Gore will be the steward of change as the world hurtles into the next millennium.
In a way, he is trying to redefine the political use of the word change. While he wants to convey that a Gore Administration would be a change from the Clinton Administration, Mr. Gore also seeks to reassure people that he stands for stability and will carry the successes of the Clinton years into a world that is anxious about how rapidly it is changing. 
 These are somewhat conflicting messages. On the one hand is a desire for a break from the status quo, while on the other is a sense that the nation needs someone who can provide continuity and reassurance.
A top Gore strategist explained the campaign's thinking this way: "In 1992, there was a classic desire for change," he said. "It was focused around economic issues and health care. In 1999 it's different. People understand they are living in a period of profound change. Working families don't get up saying, 'Am I going to lose my job?' They are saying, 'Is my kid going to be safe at school?' There is a whole host of livability issues that the press laughs at but I can assure you are pretty profound issues for people. We are beginning to bring a coherent theme to them."
In a sense, all candidates promise change and want to represent it, if only because voters eventually tire of the status quo and want something fresh and different.
This is what led Ronald Reagan to declare, somewhat improbably, "We are the change," when he spoke on behalf of his Vice President, George Bush, at the 1988 Republican convention. Mr. Reagan at the time was concluding eight years in the Oval Office.
In 1992, the Clinton-Gore ticket offered itself as the "agent of change," breaking with the Bush Administration. But that was a different kind of change from what Mr. Gore is talking about as he competes for the Democratic Presidential nomination against former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who has many positions similar to Mr. Gore's, and against a raft of Republicans, most of whom are painting Mr. Gore as the status quo that needs to be upended.
In fact, one goal of the Gore campaign theme, said Stephen Hess, a Presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution, is to pre-empt other candidates from using the slogan of change. "Before the Republicans stand for change, Gore wants to make it his very own," he said.
So far, Mr. Gore speaks of change in only the vaguest terms.
"At a time when the world is going through a more rapid and tumultuous period of change than ever in human history, as Americans, we have to provide leadership," he told a small group of Democratic donors in Washington the other night.
He added: "Change is always resisted. And we have been bringing change. The question is whether or not that change will continue, whether or not the prosperity will continue, whether or not we'll use it to make sure that no one is left behind. That's what I stand for."
To underscore to his listeners that he is prepared to lead the world into a new dimension beyond the Clinton years, Mr. Gore asserted: "We've built a foundation. Now it's time to reach for the stars."
Mr. Clinton is a complicit partner in the message of change, just as audaciously as Mr. Reagan was in 1988.
"The issue in this election will not be whether we should vote for change or not," Mr. Clinton told the same audience as he introduced Mr. Gore. "The issue is what kind of change we'll vote for. We're living in an inherently dynamic time."
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster and adviser to the Gore campaign, said Mr. Gore wanted to convey confidence to voters who feel an underlying anxiety about school violence, keeping up with technology and remaining prosperous.
"People recognize that the world is changing at a faster pace than ever before, and they want a President who is going to help make the future work for them," Mr. Mellman said. "In focus groups, people talk about education and not being able to do the things that their kids can do on computers and fitting into the new economy and all these issues in medicine -- genetic testing and genetically modified food and the right to die. Their moorings have been loosened a bit."
Mr. Hess said that beyond the tactical goal the Gore campaign was trying to accomplish several tasks with the word change. One is to assuage a natural fear about change. Another is to jazz up Mr. Gore's image because change is a word that conveys "excitement."
"Change in a political context is usually identified with reform, so there is a subliminal message that they aren't just stuck in the mud," Mr. Hess said. "They're also trying to sort out how Gore can take credit for what's been, take advantage of the President's strengths and differentiate himself enough so that he has his own persona."
As for pre-empting his rivals with the change slogan, so far it does not seem to have worked too well. Gov. George W. Bush, the Texas Republican whose candidacy represents an inherent change from Mr. Clinton, has been leading Mr. Gore in the polls for six months.
Mr. Bradley likes to put forward the notion that he is the one who offers a "fresh start." Anita Dunn, a top adviser to Mr. Bradley, said the desire for change would be "one of the major factors in this election, and a vice president is de facto the candidate of the status quo."
Though Mr. Gore leads Mr. Bradley among Democrats, he still has had obvious difficulty in separating himself from Mr. Clinton. Earlier this year, he toyed with the idea of change as a natural break in the calendar, an epochal divide that necessarily would leave President Clinton (and his scandals) in the past and allow Mr. Gore to proceed unencumbered.
"It's not only the beginning of a new century and a new millennium," Mr. Gore said in March. "It's the beginning of a whole new era in human history." This, he said, posed a new set of challenges and new solutions.
But some aides thought this was too elliptical, and Mr. Gore dropped that formulation. In June he called Mr. Clinton's extramarital behavior inexcusable and said he would bring his own values to the Oval Office, a split that some Democrats, including those in the White House, found too stark and that Mr. Gore's staff said news organizations "overinterpreted."
Mr. Gore talks less now of separation from Mr. Clinton and more of a sense of continuity. "We know the policies that work, and we know how they can be applied to the brand new circumstances and the brand new problems that will confront us at the beginning of the new century," Mr. Gore said last week. He specifically mentioned balancing the budget, overhauling the Government's regulatory structure, opening new markets and investing in education.
Education is one of the top concerns of voters, and Mr. Gore is so adamant about offering changes in public education that he describes his approach as "revolutionary." This usually leaves his audiences a little puzzled, because he talks about reducing class size by adding teachers and connecting classrooms to the Internet, efforts already under way.
In his stump speech, Mr. Gore injects a note of uncertainty about the future, which may reflect his vacillating relationship with Mr. Clinton. He has taken to quoting the Spanish poet Antonio Machado, saying: "Traveler, there is no path. You make your path as you travel."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Gains 42.74 Points For Another Record High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stock prices moved up yesterday, carrying the Dow Jones industrial average to a new closing high, as investors grew more confident that the latest interest rate increase would enable the economy to grow without runaway inflation.
The Dow advanced 42.74 points, to 11,326.04, topping its previous record close of 11,299.76 set on Monday. 
 Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 18.29 points, to 1,381.79, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 53.23, to 2,805.60. The Nasdaq, which lists many of the nation's leading technology companies, notched its fourth consecutive increase and is edging back toward its July 16 record close of 2,864.48.
Bond prices, which rose after the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates, propelled stocks higher yesterday. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.86 percent, its lowest level in almost three months, making bonds a less attractive alternative to stocks. Bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction.
"People were looking for an excuse to buy, and the Fed provided it," said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott & Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond, referring to the quarter-point rate increase announced by the Fed on Tuesday.
Technology stocks rose most sharply as investors bet that those companies would continue to grow, with interest rates stable. Microsoft extended a string of recent gains, rising 3 1/8, to 955/16 . Amazon.com jumped 12 13/16, to 132 7/8, and America Online rose 4 3/8, to 103 1/8.
Many of those shares faltered earlier this summer amid the threat of rising interest rates. Investors buy those stocks on the promise of strong future earnings, and high rates can hurt profits by making it more expensive to borrow to finance growth.
Now, investors are back looking for value in the Internet sector.
"At their current levels, they look like bargains to some people," Mr. Dickson said.
Bank stocks, which should benefit from good news on interest rates, dropped after Bank One warned on Tuesday that 1999 profits would fall short of Wall Street's expectations, largely because of slower growth in its credit card business.
The Chicago-based bank's stock plunged 12 5/8, to 43, and dragged other financial-services stocks down with it. Chase Manhattan fell 1 1/16, to 85 1/2.
But a wide range of Dow components gained ground. AT&T rose 2 5/8, to 49 1/4; General Electric increased 2 11/16, to 11 95/16, and Johnson & Johnson gained 2 9/16, to 105 3/4.
While many analysts said the Fed's announcement enabled stocks to make further gains, Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at Warburg Dillon Read, said investors were likely to continue their watch for signs of inflation that could prompt the Fed to raise rates again.
"Soon the markets will refocus on economic announcements for direction," she said, noting that the next employment report, expected on Sept. 3, would indicate whether labor costs are escalating sharply.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,607 to 1,429 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 864.7 million shares, up from 719 million in the previous session.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Production Rose 3.3% in July

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Orders to United States factories jumped 3.3 percent in July, but analysts said the sharp increase did not suggest inflationary pressures of the kind that Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve moved to head off earlier this week.
The rise in production of such durable goods as cars, airplanes and computers, reported by the Department of Commerce, was offset by a drop of 3.9 percent in the sale of existing houses. 
 While the drop in housing sales, reported by the National Association of Realtors, tells only part of the story because residential real estate represents a much smaller portion of the economy than does manufacturing, analysts said yesterday that several other factors left them optimistic.
Arguing against the idea of significant new pressures on inflation, for example, Chris Varvares, the president of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis, noted that the rise in orders for factory goods was coming as the overall economic growth rate appeared to be moderating.
"The 3.3 percent rise is not particularly worrisome with respect to prospects for inflation," Mr. Varvares said.
Clearly delighted by the July figures, David Huether, the director of economic analysis at the National Association of Manufacturers, said that orders fluctuated considerably from month to month. "Next month," he said, "I would say it's probably going to cool down to 1.5 percent or so."
The trend in recent months has been good for the manufacturers. "The main thing here, is that manufacturing is coming back," said David Wyss, the chief economist at Standard & Poor's DRI in Boston. "Manufacturing has been soft most of the last year, but we've been seeing it pick up."
Mr. Huether said he believed that many of the new orders were coming from American business. But the Standard & Poor's economist, Mr. Wyss, said he believed at least part of the upturn reflected the economic recovery under way in Asia.
Mr. Wyss said that while rising orders could force manufacturers to hire more workers in an already tight employment market, with a potential inflationary push, American manufacturers' pricing has been restrained by increased exports from Asia.
"They're in a recession in Asia, and they've got supply coming out their ears," Mr. Wyss said. "Our manufacturers can't push up prices or the imports will take over."
Mr. Huether said that much of the long-term growth in manufacturing had been in the computer industry. Computers have led to increased productivity, he said, and that has offset rising wages as a check on inflation.
On Tuesday, brushing aside arguments from farmers, labor unions, some political leaders and manufacturers that there was no inflation to fight, the Federal Reserve, led by Mr. Greenspan, raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, the second increase in less than two months. The Fed raised the main rate it controls, the Federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks, to 5.25 percent from 5 percent. It also raised its more symbolic discount rate, on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system, to 4.75 percent from 4.5 percent.
Banks quickly raised their prime lending rate to 8.25 percent from 8 percent, a step that will lead to higher rates on some consumer and small business loans.
The rate increase earlier this year and the anticipation of the rise this week played a role in the decline in existing housing sales, the analysts said. Rates for mortgages just before the Fed's most recent action, for example, had risen to a little more than 8 percent, up from just under 7 percent a year ago.
"You are beginning to see higher interest rates beginning to slow demand in the most interest-sensitive sectors like housing," Mr. Wyss said, "which is what the Fed has been hoping for."

HEADLINE: Insurer Is Said To Seek a Deal

BYLINE: ByBloomberg News

 BODY:
Metropolitan Life Insurance, the No. 2 United States life insurer, is reported to be in talks to buy the General American Life Insurance Company for $1.2 billion. Such a move could mean that customers would be repaid as much as $6.8 billion they have demanded from General American.
It is believed that Met Life would complete the transaction by buying the Genamerica Corporation, which controls General American Life. Met Life, of New York, would take responsibility for repaying General American clients. 
 The St. Louis-based General American has been looking for a buyer for the last two weeks, since money market funds sought repayment of short-term investments and the insurer was unable to sell assets fast enough to meet demand.
The company's problems began after it doubled the assets it had tied up in short-term investment contracts called funding agreements. General American, along with the ARM Financial Group, had jointly sold the agreements for six years, offering interest rates higher than comparable investments. They profited by reinvesting the money in securities that paid higher rates.
This arrangement crumbled when falling bond prices and a weak market for asset-backed securities led to a decline in the value of the assets backing the investments.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Shares Plunge At Bank One Over Earnings

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Shares of Bank One, the Chicago-based banking giant, plunged 23 percent yesterday after the company stunned the financial community with its warning late Tuesday that intense competition in the credit card business would cause profits to fall short of expectations.
Wall Street analysts flocked to reduce their ratings on the bank, the nation's fifth largest, and shares of other major card issuers were caught in the downdraft, although some later recovered a good portion of their losses. 
 "Bank One's announcement raises concerns about the overall health of the card industry," said Jeffrey Evanson, banking analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. Visibility of earnings growth, he concluded, has become questionable.
The Metris Companies lost $4.25, to close at $31; Providian Financial fell $3.9375, to $87.50, and Capital One Financial gave up $3.3125, to $43.375. American Express skidded more than $5.50 but climbed back to finish at $147.25, down only 62.5 cents.
Bank One's situation was seen as especially troublesome. Its First USA operation is likely to earn $500 million less than anticipated, putting 1999 earnings in the range of $3.60 to $3.65 a share, it said, in contrast to a consensus of $3.92 from analysts surveyed by First Call.
Still, analysts saw the episode as pointing up the increasingly fierce struggle for credit card profits. Among other things, it is prompting some reappraisal of the industry and a backlash by consumers. Bank One shares fell $12.625 to $43.
Traditionally, the card business has been highly profitable, with interest rates on revolving balances often running into the high double-digits, more than offsetting monthly administrative costs and the inevitable 1 or 2 percent of the debt that ultimately proves uncollectible.
But intense competition has forced rates down, both regular ones and introductory teasers, so far that banks and others in the business have increasingly tried to make up the revenue through fees, such as for late payments and over-the-limit spending. In many cases, even annual fees have been competed away to oblivion.
Bank One "seems to have a severe case of the affliction plaguing the entire industry," said James Daly, editor of Credit Card Management, an industry monthly. He described profit margins on this mature and now largely commoditized business as under "extreme pressure." And growth has slowed to about 5.5 percent a year from more than 20 percent as recently as the mid-1990's.
Warren Heller, research director of Veribanc Inc., a bank research and rating service, made the case more pungently.
"The whole card business is living in a wonder world," he said, pointing to high delinquencies and chargeoffs at a time of unsurpassed prosperity and to increasing reliance on customer-unfriendly fees when it has become so easy for customers to go elsewhere.
"What a crazy business model the card business of the majors has become," Mr. Heller added.
Bank One, which boasts the nation's second-biggest card business after Citigroup as a result of the 1997 acquisition of First USA, found out in the spring just how peevish consumers have become. They left in droves after the company dropped a one-day grace period, quickly reinstated, for late payments.
"Consumers who are paying attention, who are savvy, are going to find other options" when displeased, said Gerri Detweiler, education adviser to Debt Counselors of America. This is especially true now that the better deals are so readily found on the Web -- at, for example, getsmart.com and cardweb.com.
Travis Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, called the situation a backlash to heavy-handed industry practice. "The fact that customers are leaving Bank One in droves says they are getting wise to the tricks they play to wring out unwarranted profits," he said.
Industry executives, not surprisingly, reject the pessimism. "We believe the business is extremely healthy," said Sean Healy, a spokesman for Visa USA. He cited opportunities on the Internet and for debit cards, which allow banks to save money in processing checks.
Mr. Daly agreed that the Internet offered hope for the surviving companies in a rapidly consolidating industry, but cautioned that this "won't be a slam dunk."
Despite the forces working to undermine the industry, various analysts including Katrina Blecher of Brown Brothers Harriman and Joseph Duwan of Keefe Bruyette & Woods called Bank One's shrunken profits mostly its own fault.
"First USA took their eye off the ball," Mr. Duwan said. "They got maybe a little too aggressive on pricing and fees," prompting customers to consider other options.
And there may be more grief to come, Mr. Heller of Veribanc suggested. Bank One had a whopping $732 million, or 3 percent of its card portfolio, seriously delinquent at the end of the first quarter, well above the industry average. And this was after charging off as uncollectible 1.2 percent, just as much as the rest of the industry.
And if the economy should slip into recession, he added ominously, things really "could fall apart."

Total consumer credit card debt has soared in the 1990's, leading to enormous growth for credit card issuers. While consumers managed the greater debt load in the early part of the current economic expansion, bad debts have risen sharply, as have the amount of that debt that card issuers have had to write off as uncollectible.

HEADLINE: 3 Copper Concerns Jockey in Merger Deal

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Two copper companies in the midst of a merger said yesterday that they were willing to discuss being taken over by the Phelps Dodge Corporation, one of the world's largest mining companies.
But the companies, Asarco Inc. based in New York, and Cyprus Amax Minerals of Englewood, Colo., demanded a 25 percent premium yesterday to the original offer of $2.66 billion from Phelps Dodge, which they had immediately rejected last week. 
Phelps Dodge called the new proposal "totally unreasonable."
In a statement issued at its headquarters in Phoenix, Phelps Dodge said it would review the Asarco and Cyprus proposal, but said it believed that its original offer was "fully priced."
As a condition to discussions, the two companies also said that Phelps Dodge would have to take responsibility for any "antitrust problems" that might develop in a three-way combination.
It was not immediately clear whether the latest offer was a sincere invitation to discuss combining forces or a ploy to fend off Phelps Dodge.
But in what appeared to be an effort to dampen criticism by investors of the combination of Asarco and Cyprus Amax alone, the chief executives of the companies, Francis R. McAllister of Asarco and Milton H. Ward of Cyprus Amax, said they planned to make a special payment of $5 a share to stockholders of the new company.
In a joint statement, Mr. McAllister and Mr. Ward said the Phelps Dodge offer "fails to reward our stockholders for the values derived from the Asarco-Cyprus transaction."
They said their demand for $3.33 billion for the two companies "gives recognition to the fact that our shareholders would be contributing approximately 50 percent to the value of a three-way combination."
Phelps Dodge said the Asarco-Cyprus Amax proposal "would deliver nearly all of the economic value of the three-way combination to Asarco and Cyprus shareholders."
Raising questions about the tactics of Asarco and Cyprus Amax, Douglas C. Yearley, the chief executive of Phelps Dodge, said that if they were "not just posturing, we would be more than willing to begin real discussions."
He added, "Neither company has attempted to sit down with us."
One mining expert said that "almost no takeovers in this industry are executed on the first bid."
"Almost invariably, if agreement is reached," he said, "it is with some bartering. The first offer is usually unacceptably low and the counteroffer unacceptably high. I would expect this process to go on for sometime."
If the three-way deal goes through, it would create a company that would surpass Chile's state-owned Codelco as the world's top copper producer and would unite production in the copper-rich American Southwest.
The world copper market is now being flooded with copper from Chile and Indonesia, where mining costs are lower and mines are newer. Many analysts expect that copper prices, which have plunged in recent years, will remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future. Cooper has been trading at about 70 to 75 cents a pound, the lowest levels in more than a decade.
The jockeying among Phelps Dodge and the two other companies is part of a larger trend involving all basic commodities including aluminum, chemicals and oils. Commodity giants have been pairing up to gain market share and reduce costs in response to a surplus of raw materials as well as declining demand.
Last week, the world's largest aluminum maker, Alcoa Inc., said it was acquiring Reynolds Metals. That came on the heels of a three-way, trans-Atlantic merger to unite Canadian, Swiss and French aluminum makers into a giant competitor to Alcoa.
Phelps Dodge made its bid to take over the two companies last week in two stages. Early in the day it offered $2.4 billion. Then a few hours later it sweetened the deal to $2.66 billion.
The offer, all in stock, was based on a Phelps Dodge closing price on Aug. 20 of $59.125. Phelps Dodge's top offer was calculated to give 0.3135 of a Phelps Dodge share for every share of Cyprus Amax and 0.4098 share of Phelps Dodge for every share of Asarco share.
In the counterproposal, the two companies increased the ratio to 0.4055 a share of Phelps Dodge for a share of Cyprus Amax and 0.5330 a share of Phelps Dodge for a share of Asarco. At $57.625, the closing price of Phelps Dodge yesterday, the total at the higher price would come to $3.33 billion.

HEADLINE: Group Will Expand Program to Help Troubled Schools

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

 BODY:
One of the city's largest business groups announced plans yesterday to expand to a second Brooklyn school district a $29 million program that would boost the salaries of superintendents, principals and teachers if they improve students' academic performance.
The business group, the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, will widen its efforts to help troubled schools by bringing the program to Community School District 23 in Oceanville-Brownsville, officials from the Board of Education and the partnership said. 
 The program is already in place in neighboring District 19 in East New York, which along with District 23 is one of the most troubled districts in the city.
If academic goals outlined in the program are achieved, it could mean up to $30,000 more a year for superintendents, $15,000 for principals and $2,000 for teachers during the next five years in District 23.
The announcement comes as the partnership is poised to hand out bonuses from the program's first year in District 19, which has 30 elementary and middle schools.
Officials are awaiting the results of the statewide tests administered in June to decide which schools will receive the awards, said Stefan Pryor, executive director of the program, which is known as Breakthrough for Learning.
The results are to be released early this fall, he said.
Lewis H. Spence, the Deputy Chancellor for Operations, speaking yesterday after a board meeting, said he expected at least two schools in District 19 to receive bonus money this fall.
Mr. Spence and Mr. Pryor declined to name the schools.
District 19 was the first of the city's 32 districts to adopt the program.
In other cities, disputes have erupted between teachers and principals over who deserved the bonuses, and there have been charges that teachers cheated to increase student test scores and that schools have inflated grades.
But Mr. Spence said New York City's program differs from others in that it emphasizes teamwork and awards money to all teachers in an improved school, not just to those whose classes improved.
He also said that Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has the authority to change the program if he finds flaws.
William C. Thompson, the Board of Education president, predicted that the incentives would improve the schools in the long run. A third district is expected to participate in the program, starting in the fall of 2000.
"I honestly believe creating incentives is a good idea," Mr. Thompson said. "It's an experiment worth having."
Under a complex system intended to monitor improvement in the schools, the districts will try to improve students' scores on two kinds of standardized tests.
One shows whether the students are learning at or above their grade level when their school is compared with similar schools each year; the other shows how much students, even those doing badly, are improving.
The dual tests provide a more accurate measure of schools' improvement than other systemwide tests, officials said.
If students in all a district's schools reach all the necessary goals on those tests, the bonuses for educators could add up to $10 million a year for that district.
But even if districts collectively receive less, the financial impact for those who earn the bonuses will be great. Superintendents now receive about $128,000 a year. Principals make between $70,000 and $80,000. Teachers, who school officials said would receive less per person because bonuses would be given to every teacher in a successful school, make between $29,000 and $70,000.
Dr. Crew recently seized control of some of the lowest-performing schools in the city, including some in Districts 19. He also removed some top district administrators, including the District 19 Superintendent, Robert Riccobono, whose replacement, Joan Mahon-Powell was announced this week. Mr. Spence said Mr. Riccobono's removal was not related to the incentive program.
Ms. Mahon-Powell, who was principal of Intermediate School 292 in District 19 last year, said she looks forward to implementing changes in schools districtwide.

Asarco and Cyprus Amax Weigh Phelps Dodge Deal
Two copper companies in the midst of a merger, Asarco and Cyprus Amax Minerals, said that they were willing to discuss being taken over by Phelps Dodge, one of the world's largest mining companies.
But the two companies flatly rejected Phelps Dodge's initial offer of $2.66 billion, saying they wanted at least 25 percent more than that. Phelps Dodge called the new proposal "totally unreasonable" but said it would review it. Page C2. 

Treasuries Rally on Fed Move
Bond prices rallied on the prospect that the increase in short-term interest rates announced by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday could be the last of the year. Yields were down to a one-month low even after the Government reported that durable goods orders rose 3.3 percent in July, far exceeding expectations. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 5/32, to 103 29/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.85 percent from 5.93 percent on Tuesday and was the lowest since 5.77 percent on July 21. C8.
 
Stocks moved higher, carrying the Dow Jones industrial average to a closing high as investors grew more confident that the interest rate increase would enable the economy to grow without runaway inflation. The Dow advanced 42.74 points, to 11,326.04. The Nasdaq composite index gained 53.23 points, to 2,805.60, and the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index was up 18.29 points, to 1,381.79. C9.

Brazilian Job Ad Opens Floodgates
As many as a million people -- or one of every 160 Brazilians -- are competing for about 10,000 entry-level jobs advertised by Banco do Brasil. The flood of applications highlights the bleakness of Brazil's job situation, even as the country slowly emerges from recession. C4.
 
Alaskan Outrage at Cruise Line
Despite a visit and apology by Jack L. Williams, the president of the Royal Caribbean International cruise line, which has pleaded guilty to dumping pollutants in Alaskan waters, the city of Juneau is likely to impose a $5 "head tax" on each passenger as cruise ships dock there. C2.
 
Metropolitan Life Seen in Deal
The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is reported to be in talks to buy the General American Life Insurance Company of St. Louis for $1.2 billion. That could mean that customers would be repaid the $6.8 billion they have demanded from General American. C2.
 
Rite Aid Shares Jump on Speculation
Shares of Rite Aid, the nation's third-largest drugstore chain, jumped $3.4375, or 17.6 percent, to $22.875, in after-hours trading after the company said it was discussing a possible deal. Analysts said that Rite Aid might sell all or part of the 1,000 under-performing West Coast stores it acquired from Thrifty Payless Holdings in December 1996. C9.
 
Factory Orders Climb 3.3 Percent
Orders to United States factories jumped 3.3 percent in July, but analysts said the sharp increase did not suggest inflationary pressures of the kind that Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve have moved to head off. The rise in production of such durable goods as cars, airplanes and computers, reported by the Department of Commerce, was offset by a drop of 3.9 percent in the sale of houses. C8.
 
Ecuador to Delay Debt Payment
Ecuador said that it would delay payment on $94 million in Brady bond interest due Saturday. President Jamil Mahuad said the nation would use a 30-day grace period to work out a restructuring agreement with creditors. C8.
 
Societe Generale to Return Shares
Societe Generale, the big French bank, will return to shareholders the minority stake in the investment bank Paribas that it won in its failed takeover attempt. Because of the merger defeat, Paribas's chairman, Andre Levy-Lang, left the bank. He was succeeded by Michel Pebereau, the chairman of Banque Nationale de Paris, which gained a 65.4 percent stake in Paribas. C4.

HEADLINE: Black Politicians Turn Against Planned Harlem Rally for Youth

BYLINE: By DAVID BARSTOW

 BODY:
Leading a wave of condemnation among the city's black politicians, Representative Charles B. Rangel, Harlem's most powerful political figure, yesterday called for a boycott of a planned youth rally, saying racially charged speeches and violent clashes with the police at last year's rally proved that "it is impossible for any good" to come out of the event.
"We hoped last year if there was an increase in the kids coming, the good would overcome the hatred of the organizers," Mr. Rangel said at a news conference in Harlem with Councilman Bill Perkins, who reported that he was assaulted on Monday by organizers of the Sept. 4 rally, called the Million Youth March. "But after the events of last year, we would not encourage anyone to get involved in the event." 
 Other prominent black politicians came forward yesterday to condemn both the march and its organizers. The statements marked a shift among the city's black leaders, who last year condemned the march's leader, Khallid Abdul Muhammad, for his derogatory remarks about Jews and whites, but grudgingly accepted the event as a way to mobilize young people, and in some cases even encouraged them to attend.
Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright of Harlem, who last year tried to mediate between march organizers and city officials, issued a statement yesterday under the headline, "Enough is Enough -- Why the Million Youth March Should Not Take Place in Harlem."
The State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, the only black holding statewide office, said in a statement yesterday: "I cannot abide by Khallid Muhammad's evil message, and I cannot support his march."
And C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan Borough President who earlier this week spurned a plea for assistance from march organizers, issued an appeal for all residents to "douse" the "flames of divisiveness."
The efforts to isolate Mr. Muhammad were driven by outrage over last year's rally -- which resulted in injuries to 14 participants and 16 police officers -- and by anger at the treatment of Mr. Perkins, a Harlem Democrat who said supporters of Mr. Muhammad surrounded him at a political event on Monday night and shouted, "We are going to kill Uncle Toms like you." Mr. Perkins, who said he was considering pressing charges, was offered police protection by Commissioner Howard Safir during a meeting yesterday.
At a raucous news conference outside the Apollo Theater in Harlem last night, as his supporters mixed threats toward white reporters with chants of "black power," Mr. Muhammad and other organizers said the calls for a boycott did not reflect popular sentiment in the community, and they accused black political leaders of pandering to whites.
"Unfortunately, the black elected officials are so far removed from their own constituents that they are afraid to stand up for the people," said Shaunette Daniels, a spokeswoman for the march.
Mr. Muhammad again denied that his supporters had assaulted Mr. Perkins, but then he added: "Bill Perkins is my brother and he is a member of the black nation, but he is a Tom that bootlicks" white people.
The organizers have yet to secure a city permit for the Saturday rally, which is scheduled to be staged along the section of Lenox Avenue known as Malcolm X Boulevard. In their latest request to city officials, the rally's organizers have said that, starting at 11 A.M., they want to march from 135th Street to 118th Street, and then conduct a program of educational speeches from 2 to 6 P.M. between 118th and 124th Streets.
Mr. Muhammad vowed yesterday to march with or without a permit, warning that there "will be a state of emergency in Harlem" if the Police Department attempts to block the event. He said the organization was committed to focusing attention on high unemployment, high drop-out rates and "a raging asthma epidemic" among black youth. "We represent vision, self-determination and, above all, courage," Mr. Muhammad said.
At a City Hall news conference yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani denounced the organizers as "reprehensible," but declined to say whether the city will issue a permit. Instead, he blamed the news media for paying too much attention to Mr. Muhammad and his organization, the New Black Panther Party.
"You are creating them," he chided reporters. "They don't have support. They don't have political support, they don't have social support, they don't have support in the community. And by constantly focusing on them, you are creating them, and I want to say as little as possible to give them attention."
But for all the public criticism, Mr. Giuliani's aides have been quietly negotiating for weeks with Mr. Muhammad's lawyers over the terms of a rally.
Daniel S. Connolly, the city lawyer handling the negotiations, declined to discuss his conversations with the rally's lawyers. Mr. Connolly, however, has told march organizers that the city will abide by a Federal appeals court's decision last year that allowed the youth rally to assemble for four hours on six blocks of Malcolm X Boulevard.
"He says that the city is prepared to adhere to that decision," said Jomo Thomas, a lawyer for the rally's organizers. Mr. Thomas said the city's Corporation Counsel, Michael D. Hess, spoke with the organizers yesterday afternoon and said he hoped to avoid another court battle.
Last year, the rally's organizers sued the city, alleging that the Giuliani administration denied them a permit solely because city officials disagreed with their political message of militant black nationalism.
This year, the organizers have demanded that city officials reduce the police presence at the rally, and not move so swiftly to clear the area at the time the permit runs out. Police officers, some in riot gear, began to clear last year's rally at 4:05 P.M., five minutes after the permit expired. As they moved in, Mr. Muhammad called on the crowd to defend themselves in the event of an attack, and angry rally participants threw chairs and other objects at officers.
In a letter Monday to Mr. Connolly, Mr. Thomas said that police officers have shown far more flexibility at other large public events, like the St. Patrick's Day Parade. "None of these have ever been held to 'High Noon' conditions of 'end exactly at the designated time or else,' " Mr. Thomas wrote.
Mr. Hess promised to respond to the march organizer's demands by 1 P.M. today, Mr. Thomas said. But neither he nor any other lawyers for the march sounded the slightest bit optimistic that they would reach an agreement with the city on a rally permit. They accused Mr. Giuliani of stalling on the permit to curry favor with Jewish voters should he decide to run for the United States Senate. "This is the typical Giuliani way of operating," said Malik Z. Shabazz, an aide to Mr. Muhammad. "But I feel strongly that by him standing up to the Million Youth March he will appease Jewish voters."
Mr. Muhammad has outraged Jews by calling them "bloodsuckers" and "hook-nosed." At other times, he has called on black people to take up arms against the police.
Some officials, most notably the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, called on the city to deny a permit. "People have a right to express themselves," he said yesterday, "but people do not have a right to foster and to engage in violence anymore than anyone has a right to stand up in a movie theater and yell 'Fire!' under the pretext of free speech."
Mr. Rangel said he believed that the First Amendment protected Mr. Muhammad's right to stage a rally, though perhaps only in a public park "where they are just speaking to themselves."
Asked how the city should handle the decision on whether to issue a permit, Mr. Rangel replied, "We want it handled in a fashion that respects the fact that this is a peace-loving community that will most likely be victimized by this event."

Suzy Wong's Long Gone and Now, Sailors Begone!

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Tony Wong dismisses many of the old chestnuts about American sailors on leave in exotic foreign ports.
"They don't go to girlie bars anymore, they buy computer equipment," said Mr. Wong, a tailor whose family has made clothing for sailors from visiting United States Navy ships since 1898, first in Shanghai and now in Hong Kong. 
 After a lifetime of fitting admirals for dinner jackets and ensigns for sport coats, Mr. Wong is steeped in the lore of American sailors on R & R. Despite a stern gaze that suggests he could command a destroyer as easily as outfitting its crew in worsted, he said, "I have a special affection for the Navy."
Which is why Mr. Wong took it hard in May when the Chinese Government banned Navy ships from visiting Hong Kong. The ban -- apparently in retaliation for NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade -- is a footnote in the larger struggle between a superpower and a rising power.
But for Mr. Wong and a circle of Hong Kong merchants, restaurant owners and barkeepers who depend on visiting American sailors for their livelihood, it is a potentially mortal blow.
"If the sailors don't come back, we'll have to think of new ways to survive," Mr. Wong said as he surveyed his empty store. "What's the buzzword in America? We'll re-engineer our business."
That may be difficult. Mr. Wong's shop is in the Fleet Arcade, a pocket-size shopping mall next to the pier in Victoria Harbor that exists primarily to serve ships. The Navy pays for the mall's upkeep under an agreement with a nonprofit organization, the Servicemen's Guides Association, to give sailors a place to eat, get a haircut, call home or even buy Chinese porcelain.
Mr. Wong thinks he can muddle through on the small number of local landlubbers who use the mall. But a nearby shop that sells porcelain closed its doors this week. "There's no business, so we had no choice," said the manager as he packed up mournfully.
The American Consulate here says that about 60 ships a year normally anchor in Hong Kong, pumping $50 million into the local economy. The bulk of that is spent on provisions like food and fuel. But with 45,000 crew members swarming into the streets, the sailors also spend a lot on food and shopping.
And, Mr. Wong's assertions notwithstanding, they still run up bar tabs in the enduringly seedy clubs of Wanchai.
"We view these stopovers as serving the interests of all parties," said Rob Laing, a spokesman for the consulate. "We're prepared to resume them as soon as the Chinese Government approves our requests."
Under the terms of the agreement that governed Hong Kong's return to China from Britain in 1997, Beijing controls Hong Kong's national security. So legal experts say it is entirely within its rights in curtailing the visits. It has allowed visits by naval ships from other countries to continue.
Mr. Laing said Beijing had not given a reason for denying the requests from American ships to dock, the first of which came in mid-May, soon after the embassy bombing. All told, it has turned down visits by 10 ships and 3 military planes.
But there are signs Beijing is softening its stance. It recently approved a request for a military plane to pick up a Congressional delegation. And it is allowing a visit by a Navy supply ship next month. The shopkeepers grouse that the vessel has a crew of only 90, most of whom are civilians.
The Rev. Ronald R. Saucci, a Maryknoll Catholic priest who runs the Servicemen's Guides Association, recently cornered a high-ranking mainland Chinese official at a diplomatic reception to ask him whether Beijing would lift the ban on the Navy visits. The official's response? "God will provide."
Father Saucci said he hoped China would relax its ban, if only to preserve Hong Kong's role as one of the Navy's favorite rest and recreation destinations. American ships have been dropping anchor here for decades, particularly since 1949, when the Communist victory in China's civil war closed off Shanghai and other mainland ports.
The merchants say they can trace the changing nature of the United States Navy to the things that sailors do and buy while ashore. Mr. Wong shows off a yellowed slip of paper that permitted his granduncle to board the U.S.S. New York in Shanghai in 1902 to measure the crew for tuxedos.
During the 1950's and 60's, Hong Kong became known as something of a den of sin, with its sloe-eyed bargirls and sharp-eyed pimps. But the British colony immortalized in the 1960 film "The World of Suzy Wong" has long since given way to a more wholesome and commercial place, where sailors shop for computers, stereo equipment and Oriental rugs.
People here worry that unless China allows visits to resume soon, Hong Kong could lose out to competitors like Singapore and Manila, which recently reopened its port to visiting American warships.
"I really hope it doesn't become a thing where China carefully assesses the world scene every time the U.S. requests a visit, because that could cut the heart out of our organization," Father Saucci said.
For now, the shopkeepers and barmen can only watch as China and the United States engage in a diplomatic pas de deux. Most are hopeful that as tensions between the countries cool, China will relent.
"China and the U.S. are like a couple: they fight with each other and then they make up," said Roger Sibnoni, who runs a hole in the wall that sells playing cards and a cologne scientifically designed to attract women.
At Club Hot Lips, a bar in Wanchai that was as quiet as a convent on a recent evening, the manager said plaintively, "Tell the Chinese Government to settle this so the Americans can come back and start drinking again."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about merchants who are feeling the effect of China's decision to bar United States Navy ships from Hong Kong misspelled the given name of the lead character in a 1960 movie about the port. She was Suzie Wong, not Suzy.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;
An American Century, Through the Government's Lens

BYLINE: By VICKI GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
Even though much in the 20th century has been a blight on the human record, we've been stuck with these 100 years and are about to lose them, so half the world seems to be competing to sum them up in photographs.
Right now, the American past in some of its blight, struggle, achievements (both real and dubious) and cagey habit of putting a good face on it all is summarized at the National Archives in Washington in a show called "Picturing the Century: 100 Years of Photographs From the National Archives." 
 Most people go to the Archives to see the great documents of America's history: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and Bill of Rights. They are still there in all their glory; the place fairly bristles with history.
One advantage of this show is that the photographs come from a near-bottomless collection. The National Archives and Records Administration has more than eight million still pictures and nine million aerial photographs in Washington alone, and it has more than 30 facilities around the country, including the 10 Presidential libraries. This means that most of the 190 pictures (along with some documents) in "Picturing the Century" are virtually unknown, and some of the history in them is, too.
When it comes to unknown, try a 1917 image of people "nature-sliding" down snowy slopes on the seats of what the contemporary caption calls their "famous tin trousers," said seats being waxed, of course. Or take a look at a World War I window display of dressed-up potatoes billed as "Potatriots." One is got up like Teddy Roosevelt, another like Woodrow Wilson; they illustrate a sign saying, "The Potato Is a Good Soldier. Eat It Uniform and All." (The Government was trying to conserve wheat at the time.)
As for history, the show offers some textbook facts like the Wright Brothers' first flight in 1903. (The brothers withheld this photograph for fear the competition would learn too much about their invention; no photograph was published until a photojournalist sneaked one in 1908.) There are also Depression-era bread lines, the D-Day landing (best known from Robert Capa's pictures but here in Robert F. Sargent's photograph for the Coast Guard), soldiers watching a nuclear blast in 1951 and V.I.P.'s in armchairs and goggles watching another that year.
The social history of America winds through "Picturing the Century" on a trail marked by bald fact and irony. In 1930, when radio was just achieving the status of a mass medium, George W. Ackerman took a picture of a farmer, his wife and daughter seated before their large console radio and watching it as intently as if it were television. Around 1960, an unknown photographer snapped female office workers admiring one woman's ring. The caption: "35 per cent of U.S. women hold daily jobs outside the home. The working woman may be an executive but 18 times oftener is a subordinate. And many a girl's happiest day at the office is the day she leaves to get married."
In 1970, Oliver F. Atkins photographed President Richard M. Nixon shaking hands with Elvis Presley at the meeting where Nixon presented Elvis with a pistol and asked that he be made a "Federal agent-at-large" in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. (Elvis looks as if he knew a lot about drugs.) In 1974, as the fuel crisis closed down gasoline stations and some stations were put to other uses, David Falconer photographed one that was converted to born-again Christianity, with pumps wearing pictures of Jesus and signs that say things like "Fill Up With the Holy Ghost and Fire."
History is in the details, which photographs supply in superabundance. And yet they speak a limited kind of language, and Bruce I. Bustard, the curator of the show, tells more than mere pictures can in an accompanying book.
He points out that the growth of photography coincidentally accompanied the expansion of the Federal Government. In 1900, there were 230,000 Federal employees, and by 1917 almost double that number. Photographs kept multiplying,too.
The Franklin D. Roosevelt Library has approximately 130,000 photographs of Franklin and Eleanor, including those from his 12 years as President. The Ronald Reagan Library has more than 10 times that many pictures, more than 1.5 million of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, including those from his eight years as President.
The Government's long and varied involvement with photography is a study in itself. When a child-labor law was under consideration in the House of Representatives in the first decade of the century, members used Lewis Hine's photographs to document their case. (They lost.) During World War I, an organized effort that included photographic imagery was made to rouse support for American participation. A 1917 photograph of "Sweethearts and relatives bidding 69th Infantry N.Y. a fond goodbye" looks candid enough but was actually posed with models, one of whom waves a flag as she busses a doughboy.
The photographs of the Farm Security Administration during the Depression are relatively well known, but other Government agencies, including the Works Progress Administration, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the National Youth Administration, the Public Works Administration and the Rural Electrification Administration had similar programs and employed fine photographers. Dorothea Lange worked for not one but three of those organizations. In 1941, Ansel Adams took photographs for some never-completed murals in the Department of Interior Building; the National Archives houses 226 of his prints.
The National Records and Archives Administration itself was set up in 1934, right in the middle of a great documentary era, and became the repository not only for Government-sponsored photographs but also for corporate and other photographs used by or donated to the Government.
After the war the Government continued to rely heavily on photography, with some changes in emphasis. Mr. Bustard writes that during the cold war "U.S. Government photography increasingly became an instrument of American foreign policy." The founders of the United States Information Agency in 1953 believed, as has long been believed in wartime, that public opinion in the enemy camp would make a difference.
A U.S.I.A. magazine called America Illustrated, aimed at the Soviet Union and Soviet-bloc countries, carried photo essays on American life, like happy mothers and daughters in dazzling kitchens or "Lunchbox Capitalists," which showed hard-hats reading The Wall Street Journal to check on stock they owned through employee stock-ownership plans. Another magazine, Topic, directed at sub-Saharan Africa, ran stories of American life and of African influence in such areas as fashion.
In 1972, the Environmental Protection Agency embarked on the most ambitious photography survey of America since the 1930's, Documerica. Meant to document environmental issues, the program gave its 75 employees so much leeway that they produced a range of telling reports on various aspects of American society before budget cuts killed the program.
Though some of the photographs in "Picturing the Century" don't look much like gold at first, nuggets of history lie everywhere. The show will be at the Archives till 2001, but don't wait too long: early in the next millennium other photographs will go up to replace most of these, putting yet another face on a century with more than its share of menacing scowls -- and photographs.
 "Picturing the Century: 100 Years of Photography From the National Archives," partly sponsored by the Eastman Kodak Company, is at the National Archives in Washington, Seventh Street and Pennsylvania Avenue N.W., (202) 501-5000, through July 4, 2001.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Plucking Warmth From Millet's Light

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

DATELINE: WILLIAMSTOWN, MASS.

 BODY:
IT'S a good bet that the most satisfying exhibition anywhere in America at this moment is "Jean-Francois Millet: Drawn Into the Light," at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute here.
As its title implies, the show focuses on drawings. Millet's drawings are limpid and nuanced, with a remarkable feel for light and the weight of things. They owe debts to Poussin and Delacroix and have the silent, time-stopped quality of Vermeer. If Millet's fame rests on a few paintings, like "The Sower," "The Gleaners" and "Man With a Hoe," which are also on loan here (a feat for the Clark), no one was more adept at pastels than he was, or more skilled at exploiting the bumpiness of textured paper to create a soft, shimmering effect, or at the technique of rubbing the lines made by conte crayons. Seurat, whose drawings are also sublime, idolized Millet because, among other things, Millet virtually invented the vaporous silhouettes that Seurat drew. 
 So the exhibition reminds us why we should admire Millet beyond the textbook view of him as a painter of peasants. He was a first-rate landscapist whose experience of the countryside, where he spent most of his life (he was born in 1814 and died in 1875), is reflected in the precision of his perceptions of rural life. Drawings like "Twilight" and the watercolors of bucolic scenes he made near Vichy during the mid-1860's are not just drawn well, they're also perfectly true to nature, which is a rarer attribute.
The standard question about Millet comes up here: was he a sentimentalist? "The Gleaners," maybe his most famous and most sentimental picture, is so familiar that it's now hard to see fresh. Three women are stooping in a field, one rising just enough so that her back approaches the horizon line but doesn't break its plane. The effect is to make the figures look rooted to the earth, weighted down.
They are also shrouded -- we can't make out their faces -- and stony. Theophile Gautier once wrote about how Millet "trowels onto his dishcloth canvas, using no oil or turps, great masonries of color, paint so dry no varnish could quench its thirst," which is what we see here: the women seem like solid blocks, dense masses.
At a good distance from them, brightly lighted, men pitch huge forkfuls of grain into stacks. Two of the stacks, beside a laden wagon, mirror the configuration of the women, giving the picture a classical balance, front to back, while emphasizing the extreme poverty of the gleaners compared to the bounty behind them.
Gleaners, the rural equivalent of urban beggars, scrounged whatever scraps of grain escaped the reapers' sheaves. They constituted the absolute bottom rung of peasant society. Millet's goal -- to suggest the gravity of their existence through a kind of religious transfiguration -- involved remaking the Bible into pictures of modern realism. He knew the Old Testament story of Ruth, the gleaner, and Boaz, the landowner who falls in love with her, and he had already adapted it for another painting, "Harvesters Resting."
His "Gleaners" glorifies, through biblical implications, the backbreaking work of these women. It was a bold statement to be making at the time. Jittery after the revolution of 1848, the urban middle and upper classes, who were Millet's audience, genuinely feared these peasants, who hadn't benefited, as they had, from the economic upturn of the Second Empire. When "The Gleaners" was first shown in the 1850's, one art critic, speaking for other Parisians, perceived in it an alarming intimation of "the scaffolds of 1793."
That said, Millet was never a radical in the way that Courbet was a radical. His attachment to classical art and to biblical sources linked him to a tradition that reassured moderates. Critics could choose to focus on what was provocative about his art or on what was conventional, depending on their inclinations.
His political views, to the extent they're known, seem to have been contradictory, which is to say they were fairly normal. If others regarded him as a wild socialist troublemaker, he was actually one of those people whose public works and private beliefs didn't necessarily coincide. The socialists thought that Millet was on their side, but as Camille Pissarro wrote in 1887, Millet was just a bit too biblical. He was "another of those blind men, leaders or followers who, unconscious of the march of modern ideas, defend those ideas without knowing it, despite themselves."
That sounds right. Millet liked to say that he had been a peasant laborer until he was 21, but he was born to a prospering family in a tiny coastal hamlet called Gruchy, in Normandy. Although he worked with his father and great-uncle tilling the soil and tending animals, he was steeped in Virgil, Milton and Shakespeare; it's said that he was one of the best-educated painters of his generation.
He also drew and was sent, at 18, to study art in Cherbourg. Having received a stipend from the city fathers there, and with money from his family, he then became a student of the history painter Paul Delaroche at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, aiming for a career as an academic painter of portraits, nudes and biblical subjects.
Gradually, however, his aspirations changed and he began to concentrate more on peasant life and landscapes. After staying a dozen years in Paris, through the revolution and despite the fact that he loathed city life, he opted in 1849 to settle permanently in Barbizon, 30 miles south of Paris, on the northern edge of the forest of Fontainebleau, where Theodore Rousseau, the painter, had also retreated a year earlier. Barbizon was close enough to Paris to stay in touch with the art business, but it was a world apart.
His ambition had become epic and posed a number of questions that are still fundamental to political art. Was it possible to convey the demeaning, mechanical quality of a task like gleaning or sowing and simultaneously dignify the people doing it? Could they be made to look particular and individual while doing such an anonymous job? What did it take to turn something commonplace into something mythic without distorting or softening it? Should brutality be made to look beautiful through art?
When Millet failed to resolve these sorts of issues, his art did slide toward sentimentalism. But generally he managed to extract from his classical sources an essential restraint, and notwithstanding the occasional maudlin effect, he tended mostly toward sobriety and a kind of obstinate awkwardness of pose and gesture, which mitigated melodrama. In the end, his works have heart. Sincerity and sentimentality are different things. Millet was sincere.
He was a painter of humanity for whom nature provided a context that was always larger than the people he described. His art was about harmony with the landscape. In "Faggot Gatherers Returning From the Forest," a winter scene of three woman laden with enormous bundles of twigs strapped to their backs, thin vertical lines designate the sticks they carry and the trees around them -- a kind of shorthand technique that merges the women with the land, reinforcing their connection. "My desire to make a winter landscape has passed to the point of true compulsion," Millet wrote, a little before he made the drawing. "There's a calm, a grandeur that's terrifying." This is conveyed here: a sense of awesome scale and silence.
His art is also neatly summed up in a drawing like "Woman Pasturing Her Cow." The woman was a poor itinerant. Itinerants were prohibited from using communal grazing land in France, so she leads her malnourished cow to feed on scraggy tufts of grass beside the roadway. In a big sunny field behind her, a landowner's fat herd grazes.
Trees are surrounding the woman and separating her from the field, like prison bars. But Millet doesn't push the point: the woman, plump-faced, standing erect, contentedly knitting, is not a cliche of poverty. The picture is as much about light and space as it is about justice or anything else. For Millet, everything returns to nature.
"Nature yields herself to those who trouble to explore her," he wrote. "But she demands an exclusive love. The works of art we love, we love only because they are derived from her. The rest are merely works of empty pedantry."
"Jean-Francois Millet: Drawn Into the Light" remains at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, 225 South Street, Williamstown, Mass., (413) 458-9545, through Sept. 6. It travels to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (Oct. 26 through Jan. 4) and to the Frick Museum in Pittsburgh (Feb. 10 through mid-April).

HEADLINE: Allow Aluminum Merger

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Questionable Mergers in Aluminum" (editorial, Aug. 20): 
 As you note, the price of aluminum is at depressed levels. Not allowing the Alcoa-Reynolds merger to take place would stifle the ability to improve efficiency and would jeopardize the future of the American aluminum industry. Jobs have already been lost, and many more surely will be if American companies are not allowed to keep up with global competition.
In our random study of 553 mergers in regulated and unregulated industries that occurred between 1990 and 1998, Dr. Robert Ekelund and I found that regulators imposed costly delays on mergers, that the delay was twice as long in regulated industries as compared with unregulated industries, and that consumers gained nothing in the process.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, Aug. 20) argues that President Ronald Reagan's breakup of the air traffic controllers' strike in 1981 helped insure our technological superiority over Europe, since it "helped break the hold of organized labor over the U.S. economy" and allowed corporate managers to lay off workers and replace them with new technology. 
 To the contrary, United States manufacturing unions have never had much power to block layoffs, and with only 23 percent of the work force organized at the time, unions in the United States were already weaker than their European counterparts. Rather than block new technology, industrial unions negotiated for retraining, workplace safety and transfer rights to growing segments of their particular industries.

Vote On Drugs

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Notice to the public:
Vote now on drugs, one of the only two ways. 
 1. If you support the war against drugs, vote now for pending Congressional legislation designed to wound major drug lords around the world. It cuts them off from all commerce with the U.S., now a laundry for bleaching the blood from drug-trade billions and turning them into investments in legitimate businesses.
Vote by telling your members of Congress that when the House-Senate bill authorizing intelligence funds comes up for final decision, probably next month, you want them to vote for the section called "blocking assets of major narcotics traffickers."
Insist they start now to tell the Administration not to try to water it down to satisfy any country for diplomatic or economic reasons -- including Mexico, the biggest drug entry point for America, already complaining about "negative consequences" of the proposal.
Turn yourself and your civil, labor or commercial organization, or religious congregation, into lobbies for the bill -- counterweight to the lobbies of drug-transfer nations and American companies beholden to them.
2. If you are against the war on drugs or just don't care about what drugs are doing to our country, then don't do a thing. That is a vote, too.
That's the way it is in Washington. Members of Congress introduce legislation, committees discuss it for months, votes are taken and then when the time comes to work out House-Senate differences, administrations on the fence and under professional lobbyists' pressure use their power to try to mold the legislation to their liking. That is exactly the time for ordinary Americans around the country to do their own lobbying.
The bill targeting drug lords extends throughout their vicious world the economic sanctions already directed at Colombian drug lords, by President Clinton's executive order. It will prohibit any U.S. commerce by specifically named drug operators, seize all their assets in the U.S., and ban trading with them by American companies.
The bill specifies that every year the U.S. Government list the major drug lords of the world, by name and nation. The lists are certain to include top drug traders from countries such as Afghanistan, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Thailand and Mexico.
In the Senate it was introduced by Paul Coverdell, a Georgia Republican, and Dianne Feinstein, Democrat from California, and passed with bipartisan support. In the House it also has support in both parties, including Porter Goss of Florida, a Republican and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Charles Rangel, the New York Democrat. It awaits the final September House-Senate Joint Intelligence Committee vote.
For awhile I heard from within the Administration the kind of mutters that preceded the Clinton certification last year that Mexico was carrying out anti-drug commitments satisfactorily, which was certainly a surprise to Mexican drug lords.
Then, yesterday, the White House told me that it favored some target sanctions.
Its objection to the bill was that the Administration would have to list all major drug lords for the President to choose targets, and that could endanger investigations. The White House said it would be better for the President to select targets without having to choose from a list.
Bit of a puzzle. The bill already gives him the right to decide which of the drug lords to target from the Administration's unpublished list. But some members of Congress think the motive is to avoid a list that might include just a little too many from a "sensitive country."
No one bill will end the drug war. Only the determination of Americans to use every sort of resource will do that -- parental teaching, law enforcement with some compassion toward first offenders and none for career drug criminals, enough money for therapy in and out of jails, targeting drug lords -- and passionate leadership.
That would preclude Presidential candidates who mince around about whether they used drugs when they were younger -- unless they grow up publicly and quickly.
Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, head of the Phoenix House therapeutic communities, says that the bill "reflects the kind of values that we don't hear enough these days." So vote -- one way or the other.

Whose Web Site Is This?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
You just knew something like this would happen. China, unable so far to occupy Taiwan on land, has done it in cyberspace. The Internet address Taiwan.com was recently claimed and registered by China.com, an Internet portal that is partially owned by China's state-run Xinhua news agency. According to The Asian Wall Street Journal, several hundred Taiwanese professors and lawmakers have petitioned the Taiwan government to reclaim the Taiwan.com domain name by taking the Nasdaq-traded China.com to court in the U.S. for misrepresentation.
One country, two Web sites. Not good. 
 This cyberdrama, though, is a perfect illustration of how all-consuming is the identity struggle between China and Taiwan -- a struggle that has made both states crazy. On one side, it has blinded the Taiwanese to their own strength. This remarkable country so clearly has the winds of history at its back. At a time when China is facing the huge task of modernizing a nation of 1.2 billion people, and could implode under the strain, Taiwan has already arrived. It has Asia's most dynamic economy. It is Silicon Valley's most feared competitor. And it is a thriving free-market democracy. As long as it can avoid provoking a war with China, Taiwan has everything going for it. But tell that to people here and all they will tell you is that China just beat them out of diplomatic relations with Tonga!
But if Taiwan can't see its strength, China can't see its weakness. China is so caught up in the principle that Taiwan is its renegade province that it has completely forgotten that Beijing has to court the Taiwanese people if it wants to win them back by anything other than force.
Beijing needs to try a strategy on Taiwan that it's never really tried before: a charm offensive. I know it's unlikely, but charming Taiwan would surely get Beijing a lot more than its present overture, which is: "Marry me or die." That is, without a doubt, history's worst pickup line.
"The way they talk to us about unification is like a traditional Chinese arranged marriage," said Antonio Chiang, publisher of The Taipei Times. "The father just tells the daughter, 'You will marry your cousin.' There is no love, no dating, no coffee. Look, we're a free country here. If people were attracted to China, there is no way the government could stop it. But they have not made their system attractive to us."
For now, the Chinese idea of a charm offensive is to suggest that the recent declaration by Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, that Taiwan and China should deal with each other as two separate "states" is a formulation that only Mr. Lee believes in -- not the Taiwanese people. The fact is, Mr. Lee was following the public mood here, not leading it.
"Today the average Taiwanese has negative feelings toward China," said Bikhim Hsiao, 28, a pro-independence activist. "The word China means threats and squeezing Taiwan's international space. If the mainland wants us to unify with them, they should tell us the benefits. Look what the latest fad is here -- it's a Japanese doll called 'Hello Kitty' that McDonald's uses as a promotion. People stand in line all night at McDonald's to get them. A Japanese doll! The Japanese colonized us for 50 years, but Japan has a more favorable image here today than China."
Given the history, any overture by Beijing would be greeted here with suspicion. But if China were to speak about coming together with Taiwan in some sort of loose commonwealth, before unification, or if China were to let Taiwan have an observer seat at something as utterly innocuous as the annual World Health Assembly, it would have a big impact. Every poll shows that when China is less threatening, people here identify more as "Chinese"; when it is more threatening they identify as "Taiwanese." The longing for some kind of unity still exists, but it is buried under layers of scar tissue, and China has to decide whether to add to those layers or start peeling them away.
"If there were a soft sell for a change, a soft-pedaling . . . I think it would make a difference," Taiwan's Vice President, Lien Chan, said to me. "Why don't we start by having the two of us -- governments or non-governmental organizations -- study together how we establish a peace zone in the Taiwan Strait?"
Another Taiwanese politician was more blunt: "I could get China's President Jiang Zemin elected President here -- easy -- if they would just try a different approach."

HEADLINE: A Fed Dissenter From June Rate Rise

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's decision on June 30 to raise interest rates for the first time in two years was not unanimous: One Fed policy committee member dissented on the ground that the move was not needed to keep inflation under control, according to minutes of the meeting released today.
Robert D. McTeer Jr., president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and a member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, was the sole opponent of the decision to raise the Federal funds rate -- the interest that banks charge each other on overnight loans -- by a quarter of a point, to 5 percent. 
 Mr. McTeer "noted that most measures of current inflation remain low and he saw few signs of inflation in the pipeline," the minutes said.
Nine members, including the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, supported the decision. Alice M. Rivlin, who was preparing to leave as vice chairman, did not attend the meeting.
On Tuesday, the Fed again nudged up interest rates by a quarter of a point. The minutes for that meeting will be released on Oct. 7.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Fall as Investors Reassess What Fed Might Do

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Bond prices fell for the first time in a week yesterday as evidence of strong consumer spending and employment caused some investors to doubt whether the Federal Reserve can keep from raising interest rates again this year.
"We see the Fed ultimately being forced to move again," said Alan Kral, who helps invest the $1 billion under management at Trevor Stewart Burton & Jacobsen Inc. "There's potential inflation in the economy." 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 23/32, to 103 6/32. Its yield rose to 5.90 percent, from 5.85 percent. Yields on two-year notes, more sensitive to Fed rate expectations, rose 11 basis points, to 5.58 percent -- the biggest one-day increase since Aug. 9.
"There's not going to be a high comfort level about the Federal Reserve being on hold until we see slower economic growth and slack in the labor market," said Mike Cloherty, a strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
But Michael Budd, the director of more than $50 billion of fixed-income investments at Bank of America Investment Management in Chicago, said he was holding to his view that "the Fed has stepped to the sidelines for the remainder of the year."
Trading was swift in a market burned by this year's performance of its benchmark bond, which has had losses of 7.4 percent, including price changes and reinvested interest.
Treasury notes took the biggest hit after the Government said consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, rose at an annual 4.6 percent rate in the second quarter -- above the 4 percent pace it initially reported.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Growth Slows, But Economy Is Still Robust

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
A swollen trade deficit helped slow the economy's growth in the second quarter, but consumers continued to spend briskly, the Government said today.
The Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and services -- grew at an annual rate of 1.8 percent from April through June, down from 4.3 percent in the first quarter. The Government originally estimated the second quarter's growth rate at 2.3 percent. 
 The revised report comes two days after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the second time this summer in an effort to avert inflationary pressures. Though growth has slowed recently, the economy is still expected to increase by a robust rate of nearly 4 percent for the year. The total output of goods and services for the second quarter was $7.8 trillion, when adjusted for inflation.
"The report is a reflection of a strong economy, not a weak one," said Sung Won Sohn, Wells Fargo's chief economist. "Consumers are still on a spending spree. That's one of the reasons why businesses cannot keep inventories on the shelves and that imports are up so much."
The second-quarter trade deficit was $14.4 billion bigger than previously estimated and shaved 1.34 percentage points off the nation's economic growth.
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity, rose in the second quarter at an annual rate of 4.6 percent. At the same time, business investment -- spending on new equipment and plants -- rose at an annual rate of 11.2 percent.
Given hearty spending by consumers and businesses, "I don't think the Fed will look at this report and say, 'Oh, our job is done, the economy is slowing,' " said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Standard & Poor's DRI. "I think they are going to be as vigilant as ever in watching for a possible acceleration of inflation."
Thus far, inflation remains contained. The Government did not revise an inflation gauge tied to second-quarter G.D.P., which rose 2.1 percent. In the first quarter that inflation measure rose 1.2 percent.
Rising labor costs resulting from the lowest unemployment rate in three decades have, however, cut into corporate profits, which fell at an annual rate of $9.2 billion in the second quarter, the biggest drop since the end of 1997. In the first quarter of the year, profits rose at a $47.1 billion rate.
The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell by 5,000, to 283,000, the Labor Department said. The labor market is considered extremely tight whenever jobless claims fall below 300,000.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Broad Retreat on Wall St. In Wake of Rate Increase

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stocks retreated broadly yesterday. A rally based on the belief that Tuesday's interest-rate increase would be the Federal Reserve's last for the year gave way, as traders began to suspect that might not be the case.
Interest rates climbed, especially on the actively traded two-year note, after the Government reported that consumer spending was even more robust than first estimated in the second quarter and that the job market remained taut last week. Some investors were moved to cash in their winnings. 
 After setting two records earlier in the week, the Dow Jones industrial average was on the defensive throughout the session and finished down 127.59 points, or 1.13 percent, at 11,198.45. The Nasdaq market, which had posted four consecutive gains, advanced in the early going but slumped in the afternoon to close down 30.98 points, or 1.1 percent, at 2,774.62.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index did the worst of the major gauges, skidding 19.78 points, or 1.43 percent, to close at 1,362.01.
"We had a pretty good run," said Andrew M. Brooks, senior equity trader at T. Rowe Price. "It shouldn't be cause for concern that the market's given some up today."
In fact, contended Todd E. Petzel, chief investment officer of the Commonfund Group, what was surprising was the market's optimism leading up to and immediately following the Federal Reserve move, not that there were sober second thoughts yesterday.
Technology, financial, oil, drug and airline stocks were among the chief casualties. The paper and forest products group, which was battered on Wednesday, was an isolated gaining sector after a recommendation by Merrill Lynch.
Activity was relatively light at 719 million shares on the new York Stock Exchange. In addition to the usual late-summer doldrums, flooding prevented many in the New York City area from getting to work yesterday.
Still, an initial public offering by Bamboo.com attracted lots of attention after underwriters marketed four million shares at 7. The company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., operates an Internet service that allows viewers of real estate to pan and zoom in on properties. Its stock opened at 9 1/8 and leaped to 17 9/16 at the close, with more than 24 million shares changing hands.
This made Bamboo the fourth most active stock of the day after Cisco Systems, Dell Computer and Microsoft and ahead of Intel.
Among the 30 Dow Jones blue chips, J. P. Morgan took the biggest toll, falling 4 3/8, to 134 7/8, in a weak bank group, as investors appraised Ecuador's hope of restructuring debt. Citigroup fell 1 5/16, to 47 11/16.
The next-biggest drags were Hewlett-Packard, down 2 7/16, to 102 5/8, and Procter & Gamble, down 2 3/8, to 100 1/4. They were followed by Chevron and Exxon, which lost 2 3/8 and 1 15/16, respectively.
Oil shares were weighed down by negative comment by an analyst at HSBC Securities in London who switched his view of Royal Dutch Petroleum to "reduce" from "add," helping drive the issue down 2 5/8, to 61 11/16.
Airlines, which often move opposite to oil shares, also fell yesterday, apparently in response to cuts of as much as 30 percent in seasonal leisure fares by UAL's United Airlines and Continental Airlines, resulting in the second industry sale this month. Delta Air Lines and AMR, American's parent, fell 3 3/16 each; U S Air was off 2 7/16, and UAL, Continental and Southwest Airlines slid more than a point.
The Bank of New York, the subject of a money laundering investigation, fell an additional 2 5/8, to 35 13/16.
Drug stocks declined after five consecutive advances, as analysts pointed to a rally in the dollar that tends to crimp export sales and shrinks the value of repatriated foreign profits.
Internet stocks were mostly lower, with Amazon.com losing 4 5/16, to 128 9/16, and Yahoo falling 5 7/8, to 152 11/16. Priceline.com was a conspicuous exception, jumping 7 7/16, to 72 5/8.
On the New York Stock Exchange 1,790 issues declined, while 1,191 advanced. New 52-week lows nearly doubled new highs, 85 to 43.
Stocks were narrowly mixed in major European markets but lower by more than 1 percent in Tokyo and Sao Paulo, Brazil

HEADLINE: Venezuelan Congress Fights Loss of Power

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Venezuela braced today for a political showdown, as its Congress threatened to meet on Friday in defiance of a new Constitutional Assembly that effectively shut it down and as opposition leaders accused President Hugo Chavez of manipulating the assembly to bring down democratic rule.
"This is using the Constitution to carry out a coup," said Cesar Perez Vivas, a congressional deputy and the leader of the center-right Copei group, one of two parties that has dominated Venezuelan politics since a military dictatorship gave way to democracy in 1958. 
 On Wednesday evening, the assembly, which is dominated by supporters of President Chavez, decreed a "legislative emergency" and passed a measure that strips the opposition-controlled Congress of its authority to pass laws and ordains that all of its "ordinary and special sessions are suspended."
The move came barely a week after the assembly, which was elected last month to draft a new Constitution, took similar action against the judiciary, granting itself the authority to fire judges and overhaul the court system.
Today, opposition leaders criticized the assembly's latest action as an illegal usurpation of powers and vowed to resist. Mr. Chavez has maintained that the constitutional panel enjoys unlimited powers. Earlier this month, he symbolically offered the assembly his own resignation to demonstrate its power to dismiss or reconfirm him.
In a televised speech today that was largely devoted to analysis of an economic situation that has worsened considerably since he took office in February, Mr. Chavez defended the assembly.
"In Venezuela, democracy is being born," he said. "Venezuela is coming out of tyranny. The entire world should recognize that."
Mr. Chavez, 45, who was elected with a sweeping majority last December, is a former Army paratrooper who was cashiered and imprisoned in 1992 after leading an unsuccessful coup attempt in which dozens of people died. He has vowed to carry out a peaceful "social revolution" in his country, which has the largest reserves of oil outside the Middle East and is the United States' main source of imported oil.
His opponents accuse him of seeking to install a left-wing military dictatorship. Mr. Chavez has submitted a draft Constitution that would extend his term to six years, and allow him to succeed himself in office and to promote military officers without the Senate's approval.
Among ordinary Venezuelans, however, Mr. Chavez remains wildly popular, with an approval rating above 70 percent. In the July 25 balloting to elect the Constitutional Assembly, 121 of 131 seats went to his supporters, including his wife, a brother, several former military colleagues and five former members of his Cabinet.
At first, it was expected that the assembly would focus exclusively on drafting a new Constitution -- the 26th in the country's turbulent history. By law, the body is required to finish work within six months and submit the document to a referendum for approval. But the assembly has spent much of its first three weeks extending its control over existing branches of Government.
Popular dissatisfaction with the two dominant parties and Congress, which have been criticized as corrupt and inefficient, has mounted in recent years. After the assembly was elected last month, Congress, recognizing it had little support and wishing to avoid a confrontation, decided to go into recess until October and even offered the assembly its chamber as a meeting place.
"There are times when resistance just for the sake of resistance makes no sense," Enrique Capriles, 27, a Copei deputy and the speaker of the lower house, said in explaining the legislature's action. But he also contended that "the constituted powers retain their character until the new Constitution" goes into effect, and warned that if the assembly tried to dissolve Congress, "we will react."
Ignoring that warning, the assembly voted Wednesday to limit the legislature's work to matters such as supervising the budget and communications. Lawmakers immediately responded by declaring their summer recess ended, and said that they would reconvene on Friday.
Meanwhile, the assembly proceeded with its moves to restructure the judiciary. Nearly half of Venezuela's 4,700 judges, clerks and bailiffs are estimated to be facing accusations of corruption, and the assembly has vowed to resolve those cases.
"The Constitutional Assembly has absolute powers," said Manuel Quijada, a lawyer whom the assembly has placed in charge of a special commission to revamp the courts. "The objective is that the substitution of judges take place peacefully, but if the courts refuse to acknowledge the assembly's authority, we will proceed in a different fashion."
On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled, by an 8-6 vote, that the assembly did not act unconstitutionally in assuming judicial powers. The Chief Justice, Cecilia Sosa Gomez, resigned on Tuesday, lamenting the disintegration of what she called "the last control on constitutionality and legality that existed in Venezuela" and accusing judges and Congress of caving to political pressure.
"The court simply committed suicide to avoid being assassinated," she said in a nationally televised news conference. "The result is the same: it is dead."
In an interview published today in the Spanish newspaper El Pais, Carlos Andres Perez, the former President whose overthrow Mr. Chavez sought in 1992, predicted that Mr. Chavez would himself fall from power before his first term expires. Saying that "the concentration of powers is anti-democratic," he accused Mr. Chavez of seeking "a military government that will totally wipe out the triumphs of the Venezuelan people.
"I am not one to encourage coups or violent attitudes, but it is clear what is going to happen," said Mr. Perez, who ran for a seat in the assembly but suffered a humiliating defeat. "I think the upheaval we are in will last two years, and afterward Venezuela will begin to get back on its feet, but without Chavez at its head."

HEADLINE: Victoria Journal;
In Canada's 'Lotusland,' Unhappy Is Premier's Lot

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: VICTORIA, British Columbia, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Inside the hilltop mansion of the Queen's representative here, portraits of the royal family and gleaming gold maple leafs lent a traditional air as Dan Miller was sworn in today as the new Premier of Canada's Pacific province.
But even the neo-Westminster pomp, the crystal chandeliers and the gilded mirrors failed to distract from the political instability that makes this capital seem less like London and more like La Paz. Only days ago, Mr. Miller himself, a stoop-shouldered, sad-faced man, acidly described the Premier's job as the most dangerous in the province. 
 His predecessor, Glen Clark, resigned last week, the province's third Premier in a row to quit under a cloud of scandal. It has been 20 years since voters here elected a Premier who served out his term. The new Premier, Mr. Clark's former deputy, now vows to step down as soon as his party, the New Democrats, chooses a successor -- the province's sixth Premier in a decade.
"This has been crazy," Mr. Miller said after the ceremony, referring to the take-no-prisoners political culture of British Columbia, Canada's third most populous province. "The biggest advantage that I have in this job is that I don't really want it."
In Canada's nine other provinces, politics are no more unstable than in American states. But to the rest of Canada this province's instability is endemic to what they call "Lotusland" -- a final frontier peopled by dreamers who have cut ties of family, home and religion and drifted to the nation's left coast.
In a reference to strong green tendencies here, The National Post snickered this week from Toronto, "Perhaps the Sierra Club should declare the scandal-free B.C. Premier an endangered species." The Globe and Mail recalled that in 1872 the province's Premier legally changed his name to Amor de Cosmos, or lover of the universe. Mr. Clark, the newspaper suggested, should change his name to Amor de Chaos.
Unfortunately for residents here, provincial politicians keep living up to the wacky stereotype. Voters wince when they recall the evening when television cameras in the stately parliament building here caught the Finance Minister, a woman, placing a windup dancing penis doll on the desk of a male political adversary. Or when the local head of the Liberal Party had an extramarital affair with the leader of his parliamentary delegation, explaining that they had "identical brains."
"We just shake our heads," said Jacqueline Darmanin, a piano teacher who is a transplant from Alberta, the oil-and-gas province separated from British Columbia by the mountains of the Continental Divide. "We don't know why such a different type of people go into politics here. In Alberta, you just don't have the scandals, the back-stabbing."
For many voters, the latest political scandal will long be symbolized by a grainy television video taken one night last March. Mr. Clark can be seen pacing in his living room as detectives from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched his home for documents linking him to the granting of a casino license to an old friend, Dimitrios Pilarinos.
According to police documents supporting the request for the search warrant, the casino applicant provided "renovations" -- outdoor decks -- to Mr. Clark's house and vacation cottage. The city assessor's office later placed a $16,000 value on the decks.
Lawyers for Mr. Clark dispute the value of the decks, and say he gave Mr. Pilarinos a $5,000 check. After Mr. Pilarinos tore up the check, the lawyers say, Mr. Clark gave him an Indian hunting knife.
Mr. Clark might have survived this ambiguous case if pollsters had not ranked him the most unpopular Premier in Canada. In June, only 16 percent of respondents to a survey by the Angus Reid polling organization said they would vote for him.
To some political observers, Mr. Clark was only the latest British Columbia politician to rise and fall on populist rhetoric.
A former provincial Finance Minister, Mr. Clark campaigned in the May 1996 election saying that the provincial budget was balanced. One month after winning the election, he admitted that there was actually a $140 million deficit. This year, the deficit has ballooned to almost $600 million.
Enamored of megaprojects, Mr. Clark unveiled a plan to revive shipbuilding here by constructing fast ferryboats, vowing that he had crunched the numbers "right down to the toilet paper." To date, only one of those aluminum-hulled boats has been built, coming in at $140 million over budget. This year, when he proposed a half-billion dollar expansion to Vancouver's convention center, some voters started calling their 42-year-old Premier "Glennochhio."
Saddled with the highest unemployment west of Quebec, Mr. Clark attributed the province's woes to the economic implosion in Asia, a region that receives one-third of British Columbia's exports.
Desperate to drum up popular support, Mr. Clark played two cards that usually are crowd-pleasers in the Canadian West: Ottawa bashing and Washington bashing. Vowing to be "tough with the Americans," he tried to force Washington to cut American catches of Pacific salmon by refusing to renew a longstanding lease for a Canadian-American underwater missile testing range near here.
The federal Government in Ottawa responded by cutting him out of negotiations on a salmon treaty, which was finished in early June. At the same time, Ottawa dusted off a century-old, never-used expropriation law and moved to seize from the province the seabed area where the United States had invested $100 million for torpedo testing.
"British Columbians rush to leaders who promise simple solutions, then turn on them when they can't deliver," said Norman J. Ruff, a political scientist at the University of Victoria.
Others blame the harsh political language. Trading parting shots over the weekend, Mr. Clark called Gordon Campbell, a front-runner in polls for a provincial election next year, "the scariest guy around." In return, Mr. Campbell, a Liberal, said, "I think Glen Clark is going to go down in our province's history as the probably worst Premier we've had."
David Mitchell, a former member of the legislative assembly, blames the provincial press, saying it has evolved from "watchdog to attack dog." To that, Don Hauka, political reporter for The Province, a tabloid, groaned and said, "You have to cover the show."
"How often do you get a Premier named Vander Zalm who lives in a castle, above a moat and behind a drawbridge, in an amusement park called Fantasy Gardens?" he asked, referring to Bill Vander Zalm, a Premier here until 1991, who lived in a replica Dutch castle left over from Vancouver's 1986 world fair.
Despite instability here, undeclared candidates are lining up for the race. Immediately after the oath-taking ceremony at Government House here, the best attended news conference was given by Gordon Wilson, provincial minister, amateur playwright and author of the the "identical brains" remark.
In opinion polls, the leading New Democrat is Ujjal Dosanjh, the province's Indian-born Attorney General, who was nearly beaten to death here in 1985 by a Sikh radical wielding a steel bar. In an interview today, Mr. Dosanjh complained that local politics were no longer a battle of ideals or ideas, concluding, "Politics in B.C. has become a blood sport."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Sharing Ecuador's Debt Burden, but at What Cost?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
As Ecuador is beginning the struggle to sell a restructuring plan for $6 billion of its debt to global investors, Wall Street is calculating how much the debtholders might lose. And, at the same time, investors are wondering whether this will set a precedent in future debt negotiations between troubled countries and their private creditors.
At issue is what former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin called burden-sharing, which is simply seeing that private investors pay a larger share of the official bailouts of nations on the verge of financial collapse. 
 The push for burden-sharing began after the United States and the International Monetary Fund bailed out Mexico in 1995, saving many investors from huge losses. It picked up steam after the Asian financial crisis, during which financial assistance from the United States and the I.M.F. avoided or eased losses for many bondholders while local workers, who lost their jobs, suffered much more serious consequences.
But while the Clinton Administration supported Ecuador's effort yesterday, a senior Treasury official indicated that the resulting burden-sharing in this case should not be a precedent. "The market should not view Latin America or emerging markets generally through the prism of Ecuador," the Treasury official said.
The official's comments indicate that the Administration thinks Ecuador is a special case because its problems are atypical in Latin America. The comments also indicate that officials do not want to be hemmed in by guidelines that would prevent them from applying burden-sharing case by case.
The I.M.F., which has been in talks with Ecuador on the bond restructuring and on an economic plan to help the country get back on its feet, was also supportive.
One of the big concerns among officials and bondholders is whether Ecuador has the political will to make the policy changes, including spending reductions, that might turn its economy around. Without a viable economic plan that is backed by the I.M.F. and appears credible to investors, there is not much chance the country can work its way out of its current predicament.
Ecuador's debt restructuring -- which could lead to the first default on the popular Brady bonds that became the vehicle for revamping debt of emerging-market countries at the end of the 1980's -- began on Wednesday night. In a televised speech, President Jamil Mahuad said Ecuador would delay for 30 days a $96 million interest payment due Tuesday and ask bondholders to swap their Brady bonds for new debt.
Although the details of the swap were not provided, the Ecuadorean Government will ask bondholders to reduce the amount of money it owes them. Reducing the debt burden, including interest payments, is essential to any recovery; Ecuador's $13 billion in foreign debt alone exceeds the size of its gross national product.
Jose Luis Daza, managing director for emerging markets at J. P. Morgan Securities, estimates that Ecuador will seek debt reduction of about 30 percent. In trading yesterday, the country's three main types of Brady bonds were priced from 21 cents on the dollar to 32.5 cents, and down about a penny.
The Ecuadorean Finance Minister, Ana Lucia Armijos, was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying, "What we are doing with the Brady restructuring is asking bondholders to share the burden, as international organizations are doing through the granting of resources, as governments will do through the restructuring of Paris club debt." The Paris club is the group of nations, including the United States, that have made separate loans to the governments of many emerging-market countries. Ecuador will also seek some reduction of the more than $1 billion it owes these countries.
The senior Treasury official said the Administration would encourage Ecuador to work with the I.M.F. on "a strong economic program that will lay the basis for stability and economic recovery" and to work with its private creditors to reach arrangements that "best satisfy their common interest in economic recovery." The official added that "on that basis, we would be prepared to support an I.M.F. program and a restructuring of Ecuador's debt to Paris club creditors."
This means the Treasury wants an I.M.F. agreement before negotiations with Brady bondholders.
Mr. Rubin brought burden-sharing to the fore again in a speech last October, when the global financial crisis, deepened by Russian default, was at its worst and the Clinton Administration was talking of a new international financial architecture to deal with such problems. "Private-sector burden-sharing is critical," he said then, "not only because there will not be sufficient official money for all circumstances, but also because it is absolutely essential in inducing market discipline."
Since then, no one in the Administration has set out guidelines for burden-sharing. In April, not long before he announced his resignation, Mr. Rubin repeated the call but acknowledged that he did not know how this should be done. And it appears that the Administration is still loath to establish any guidelines.
A point that may have been overlooked in all this is that the Brady bonds Ecuador is trying to restructure have already been subject to burden-sharing, as all Brady bonds are.
The bonds, named for a Bush Administration Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, were devised as a way to repackage the billions in bank loans to many Latin American countries that effectively defaulted on them in the early 1980's. The repackaging into bonds made the old loans more attractive to investors because they could be traded easily and came with various guarantees on the principal and interest.
But the essence of the Brady bond program was the agreement by the banks to reduce the the amount of debt owed them by the countries, led by Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. For example, Mexico, the first country to negotiate a Brady bond deal, got a 35 percent reduction in the face value of its outstanding bank loans.
Ecuador's Brady bond deal, which was issued in 1995, came with a 40 percent reduction.
Another issue is what kind of impact an Ecuadorean restructuring would have on other Brady bonds.
While any such reworking -- whether it results in default or not -- should have an impact on other countries' Brady's bonds, it is hard at this time to measure. Mr. Daza said one reason was that it was not yet clear how the restructuring would be done. A lot, he said, will depend on whether the exchange is carried out in a "market-friendly way."
But so far, the damage has not been that bad to other markets. According to J. P. Morgan's index of Latin American bonds, while the yield on Ecuador's bonds, compared with that on United States Treasury bonds, has skyrocketed since May, to a level 38.15 percentage points above Washington's, this so-called spread has stayed relatively stable against the debt of Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.
And Mr. Daza said he was surprised that the prices on Ecuador's debt had not fallen further, given the clear threat of default. Therefore, he said, prices have further to fall.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS -- 'Begols' and 'Dirty Water';
Fast-Food Chains Take U.S. Marketing to Europe

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Nobody knows when the custom began among travelers to Rome of turning your back to the Trevi Fountain and tossing in a coin over your left shoulder as a means of assuring your return.
Do it these days, however, and you will probably spy, over to the left and a few steps up the narrow Via di San Vincenzo, a row of tan awnings labeled Dunkin' Donuts. 
 Rome, the Eternal City, home to . . . Dunkin' Donuts? Yes. Only two months old, the little store that bears the bright colors is already selling 1,200 to 1,300 doughnuts a day to a mix of foreign tourists and Italians. For a store of only 690 square feet, a fraction of the size of the average Dunkin' Donuts in the United States, said Gianluigi Contin, president of the company that operates it, "that's not bad."
Why would Italians, raised on tasty cannoli, Neapolitan pastry and endless tiny cups of super-strong espresso, enjoy washing down fluffy donuts with American-style coffee? That is not easy to explain, but the timing seems just right as a fresh wave of fast-food establishments sweeps across not just Italy but much of Europe.
Not that selling skeptical Italians on doughnuts and drip coffee comes all that easy. The company has decked the store out in big pop plastic doughnuts, in garish shades of orange and hot pink, with fluorescent lighting. To amuse and inform customers, table-top folders ask provocatively, in Italian, "Ever tried American coffee?" then go on: "Do you think it's dirty water? If so, have an espresso. We'll never convince you." Another prods, "Ever tried a bagel? (It's pronounced 'begol')."
The fast-food chains' wave is gathering momentum as a result of a combination that includes a crisis in family-owned mom-and-pop food businesses, large fast-food franchises eager to expand into what they see as underserved territory, and investors on both sides of the Atlantic who are awash in money available at low cost and who can taste the prospect of quick growth and future earnings.
This fertile terrain prompted a group of international investors, including several from the United States, to bid enough to win the master franchise for Dunkin' Donuts in Italy and Germany, and possibly other countries. The store at the Trevi Fountain is the flagship, but the group, known as S & C International, plans to open about 110 stores in six years, roughly 70 in Germany and 40 in Italy. The first Dunkin' Donuts in Germany, in Berlin's fashionable Charlottenburg quarter, is to open by November. The next Italian store will open in October at the central Termini railway station in Rome.
The expected growth is partly a result of the realization that many big fast-food franchises have virtually saturated the United States, while Europe's fast-food map still shows large empty areas.
"There's a market there," said Mr. Contin, 35, of S & C International, noting that Italy's roughly 180,000 coffee bars are almost all individually owned, and many are in poor financial health.
And while market leaders like the McDonald's Corporation have fairly blanketed the European landscape, most other fast-food franchises are far more thinly spread. In Western Europe, for instance, Dunkin' Donuts had until now been limited to a fairly small number of stores in Britain, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain, leaving big markets like France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland bereft.
Cheeky selling techniques, combined with the appeal of almost anything American, are breaking down European resistance to fast food in many places that had long been untouched. Earlier this month, Burger hKing opened its first restaurant in Italy, in Milan, and more are to come. In July, Autogrill S.p.A., a restaurant operator controlled by the Benetton clothing group, spent almost $1 billion to acquire its big American rival, the Host Marriott Services Corporation, which operates Pizza Hut, Starbucks and Sbarro franchises in North America. It plans to expand the reach of those names into new European nooks and crannies.
Tricon Global Restaurants Inc., which was spun off last year by Pepsico Inc., has said it sees tremendous growth potential in Europe for its franchise brands Pizza Hut and KFC. Other big chains, including Starbucks, are also looking closely at large European markets, notably Germany.
"We need to expand in Europe," said Lyne Mongrain, brand marketing director for Dunkin' Donuts International, which has been owned by the big British beverage group, Allied Domecq P.L.C., since 1989.
This second wave of fast-food expansion follows a hiatus in much of the 1990's, as European economies slumped and the 15-nation European Union struggled to introduce a single currency and integrate other countries into its earlier core.
In Toti Attanasio's hometown of Catania, a Sicilian city of 378,000, the first fast-food restaurant, a McDonald's, plans to open in October. On a recent trip to Rome, Mr. Attanasio, 28, a court magistrate, stumbled on the new Dunkin' Donuts while sightseeing with his girlfriend. They were so impressed by the doughnuts, he said, that after a four-day side trip to Bologna, they made a point of returning.
"We even bought three to take home, but then ate them while we were walking down the street," he said between bites of a French cruller.
The doughnuts, at the equivalent of 98 cents each, are more expensive than in New York, where they sell for about 85 cents. But Mr. Attanasio, who said he was a fan of American culture and a collector of Bruce Springsteen recordings, described the doughnuts as a treat because they were unlike anything Italian pastry had to offer. "We Italians like to try new things," he said.
Of course, not everyone is bubbling with enthusiasm over the arrival of Dunkin' Donuts in romantic corners of Europe like the Trevi Fountain, immortalized by the voluptuous Anita Ekberg frolicking with the heartthrob Marcello Mastroianni in its dark nighttime waters.
"As long as it creates jobs, it's all right with me," said Paolo Becker, a man in his 40's who for the last 10 years has sold accessories for smokers -- fancy pipes and cigar humidors -- in a store across the street. But he added, softly: "It's a typical product of American culture -- the colors, the fake plastic doughnuts. It's not my thing."
He admitted that he had taken his daughter, who is 13, to McDonald's. But like many Europeans, he is uneasy, partly for the threat to small independent retailers, partly for the changing character of historic inner cities. And it is not just American stores that raise a certain level of ire; so do locally owned chains.
"The neighborhood used to be traditionally Italian, but have you seen the Benetton on the square?" Mr. Becker said, waving toward the Italian clothing chain's large, modern outlet directly opposite the soaring fountain with its prancing marble horses. "It used to be a historic store, called Giusti, a family haberdashery, but it died because 95 percent of the people who pass here now are tourists, often groups, and groups don't have time to stop."
His own store, he said, relied on a loyal clientele of pipe and cigar smokers from throughout Rome, generating only about 5 percent of its sales from tourists.
But that raises a difficult choice for Europeans. While many bemoan the loss of charm in their historic cities, developers and retailers are persuading city planners that American-style franchising, and the job creation and promotional spending that go with it, can help keep central cities vibrant.
"We don't want to drive out the traditional coffee bar," said Leonardo Mainella, a 27-year-old law student who works part time at the Dunkin' Donuts. "We want to be here alongside them."
Indeed, Toni Impeduglia, the new store's manager, said the developers were at pains to give the store a bit of European flair. A star Milanese architect, Matteo Thun, was called in to impart to the design a vaguely retro look, with chrome tubular chairs and plastic accessories in bright colors. American customers, used to the more pedestrian homegrown variety of Dunkin' Donuts, were impressed.
"It's trendy," said Amelia Hindi, 25, who toured Switzerland and Italy this summer after graduating from Brooklyn Law School and admitted to being startled to find a Dunkin' Donuts at the Trevi Fountain.
"Back home," she said as she sipped a coolatta, "they don't have doughnuts with lights hanging from the ceiling."
Mr. Impeduglia, 35, who heads off this fall to the Boston area for a six-week course at the Dunkin' Donuts University there, acknowledged that given the rush of summer tourism, probably 70 percent to 80 percent of the store's daytime customers are foreign tourists, though the number of Italians increases in the evenings. Come autumn, he said, he expects the percentages to reverse.
He said Italian customers do not make unfavorable comparisons with local pastry. "In Italy, we have our own pastry tradition, but you shouldn't compare the two," he said.
The same holds true for American-style coffee, he argued. In the store's first months, sales of American coffee, which costs $1 for a regular cup, have been roughly double that of espresso, which costs only 70 cents.
"It's a bit of a fashion, particularly among Italian women in their 30's and 40's," Mr. Contin said.
"It's less hysterical, you sit down to drink it," unlike espresso, which Italians gulp on the run, he said. "And there's three times less caffeine, so there's a small but widening niche."
As for bagels, Mr. Impeduglia said, Italian customers tend to look on them "as just some kind of bread." The Trevi Fountain store stocks five varieties, including onion, sesame, cinnamon and plain, and serves them with five varieties of cream cheese, including dill, salmon and plain. This fall, bagel sandwiches will go on sale, with fillings like chicken salad and boiled ham.
But with so many investors rushing in, should the fast-food industry be afraid of a European glut?
Paolo de Spirt, chairman and one of the founders of S & C International, thinks not.
"On the simple numbers of it, the number of chains in Europe is far behind that in the United States," Mr. de Spirt, a former investment banker at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said. In Europe, he said, only 16 percent of food distribution is franchised, and in some major markets, like Italy, as little as 5 percent, compared with more than 50 percent in the United States.
"The potential for growth here is enormous," he said.

HEADLINE: TV Judge Stars in Real Court Drama

BYLINE: By EMILY YELLIN 

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Louis Moore looked scared as he sat in Division 9 of the Shelby County Criminal Court here on a recent summer morning. Mr. Moore, a 19-year-old grill cook at McDonald's, knew he was going to have to go before Judge Joseph B. Brown Jr., plead guilty for his crime and hope that the judge would suspend his sentence and give him probation instead of prison.
That was nerve-racking enough. But Mr. Moore was worried further because while this was his first offense, and his first visit to court, he had seen Judge Brown in action many times before, on the year-old nationally syndicated television show "Judge Joe Brown." 
 "I'm afraid he is going to be hard and mean," Mr. Moore said, "like he is on TV."
Mr. Moore's situation illustrates the things that so many people applaud in Judge Brown. He is admired for reaching young people with his down-to-earth, tough-love approach to justice, which many believe can turn around people like Mr. Moore before they fall into a life of crime.
But the case also highlights one of the things that others criticize: he is the only judge on national television who is also a sitting judge. Many critics argue that he cannot do both jobs well.
In Memphis, where Judge Brown was a lawyer from 1974 until he became a Criminal Court judge in 1990, those two opinions about him are clashing furiously.
The Tennessee Supreme Court recently reviewed his court attendance and denied his request to have a regular substitute fill in while he is in Los Angeles taping his show.
The Commercial Appeal has written editorials criticizing his dual role, one of which began with this question: "Which court matters more to Judge Joe Brown -- the one that serves the Shelby Countians who elected him or the one created by the television executives who hired him to entertain viewers from a sound stage in Los Angeles?"
Among voters here, the judge is popular, being re-elected last year in a landslide to another eight-year term, for which he is paid $102,240 annually. Neither the producers of the show nor the judge would comment on his television salary.
Wherever he goes, including many community service events, he is asked for his autograph. His street-smart style, exemplified by the fact that he carries a pistol with him at all times, even wearing it on a holster under his robe in the courtroom, makes him a highly coveted speaker.
Recently, he told a group of women who were former convicts that by going to prison they had played into the hands of the rich, white establishment. "You are serving a great utility so that economic prosperity for the haves and the good old boys can be continued," he said.
"See, while we are acting damn fools being black against white, which we should not be since we all ought to work together, while we are distracted and polarized, what's really going on is those people are ripping us off economically."
Judge Brown, 52, who grew up in South-Central Los Angeles and graduated with honors from the U.C.L.A. Law School, has always been controversial here. He came to national attention for his creative use of alternative sentencing. It is a tactic he continues to use, routinely giving writing assignments or making defendants read "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" as part of their sentences. And most notably, he has let burglary victims take something from thieves' houses to illustrate to them how it feels to be robbed.
The judge also gained national attention when he presided over James Earl Ray's unsuccessful final efforts, before he died last year, to win a trial in the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The King family allied with Mr. Ray, who confessed to the murder and then recanted days later. Judge Brown was eventually removed from that case after an appeals court found that he was biased toward Mr. Ray.
During the Ray case, the producers of "Judge Judy" saw a profile of Judge Brown on the ABC program "Nightline." They contacted the judge, and his show was born. Last season it had five million viewers a day, second only to "Judge Judy" among the four national television courtroom shows at the time.
Stephen Gillers, professor of legal and judicial ethics at New York University Law School, said that although he did not doubt that Judge Brown was a good judge, he thought it was wrong for him to do both jobs.
"The judge must choose between court business and show business," Mr. Gillers said. "It is not fair to the court system or to the people of Tennessee."
Mr. Gillers cited several reasons for his dim view of Judge Brown's serving in both venues. "Inevitably, he will cut corners," he said. "In addition, he compromises the prestige of the court by exploiting his position outside the court."
Judge Brown disagrees, saying that argument represents a narrow interpretation of the code of ethics, and he believes he is doing nothing unethical.
"I am enhancing the public's respect for the courts," he said, "which is not as high as it has been. Judges have an obligation to advise the public about the law and judicial procedures, and my show does that. Through these shows, the public observes the application of common sense by judicial officials."
But in Judge Brown's courtroom, the concerns are more practical. For Mr. Moore, it had taken a long time for his case to come up because his lawyer had the hearing delayed while Judge Brown was taping the show, telling Mr. Moore it would be better to wait. Mr. Moore was not so sure, saying, "He's not real lenient."
When Mr. Moore finally sat down before Judge Brown, the judge told him to sit up straight. Mr. Moore explained that he had been helping a friend move last year and was unaware that the friend's car was stolen and that there was marijuana in it. Mr. Moore said the police stopped them and his friend ran, while he did not. Mr. Moore was charged with auto theft.
The judge sentenced Mr. Moore, an 11th-grade dropout, to two years of probation in the judicial diversion program, ordered that he complete his G.E.D. and take random drug tests as part of his sentence. And then, in his signature style, he said gruffly: "Quit blowing that herb, and concentrate and focus. Step down, young man, and get it together."

HEADLINE: Chances of Boeing Strike Appear to Grow

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
For more than a year, executives at the Boeing Company and leaders of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the union representing the largest number of Boeing employees, have been meeting regularly to trade ideas and work out disputes.
The not-so-subtle goal of what both sides said was a new era of cooperation between management and labor was to avoid a disruptive strike at a time when Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, is recovering from some of the worst operational turmoil in its history. 
 But with Boeing poised to deliver its "best and final offer" to the machinists today for a contract to replace one that expires next Wednesday, the likelihood that the company will be struck for the third time in 10 years appears to be growing.
"Everything we've put together for months about working together has all been bogus as far as I am concerned," said Bill Johnson, a member of the union negotiating committee and president of the Seattle local that represents 31,000 of the 44,000 Boeing workers covered by the contract. "Nothing has come across the table that is going to satisfy our members if they are going to buy into a contract."
Of course, Cassandra-like warnings are not unusual as contract negotiations head into their endgame, especially if the union thinks, as now, that the company cannot afford a strike.
For its part, Boeing sounds more optimistic. "We have been making progress," said Peter Conte, a company spokesman. "The proposal as it is coming together will address all of the employees' issues and many of the union's concerns upon entering this round of bargaining."
Still, Mr. Conte acknowledged that the company was painting green lines around the entrances to its buildings to mark how close pickets can stand. It is also certifying some managers for technical work so they can help build its jetliners if the workers walk out.
The machinists' union represents about a quarter of Boeing's total work force of 200,000 but nearly half the 100,000 at its flagship commercial-airplane division. The union and the company have been negotiating intensively at a hotel in the Seattle area since Aug. 16.
After the machinists receive the company's final offer, they will present it to their members for a vote. If the proposal does not receive a simple majority, a second vote, requiring a two-thirds majority, will be held to decide whether to strike. A walkout could come as soon as 12:01 A.M. next Thursday. (If the strike vote fails, the company's offer is automatically accepted, even though it lacks majority support.)
The last time the machinists struck, in 1995, they were out for 69 days. The event rippled through the economy of the Seattle area, because factory workers at Boeing receive some of the region's highest wages. During that walkout, the union paid out only $17.6 million in strike benefits, compared with Boeing's normal payroll of $325 million during the same period.
A strike would also affect Wichita, Kan., where 11,500 machinists work for Boeing, making the fuselages for its single-aisle 737 jets, and Portland, Ore., where the company employs 1,800 members of the union.
The workers covered by the contract earn more than $40,000 a year on average -- not including overtime, which can swell wages to more than twice that level during periods of particularly heavy production. Although the union seeks a wage increase, neither side will discuss the size of the demand.
In any event, pay is not among the main issues, which the union has identified as job security and health and retirement benefits. A survey of its members by the union found that only 5 percent thought that their jobs were "very secure." More workers thought that subcontracting work to outsiders posed a greater threat to their jobs than did competition from Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that, other than Boeing, is the world's only remaining maker of large passenger jets.
The machinists would like a say in future decisions by the company to transfer manufacturing to outside suppliers. They also want Boeing to increase retirement benefits, which the union says average $16,200 a year after 30 years on the job.
The union is also resisting the company's efforts to reduce overtime by expanding production to seven days a week, from five, and to raise the amount workers pay for health insurance, which was the biggest issue in the 1995 strike.
Mr. Conte, the company spokesman, said Boeing simply wanted to explore how best to manage escalating health care costs.
"All our positions are subject to change up until the final offer," he said. "Those are among the positions that could yet change."
The machinists entered the negotiations with confidence, because Boeing is only beginning to emerge from a costly foul-up two years ago that forced it to halt airplane production for a month and led to its first annual loss in 50 years.
Boeing's stock price, which at first plunged, has since recovered, rising 36 percent this year. But it is still not back to where it was before the crisis began. Wall Street analysts think that Boeing must improve its efficiency on the factory floor if it is to increase its profits.
"You really need to see the work force actively increasing productivity at the company," said Byron K. Callan, an aerospace analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Some think that the union may be overplaying its hand, underestimating Boeing's willingness to fight.
"We don't want a strike," Harry C. Stonecipher, Boeing's president, said in an interview in June. "We don't expect a strike. I don't think the union wants a strike. But I think both sides are perfectly willing to strike, or take a strike, if anybody gets kind of stupid or forgets what the world's all about."

HEADLINE: Bank Called Long Unaware Of Big, Suspicious Transfers

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and RAYMOND BONNER 

 BODY:
Large sums of money were moved through accounts at the Bank of New York for at least six months before the bank was aware of it, according to individuals who have direct knowledge of an investigation into Russian money laundering.
They said today that nine New York accounts that are part of the inquiry became active before March 1998, much earlier than was previously believed. 
 More than $4.2 billion that investigators suspect was tied to organized crime and corporate embezzlement in Russia passed through these accounts between early 1998 and March 1999. The bank did not begin cooperating with a Federal investigation of money laundering at the bank until September 1998.
The fact that money was filtered through the bank for at least six months before any action was taken raises questions about how well accounts and employees were supervised at the bank before the investigation was begun and will undoubtedly concern regulators.
It also is not clear why the Government allowed the accounts to remain open so long after the investigation began.
The accounts are linked to Benex, a company incorporated in London, whose exact activities are unknown.
In March of this year, the British authorities who had initially notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation about a suspected money laundering operation in June 1998 expressed concern that the inquiry was moving too slowly. Federal and state bank regulators have declined to comment on the matter.
Investigators believe that as much as $10 billion may have been moved by Russian organized crime and members of the country's political and business elite through the Bank of New York in order to hide its origins.
Some news reports have suggested that some of that money may have been diverted from loans extended by the International Monetary Fund to Russia in 1998 as part of a failed effort to stop a series of bank collapses and the crash of the ruble.
But a senior Clinton Administration official said that Attorney General Janet Reno was given a detailed briefing yesterday on the investigation and that the Justice Department did not believe, at this point, that I.M.F. funds were involved in the suspected money laundering.
The official said the amount of money involved was so great that it almost certainly did not come only from the direct profits of criminal activities. Other areas, besides the I.M.F., that investigators are studying as potential sources for the money include looted state assets and corporate corruption.
People close to the investigation said the $4.2 billion initially moved slowly through the Benex accounts but then increased to sometimes very heavy volumes before the bank began cooperating with the investigation.
Thousands of pages of records pertaining to Benex were obtained through subpoenas sent to the bank, but it could not be determined when those subpoenas were issued, information that would help make the sequence of events less murky.
People close to the investigation said the Government had requested the accounts be left open from September 1998 until last week. The accounts were closed only after The New York Times wrote about the investigation last week, these people said.
Spokesmen for the F.B.I. and the United States Attorney's Office in New York declined to comment on any aspect of the matter yesterday.
Two bank employees have been suspended since the investigation became public. People close to the investigation said yesterday that no "smoking gun" had been discovered implicating the employees. Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a Bank of New York executive who oversaw the bank's Russian business, was suspended from her job pending the outcome of the investigation.
No document has been discovered so far that directly links Ms. Kagalovsky to the suspected money laundering operation, an investigator said. But he added that it was "inconceivable," given her position, that she had not been aware of the large volumes of questionable money moving through the accounts.
Ms. Kagalovsky's lawyer has declined to comment, and she has not been charged with any wrongdoing.
The other bank executive who has been suspended, Lucy Edwards, worked in the bank's London office. Ms. Edwards has also not been charged with wrongdoing, and it has not been possible to reach her or her husband, Peter Berlin, who ran Benex, the company whose accounts are under investigation.
The people close to the investigation said the Bank of New York claimed that it did not know that Ms. Edwards was married to Mr. Berlin. They also said evidence had been found in Ms. Edwards' London home indicating that she used the Bank of New York name for dealings unrelated to her bank duties.
The name of Ms. Kagalovsky's husband, Konstantin, vice chairman of a large Russian oil company called Yukos, has also come up in connection with the Bank of New York investigation.
Mr. Kagalovsky is a former vice chairman at Menatep, a now insolvent Russian bank that once did business with Bank of New York. Investigators are examining whether Menatep accounts were laundered through the American bank.
Mr. Kagalovsky has declined repeated requests for an interview. In a statement yesterday, Menatep said that "neither the institution nor its esteemed former vice chairman can in any way reasonably be implicated" in charges of money laundering at the Bank of New York.

Builders Prodding Rebirth of Beachfront in Queens

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
For three decades, city officials have struggled to find a way to develop the Arverne neighborhood in the Rockaways, a vast expanse of beachfront land in Queens that has lain fallow since its bungalows were cleared as part of urban renewal efforts in the late 1950's and early 1960's.
Now, with the demand for housing so high and the market so tight, new houses are finally going up in the area, which is one of the few urban neighborhoods along a beach that is served by mass transit. 
 Development has come to the 308-acre Arverne Urban Renewal Area even though several grand plans for the area -- including one for a $1.2 billion sports and entertainment complex -- have yet to materialize. In the past, many of the ambitious proposals for Arverne fell victim to market forces, or just plain bad timing. City officials say that new development in Arverne is testimony not only to the strength of the economy but also reflects the neighborhood's promise.
"It was a great seaside resort in the way that Coney Island was at the turn of the century, with grand Victorian hotels and bungalows," said James F. Lima, assistant commissioner for new construction in the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
The new construction is just a beginning: 40 two-family homes on vacant lots sprinkled among the remaining houses bounded by Beach 59th and 61st Streets, Rockaway Beach Boulevard and the ocean. The builder says he particularly wants to interest local residents in the solid masonry homes.
"Basically, we believe that most of our purchasers will have lived locally and rented locally," said Vincent L. Riso, president of the Briarwood Organization, the builder. "The only necessity is that we have a buyer with good credit, income above $40,000 and a 5 percent down payment."
Residents of the area are hoping that the development will erase what is perhaps the greatest eyesore of the Rockaways.
Standing by the bay window on her porch, Maizle Morris seemed almost joyful about the grinding of bulldozers and pounding of pile drivers across the street and down the block from her home near the development.
"It's progress; I feel so happy," Mrs. Morris said of the 40 homes now being built, which are the first market-rate construction in the area in 35 years. "It's like a dream come true."
Mrs. Morris, a member of both Community Board 14 and the 52-family Arverne Neighborhood Development Organization, has been fighting for revitalization of her community since the 1970's. "All these years, they promised us everything," she said of previous city efforts. "It all fell through the cracks."
Prices for the two-family houses -- a three-bedroom home with a garage for the owner and a two-bedroom unit for possible rental -- range from $250,000 to $285,000. "It's a situation where we are purchasing the property from the city at a substantial discount, $1,000 for the land," Mr. Riso said, "and passing that discount along to the purchaser."
Under what the city calls its Urban Development Action Assistance Program, a buyer would receive real estate tax exemptions for 20 years. During the first 11 years, taxes would be payable only on the land, not the home itself. In the 12th year, the home would be 90 percent exempt, with the exemption reduced by 10 percent each year after that. Contracts have been signed for 14 of the 40 homes, Mr. Riso said, with occupancy expected next spring.
Tobias Parker, 29, a customer service representative for a credit card company, is considering buying. Mr. Parker lives in Ocean Village, a complex of 18-story rental buildings adjacent to the new houses. "I need more room," he said one recent morning. "I've got two kids and one on the way. This gives me a chance to get out of these apartments. I'm going to look into it."
Mr. Parker is eager for further development of the Arverne area. "It'll be a better community," he said, "instead of an empty lot with all of the weeds."
Previous plans for the vast, contiguous Arverne parcel, said Mr. Lima, the assistant commissioner, "have just missed the market."
In particular, he recalled a plan in the late 1980's, "costing hundreds of millions," to build out the entire 308 acres with 10,000 units of mid-rise, market-rate residential development. But then the recession hit, and the plan was abandoned.
"What came out of that," Mr. Lima said, "was a plan by the city to permit incremental, mixed-used development of single-family to mid-rise buildings with a series of public access points to the beach and public parks."
In November 1996, the city settled on developers to build two distinct projects within the urban renewal area: One was Briarwood's initial plan for 161 two-family homes; the other was for a 75,000-square-foot shopping center at Beach 73d Street, which has not yet been started.
Beyond the 40 homes now scheduled for construction, the remainder of the Briarwood project has been placed on hold while the city considers a proposal by the Reichmann family of Canada to build a $1.2 billion sports and entertainment complex called Destination Technodome in the urban renewal area.
"The community was pretty clear about wanting to build the economic base of the Rockaways, particularly capitalizing on the site's potential as a tourist and recreation destination," Mr. Lima said. "There's a real interest in incorporating a golf course, between Beach 56th and 44th, as part of a park, and an option for movie theaters, a hotel."
Mrs. Morris is hopeful. "Property values will be accelerated," she said. "I bought this home, believe it or not, for $38,000 in 1972, and got reappraised for $260,000 in 1995 when I refinanced."
If promises are finally kept, she said, "it will be a community instead of vacant, barren lands."

Atlanta Faces Lawsuit Over Affirmative Action

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Aug. 26

 BODY:
A nationwide anti-affirmative action group sued Atlanta today over its policy of setting aside a third of city contracts for businesses owned by women and minority members.
The group, the Southeastern Legal Foundation, had threatened for months to file the Federal suit, while Mayor Bill Campbell and other black politicians vowed to fight "to the death." 
 Atlanta, birthplace of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a symbol of black economic achievement, started the program in 1975 under Maynard Jackson, the city's first black Mayor.
The foundation's president, Matthew J. Glavin, began his challenge on June 14 with a letter to Mayor Campbell demanding that the city abandon the program or face a lawsuit. Mr. Glavin said today that he was still willing to negotiate, though he said any settlement would require that the city abolish the program.

Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that the city has denied a permit for a controversial youth rally in Harlem, but organizers of the event angrily vowed to proceed with or without the city's permission.
Mr. Giuliani said the permit was denied because the organizers, whom he has called "reprehensible" for their anti-white and anti-Semitic comments, failed to submit a proper application. "They had an opportunity to properly apply," he said. "They haven't. So as far as we're concerned it's over." The Mayor did not specify how the group's application was improper. 
 Khallid Abdul Muhammad, the primary organizer of the event, called the Million Youth March, said he will first seek to overturn the city's decision in court. But if that course fails, he added, the rally, scheduled for Sept. 4, will go forward anyway.
"I believe in the philosophy and the ideology of peace if possible, but violence when necessary," Mr. Muhammad said yesterday.
When the Million Youth March was held last year, after a court order permitting the rally, dozens of people were injured as hundreds of police officers and rally participants clashed.
While saying yesterday that the objective of the rally was to call attention to education and economic empowerment for black youths -- "We are not going for a war in the streets," he said -- he also insisted on his "God given" right to lead a rally of young blacks in the streets of Harlem.
"I will be there," he said, emphasizing each word. "For the sake of my people, for the sake of our youth, I will be there."
Just as firmly, Mr. Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir promised that the city would act to prevent the rally from being held without the required city permits.
"This is a group that talks about hurting people and hate," Mr. Safir said. "There is no permit. If they attempt to march, they won't be allowed to, and that will be the end of it." He did not elaborate on what methods the Police Department would use.
Yesterday's events -- announcement of the permit denial, the promised legal challenge, the charged words of confrontation -- mirrored the events leading up to last year's Million Youth March. Once again, Mr. Giuliani dismissed the march organizers as marginal hatemongers who are playing to the news media. Once again, Mr. Muhammad accused the Mayor of oppressing black people and pandering to Jews who resent Mr. Muhammad's history of anti-Semitic remarks -- epithets so extreme that he was suspended in 1994 from his position as spokesman for the Nation of Islam.
"Seems like deja vu," Mr. Muhammad said in an interview outside Sistas' Place, a jazz cafe in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn that is serving as the headquarters for the rally.
As he spoke, several passing cars honked, the drivers sticking out raised fists or calling words of support to Mr. Muhammad, who was dressed in combat boots and black fatigues.
One woman pulled over to tell him she planned to be at the event no matter what. "These devils won't write that," he told her, gesturing toward three reporters.
In his announcement yesterday, Mr. Giuliani said the permit was denied because Mr. Muhammad's group, the New Black Panther Party, had refused to "comply with the parameters" of a Federal appeals court ruling last year that gave the organization permission to demonstrate then for four hours on six blocks along a section of Lenox Avenue known as Malcolm X Boulevard.
There was confusion over the timing of the denial of the permit. Asked when the decision was made, Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that it was made "about three or four days ago."
Yet the day before, when asked by reporters whether the march should be allowed, Mr. Giuliani declined to answer, and he made no mention of the permit having been denied. Nor did City Corporation Counsel Michael D. Hess mention that there had been a decision when he spoke late Wednesday afternoon with Roger S. Wareham, an attorney for the march.
According to Mr. Wareham, Mr. Hess said that he wanted to work out an agreement and avoid the necessity of going to court. In an interview, Mr. Hess said the final decision was made yesterday, when the Mayor announced that the permit had been denied.
Mr. Muhammad said march organizers have agreed all along to abide by the terms of that ruling. In their most recent letter to the city, dated Monday, a lawyer for the march organizers said that they "fully intend to function within the spirit" of that court decision. But in the same letter, the lawyer went on to request additional city permits for a 17-block parade to the rally site at 118th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard.
"The conveners are only demanding equal treatment before the law," the lawyer, Jomo Thomas, wrote.
Mr. Muhammad said it was Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Safir who were defying the ruling and "now trying to rewrite the white Constitution of America." He said the two were "rattling the saber" to confuse and frighten those who might be inclined to attend the rally. "They are wickedly wise," he said. "They want to minimize this new black power movement."
But Mr. Giuliani yesterday pointedly noted that Mr. Muhammad has lost the backing of Harlem's leading politicians, who last year supported the march even as they condemned Mr. Muhammad for his comments about Jews and whites. On Wednesday, for example, the most powerful political figure in Harlem, Representative Charles B. Rangel, called on blacks to boycott the march.
"I have to commend all of the political leaders in the community for supporting the city's position," Mr. Giuliani said. "I think that it shows a great deal of independence and courage to do that, and a willingness to take a look again at a set of facts in which they had a different position last year."
Mr. Rangel, slightly uncomfortable at being the recipient of mayoral praise, declined yesterday to support Mr. Giuliani's decision to deny a permit for the march. "The city has done this before and the courts clearly overruled," he said. "Anybody has the right to do anything they want, but I think it is in the community's best interest to ignore these spokespeople for racism and hatred."
Yet Mr. Rangel's call for a boycott -- and the likelihood that a court will now decide the question of whether to grant a rally permit -- largely defused any potential political fallout for Mr. Giuliani, who is considering running for the United States Senate.
Mr. Giuliani's likely opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, announced yesterday that she, too, opposed the march. But through a spokesman, Mrs. Clinton declined to offer an opinion on whether the organizers should be denied a permit.
"That's up to the appropriate authorities to determine," the spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said. "Mrs. Clinton certainly joins with community leaders in opposing the march."

HEADLINE: Library Users Can't Afford to Pay

 BODY:

To the Editor:
John Derbyshire (Op-Ed, Aug. 24) wants to impose fees on library users to make reading a magazine on a library computer more like signing up for a subscription at home. While allowing "exemptions for kids, students and retirees," Mr. Derbyshire's proposal strikes at the heart of the free access -- for everyone -- that makes public libraries the engines for equality that they are today. 
 A Federal study released in July by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration revealed that unemployed Americans who use the Internet outside the home rely on public libraries at almost three times the rate of the general population. People earning less than $20,000 a year are more than twice as likely to rely on libraries for Internet access as are Mr. Derbyshire's "middle-class magazine addicts."

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
Foreign, Not Far

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
In Paris, the familiar eight-sided red street signs say "STOP." The Academie Francaise, the guardian of linguistic purity, utters not a peep of complaint. But in Montreal, where these matters are deemed crucial to cultural identity, the signs say "ARRET."
The proud old Queen Elizabeth Hotel, which dates from Canada's days as a dominion, is now Le Reine Elizabeth, never mind what the chatelaine of Buckingham Palace calls herself. In Montreal, Eaton's department store, a Canadian tradition for generations, is now just plain Eaton; the possessive ending was amputated because the authorities ruled it too un-French. They even tried unsuccessfully to force a local stonecutter to take down his sign; it was bilingual, O.K., but the two languages were English and Hebrew. 
 There is a serious side to all of this opera bouffe, of course. It is a continuing manifestation of the deep frustration and resentment that Quebec's Francophones feel toward Canada's top-heavy Anglophone majority, which has always monopolized the economic high ground here. That there was widespread discrimination until fairly recently is beyond dispute; for years English-speaking clerks in some shops shunned French-speaking customers.
Twice in the last two decades hard feelings have pushed Quebec close to separation from Canada, with severe and lasting consequences for Montreal, even if the city itself voted no. The issue still percolates, never very far beneath the surface. "Je me souviens," the license plates on Quebec cars say, "I remember," as if warning that past slights will one day be avenged.
But the visiting, linguistically challenged American need not fear. Most of the Montrealers one encounters speak excellent English, though they delight in encountering an American with a smattering of French. Like us, they laugh at signboard Franglais that has escaped the language cops, like "Le Pit Stop" and "Poulet BBQ."
Often billed as the second-largest French-speaking city in the world, Montreal is delightfully, idiosyncratically "foreign." Yet under its skin, says Morley Safer, the Canadian-born CBS correspondent, it is a lot like New York, which is something no one would ever say about Toronto.
In summer, when the sun shines bright for a few precious weeks, the people of Montreal spill into parks and sidewalk cafes and onto boats in the broad St. Lawrence River, which lies at their doorstep. The jazz festival draws 1.5 million enthusiasts a year, and there are also festivals of bikes and jokes, hot-air balloons and chamber music. Dragon-boat races, fireworks competitions, a kite-flying derby, a Beer Mundial and the Carifiesta help pack the calendar from May to August. Sometimes you'd swear you were in Rio.
In winter, when as much as eight feet of snow often falls on the city, Montrealers move underground, into a well-lighted maze of passages that connect a half-dozen downtown malls, 30 movie theaters and 7 major hotels. People shrug at ice storms like one that knocked out power to 1.4 million households in January 1998. After a few days the good times roll on.
 
A Parade of Nationalities
The fact is, Montreal is one of the hemisphere's most cosmopolitan cities, a place that has room not only for Francophones and Anglophones but also for "Allophones" -- people whose first language is Arabic or Spanish or Russian or whatever. Brian Moore, the Ulster-born novelist who worked in Montreal for a decade as a reporter, always remembered something that caught his attention on his first trip in from the airport. It summed up the city for him: a shop calling itself the Notre-Dame-de-Grace Kosher Meat Market.
Drive or walk up Boulevard St.-Laurent, which climbs from the Old Port toward the distant Laurentians, and you will witness a grand march of nationalities: on the sidewalks, in the shops and above all in the restaurants of this food-mad city.
People call the boulevard "the Main," and in theory it separates the French east side of town from the English west side. But the barrier is porous at best, and the Main itself is polyglot. You will hear Chinese, Vietnamese and Malay spoken at the bottom, and then, higher up, especially between Roy and Duluth Streets, Thai, Slovak, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Portuguese.
A couple of blocks over, and you're on Rue St.-Urbain, the main stem of Duddy Kravitz's not entirely fictional world. It's no longer quite as Mordecai Richler described it in his 1959 novel "The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz," with a cigar store, grocery store and fruit man on each corner, outside staircases everywhere and "an endless repetition of precious peeling balconies, and waste lots making the occasional gap here and there."
The Jews have moved up and on, and some of them, like the whisky-making Bronfmans, are now leading citizens of Montreal, Canada and the wider world. Other immigrants have taken their place and learned what it is like, as Mr. Cohen told Duddy, to "land in this country with three words of English and 50 cents in your pocket."
Not many Americans know it, and not many American schools teach it, but Montreal played a fascinating if minor role in the American Revolution. The rebellious colonists hoped to enlist Canadians in their struggle against Britain, and in November 1775, seven months after Lexington and Concord, Gen. Richard Montgomery captured Montreal without much of a struggle, forcing the British Governor of Quebec, Maj. Gen. Guy Carleton, to withdraw.
Presumably to vent their political passions, American troops defaced a bust of George III that stood in the Place d'Armes, where today stands a statue of Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve, the founder of Montreal. In April 1776, a group of envoys sent by Congress, headed by Benjamin Franklin, took up temporary residence in Montreal. But even after he was reinforced by troops led by Benedict Arnold, Montgomery was unable to drive Carleton from Quebec City, and Franklin and company headed back south in 1777.
The house where the Americans lived and worked, known as Chateau Ramezay, has been preserved as a museum. It is one of the hundreds of handsome gray sandstone buildings that have made Vieux Montreal one of the most attractive 18th- and 19th-century neighborhoods anywhere on the continent, where you can easily trace the city's evolution from a trading post to a French town to a British city to today's modern, French-dominated metropolis.
Head first for the striking, brilliantly conceived new museum at Pointe-a-Calliere, where Montreal began. Built over extensive excavations, which you can visit, it mounts changing exhibitions on the city's history and boasts a bilingual multimedia show that is not only informative but also witty, in the style of Monty Python. Don't miss the lookout atop the museum's tower, where you can scan the city skyline and the site of the Expo '67 World's Fair.
A financial failure, the fair left behind one of Buckminster Fuller's geodesic domes, built as the United States exhibit, which now houses an environmental center; a French pavilion that has been turned into the Montreal Casino, and Habitat, Moshe Safdie's pioneering modular apartment block, a sensation at the time and highly popular with tenants ever since.
Stroll down Rue St.-Paul, a cobblestone street, to get the full flavor of Old Montreal, good and bad. Concentrate on the stout, honest architecture of the houses, churches and warehouses and try to ignore the cheesy souvenir shops that fill most of them. Among the highlights are the Marche Bonsecours, with a tin dome, and Place Jacques-Cartier, filled with tubs of geraniums in summer, and the Hotel de Ville, or City Hall, where Charles de Gaulle, ever the rabble-rouser, made a speech in 1967 that ended with the words, "Vive le Quebec libre!" ("Long Live Free Quebec!")
Just a few blocks away is the Place d'Armes, which for centuries was the city's focal point, near the heart of the old financial district. Around it stand the imposing neo-classical office of the Bank of Montreal; the Art Deco Aldred Building (1930), inspired by Rockefeller Center, then under construction, and the quite extraordinary Notre Dame Basilica, a Gothic Revival whoop-de-do in red, gold, white and a lot of sky-blue that can seat 3,800 worshipers.
 
Excellent Acoustics
When someone told me that the pop diva Celine Dion, a Quebec girl, had been married in a gala ceremony in the basilica, I could not resist the thought that it looked like a set for a Cecil B. De Mille movie, executed by A. W. N. Pugin, who decorated London's Houses of Parliament in a vividly polychromatic "Gothic" style. The church has excellent acoustics, if dubious esthetics, and my wife, Betsey, and I had the good fortune to hear a concert there this summer by the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Charles Dutoit, its Swiss-born music director. In 22 years Maestro Dutoit has made the orchestra the most admired in Canada, while also serving as music director of major orchestras in Paris and Tokyo. The Montreal Symphony has played in Europe, Asia and Latin America during 16 foreign tours, almost one a year; and since 1982 it has appeared annually at Carnegie Hall. Its work is copiously represented on CD's.
The big counting houses began moving from Old Montreal in the 1970's to new buildings in the newer sections of the city or, in many cases, to Toronto. Even the Bank of Montreal now has a major headquarters there.
Bell Canada has stayed, ensconced in a tower near Dorchester Square, the heart of the new downtown. So has Molson, brewer and owner of the deeply beloved but recently floundering Montreal Canadiens, who play in the Molson Center (nickname: the Keg), having forsaken the sporting temple known as the Forum. There, Rocket Richard and Boom-Boom Geoffrion wrote hockey history. Over the years the Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup 24 times.
But one undeniable consequence of Quebec's repeated flirtation with independence has been an episodic flight of businesses from Montreal. When the political mood is calm, economic life flourishes; when referendums on separation loom, recession strikes. At the moment, with independence on the back burner after having been voted down decisively in 1980 and very narrowly in 1995 -- by only 52,000 votes, in fact -- Montreal is enjoying a mini-rebound.
Still, almost half a million "Anglos," as they are called here, have left town in the last 23 years, and the children of many Anglos who remain do not return after college. Investment dollars are hard to come by.
"Economically speaking, Montreal could be a huge, beautiful tree," said Derek H. Burney, the former Canadian Ambassador to the United States, who lives here. "But with the future in doubt, it's only a bonsai."
Some Montreal Anglos feel that they live under cultural siege, and it is certainly true that Montreal and Quebec stand well apart from the rest of Canada, and not just because of language. (Canadian French, by the way, is no more Parisian than American English is Oxonian. The word "depanneur," to take one example, means convenience store in Canada, repair man or repair shop in the old country.)
Quebecers smoke more and get divorced more than other Canadians. They are forbidden, unlike other Canadians, to turn right on red. But their isolation enriches their cultural life, in a way. In most of Canada television programming comes mostly from the United States, but in Quebec 70 percent is produced in Canada. French-Canadian theater flourishes, as does French-Canadian literature, partly because they meet such a great need.
The leading English theater in Montreal, the Centaur, is housed in the creatively adapted old stock exchange. In the coming season Gordon McCall, the artistic director, plans to mount several Irish and American works, including "The Crucible" by Arthur Miller, but also, in translation, a play by Michel Tremblay, the best known of French-Canadian playwrights. Mr. Tremblay is more often produced by the outstanding French-language Rideau Vert Theater.
The center of the performing arts in Montreal is the Place des Arts, a complex of five theaters and concert halls, begun at a time of growing French cultural awareness in the 1960's. It includes the Montreal Contemporary Arts Museum, which concentrates on Canadian and particularly Quebec artists, and the all-purpose, 2,982-seat Salle Wilfrid Pelletier.
This is the home base for Mr. Dutoit's musicians, the up-and-coming young Montreal Opera and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, which was founded in 1958 by Ludmilla Chiriaeff, who more or less single-handedly created a lively dance scene in Montreal. It has been led since 1989 by Lawrence Rhodes, a highly regarded American dancer. Les Ballets Jazz de Montreal is another ornament of the local ballet stage.
The Montreal troupe best known abroad is the Cirque de Soleil, which has grown from modest origins -- a pooling of talents by street performers in 1984 -- into a global phenomenon, seen to date by 18 million people. It is a circus without animals, but not without genius. At the moment two of its seven companies are performing in Las Vegas, one at Disney World in Florida, one in Biloxi, Miss.; one is touring North America, one is touring Europe, and one is traveling in the Pacific. Next year is Montreal's chance.
But this city's well-developed taste for the innovative, the surreal, the avant-garde, lights up the Cirque's performances everywhere.
 
Shimmering Towers
To get a good picture of what Montreal has been up to in the last two decades, stand on the little platform on Rue Cathcart, with your back to I. M. Pei's Place Ville-Marie, which helped to establish the new, revitalized downtown when it opened in 1962. You will be looking up Avenue McGill College toward McGill, Canada's premier English-speaking university (its premier university of any kind, to venture into political incorrectness). It scrambles up the steep flank of the overgrown hill for which Montreal is named, Mount Royal, which was landscaped by the American Frederick Law Olmsted.
Most of Canada's best post-modern architects have been employed by the builders of the shimmering skyscrapers on either side of the avenue. Peter Rose, of whom more in a moment, helped design the rose-and-pale-blue Montreal Trust building at No. 1500. But nothing here matches the ninth-floor dining room of the Eaton store on Rue St.-Catherine, which crosses the avenue. Perfectly preserved, it was decorated in 1931 by the Frenchman Jacques Carlu in the Art Deco style of the trans-Atlantic liner "Ile-de-France." Eaton has just announced plans to liquidate; it is not yet clear what will happen to the spectacular dining room.
At the top of Avenue McGill College, just before the university gates, you will reach Rue Sherbrooke, Montreal's Fifth Avenue, which is lined with hotels, antiques shops and fashion outlets, many of which sell Canada's fine furs. Here, in the so-called Golden Square Mile, where once lived the Britons, most of them Scots, who controlled three-quarters of Canada's entire wealth at the turn of the last century, stand the McCord Museum, a historical collection with fine Indian artifacts, and the Museum of Fine Arts.
Mr. Safdie, the Israeli architect, designed the newer of the art museum's two buildings, which houses both its international collections and the superb special exhibitions in which it has specialized in recent years.
In the former you will find portraits by Memling and Rembrandt, a pair of riveting grisailles by Mantegna and a string of excellent 20th-century pictures by Picasso, Feininger and Leger, among many, many others.
The current temporary exhibition, which closes on Oct. 17, is "Cosmos: From Romanticism to the Avant-Garde," which traces artists' conceptions of, and reactions to, remoter corners of the world and outer space. Goya looks at balloons, Moran at Yellowstone, Church at icebergs, van Gogh at the sun and stars, Calder at the solar system, Kiefer at the heavens, all struggling for answers to questions that none of us understand, along with Malevich, Kupka, Delauney, Hartley and Balla.
It is a gem of insight.
 
Economic Plants
And the visual delights of this island city of 1.8 million, a port 994 miles from the Atlantic Ocean, run on and on. Beneath the Museum of Fine Arts (and hence a bit difficult to find) is an excellent Decorative Arts Museum. Sharply focused on the 20th century, it was designed by the Canadian-born Frank O. Gehry in a style as low-key as his Bilbao museum is flamboyant.
Mr. Rose was the architect of the Canadian Center for Architecture a few blocks away. Financed by Phyllis Lambert, a Bronfman heiress, it may well be the best of its kind anywhere. Its exhibitions (at the moment, Carlo Scarpa) and the exhibitions elsewhere to which it lends are enriched by a collection of more than a quarter-million books, prints, models and photos.
Fifteen minutes to the northeast, finally, is Montreal's fabulous Botanic Garden, exceeded in size only by Kew in London. Extensive greenhouses, including a wonderful array of "economic plants" -- did you know that strychnine grew in Burma? -- are followed by annuals, perennials and acres of trees, including Canada's birches, spruces and, of course, maples.
When beauty pales, you can visit the notably ugly Olympic Stadium nearby, which has the additional virtue of a retractable roof that no longer retracts. No wonder the Expos, who play there, are one of the sorriest teams in baseball, one that sometimes seems to exist mainly to sell the stars it develops to others. No wonder fewer than 10,000 show up for most home games. No wonder the team is seriously considering a move to Washington.
But hey, your greenback is worth $1.50 in Montreal. Who cares whether the stadium works or not?
 
Parlez Canadien?
 
Montreal is about 335 miles from Manhattan. Here is a sampling of attractions, and travel information. Prices are in United States dollars, figured at $1 to $1.50 Canadian.
 
Where to Stay
 
AUBERGE DU VIEUX PORT, 97 Rue de la Commune Est, (514) 876-0081. This 27-room package of charm, tucked into a waterfront building in Old Montreal, is marred only by a somewhat clamorous cafe on the ground floor. Guest rooms have exposed stone or brick walls, polished floors and brass headboards; an appealing little restaurant, Les Remparts, occupies the basement. Double rooms: $90 to $167.
 
BONAVENTURE HILTON, 1 Place Bonaventure, (514) 878-2332. The hotel sits atop a fortresslike exhibition complex in the city center, but once you take the express elevator to the three top floors, that seems irrelevant. There, a lobby decorated with bonsai and Japanese screens awaits you, plus an outdoor pool that you can enter from indoors in cold weather, and a lush two-acre garden, complete with waterfall. The rooms are fresh and modern. Double rooms: $148.
 
LOEWS HOTEL VOGUE, 1425 Rue de la Montagne, (514) 285-5555. A stylish, low-key hotel, rather European in style, lurks behind a pink facade across from Ogilvy, the carriage-trade department store, and down the street from the Museum of Fine Arts. The bedrooms boast silk fabrics, the bathrooms boast whirlpool tubs, and the snug little lobby bar welcomes one and all. Double room: $200 to $300.
 
RITZ-CARLTON, 1228 Rue Sherbrooke Ouest, (514) 842-4212. Montreal's grandest hotel, smack in the middle of the Square Mile, is an Edwardian dowager, built in 1912 and updated with style. Brass elevator doors in the lobby, country antiques in some rooms and proper keys, not plastic key cards, are all welcome reminders of the past; electronic safes bespeak the modern era. Elizabeth Taylor was once married there, but a lot of places can make that claim. Double room: $164 to $234.
 
Where to Eat
 
L'EXPRESS, 3927 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 845-5333. A mere sliver of a room where the buzz never stops. With marble tables, oxblood-red walls and checkerboard tiles on the floor, it's a convincing evocation of 1930's Paris. So is the food: pot-au-feu, calves' liver with tarragon, onglet with shallot butter and frites, to say nothing of a grandmother-worthy floating island under a dome of brittle caramel. If I lived in Montreal, I'd head to L'Express for lunch several times a week.
 
JONGLEUX CAFE, 3434 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 841-8080. This split-level restaurant (it's not really a cafe) is the latest venture of Nicolas Jongleux, a talented young Frenchman. The service is slow and the wine list needs work, but dishes like pork cheeks, braised with vegetables in tomato bouillon and topped with cheesy ravioli, combine finesse and peasant robustness.
 
MEDITERRANEO, 3500 Boulevard St.-Laurent, (514) 844-0027. California in Quebec, a brassy, trendy spot with decor faintly reminiscent of the Normandie and glass walls that slide back in summer. The glistening veal chop, big as a bass fiddle, resting on a hill of spinach, epitomizes the modern culinary approach, and the Italian and American wines match it perfectly.
 
LE PASSE-PARTOUT, 3857 Boulevard Decarie, (514) 487-7750. Trained by Charles Barrier, a legendary chef in the Loire Valley, New York-born James MacGuire is Montreal's premier baker. His incredibly moist sourdough puts San Francisco to shame. The modest restaurant next door, more Montparnasse than Montreal, serves "simple things," he says, but they are all perfect: gutsy salmon that he smokes himself, rilletes and terrines that he makes himself, maybe a masterly estouffade of lamb. Try the lovely little French country wines, like the apple-scented Cheverny, which cost three times nothing.
 
SCHWARTZ'S, 3895 Boulevard St.-Laurent, (514) 842-4813. Officially the Delicatessen Hebraique de Montreal, Schwartz's is the size of a luncheonette, and just as chic. The raison d'etre here is smoked meat, a dry-cured Montreal beef similar to pastrami. Piled high on mustard-smeared rye, it makes a delectable sandwich. Warning: the cholesterol-averse will wince.
 
TOQUE, 3842 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 499-2084. Unlike the critics, who raved, the New York public failed to embrace Normand LaPrise's Manhattan venture, Cena, which closed this summer. In Montreal he is the king of the mountain. In dining rooms decked out in primary colors, he serves inventive dishes based on adroit combinations of carefully chosen local products. The spice-glazed eel with green beans, the cold yellow tomato soup with rice vinegar and basil oil, and the caramelized fig tart all made me sigh with delight. The service is every bit as good as the food: young, savvy and jolly.
 
Attractions
 
CANADIAN CENTER FOR ARCHITECTURE, 1920 Rue Baile, (514) 939-7026. "Carlo Scarpa, Architect: Intervening With History," through Oct. 31.

HEADLINE: An Incandescent Coney Island of the Mind

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

 BODY:
In the all-too-brief best of times at Coney Island, elephants in jeweled blankets sat on their tails and waved their plump forelegs in the warm Atlantic breeze.
Perched atop a water slide called Shoot the Chutes, the big-bottomed beasts came thundering down, one by one, to smack the water as only falling elephants can, drenching and delighting paying customers at an amusement park called Dreamland. 
 When Dreamland burned to the ground in 1911, a smaller, sadder water spectacle was built on the same stretch of beach. To control costs, pigs replaced pachyderms. Splashes were smaller and so were the crowds. As Coney Island slid still further into dereliction, pigs followed elephants into unemployment and the water slide disappeared. Carnival operators tried to delight New Yorkers with cockroach races.
The devolution of the amusement park in the American imagination can be quantified. In 1910, when there were 92 million people in the United States, there were 1,500 amusement parks. Today there are an estimated 273 million Americans and just 600 amusement parks, according to the National Amusement Park Historical Association.
Roller coasters, the signature contraption of the amusement-park era, also took a death-rattle dive. There were 1,520 in 1920, but just 145 by 1979. Nostalgic thrill-seeking has since pushed the number of roller coasters up to 550.
Numbers, though, cannot explain what has been lost at Coney Island, the amusement park that invented amusement parks, not to mention the hot dog. For a splendid decade at the turn of the century Coney Island transcended the sleazy carny craft of separating chumps from their money. It drew daily crowds of 90,000 at a time when 20,000 at a baseball game was a memorable event. Adorned by minarets and spires and bedizened by more than million lights, Coney Island embodied what has been called the "architecture of exhilaration." It connected with New York, America and the world in a way that no other amusement park has done before or since, offering visitors not just a good time, but a jolt of incandescent wonder.
To hear about what has been lost, one can drive to an apartment on the Upper West Side, pick up a novelist named Kevin Baker and head out to Coney Island. There, amid the cackling of sea gulls, the rumble of subway trains and the sick-sweet smell of deep-fat-fried clams, Mr. Baker, author of "Dreamland" (HarperCollins, 1999), will rhapsodize about a time when a visit to Coney Island was essential to understanding the American experience. "What got me writing was a show they had in Dreamland called 'Fighting Flames,' " he said.
"A fake tenement was set on fire and you would see the fake Fire Department run out and douse it. Fake tenants would dive from windows. New Yorkers who lived in constant fear of this happening in their own fire-trap tenements on the Lower East Side would actually pay money to come out here and see this. It really struck me that a lot of Coney Island had become the pageant of their lives, a pageant in which they would see their best hopes and worst fears for the future played out."
The decayed look of Coney Island gives Mr. Baker's stories an almost painful poignancy. It's a fallen city by the shore where weeds are swallowing a rotting roller coaster called the Thunderbolt, where a weather-bleached sign on a sideshow trailer advertises the "orld's smallest horse," where low-income housing projects tower over the garish remnants of a third-rate carnival.
In his novel, which draws heavily on his 10 years as chief historical researcher for Harold Evans's 1998 book "The American Century," Mr. Baker uses Coney Island as a device to illuminate what it was like to be alive in turn-of-the-century New York. What is most striking about the amusement-park world that Mr. Baker recreates is the cruelty that Coney Island routinely inflicted on its patrons.
A trick elevator sends people crashing to the ground. A greased floor induces fun-seekers of all ages to fall on their faces. Electrified benches shock patrons seeking rest, encouraging them to shake a leg and spend more money.
"There was a great deal of humiliation involved," said Mr. Baker, 41, whose novel has been optioned to Leonardo DiCaprio's film production company and who has a two-book contract with HarperCollins to write a prequel and sequel to "Dreamland." "The most amazing humiliation was after a ride called the Steeplechase. When you got off the horse, you would have to go across this area where jet streams of air would blow up women's skirts. A totally mad-looking dwarf would attack you with a cattle prod for the benefit of your fellow New Yorkers who were watching from the laughing gallery of the Blowhole Theater."
Mr. Baker contends that the periodic pain of having fun at Coney Island was an echo of the deeper and more persistent misery of living in New York when it was struggling to digest the largest influx of immigrants in its history. It was a time when fathers deserted families, when mothers worked 16-hour days, when struggling immigrants made ends meet by taking in roomerkehs, or boarders, three of whom would often rent eight-hour shifts in a single bed. And out on the streets there was a poisonous mix of gangsters, corrupt police officers and the politicians who used them.
The plot of "Dreamland" grows out of a made-up feud between two real New York gangsters, circa 1910. The bad guy is Gyp the Blood, whose real name was Harry Horrowitz and who was really a sadistic bouncer at cheap dance halls on the Lower East Side. Gyp's specialty was breaking a man's back by bending him backward over his knee.
Gyp is doing exactly that at the start of the novel when he gets whacked over the head by a shovel. The gangster with the shovel is Mr. Baker's hero, Kid Twist, whose real name was Max Zweibach and who really did kill six men. In "Dreamland," though, Kid has a sense of justice and a powerful love for a seamstress who turns out to be Gyp's sister.
After creasing Gyp's head with the shovel, Kid hides out in Coney Island. He takes a room in a hotel turned bordello that is shaped like an elephant. Like nearly everything in the novel, the elephant brothel was a real establishment.
Mr. Baker's exuberantly descriptive novel uses the gangster's exile as a device to walk readers through three spectacular amusement parks, Dreamland, Luna Park and Steeplechase, which opened in Coney Island from 1897 to 1904. Before movies and newsreels, they made Coney Island the place to go not only for rides, games and cheesy trips to the moon (where green dwarves served cheese), but also for a glimpse of how the real world worked. They re-enacted pivotal historical events like the Johnstown Flood and the Boer War. The line between reality and re-enactment was sometimes difficult to discern.
"When the Boer War was over in 1902, combatants came to Coney Island to star in a show about the war," said Mr. Baker. "The show went bust and the players went down to South American to fight as mercenaries. They went from real war, to fake war and back to real war."
Reality asserted itself with a vengeance when Dreamland burned down in 1911. The other two parks soon lost their shimmer. Huge crowds, often a million people a day, still came out to Coney Island until the late 1950's. They came to swim and play and cool off, but not to sate their imagination. Movies and television had long since stolen away that role.
Luna Park burned in 1944, and Steeplechase hung on until it was closed in 1964.
Before he was driven back to Manhattan and returned to Manhattan, Mr. Baker lamented the passing of what he called "hands-on entertainment."
"You listen to a radio, you watch a screen," he grumbled. "You don't have a dwarf poke you with a cattle prod."

HEADLINE: Trade-Deficit Dangers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Alan S. Blinder (Op-Ed, Aug. 24) may have overlooked the real menace of the underlying trade deficit to our economic health. A combination of things, like reinvigoration of the world's economies and signs of trouble here (suggested by rising interest rates), could prompt at least some deficit-balancing capital to repatriate. Signs that others may lose confidence in the United States as the best store of wealth could prompt a "run on the bank" mentality, which could prompt further dollar weakness and capital withdrawal. 
 A weakening dollar could allow domestic producers to discover the pricing power that has been missing the last several years and be tempted to meet strong consumption at higher prices by bidding up for labor and other resources.
The trade deficit is not a problem as long as global investors think this is the best place to invest. It becomes a huge problem if investor confidence shifts.

HEADLINE: U.N. Official Warns of Problems Undercutting Aid to Kosovo

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 27

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan's leading envoy in the Balkans said today that unless significant political and economic reforms are made in the region, much of the reconstruction aid promised to Kosovo by world leaders will be wasted.
In an interview here, the envoy, Carl Bildt, said that the inefficient use or diversion of aid is a "major impediment all over the entire region," not only in Bosnia, where there is rising concern about the misuse or waste of assistance.
The underlying problem, Mr. Bildt said, is the persistence of old-style socialist or Communist political and economic systems with all their built-in faults. Serbia, he said, has been the biggest drag on regional growth. But what Asians call crony capitalism is also found in Croatia and Bosnia, he added.
"There is a need for reconstruction, needless to say, but there is a far greater need for reform," said Mr. Bildt, a former Prime Minister of Sweden. "If we do reconstruction without reform, then we end up with an aid-dependent place. Bosnia is a good example of that."
Mr. Bildt said that Europe and the United States need to turn attention to long-term political as well as economic change, especially in Serbia. Success in Kosovo, he said, "is very much dependent on what's going to happen to Serbia."
"It's such a big chunk of land in the middle of the Balkans that if it does not reform itself it will be very difficult to do anything substantial with the rest," he said. "Serbia is the core nation of the region."
The United States has ruled out all but emergency assistance to Serbia as long as President Slobodan Milosevic, who has been indicted by the United Nations' war-crimes tribunal in The Hague, remains in power. Mr. Bildt, who said he believes that Mr. Milosevic will eventually stand trial, does not advocate waiting for that moment to begin dealing with the fundamental problems of Serbia, formerly an important regional trade hub.
"I don't think Milosevic will hang around for much longer," Mr. Bildt said. "The country is going so rapidly downhill. You have the economy contracting this year by either 30 or 40 percent. That's a collapse with major social consequences. That has to do to a very large extent with the bombing, but not only."
Yugoslavia, which was in many ways a pioneering socialist economy a few decades ago, has now fallen behind the rest of Eastern and Central Europe, he said, adding that it could take 15 or 20 years for Serbia and its neighbors just to go back to the economic levels of 1989, the year the Berlin wall came down.
"This is the least reformed economy in Europe next to Belarus," Mr. Bildt said. "The problem of Serbia is that it can't be discussed just in terms of the personality of Mr. Milosevic. That's only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the problems of Serbia."
Mr. Bildt said that he welcomes the arrival at the United Nations of Richard C. Holbrooke, the new chief representative of the United States. The United Nations and the United States will be facing tough decisions on the Balkans in the months and years to come.
"He will make the U.S. a far more active player in the U.N.," Mr. Bildt said. "And he brings to the job not only a knowledge of the issues and a lot of personal contacts but a certain amount of political clout. That is good. He is highly respected."
Mr. Holbrooke, the architect of the accord that ended the war in Bosnia, will feel some pressures from Washington to speed up developments in Kosovo, some diplomats here say. They fear that the United Nations will be blamed if the situation goes awry.
"There is always a tendency to underestimate the challenges ahead," Mr. Bildt said, and when things go wrong, a search for culprits in international organizations follows.
Mr. Bildt, who was involved in ending the war in Bosnia, said he had learned from that experience that withdrawing troops or lowering the level of an international military presence too soon can be a mistake.
"I think it is way too early to discuss troops leaving Kosovo," he said. "We are there for the long haul. That was one of the mistakes that were made in Bosnia. There was this belief that you could go in very quickly and do it primarily as a military operation and be out after one year. That was a mistake."
In Kosovo, Mr. Bildt said, Americans, Europeans and Russians may have to stay for quite a while.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Mortgage? Mexicans Sign Up for Monthly Raffle

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 21

 BODY:
When Javier Zavala and his wife, Jenny, began thinking about buying a house, they did not bother going to a bank to talk about getting a mortgage.
"We knew it would have been hopeless," said Mr. Zavala, 32, a marketing manager for his family's agro-chemical business here. 
 The banks in Mexico have been struggling with huge portfolios of failed loans since a sharp devaluation touched off soaring inflation nearly five years ago. With a few exceptions, they are lending only to the biggest corporations.
The richest Mexicans, who least need loans and often prefer to pay cash, can sometimes get mortgages. Some of the poorest Mexicans, in a form of political patronage, get subsidized loans through government agencies. But most Mexicans, like the Zavalas, are out of luck.
In this world of incredibly tight money, though, Mexican entrepreneurs have devised cooperative ventures that the Zavalas and tens of thousands of others are using in hopes of getting houses.
The entrepreneurs form groups of 500 home buyers, all of whom agree to make monthly payments for nearly 17 years toward homes valued at as much as roughly $200,000 each. A raffle is held each month and the pool of money goes to one lucky member to buy a house. That person, like the others, keeps paying for the rest of the nearly 17 years, and eventually everyone is supposed to end up with a house.
The entrepreneurs adjust monthly payments for inflation, which is running at an annual rate of 16 percent. Members pay no interest but are charged administrative fees of about 10 percent, compounded monthly. So the cost of financing through one of these groups works out to nearly 30 percent, or a little more than banks say they would charge if they were lending for mortgages.
The cooperative groups are not exactly a bargain. "But," Mrs. Zavala said, "the point is, the banks are not approving loans."
(In the United States, where inflation has been running at 2 percent, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages now cost a little more than 8 percent.)
One thing that the entrepreneurs do not point out is that members do not earn interest on money they are putting toward houses.
Financial experts say the cooperatives, known here as self-financing groups, are potentially dangerous for investors because they are not regulated by the banking authorities and monthly payments are not insured, as are deposits in Mexican banks.
"They are under God's protection," said Roberto del Cueto, a professor at Mexico's Autonomous Institute of Technology who specializes in banking law.
Yet, he and others following these groups say they know of none that have encountered financial trouble or turned out to be run by swindlers. Federico Castro Romo, the administrative director of Autofin, which is said to be the oldest and largest of the self-financing organizations, said the money paid by members was held in trust.
Adriana Campos, an official at Mexico's federal agency for consumer affairs, said several thousand participants in self-financing groups had complained of delays in getting the money for their houses after raffles. In a handful of disputes, she said, group administrators have paid fines of up to $10,000 and refunded the money of would-be homeowners. Ms. Campos said she knew of no cases in which group members had lost their money.
Ms. Campos estimated that more than 70,000 Mexicans were participating in these groups.
Similar cooperatives have been used in Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere, particularly for small businesses.
When the banks in Mexico do lend for a home, they demand pristine credit histories and down payments of up to 50 percent. "We're being very selective," said Ernesto Gomez-Gallardo, an executive vice president at Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, Mexico's largest bank.
When the peso was devalued, Mexico's banks were a disaster waiting to happen. After a decade under state ownership, the banks had been reprivatized in the early 1990's. Many of the new owners paid several times what analysts said were fair prices for the banks. Eager to earn their money back, they went on lending sprees. Some handed out credit cards in shopping malls, no questions asked. They accepted small down payments on mortgages, let people borrow more than their incomes would justify and relied on customers to disclose their total debt.
In keeping with Mexican practice, mortgages were issued with variable rates. Not long after inflation soared beyond 70 percent a year following the devaluation, home buyers found themselves owing interest equal to the amount of their loans. And many just walked away.
The banks tried to repossess the homes. But they were reminded that Mexican law greatly favors homeowners.
"In Texas, it takes an average of 90 days to repossess a house," said Professor del Cueto. "In Mexico, it may take six years."
The inability to repossess quickly is another reason the banks are reluctant to resume large-scale mortgage lending.
Mr. Zavala and his wife, the parents of a 2-month-old son, are doing business with Autofin. It started more than 20 years ago, financing cars, and moved into raising money for homes four years ago, shortly after Mexican banks stopped lending.
Mr. Zavala said he was a bit uneasy at first. "But once I found out they had been in the business such a long time I felt better," he said. "And it is working. We've been in the group about two years. We see people getting houses and more people keep coming into new groups. So I feel I will get my money out."
The Zavalas contracted for a house worth 450,000 pesos in 1997. Because of inflation it will now cost about 680,000 pesos, or about $73,500, to buy the same house. Their payments have been rising steadily to keep pace with inflation.
The lottery each month is tough on the nerves. "They run through all 500 numbers so you can see how you ranked," Mrs. Zavala said. "It's depressing if your number is way down there. But if you're close to the top, it's encouraging."

And the Winner Is . . . George W. Bush

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
A bump in the road, a setback, a boon to his primary opponents? Puh-LEEZE! The people who dourly predicted dark consequences from George W. Bush's "mishandling" of Snortgate were the same geniuses who predicted Bill Clinton's imminent demise 20 months ago. After the avalanche of insinuations that the Texas Governor might have used cocaine and is now engaged in a cover-up, Mr. Bush is in fact, in the words of his campaign adviser Ralph Reed, "better off" than he was before the firestorm started. Far from bungling his first encounter with adversity, the front-runner handled it like a master.
Sure, his convoluted answers to the cocaine question were Clintonesque -- you need a Palm Pilot to chart the chronology of his non-drug use -- but the political dividends have proved Clintonesque in a positive sense. Mr. Bush has enjoyed an "uptick" in the polls, as Mr. Reed described it. He continues to best Democratic adversaries by double digits and swamps his closest Republican rival, Elizabeth Dole, by a factor of four. 
 This is true even though most voters with an opinion on the subject believe that he is guilty as rumored of the alleged felony -- just as most voters judged President Clinton guilty of non-felonious adultery from the outset of Monicagate. Yet no one cares. Only 11 percent in a CNN/Time poll feel cocaine use disqualifies Mr. Bush from the Presidency. More revealingly, the number of people who think a candidate should not even respond to questions about cocaine has gone up since the marathon cross-examining of Mr. Bush began.
Does this mean that Americans have once again proved themselves to be morally bankrupt, as was widely proclaimed last year? Has the rise in the Dow Jones average since then made them overlook hard drugs as well as reckless sex? If the Dow hits 13,000, could a politician suspected of grand theft auto run for President without fear of public condemnation? At 20,000, a serial killer?
No, but what this fracas did prove is that the best place a candidate can be in 2000 is in opposition to the fulminating moralists in public life, whether those of the press or of Mr. Bush's own party. Bill Clinton's bipartisan legacy is this: Given the choice between scolds and scamps, the country opts for scamps. The more the media pile on a politician over a private sin -- let alone a sin for which there is no evidence or accusations, despite major investigative efforts by both The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal -- the more the public will rally around the targeted candidate. Just prior to the last push to bust Mr. Bush for drugs, there was a mini-storm in which our Puritan tribunes reprimanded him for using a four-letter word repeatedly in an interview in Talk magazine; that may have helped his poll numbers too. Should someone now come forward and actually accuse him of coke use, he may enjoy a poll bounce analogous to the one enjoyed by Mr. Clinton after Kathleen Willey appeared on "60 Minutes."
Mr. Bush's tormentors have tried to dress up the propriety of the cocaine question ex post facto by linking it to his hypocrisy on public policy. As Governor, he has signed on to Draconian laws in Texas that promote jail for first-time drug offenders caught in possession of minuscule amounts (though jail rarely befalls those of Mr. Bush's station, who can afford the right lawyers). But the many troubling questions raised by this hard line -- and the failed national war on drugs it epitomizes -- could have been asked of him before the cocaine rumors flared, whether he's a hypocrite or not. Now they'll likely be forgotten again, unless or until the questions about his own cocaine use get a second wind.
Such is our political culture, in which scandal usurps all else, that Mr. Bush has been able thus far to position himself as a don't-worry-be-happy candidate, a genial Chauncey Gardiner who seems to believe whatever a beholder hopes he believes. He has been able to skate by most policy questions, including those drowned out by Snortgate. Most of the media, for instance, ignored his response to a query by David Bloom of NBC News about the Kansas school board's decision to delete evolution from its recommended curriculum. Mr. Bush fudged it: "It's up to local districts to make decisions on how to achieve standards of excellence, as far as I'm concerned."
If this is how educational excellence is going to be promoted by a chief executive -- and the hapless Al Gore, seemingly following Mr. Bush's lead, is now also waffling on this question -- the policy implications go well beyond Kansas. How would a President respond to similar political pressures by creationists that could threaten Federal funding of scientific research (and academic institutions) exploring the frontiers of biology and medicine? Will taxpayers have to foot the bill in future welfare programs for graduates of evolution-free high schools sentenced to the bottom rungs of the new economy?
Some voters may be less concerned with what drugs, if any, passed through Mr. Bush's brain than with what other traffic, if any, did. Though otherwise cooperating with a seven-part Washington Post profile this summer, this would-be education President would not permit either Andover or Yale to release his grades. Asked by a South Carolina elementary-school kid at a campaign photo op this week to name his favorite book as a child, Mr. Bush responded, "I can't remember any specific books." Amidst all the crackhead cracks on late-night talk shows was David Letterman's chilling aside, "I have the feeling that this guy could turn out to be a colossal boob."
The good news for Mr. Bush is that he can deflect his critics for months to come. Not only can he ignore the scandal obsession of the Beltway media and capitalize on the national backlash against it, but he can also count on the abrupt flip-flop of G.O.P. moralists in the aftermath of their post-impeachment election setbacks. As Senator Robert Bennett, a Utah Republican, memorably put it -- in a formulation he has since regretted and then blamed on the movie version of "Primary Colors" -- Mr. Bush will be the nominee unless "he was hit by a bus or some woman comes forward, let's say some black woman comes forward, with an illegitimate child that he fathered within the last 18 months. . . ."
Actually, Mr. Bush may be the nominee even if this scenario does come to pass. For all the talk about the Governor's alleged hypocrisy, it is nothing compared with that of some of his supporters. Tom DeLay, the impeachment ayatollah who saw himself in a war of "relativism vs. absolute values," is now a born-again relativist, suggesting last week that what Mr. Bush has "done as a part-owner of the Texas Rangers" matters more than any youthful felony. Peggy Noonan, who last year inveighed against a President for prizing winning over telling the truth, has now called upon Mr. Bush to stonewall and expressed latent nostalgia for "the old tolerance" of "normal failings." According to the new relativism she posited in The Wall Street Journal, a sexual fling may be O.K. too, as long as it can be deemed a romantic "love affair" and doesn't involve a "sick manipulator being serviced in the hallway."
William Bennett, at least, deserves credit for consistency: he is the only major Republican to rue (and acknowledge) the news that his party's foremost champion of moral renewal, Newt Gingrich, carried on extramaritally with a Congressional aide 23 years his junior. Mr. Bennett has also called upon Mr. Bush to answer the cocaine question, though with a loophole: Cocaine use is "a serious matter," but "how serious depends on facts and circumstances."
After two decades of conservative campaigning against the 60's and "secular humanism" and boomer self-indulgence, what has happened to change the equation? The virtuecrats have a fresh-faced boomer of their own who might lead their party back into the White House. "I think we run the risk here of looking like when it's a liberal Democrat we're willing to be serious about these things, but when it's one of our own we're going to use a different standard," said Gary Bauer this week.
But Mr. Bauer, like Orrin Hatch, another G.O.P. Presidential wannabe still implicitly criticizing Mr. Bush's evasiveness on drug use, is a loser. For Republicans in 2000, much like Democrats in '92, when Bill Clinton parsed the Gennifer Flowers questions, winning is everything. And Mr. Bush -- having proved so early that only the despised press will call him on youthful indiscretions, real or imagined -- emerges from his first crisis in a position that is nothing if not win-win.

HEADLINE: U.S. Warns Indonesia Over Political Violence

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
President Clinton has warned the President of Indonesia that relations with the United States will be seriously damaged if there is mass violence during next week's referendum on self-rule in East Timor, senior Administration officials said today. The United States effectively has veto power over international loans to Indonesia.
Officials said Mr. Clinton's letter to President B. J. Habibie was intended to put him on notice that he will be held responsible if the Indonesian military fails to crack down on the anti-independence militias that have been responsible for several recent killings in East Timor. 
 The former Portuguese colony, which was invaded and annexed by Indonesia in 1976, is scheduled to vote Monday on whether to become an independent nation or an autonomous region within Indonesia. Most experts on the territory are convinced that after two decades of repressive Indonesian rule, voters will seek independence.
Administration officials declined to reveal the exact wording of the President's warning, which was sent in a letter this week, but one senior official said the threat of curtailing international loans and other aid through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank was not stated directly.
"But it's implicit," he said.
Another senior official said: "It's a very tough letter."
The Indonesian Government has been promised nearly $50 billion in loans from the I.M.F. to deal with the aftermath of the Asian economic crisis, which has crippled the economy of the vast archipelago nation.
A three-member Congressional delegation that just returned from East Timor said that mass violence was a strong possibility next week, especially given the close ties between the well-armed anti-independence militias and the Indonesian military and police.
"My worst fears are coming true," said Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, who led the delegation last week and who supports the immediate use of peacekeeping troops there, possibly including Americans. "I predicted this. The civilian forces, the Indonesian police, are not going to stop these thugs. They're openly associating with them."
Mr. Harkin said that if there is widespread violence next week, he would push the Administration to punish Indonesia under a 1977 law requiring the United States to vote against World Bank loans for countries that systematically violate human rights.
The State Department has largely brushed aside questions about the possibility of an armed peacekeeping force in East Timor, saying instead that it supports the use by the United Nations of unarmed civilian monitors and military observers. It has insisted that the Indonesian Government take responsibility for keeping the peace in East Timor.
"It's important to underline the fact that the Indonesian Government itself has placed its credibility on the line here," said James Foley, a department spokesman. "The responsibility for maintaining law and order is East Timor is very much the responsibility of the Indonesian authorities."
Representative Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, who joined the delegation, said it was clear that the Indonesian military and police were working closely with the militias, and that an armed international peacekeeping force was vital. "I think we should have had it in there already," he said.
But the third member of the delegation, Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said: "I think you've first got to make the strong, strong case that we expect the Indonesians to live up to their agreements and to provide a safe and secure environment for the elections. If they don't, then the consequences should be severe."

Share Prices Fall on Concern Over Greenspan Remarks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stock prices fell yesterday as some investors took remarks by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, as a warning that shares may be overvalued.
Mr. Greenspan is "holding to the notion that one never knows a bubble until it bursts -- that's where the risk is" for stocks, said William Meehan, senior market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald & Company. "Given the signs we've seen in the economy, there's a pretty good chance the Fed could raise rates again" later this year, he added. 
 In the bond market, prices had their biggest decline in three weeks as $7 billion in corporate debt sales sapped demand for Treasuries. The price of the benchmark 30-year issue fell 1 3/32, to 10 23/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.97 percent from 5.90 percent on Thursday.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 108.28 points, or 1 percent, to 11,090.17. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 13.74 points, or 1 percent, to 1,348.27. The Nasdaq composite index fell 15.72 points, or six-tenths of a percent, to 2,758.90. On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,778 stocks fell and 1,140 rose.
Next week, Government reports on employment and hourly earnings will give investors fresh evidence on whether the economy is continuing to boom. The Fed raised interest rates a quarter of a percentage point on Tuesday to try to control inflation by slowing the economy.
While some investment professionals saw Mr. Greenspan's comments as ominous for stocks, others called the remarks a nonevent that depressed shares in an otherwise humdrum news day and said the market would soon resume its gains.
For the week, the Nasdaq advanced 4.2 percent, the best performance since the week ended July 2. The S.& P. 500 rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, and the Dow average was little changed.
American Home Products fell 3 7/8, to 42 1/8, and was the biggest decliner in the S.& P. 500 after a judge certified a class-action lawsuit over the diet drugs Pondimin and Redux, the so-called phen-fen combination. About six million people took the drugs, and the lawsuit seeks to have some of them medically monitored at American Home's expense. American Home Products has denied any wrongdoing in marketing the two-pill mixture and disputes contentions that the drugs caused serious heart-valve damage or lung disease.
Intel rose 1 15/16, to 83. Mark Edelstone, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, raised his estimates for the semiconductor maker's 1999 and 2000 profits and said the stock could reach $95 within 12 months. Mr. Edelstone had previously forecast an $80 share price.
Ameritrade fell 1 7/16, to 21 5/16, and E*Trade Group was off 1 13/16, to 25 15/16, after the Internet brokers were reduced to "outperform" from "buy" at Lehman Brothers. As competition grows, Internet brokers are having to spend more to add accounts.
Hewlett-Packard rose 2, to 104 5/8, leading the Dow's advancers, after Steven Milunovich, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the company's new chief executive, Carleton S. Fiorina, was "hitting the ground running" and had set a goal of 13 to 20 percent revenue and earnings growth over the next three years, which would "at least" match Merrill's expectations.
Intuit jumped 8 3/16, to 9 11/16, after the company, a maker of personal-finance software, said its fourth-quarter earnings had beat expectations as its new small-business accounting software increased revenue. The company reported a pro-forma loss of 26 cents a share for the quarter ended July 31, narrower than the 33-cent loss forecast by Wall Street.
Northwest Airlines fell 2 7/16, to 29 1/2, after its flight attendants rejected a tentative labor contract, moving the airline closer to a strike.

HEADLINE: Bush Fund-Raising Machine Plows Ahead

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Aug. 27

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the early front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, today wrapped up a three-state, three-day campaign swing through the Southeast that yielded what aides estimated was another $1.1 million in campaign contributions.
It was proof that the fund-raising juggernaut of the Bush campaign rolled on, undiminished by any sense among his supporters that Mr. Bush was so firmly in the lead, in terms of both national surveys and his first-place finish in the recent Iowa straw poll, that they could start breathing easy and closing their checkbooks. 
 Instead, they were looking ahead to the general election in November 2000, and they were going for broke.
"We need coattails in North Carolina, so we need him to have a landslide in North Carolina," said Randy D. Doub, a lawyer who was one of many hosts of a $1,000-a-head fund-raiser at the Sheraton Imperial Hotel in Durham, N.C., on Thursday night.
Mr. Doub was referring to Congressional and state races in 2000 that he wanted Republicans to win, and he seemed to be assuming already that Mr. Bush would end up in the White House, his path to glory smoothed by the treasury he was amassing.
Mr. Bush was expected to raise $500,000 today from a $1,000-a-plate luncheon here and a dinner in Plantation, Ga., with the same price tag. The federally mandated limit for individual donations to a campaign is $1,000.
The roughly $37 million that Mr. Bush had reported raising by June 30 was by far the most that any Presidential candidate had accumulated at such an early point in the race. It also raised the question of how quickly Mr. Bush could continue to rake in the cash, given the number of contributors he had already tapped.
This week's tally, from five $1,000-a-head events, provided the answer: There was plenty more where that came from.
"That spirit is still there," said Don Evans, a Texas oilman who is Mr. Bush's national finance chairman.
Mr. Evans and other officials with the Bush campaign said they would not specify how much additional money they had raised before the end of the quarter on Sept. 30.
But in remarks this week, Mr. Bush said that more than 105,000 people had now donated to his campaign; at the end of the last quarter, the figure was about 75,000. If the new donors gave at a similar rate, Mr. Bush has easily added more than $10 million to his treasury and may be over the $50 million mark at this point.
"They are keeping up a remarkable pace," said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Elizabeth Dole, who places a distant second behind Mr. Bush in most national polls of Republicans. In a four-day swing last week through Western states including California, Mrs. Dole raised about $165,000, Mr. Fleischer said.
This was hardly Mr. Bush's best week. In California at the end of June, Mr. Bush raised an estimated $5 million. But the terrain he traversed this time around -- South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia -- is not as famously fertile with donors, and the Bush campaign had held fund-raising events here already.
The $1.1 million that aides said he had raised did not subtract what it cost Mr. Bush and his aides to put on and attend the events, but the Bush campaign is renowned for its fiscal prudence in such endeavors. The fund-raiser in Durham, N.C., for example, consisted of serve-yourself appetizers -- arrayed buffet-style under an ice sculpture of an elephant -- rather than a sit-down dinner.
Bill Graham, a co-chairman of the event, said that he has been amazed at the ease of raising money for Mr. Bush. To illustrate the point, he opened his suit jacket to reveal an inner pocket bulging with $1,000 checks.
Mr. Graham, a lawyer from Raleigh, N.C., said the humming economy was one explanation for the phenomenon, but that another, perhaps more potent reason was the hunger of people who did not like President Clinton to banish all traces of him, including Vice President Al Gore, the early front-runner for the Democratic Presidential nomination.
"We've got to get someone else in there, and this guy looks like a winner," Mr. Graham said, referring to Mr. Bush. Mr. Bush's swing through the Southeast included just as many events that raised no money at all, and the selection of places he stopped -- including a school in Florence, S.C., and a mostly privately funded social services center in Marietta, Ga. -- emphasized two of the principal themes of his campaign: improving education and encouraging religious organizations and charities to do more to help the needy.
Mr. Bush presented those efforts as the bulwarks of compassionate conservatism, a phrase that has become a linchpin of his identity and a mantra in his campaign.
As for all the contributions and support that have come his way, Mr. Bush said he was grateful but not complacent. "I also know that I've got a lot of work to do," he said.

HEADLINE: Consumption And Incomes Up Yet Again

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
Personal incomes rose for the seventh consecutive month in July, Government figures showed today, enabling consumer spending to continue to grow and pushing the economy toward its longest expansion ever.
Incomes grew two-tenths of a percent in July after rising seven-tenths of a percent in June, the Commerce Department said. Spending rose four-tenths of a percent after a gain of three-tenths of a percent a month earlier. 
 The July increase in income was the smallest since the end of last year because Federal disaster payments had increased farmers' income in June. Excluding farmers, personal incomes rose five-tenths of a percent last month, the same as in June.
"The economy will continue to grow with limited interruptions," said Richard Yamarone, a senior economist at the Argus Research Corporation in New York. If growth continues through January, the expansion will be 107 months old and the longest in United States history.
Pay increases at factories helped bring about a seven-tenths of a percent increase in wages and salaries, which account for about 60 percent of income. That was the biggest increase since January.
Wages and salaries at manufacturers, where pay tends to run higher than in service-producing jobs, rose eight-tenths of a percent. The rise last month in factory wages was the strongest since a 1.2 percent jump in August 1998, Government figures showed.
The increase in consumption was paced by a rise of six-tenths of a percent in spending on utilities and other services, "as air-conditioning use was boosted by the summer heat wave which enveloped much of the country," said Marilyn Schaja, a money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York.
Spending on durable goods was lifted by demand for autos, analysts said. Sales of cars and light trucks rose to 17.1 million units at an annual rate in July, up from 17 million units in June, auto makers reported earlier this month.
The nation's savings rate, meanwhile, came in at minus 1.4 percent, compared with minus 1.1 percent in June. The rate accounts for neither capital gains from investments nor improvement in home values, something that consumers may be counting on to pay for future expenses like retirement.
In addition, the report assumes that installment purchases that can be paid off in two or three years are one-day cash purchases. That is why many economists say they think Americans are saving more than the statistics indicate.
Separately, the University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence fell to 104.5 in August from 106 in July. The index, which fell to 97.4 last October, has ranged between 103.9 and 108.1 this year.

HEADLINE: Where Does Generation Y Go to Shop?;
70 Million Young Buyers Without a Thing to Wear

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
When Tony Shellman steps outside the midtown Manhattan offices of Enyce, a small clothing designer, he never knows what his trend-spotting antennae will hone in on.
Recently, Mr. Shellman, vice president for marketing and design at the company, went shopping for a new backpack. What he found instead, was a colorful, rugged, water-resistant fabric that his company turned into jackets for its fall men's line. 
 "We stumble across some of our inspiration by just walking down the street," Mr. Shellman said, explaining that he and the company's design team are as likely to find inspiration in a hardware or auto parts store as at a downtown nightclub.
Such vigilant design strategies, coupled with nontraditional apparel marketing techniques, are helping Enyce (pronounced eh-nee-chay) and other cutting-edge fashion companies attract the attention of the approximately 70 million American young people known as Generation Y.
Moreover, as department stores seek to lure back the rapidly growing numbers of younger shoppers, they are increasing floor space for teen-age styles and courting trendy urban clothing lines like FUBU, Mecca, P.N.B. Nation, Sean John, Ecko and Phat Farm, which once could only hope to find space at specialty shops.
For large retailers, the economic benefits of selling to young customers are too significant to ignore, according to Irma Zandl, president of the Zandl Group, a market research firm that tracks youth trends.
"It's the biggest number of teens since the baby boomers," she said.
As the back-to-school shopping season begins, the firm's research suggests that teen-agers will be clamoring for backpacks with large, comfortable straps, Velcro closings and lots of pockets, along with brightly colored sneakers. And the popularity of vests will be "huge," Ms. Zandl said, especially in bright hues and fabrics with a high-tech feel.
Generation Y -- the children of baby boomers, born mostly in the 1980's and 1990's and raised in a general age of affluence -- dwarfs its shorter-age-span predecessor, Generation X, the roughly 45 million people born between 1965 and 1978. Estimates are that this newest group of consumers already has about $150 billion to $250 billion in spending power each year -- with almost a third of that devoted to clothing.
And this fall, instead of spending as much on the widely popular urban clothing styles which had their origins as the baggy, oversized, logo- emblazoned fashions favored by rap musicians and black street gangs, teen-agers will see fashions that are a little more streamlined and stylish, combining elements of casual, athletic and dressier clothes.
Even traditional companies like Levi Strauss & Company are revamping their offerings and shifting their focus away from the baby boom generation that grew up on jeans.
As teen-agers browse among the clothing racks of department and specialty stores in search of what everybody else is wearing, many are likely to encounter Enyce's take on the de rigueur look: Button-front woven shirts come in muted oranges, blues and browns, while Hawaiian-style printed shirts feature leaf, taxi, stamp, skier and penguin designs.
Drawstring cargo pants are part of the offering, of course. So are loose-fitting jeans in raw, Belgian and waxed denim, available in colors ranging from khaki and dark rinse blue to chocolate and black. Waterproof red and gray snowboarding suits feature a hooded jacket lined with mesh fabric that absorbs sweat.
There is one item Enyce will not sell, though: vests. "We let everybody else do it," Mr. Shellman said.
But persuading teen-agers to buy what Enyce and other hip fashion houses are selling is no sure thing. Companies are making a big bet on one of the ficklest groups of consumers -- as Nike and Reebok have learned -- who have shown their ability to hurt a brand by turning away from a style or dismissing poor products.
"Big brands are at an inherent disadvantage when talking to teens," said J. Walker Smith, president of Yankelovich Partners, a research firm. "They have grown up distasteful and wary of a hard sell."
Indeed, courting a generation of skeptical consumers who have been weaned on the visual immediacy of MTV and the speed of the Internet requires apparel marketing strategies with new twists. These include enlisting high-profile musicians to wear specially designed outfits for concerts and in-store appearances. Within stores, music CD's are the product giveaway of choice, and disk jockeys even play records in the aisles between the clothing racks.
And, of course, as always, it helps if parents are befuddled by the music and the message and maybe even a little wary as well.
That is why it is all the harder for brands popular with baby boomers to win the allegiance of their children. Levi, in seeking to reinvigorate its trademark denim line, has picked up on the strategies pursued by newer apparel companies and has stepped up its sponsorship of music concerts and events. The company, the largest apparel maker in the world, sponsors tours for musicians, like Lauryn Hill, the Grammy award winner who has melded hip-hop with a smoother Caribbean-style music, and the band Sugar Ray, a surf 'n ska group. Performers often appear in clothing designed for them by the company, and may get involved in the design process, as Ms. Hill did.
The company also offers customers who buy any Levi's product a CD compilation of music by lesser known musicians who perform at Levi-sponsored concerts as well.
"All of the bands are totally relevant, but if you're outside of the demographic you probably haven't heard of them before," said Mitch Berk, president of Entertainment Marketing, which developed some of Levi's new promotions focused on teen-agers.
At many of the concerts that Levi sponsors, the company offers a special seating area for customers. And while teen-agers enjoy the music, Levi's trend spotters scan the area, paying close attention to what everyone is wearing, Mr. Berk added.
In-store promotions are part of the strategy as well. Earlier this month, at Macy's flagship store in New York City, teen-age girls screamed as Mark McGrath, lead singer of Sugar Ray, signed autographs, kissed cheeks and dutifully posed for photographers. Mr. McGrath wore a specially designed, sweat resistant black T-shirt and a pair of dark blue Levi's 501 jeans.
Trends change quickly. One of the things several companies and retailers are forecasting this year is that logos on clothing other than T-shirts will become smaller, eliminating the look of huge, billboard style banners everywhere.
"I call them the pieces you can only wear once a month because the logos are so big," said Jeffrey Tweedy, executive vice president of Sean John.
Customer surveys also help Sean John stay on top of teen-age preferences, Mr. Tweedy said, adding that the company uses surveys to help establish prices.
Thus far, Sean John, named after its founder, the rap impresario Sean (Puffy) Combs, has had strong sales since its clothes began appearing in March. Retailers said they had often racked up sales gains of more than 10 percent a week, above average for a new style.
Many companies, like Enyce, also have close ties to fashion stylists who follow trends and scout unique styles for their celebrity clients.
As a result of such efforts, Mr. Shellman can also offer a running list of celebrities and style setters who he says have worn the company's clothing, including 'N Sync, Cindy Crawford, Steven Spielberg, Jennifer Lopez, Brittney Spears, Usher, TLC and the Backstreet Boys.
Among retailers, Macy's executives say the company is willing to take a risk and try a variety of new styles in its stores. New products, however, must show strong sales quickly or they are removed from the store -- Enyce fell victim to this in late 1997 and was removed from the store. The company, which is owned by Fila Holding, hopes it will regain space in the store next year.
Trend spotters for Bloomingdale's cover fashion shows around the world. In addition, favorite trend- spotting spots in Manhattan include Balthazar and Fressen, two restaurants in lower Manhattan, as well as Jeffrey's Room, a small store in the Fashion District. "I'm in restaurants and clubs five nights a week, seeing what people are wearing," said Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice president for fashion direction at Bloomingdale's. "You have to cover it on the runways and on the street."
Mr. Ruttenstein predicts that vests will be popular items in a variety of fabrics. Hot colors will include earth tones, like green, brown, rust and rich reds. In addition, clothes will fit closer to the body. Also, cargo pants and anything with lots of pockets should do well.
Bloomingdale's is also gambling that a new generation of teen-agers will gravitate toward retro styles inspired by the coming Broadway musical "Saturday Night Fever." The musical is based on the popular movie from the 1970's, which glorified the disco nightclub culture.
But one thing from the line may be a tough sell: Bloomingdale's plans to offer an updated version of the trademark white suit that John Travolta wore in the movie.
"We're doing that white suit again, but in a white microfiber," he said.
Is Bloomingdale's afraid of making a fashion blunder? "If we make a mistake, we mark it down," Mr. Ruttenstein said.
At Sean John's, Mr. Tweedy forecasts that cashmere sweaters, and jean suits with long jackets will sell well.
In addition to some dressier styles, Sean John and Enyce are among several companies offering a new version of cargo pants with understated, zippered pockets.
After that, what is the next big must-have look that Generation Y will be clamoring for?
"I don't know," confessed Evan Davis, senior vice president of Enyce. "After this we probably have to do 3-D."

HEADLINE: Raymond Vernon, a Shaper Of Global Trade, Dies at 85

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Raymond Vernon, who helped shape the postwar system of international trade as a Government official and influenced thinking about the global economy as a scholar, died on Thursday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 85.
The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Heidi Vernon. 
 Mr. Vernon was a member of the Marshall Plan team that guided the economic revival of Europe after World War II, and worked on the development of the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. After serving in the Government in the Securities and Exchange Commission and the State Department for nearly two decades, he went to Harvard University in 1956 and never left.
At Harvard, Mr. Vernon first led an ambitious three-year research project on the New York metropolitan region that was regarded as a pioneering work in urban studies -- the work was supported by the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. Afterward, at the Harvard Business School and later at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, Mr. Vernon focused for decades on the study of the international economy -- especially the increasing role played by multinational corporations and the limits to governmental power.
"Ray Vernon was the father of globalization long before people used that term," said Daniel Yergin, an author and business consultant. "His work has had a phenomenal effect on several generations of thinking about how the global economy works."
Mr. Vernon's books on these subjects -- including "Sovereignty at Bay" in 1973, "Storm Over the Multinationals" in 1977, and "Beyond Globalism" in 1989 -- were influential and often far-sighted.
In "The Commanding Heights," a 1998 best seller by Mr. Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw, the authors, recognizing the scholarly foundation laid by Mr. Vernon in the study of relations between Government and the global marketplace, wrote, "It is impossible to write about these issues without acknowledging the profound intellectual impact that Prof. Raymond Vernon has had on them over the half-century."
Kim B. Clark, dean of the Harvard Business School, called Mr. Vernon "one of the most influential scholars of his generation, a true pioneer in the study of multinational corporations and the international economy."
Born on Sept. 1, 1913, in New York City, Mr. Vernon was one of four children in a family of Jewish immigrants from Russia.
His father, Hyman, drove a truck delivering seltzer water to restaurants and bars in the Bronx, and Mr. Vernon and his two brothers helped their father heft the crates of seltzer on and off the truck.
Their family name was Visotsky, but the children changed it to Vernon, beginning with Raymond's older brother, Sidney. Recalling her uncle's explanation, Heidi Vernon said he changed his name to improve his chances of being accepted into medical school. All four of the siblings -- Sidney, Leo, Raymond and Corrine -- earned doctoral degrees.
Mr. Vernon received a bachelor's degree from the City College of New York in 1933, and earned a Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University in 1941.
At the S.E.C., where he worked from 1935 to 1946, Mr. Vernon handled various assignments from studying the behavior of floor traders and specialists on the New York Stock Exchange to planning securities enforcement programs.
While at the State Department, he was one of the negotiators who brought Japan into the GATT trade system and helped secure nondiscriminatory treatment for Japanese exports.
In the early 1950's, as acting director of the Office of Economic Defense and Trade Policy, he oversaw trade with the Soviet-bloc nations and encouraged their trade with non-Communist countries.
Mr. Vernon's economic perspective, according to Mr. Yergin, who knew him for many years, was shaped by having grown up in the Depression and by his years at the S.E.C. "He believed in markets, but he also saw the weaknesses -- where they can go wrong," Mr. Yergin said.
In 1956, Mr. Vernon went to Harvard to head the three-year study of the New York metropolitan region. His urban studies project concluded with a measured though prescient projection -- continued growth and prosperity for the three-state region, but decline for broad swathes of the region's inner cities.
Mr. Vernon began his research into multinational corporations in 1965. His early work anticipated that multinationals -- as efficiency-seeking enterprises -- would transfer labor-intensive work on standardized products to developing nations. In "Storm Over the Multinationals" he analyzed how the pragmatic decisions of increasingly global companies held a growing sway over economic forces once controlled by governments, like trade flows and levels of investment.
Later, when European nations tried to combat the power of American multinationals by fostering the creation of state-owned "national champion" corporations, Mr. Vernon predicted early on that the tactic would prove to be poor policy.
"His view was that state-owned enterprises could not compete with the investor-owned multinationals, which are more flexible," said Robert Stobaugh, a professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School. "His research became part of the foundation for the privatization push of the 1980's."
Short and wiry, Mr. Vernon was an athlete until cancer slowed him down last year. An avid oarsman, he could be seen daily at dawn on the Charles River in his single scull. He competed for decades in the annual Head of the Charles crewing competition. Icy winters did not cool his competitive zeal. In his 80's, in fact, he set a world record for his age group in one class of "indoor sprints," rowing machines with odometers attached. He was a member of the Cambridge Boat Club for 40 years.
"One of the great sadnesses of his life," said his daughter, Heidi, "was that he was not able to be on the river these last months."
Mr. Vernon's wife of 60 years, Josephine, died in 1995. Mr. Vernon is survived by his two brothers, Sidney and Leo, and his sister, Corinne; and by his two daughters, Heidi Vernon of Newton, Mass., and Susan Vernon Gerstenfeld, also of Newton, Mass., four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
Mr. Vernon, the renowned student of multinationals, was once employed by a multinational-in-the-making. In 1954 he went to work for Forrest Mars Sr., who built the Mars candy empire. Mr. Vernon was placed in charge of planning, finance and new products. He oversaw the development effort that led to chocolate-covered peanut M & M's.
The new peanut variety was a success, and, in the candy industry, Mr. Vernon was called "the man who put the crunch in M & M's."
Mr. Vernon's foray into the private sector was short-lived, since he went to Harvard after less than two years in the candy business. But he would always talk of his M & M exploits at family gatherings, impressing the younger members of the Vernon clan, recalled his daughter, Heidi. "He told the grandchildren that he was the person who figured out how to get the letter M on each and every piece of candy," she said, "and they'd all believe him."

HEADLINE: Applicants for Police Test Are Down Despite Big Drive

BYLINE: By KEVIN FLYNN 

 BODY:
The largest Police Department recruitment drive ever fell far short of matching even the responses of recent years, but officials said yesterday that they would still consider the campaign a success if most of those who did sign up turn out to be city residents.
As of yesterday, the deadline to mail in applications, 10,328 people had signed up to take the qualifying test on Oct. 2. The total represents a 28 percent drop in applicants from last year's test and an even sharper decrease when compared with prior years, when the city routinely received more than 20,000 applications for the written exam, the first step toward becoming a police officer. 
 City officials said they expected only several hundred additional applications that were mailed in the last few days to arrive next week.
Nonetheless, police officials said the success of the drive, in which $10 million was spent on advertising and other efforts to encourage applications, should be measured by how many city residents it attracted to police work. The drive was initiated after the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, a West African immigrant, by white police officers, an incident that renewed criticism that the department's racial composition is not representative of the city's population.
"The purpose of the $10 million was not to get more numbers," said Police Commissioner Howard Safir. "The purpose of the $10 million was to get more city residents."
Personnel officials said it would take a few weeks for them to determine what percentage of the applicants live in New York City. About 60 percent of the 40,000-member force now lives in the city, officials said.
Even though department officials said attracting more applicants was never their focus, in previous briefings officials had dismissed reports of a low turnout by suggesting that the great bulk of applications traditionally do not come in until the final two weeks of a sign-up period. Yesterday, they explained the low number as the product of forces larger than the recruitment drive itself.
"It's a function of the economy," Mr. Safir said. "I have checked with police chiefs all around the world and they are seeing exactly the same thing. The economy is good. Police officer jobs are relatively low paying. You can't attract the number of people you have in the past."
The starting salary for a police officer is $34,970 a year.
Personnel officials confirmed that applications for other New York City uniformed services were also down sharply. The last firefighter test, in 1998, drew 41 percent fewer candidates than the previous one, according to Denise Collins, a spokeswoman for the Department of Citywide Administrative Services. The sanitation worker test given last year drew 45 percent fewer applicants than the previous one, she said.
But Thomas Scotto, president of the Detectives Endowment Association, offered an additional explanation. He said it was particularly difficult to recruit for the Police Department because so many officers were telling their friends and families that they feel underpaid and unappreciated. "The morale in this department is so low, it's nonexistent," Mr. Scotto said.
Mr. Safir also said negative publicity played a large part in driving potential applicants away from police work. "Part of the $10 million was to restore the image of police officers so people would apply," he said, "because the only public things young people have been hearing from the media is Louima, Diallo, profiling, all those negative spins that you guys love to do."
The department spent the recruitment budget on newspaper, television and radio advertisements, as well as on a 12-story banner that covers one side of Police Headquarters in lower Manhattan.
From the outset, the Rev. Al Sharpton had complained that too little money was spent advertising on media outlets owned by blacks and Hispanics. Yesterday he said the low number of applicants probably meant an equally lackluster draw of black and Hispanic applicants, many of whom he said distrust the department's treatment of members of minority groups. He accused Mr. Safir of "trying to put the best face on failure."
But the office of Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields, who has supported the department's recruitment efforts, said their success could not be measured until the figures on residency were tabulated. "This could just be a low point for this time of year, a momentary lull," said Charles Walker, a spokesman for the borough president. "Nevertheless, because the numbers are so low," he said, the Police Department may "want to review their recruitment procedures."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Ties Debate on Rates to the Markets

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 27

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said today that the booming stock market now plays an increasingly significant role in the Fed's debate over inflation but he stopped short of calling the market overvalued.
"We no longer have the luxury to look primarily to the flow of goods and services" when making decisions about interest rates, Mr. Greenspan said. In effect, he was labeling what he called the "extraordinary increase in stock prices over the past five years" as one of the major economic forces capable of pushing up the inflation rate. 
 Traditionally, a run-up in stock prices has been viewed as reflecting a strong economy and profitable companies. The economy drove the market. Now the opposite is more and more the case, Mr. Greenspan suggested.
The stock market, in response to Mr. Greenspan's remarks, which were delivered at an annual conference on monetary policy issues organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, fell moderately today. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 108.28 points, or nearly 1 percent, closing at 11,090.17 in light trading. Page C3.
The concern, mildly expressed in the day's trading, appeared to be that if the Fed saw an inflationary force in stock prices, it might raise rates again to slow the economy. Higher rates normally bring down stock prices because they raise the payoff from alternative investments, like Treasury bills.
The spectacular rise on Wall Street in recent years has added considerably to the wealth of millions of families and also to the value of the nation's publicly owned companies. Families and companies have spent -- or borrowed against -- part of the windfall from that gain as well as the increased value of real estate to buy additional goods and services. Their increased spending has helped make the economy boom.
Mr. Greenspan's remarks suggest that stock prices have become a more important target in the Fed's manipulation of interest rates. Controlling inflation remains the goal of interest rate changes, and that point was made repeatedly at the conference today. But Mr. Greenspan signaled that rising stock prices, and to a lesser extent rising real estate prices, must take their places alongside such traditional inflationary forces as tight labor markets, rising wages, shortages of goods and services that develop when demand outstrips supply, and the changing value of the dollar.
Despite the strong economic growth since 1996, inflation has remained unusually mild. The Fed, as a result, has been reluctant to push up interest rates very much -- a reluctance that helps feed the stock market. If a speculative bubble develops and the market finally crashes or declines sharply, the Fed's position is that it will step in then to minimize the damage by lowering rates and making money easier to borrow. Meanwhile the Fed will view the market as another potentially inflationary force, Mr. Greenspan said, but will not try to influence the market itself.
During a question-and-answer period, Mr. Greenspan elaborated on his speech. He said the Fed would intervene in financial markets only to correct sharp rises or falls in stock prices that might send shock waves through the rest of the economy. The real issue, he said, is a credit squeeze -- a sudden reluctance of lenders to lend -- whether markets are rising or falling.
"We don't respond to gradually rising or falling asset prices," he said. "We do respond to seizing up."
Some economists attending the conference here saw in Mr. Greenspan's speech a sort of addendum to the statement that the Fed issued on Tuesday, when it announced a quarter-point increase in the Federal funds rate at which banks lend each other money overnight, raising it to 5.25 percent, and pulling up other short-term interest rates with it.
The rate increase plus a similar one in June, the statement said, "should markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward."
The financial markets initially saw in that statement a possible signal that the Fed was probably finished raising interest rates for a while. But for Alan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon Institute, Mr. Greenspan's explicit addition today of the stock market as an inflationary force might mean more rate increases in the coming months.
"Greenspan is saying, 'I am not certain I am all done or not all done, but you are making a mistake if you think I am all done,' " Mr. Meltzer said.
Having identified the booming stock market as a potentially inflationary force, Mr. Greenspan said that a lot more research needs to be done to determine why people are willing to make such risky investments and then, turning on a dime, flee them.
"If episodic recurrences of ruptured confidence are integral to the way our economy and our financial markets work now and in the future," he said, "it has significant implications for risk management and, by implication, macroeconomic modeling and monetary policy."
But Mr. Greenspan was careful to avoid going as far as he had in the past in worrying about the stock market. In December 1996, he questioned the "irrational exuberance" of investors on Wall Street, causing a brief but sharp selloff in markets around the world.
This time, he said that while stock prices seem unusually high, he could not conclude that the market was overvalued. Stock prices, for example, should reflect corporate profits, and Mr. Greenspan noted instances in which profits had been both overstated and understated in recent months, with the bottom line being that profits might be understated, thus helping to justify a rising market.
But he added an important caveat.
"It does not seem likely, however, even should all of the appropriate accounting adjustments to earnings be made," he said, "that such adjustments can be the central explanation of the extraordinary increase in stock prices in the past five years."

HEADLINE: Little Tribe, Casino Threatened, Battles U.S.

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 27

 BODY:
A tiny Indian tribe in a sparse slice of northeastern Nebraska found itself today at the forefront of an increasingly heated national debate over the matter of where tribal sovereignty ends and state control begins.
The issue was the tribe's operation of a shoe-box casino on its reservation. Today that little casino nearly led a Federal district judge in Omaha to take an unprecedented step: the jailing of tribal leaders in a clash over reservation gambling. 
 Although the judge, William G. Cambridge, ultimately decided against jailing the leaders now, the tribe hardly won a conclusive victory. Judge Cambridge suggested that Federal prosecutors might want to pursue a criminal rather than civil case against them, and declared once more, as he had repeatedly, that the casino was illegal because it had lacked state approval ever since opening three and a half years ago.
The lack of such approval violates a Federal law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, which requires an Indian tribe to strike an accord, or compact, with the state in which its reservation lies if it wants to open a casino. There are now about 145 such compacts between states and various tribes. But Nebraska, opposing any casinos within its borders, has refused to negotiate one with the Santee Sioux, the tribe with a stake in the proceeding today.
That proceeding was the latest in a series of recent skirmishes over the rights of tribes to operate casinos in states from Florida to California and, more broadly, over the ability of tribes to be exempt from state regulation and taxation.
Only Monday, the California Supreme Court overturned a ballot measure that would have allowed expansion of legalized gambling on Indian reservations. The decision dealt a severe blow to tribes' ambitions to build a gambling mecca to compete with Las Vegas. The tribes' position was supported by Gov. Gray Davis, but the court ruled that it conflicted with the State Constitution's ban on casino-style games like blackjack and 21.
In addition, Florida, Kansas and Alabama, trying to block the opening of Indian casinos within their borders, have sued the United States Interior Department with the aim of overturning new rules that allow the Federal Government to license tribal casinos in cases where states are reluctant to negotiate compacts.
And Wisconsin's Governor, Tommy G. Thompson, refused to renew one-year gambling agreements with that state's 11 tribes until they agreed to pay $22 million in lieu of taxes, up from $350,000 under the old one-year agreements.
"Before, when we didn't have any pie, nobody bothered with us," said Sheila Morago, a spokeswoman for the National Indian Gaming Association. "Now that we have a small piece of the pie, they want our filling. It's just a constant intrusion on the treaties that were signed long ago, on the tribes' sovereign rights. Every time you get a little farther, you take one step forward and two steps back."
David M. Rocchio, deputy legal counsel to Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, who has been involved in discussions on Indian gambling through the National Governors' Association, said that "the concern that governors have is not with the benefit casinos bring to tribes." Rather, Mr. Rocchio said, "the concern is with the carve-out from state regulation, such as land use, police power and other ancillary concerns that arise when tribes have casinos -- and the impact on the residents not only on the tribal lands but also on other lands in the state." Like gambling venues everywhere, casinos attract crime, and can prey on compulsive gamblers.
The reservation of the Santee Sioux, the tribe involved in the court showdown in Nebraska today, lies on the Missouri River just across the border with South Dakota, and is home to about 1,000 tribal members.
In February 1996, the Santee Sioux opened the Ohiya Casino on reservation land, in a metal building not much bigger than a 7-Eleven store. It has 71 video gambling and slot machines, and attracts mostly elderly people from nearby farming communities. It takes in just $900,000 or so a year and employs only 23 people, but tribal leaders say it is an economic godsend for a reservation with 74 percent unemployment. Arthur Denny, the tribe's chairman, says the casino actually supports about four relatives of each employee and has brought a decline in alcohol abuse and domestic violence.
But Nebraska, which does not allow casino gambling anywhere in the state, has refused to negotiate a compact with the Santee Sioux.
Almost from the beginning, the United States Attorney's office in Omaha has tried to get the casino shut down. A Federal appeals court found the casino illegal in 1998, and the Supreme Court, without comment, let that ruling stand.
This February, Judge Cambridge began fining the tribe $3,000 a day, and in June he doubled the fine, to $6,000 a day. None of the debt, now totaling $726,000, has been paid by the Santee Sioux, and the purpose of the hearing today was for Judge Cambridge to consider whether to put the 11 members of the tribal council in jail for contempt.
In the end, he decided against doing so, saying that because the tribe voted in a referendum this month to keep the casino open, the leaders no longer had the authority to close it. He told the Federal prosecutors that to get the casino closed, they would have to pursue the case as a criminal matter, not a civil one. Why that would make any difference in a practical sense was not entirely clear.
In any event, the judge was hardly sympathetic to the Santee Sioux, saying the fines would continue.

HEADLINE: Panel May Rethink Charter Change to Avoid Affecting Green

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
The commission considering changes to the City Charter will probably soften a contentious proposal that could have thwarted the mayoral ambitions of Mark Green, the Public Advocate, if Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani left office early, administration officials said yesterday.
While the panel indicated yesterday that it would put a proposal on the November ballot to require a special election within 60 days if a mayor leaves office early, the officials said that the proposal would probably specify that such a change not take effect until after 2001. 
 This delay means that even if the proposal became law, Mr. Green would still serve a year as mayor should Mr. Giuliani be elected to the Senate in 2000, and would still have the advantage of incumbency during the mayoral election of 2001.
The reversal is surprising because when Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, appointed the Charter Revision Commission in June, he strongly hinted that his main goal was to keep Mr. Green, a liberal Democrat, from succeeding him. Under the current charter, the Public Advocate automatically fills a mayoral vacancy.
But the administration officials said yesterday that panel members had decided that changing the rules in the middle of an election cycle would be too controversial.
During a meeting yesterday, Randy M. Mastro, the panel's chairman and a former Deputy Mayor under Mr. Giuliani, said that he believed any change in the election laws should be effective immediately. But Mr. Mastro also acknowledged that the special election proposal had come under criticism, and he urged the panel members to "think long and hard" about when such a proposal should become effective.
"Sometimes it makes more sense to postpone the effective date of a proposal, to eliminate any question about why the proposal is being made at that point in time," Mr. Mastro told reporters after the meeting. "It is appropriate for us to consider that issue, based on public criticisms and issues that have been raised."
Mr. Giuliani's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, said yesterday that the Mayor would support whichever ballot proposals the charter commission recommended. On Wednesday, the panel is to vote on whether to put the special election proposal and 13 others on the ballot this fall.
The other proposals include merging the Department of Health with the Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Alcoholism Services; imposing a cap on year-to-year budget increases; banning guns within 1,000 feet of schools, and creating a commission to monitor organized crime.
Three other proposals would make the Human Rights Commission, the Office of Immigrant Affairs and the Administration for Children's Services permanent agencies under the charter, so that they could not be eliminated without voter approval.
Panel members already expressed strong support for most of the proposals at a meeting on Aug. 17. Yesterday, they focused on the questions of how the proposals should appear on the ballot, and when they should take effect, if they are approved.
Mr. Mastro said that it made sense for the proposals to appear as one big question because they all shared the goal of continuing the Giuliani administration's policies.
"It makes sense to present these proposals as a whole," Mr. Mastro said, "because they all relate to the same fundamental theme that we should make permanent those reforms that have served the city government so well in recent years."
But Mr. Green and several of the panel's other critics said they would fight any effort to combine the 14 proposals -- some of which involve complicated budgetary and procurement issues -- into one ballot question. The critics contended that the panel would be trying to make controversial proposals more palatable to voters by mixing them with innocuous recommendations.
Mr. Mastro said yesterday that the panel members had not decided whether to recommend delaying any change in succession rules, or even whether to put the special-election proposal on the ballot.
But the administration officials said that a delay was almost certain because there was too much public opposition to changing the rules immediately. In hearings this month, many elected officials and members of the public said changing the rules in the middle of an election cycle would be unfair.
Perhaps more significant is that several union leaders have sided with Mr. Green, and have threatened to mobilize their members and phone banks to fight the special election proposal. That kind of organized effort could insure the proposal's defeat, especially this year, when voter turnout for an election without major races is expected to be low.
Mr. Green said yesterday that he was pleased that Mr. Mastro had discussed the possibility of delaying any change in succession rules until after 2001. But he added that he was still not convinced that the panel would recommend such a delay.
"Hope springs eternal," Mr. Green said, "but I will wait to hear what they say on Wednesday before commenting."
 
REVISING THE CHARTER
Choosing Among 14 Proposals for the November Ballot
Here are the 14 proposals that the Charter Revision Commission is strongly considering placing on the ballot in November:
1. Imposing a cap, tied to the inflation rate, on increases in the city budget.
2. Requiring that at least half of any budget surplus be set aside for use in a fiscal emergency or other need that the Mayor and the City Council jointly decide is in the city's best interest.
3. Requiring at least a two-thirds vote of the City Council to impose a new tax or increase an existing tax, and requiring a four-fifths vote of the Council to override a mayoral veto of a new tax or tax increase.
4. Making the city's Human Rights Commission a permanent agency, and incorporating the city's Human Rights Law into the Charter.
5. Requiring that a special election be held within two months to fill any mayoral vacancy.
6. Making the Administration for Children's Services a permanent agency.
7. Merging the Department of Health and the Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Alcoholism Services.
8. Creating an Organized Crime Control Commission to handle the regulatory, investigative and licensing functions of agencies that oversee the carting industry, public wholesale food markets and shipboard gambling.
9. Requiring that domestic violence services be coordinated through the Mayor's Office of Operations.
10. Making the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs a permanent agency, and incorporating the city's laws protecting the rights of immigrants into the Charter
11. Eliminating from the Charter detailed requirements concerning bidding on city contracts, streamlining the city's procurement process.
12. Authorizing a centralized review of the integrity of vendors who want to do business with the city.
13. Creating gun-free zones within 1,000 feet of schools.
14. Making the failure to have safety locking devices on legally owned guns a crime.

Crisis Recedes In Hong Kong, With Economy Back in Black

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 27

 BODY:
Fifteen months after it spiraled downward into its worst recession in a generation, Hong Kong said today that its economy had stormed back to positive growth in the second quarter this year.
The government's estimate of growth of five-tenths of 1 percent from a year earlier puts Hong Kong in the ranks of other Asian economies, which appear to be recovering from the regional crisis as swiftly as they succumbed to it. South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia have all announced sharply better economic statistics in recent weeks. The Philippines said today that its economy had also beaten expectations -- growing by 3.6 percent in the second quarter. 
 The abruptness of Hong Kong's comeback caught economists here by surprise. Most had forecast that this former British colony would lag behind its neighbors in recovering from the regional crisis. Even after today's announcement, analysts remained wary of the territory's immediate prospects.
"It's an astonishing number," said Ian K. Perkin, chief economist for the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. "But if you're coming out of recession, you want more than one quarter of growth."
Mr. Perkin said Hong Kong could still be hobbled by two things out of its control: its close ties to the weakening Chinese economy and its vulnerability to shifts in monetary policy in the United States.
The Hong Kong Association of Banks announced today that it would raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point -- mimicking an increase three days earlier by the Federal Reserve. Rates here closely track those of the United States because the Hong Kong dollar is linked to the United States dollar.
Though the rate increase was widely expected, it pushed down Hong Kong's stock market by 225.25 points, or 1.66 percent, to 13,383.13. The economic results were released after the market closed.
Despite all the caveats, officials here allowed themselves a sigh of relief after the relentless gloom of the last year.
"The worst time for Hong Kong occurred in the third quarter of last year," Sir Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's financial secretary, said. "Since then, we have seen some very robust recovery."
He added, "If you define a recession as negative growth, we are no longer in that area."
Sir Donald attributed the strong performance to revived consumer spending and tourism. Retail sales declined just 2 percent in the second quarter, following declines of 10 percent in the first quarter and 17 percent last year. Visitor arrivals rose 11.1 percent in the first seven months of this year.
Barring any rude shocks, Sir Donald said Hong Kong should eke out growth of five-tenths of 1 percent for the year. But he noted that the government had not raised that forecast, which was made earlier this year, despite the second-quarter numbers.
That is because Hong Kong is still surrounded by economic land mines.
On the government's list of dangers is a slowdown in the United States economy, a faltering recovery in Japan, overly high interest rates and, the most unpredictable, the tension between China and Taiwan.
"I have learned one thing," said Sir Donald, who has been lampooned here for predicting that the crisis would be over by last Christmas. "If I keep looking at the crystal ball, I will end up with a handful of broken glass."
Indeed, economists said Hong Kong's recovery differed from that of other Asian countries because it is still basically a trading post, packaging and shipping goods from China rather than producing its own exports.
"Hong Kong does not have the driving force that pushes other countries out of recession," said Dong Tao, an economist with Credit Suisse First Boston, who predicts that its economy will contract 1.5 percent in 1999.
Also, unlike Thailand or South Korea, Hong Kong does not have the benefit of a cheap currency. While those countries have devalued their currencies, the Hong Kong dollar rises and falls in lockstep with the United States dollar. That can make this a very expensive place to do business.
"A weak economy and a strong U.S. dollar is a painful combination for Hong Kong," said Guonan Ma, a regional economist with Merrill Lynch here. "Hong Kong is sandwiched between the tightening monetary policy of the United States and the slowing economic growth of China."
Hong Kong's currency is one reason that asset prices here rose to gravity-defying levels before the Asian crisis.
Now, the city is in a deflationary cycle, as the gaudy sale signs in store windows attest. Salaries and commercial rents are also falling. A report by Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate broker, said Hong Kong was now only Asia's third-most-expensive city for office rents, after Tokyo and Bombay.
"Deflation squeezes margins, so for corporations, Hong Kong is having a profitless recovery," Mr. Tao said.
Regardless of Hong Kong's peculiarities, its rebound will lend further credence to the perception that Asia is returning to health more quickly than almost anybody would have predicted last year. Rather than a protracted and painful convalescence, economists said Asia now looks more like Mexico, which snapped back from its currency crisis in late 1994 and early 1995.
"Virtually every Asian country reported an explosive second-quarter G.D.P. number," Mr. Tao said. He said the region was benefiting from sustained strong demand for its exports by the United States.
For Hong Kong, the big wild card is China. The country is grappling with deep deflation, which threatens to strangle its growth. Most analysts are expecting Beijing to devalue the currency, although few think it will act before Oct. 1, the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
A devaluation of China's currency would have unpredictable consequences for Hong Kong. It could put pressure on the link between the Hong Kong dollar and United States dollar. But it would also make China's exports more competitive.
And that could benefit China's middleman, Hong Kong.

Like other Asian countries caught in the region's recent economic downturn, Hong Kong is showing signs of revival. Still, analysts remain wary, saying it is vulnerable to slowdowns in the United States and Japan and it has close ties to the Chinese economy, which is weakening.

HEADLINE: In Basketball Heaven, All Summer Long;
Home-Grown Tournaments Lure Street Legends and College Stars

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
"I got $4.75 we win today. I got $4.75 in my pocket. Any bets? Any bets?"
Charles Faison was hanging on the chain-link fence at a playground in the Bronx on Sunday, haranguing players, coaches and anyone else within earshot. "I will bet a Happy Meal we win today," he said, cracking himself up. 
 He turned his sights on a young man in a technicolor shirt. "If you play ball as cool as you look you'd be in the N.B.A.," he crowed.
Just a few hours later, Mr. Faison, 26 -- known as Ese (ESS-ay), Mexican slang for "homeboy" -- would be in uniform and on the basketball court, his taunts being put to the test. But the hours before the Unlimited Tournament got under way were about warming up the attitude as much as the muscles.
For many city residents, summer in New York means one thing: basketball, specifically basketball tournaments, like the Rucker, the Entertainer's Basketball Classic and the Goat, all in Manhattan, and the Gunhill, also in the Bronx. For the tenants of the Forest Houses, a housing project in the Morrisania section of the Bronx, it means the Unlimited: a home-grown tournament played at the playground right across the street.
The court is cracked and buckled; the schedule is, well, loose. Players sometimes fill up on beer during courtside breaks, and teams occasionally struggle to find enough players to take the court. But for Mr. Faison and other Forest residents, the Unlimited is the high point of the year. Before this tournament started in 1997, the last tournament at this playground was held in 1985.
"It's good for the community," said Mr. Faison, who holds a paying job as a laborer at Montefiore Cemetery in Springfield Gardens, Queens. "I got something to look forward to in summer."
For now, the Unlimited is happy and sloppy enough to still be like a family event. But its patron, Lord Finesse, a successful rapper who grew up at Forest and took over running the tournament this year, has a vision. He sees the court resurfaced. He sees corporate banners hanging from the fence. And he sees big money flowing into the projects.
Tournaments like the Rucker and the Entertainer's Basketball Classic have become big money machines, driven by companies like Def Jam Records and Reebok. At the Entertainer's tournament, sponsors pay $10,500 to enter their team.
Finesse, 29, thinks that same machine could bring a badly needed boost to the neighborhood, where the biggest business opening in years was a new McDonald's that arrived this year.
"Give me $500,000 to $1 million," Finesse said, "and Forest will look like paradise."
He remembers his own childhood, when Friday field trips organized by the community center introduced him to more than the projects. "I just want kids to get out and see more," he said. "It would give kids a head start. They would see that maybe life isn't so one-sided as they see it in the projects."
For now, he is putting his own money into the tournament and charging each team $500 to participate. He bought new backboards and nets for the courts, and workers from the city's Parks and Recreation Department put them up. On nice days, he pays a deejay to pump music courtside. But he has his priorities clearly in order. "It's not like I'm not here for the community," he said. "But I want to win."
That means that his team, the X-Factor, must best the team of his longtime friend Fat Joe, a rapper who also grew up at Forest. The X-Factor and Fat Joe's team, the Terror Squad, have two of the best records in this summer's tournament; both are in the playoffs, which take place today. The tournament, which began late last month, ends Labor Day weekend, and the winners take home trophies.
Finesse said the strength of his team and Fat Joe's is not entirely coincidental. They recruit on courts and high school and college teams all over the city. "Being a rapper," Finesse said, "you have an advantage: everyone wants to play for you."
The players are college stars and playground legends; unemployed homeboys and juvenile counselors; teachers and bouncers. For those who never made it near college, Finesse said, it is their chance to prove themselves to those who did.
What they all share is talent that is both raw and showy. It is that talent, Finesse said, that made him want to run the tournament.
The players come from all over the city, but the fans definitely show hometown, or home project, favoritism. If Finesse leaves Ese, who plays on the X-Factor, on the bench too long, the crowd begins chanting his name. And when Chuck Dinkins, a k a the Hulk, a k a the Claw, a Forest resident known more for power than for smoothness, did some fancy footwork and then sank a three-pointer on Sunday, the 60 or so fans on the cement bleachers went wild.
Mr. Faison said he and his friend David (Spider Web) Webster are the backbone of Finesse's team.
"If we're on the court we vibe off each other," Mr. Webster said.
"And the team vibes off us," Mr. Faison said.
"We make 'em laugh," said Mr. Webster, 23, who spends most of his time caring for his twin daughters.
Some street basketball legends get paid to participate in this and other tournaments, because the competition for their presence is so fierce. But Mr. Faison and Mr. Webster said all they ask from Finesse is a good meal. (Mr. Faison prefers shrimp parmigiana; Mr. Webster, chicken parmigiana.)
If Ese and Spider Web, with their unceasing commentary, are the tournament's comic relief, Finesse and Fat Joe are its yin and yang. Finesse is a hands-on coach -- so much so that when his players bend their knees to take a shot, Finesse's knees bend too -- and a micromanager.
Fat Joe is as laid back as they come. By the time he rolled in on Sunday, his team was already playing. He cheered the players from the sidelines, then retired to the bleachers to relive his birthday party the night before with some friends. He signed autographs for children on little scraps of paper, and occasionally checked out the game.
"I'm not much of a coach," said Fat Joe, who also had a team in the Entertainer's tournament. "I'm more like a mascot."
His team in the Unlimited Tournament still won by 40 points that day.
"I love it when my players play like that," Fat Joe said.
Fat Joe owed his victory to one player in particular: Anthony Heyward, a 28-year-old from the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. Off the court, Mr. Heyward is a math and science teacher who says he loves working with kids. On the court, he shows how he earned his nickname: Half Man, Half Amazing.
On Sunday, he was simply amazing, passing, rebounding and shooting with equal ease. He grabbed one rebound with arms that seemed to reach halfway to the sky; took the ball all the way down the court, navigating around defenders as if they were plastic traffic cones; and flew through the air to dunk the ball, easily his 10th dunk of the game. He finished with 35 points.
Mr. Heyward played three years of basketball at the Pratt Institute, then played in Europe and Latin America. His shot at the pros has not come, but he calls basketball "the love of my life." Every summer, he reconsummates that love, playing 60 or 70 games in multiple tournaments.
After his game, it was time for Ese and Spider Web to step up, as the X-Factor took on the Posse. "I'll buy you a whole chicken if you do your thing," Ese yelled to a teammate.
As the play continued, summer confected a moment of pure perfection. Little girls flew wildly on the swings next to the court, the girls shrieking, the swings creaking. Music from a Mr. Softee truck tinkled. The smell of grilling meat from a street vendor perfumed the air. A huge grin spread across Ese's face.
Then, suddenly, the peaceful rhythm was punctured. The referee ejected a player from the game after calling him for a technical foul, a delay of game, and a flagrant foul. The player, Master Rob, a playground legend on the Posse team, was not pleased, and when the referee had his back turned, Master Rob hit him on the back of the head.
Furious, the referee said he was ending the game, which was nearly tied in the third quarter. Angry players challenged him, saying he shouldn't punish the whole team for one player's actions. A plastic bottle flew through the air. The arguing escalated.
"He struck me in the back of the head," the referee, who did not want to be identified, told a player who was challenging his decision to end the game.
"C'mon man, this is the 'hood," the player said.
When the referee would not back down, the player told him not to show his face on the court again. "Next time, it will be different," the player warned.
It was the first time that a referee had been struck or threatened, players and coaches said, and suddenly, Finesse and the others realized that the future of their tournament was at stake: with referees too scared to return, or too scared to make tough calls, they would have nothing. They rallied around the referee.
"You don't mush the ref," Finesse said. "No one is going to touch my officials."
Even Fat Joe got off the bench and walked over to the scene of the argument with his friend Full Flex, another rapper who grew up at Forest. Full Flex yelled at the player who had threatened the referee: "It's my court! It's my court! You touch the ref and you'll walk out of here on crutches."
The player backed off and stalked away. The referee agreed to return for the playoffs. Master Rob was ejected from the tournament. The game was forfeited to Finesse's team. Peace returned, darkness fell, and the players, coaches and fans, all one for a moment, lingered, savoring summer's ebb.

Greenspan Says Stocks Influence Inflation Talks
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that the booming stock market now played an increasingly significant role in the Fed's discussions of inflation. But he stopped well short of calling the market overvalued.
"We no longer have the luxury to look primarily to the flow of goods and services," when making decisions about interest rates, he said. The traditional view was that the economy drove the market. Now the opposite is more and more the case. Page A1. 

Stock and Bond Markets Decline
Stock prices fell as some investors interpreted the Federal Reserve chairman's remarks as a warning that shares may be overvalued. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 108.28 points, to 11,090.17. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 13.74 points, to 1,348.27, while the Nasdaq composite index slid 15.72 points, to 2,758.90. C3.
 
The Nasdaq stock market said that beginning Oct. 1 it would make its trade reporting and quotation systems available to organizations that intend to offer after-hours trading. C3.
 
Chicago Exchange Adds Options
Escalating the options trading war it started, the Chicago Board Options Exchange said that it would list options on 29 more stocks, including some contracts listed on the previously uninvolved Pacific Stock Exchange. C3.
 
Cell Phone Monitoring Standard Set
The F.C.C., over the objections of civil libertarians, announced technical standards for cellular phones that will give law enforcement agents expanded ability to monitor conversations and find criminal suspects. A1.
 
Regulators Reject French Bank
French bank regulators ruled that Banque Nationale de Paris could not keep its stake in its unwilling target, Societe Generale, effectively ending Banque Nationale's hopes of creating Europe's largest bank in terms of assets. C2.
 
Medtronic to Buy Xomed Surgical
Medtronic, which is known for its cardiac-rhythm-management products and is seeking to become the dominant maker of medical devices, agreed to pay $800 million in stock for Xomed Surgical Products, the leader in ear, nose and throat surgical products. C14.
 
Merrill Lynch Strategist Is Leaving
Merrill Lynch said that its chief investment strategist, Charles Clough, would leave the firm at year's end. During the bull market, he has favored a conservative strategy that has not been popular with many brokers. Nevertheless, the firm said it had wanted him to stay but he was leaving to spend more time with his family and help not-for-profit organizations. C3.
 
Trial Allowed for Diet-Drug Suit
A nationwide class-action lawsuit seeking medical monitoring for people who used the American Home Products diet drugs Pondimin and Redux has been certified by a Federal judge in Philadelphia. The drugs were frequently taken with phentermine in a combination popularly called fen-phen. C14.
 
Russian Officials Cited in Inquiry
A powerful Russian industrialist whose empire is under investigation in the Bank of New York money-laundering inquiry, Mikhail Khodorkovksy, said that a large part of the billions of dollars involved came from Russian officials trying to protect their fortunes from last year's collapse of the ruble. A1.
 
In Russia, Konstantin Kagalovsky, a businessman cited in the American money-laundering investigation, is becoming a celebrity. A6.
 
Ecuador Says It Will Get I.M.F. Loan
Ecuador said that it would receive a $400 million loan from the International Monetary Fund to help shore up its economy as it seeks to restructure nearly $6 billion in Brady bonds. In addition, the nation's Finance Minister, Ana Lucia Armijos, will step down. C2.

 BODY:

UNRAVELLING
By Elizabeth Graver. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13.
Aimee Slater is a nave New Hampshire farm girl who leaves home for a factory job in the 1840's, becomes impregnated by a mechanic and is exiled by her mother, forcing her to build a new life as an outcast and struggle to overcome her bitterness. In 1997 our reviewer, Benjamin DeMott, called this a "grave, winter-wise and absorbing first novel."
 
TITAN: THE LIFE OF JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, SR.
By Ron Chernow. Vintage, $16.
The archcapitalist John D. Rockefeller Sr. (1839-1937) is portrayed as a complex figure whose lifelong devotion to making money was balanced by a deep religious conviction and devotion to his family. Rockefeller's Marxist analysis of the American economy put him and his fledgling company, Standard Oil, in ruthless pursuit of monopoly on an unparalleled scale before he was 30 years old. This evenhanded account, selected as one of the best books of 1998 by the editors of the Book Review, "is a triumph of the art of biography," Jack Beatty wrote in these pages. "Unflaggingly interesting," it brings its subject to life "through sustained narrative portraiture of the large-scale, 19th-century kind." 

SUMMER AT GAGLOW
By Esther Freud. Ecco, $15.
Shifting back and forth between contemporary London and Germany during and after World War I, this novel explores the fracturing of a Jewish family and how their notion of "home" is altered by their connection to their former summer estate. The result is "a near-seamless meshing of family feeling, history and imagination," Deborah Mason wrote here last year.
 
THE CLIMB: TRAGIC AMBITIONS ON EVEREST
By Anatoli Boukreev and G. Weston DeWalt.
St. Martin's Griffin, $13.95.
This haunting account of the 1996 storm that killed eight climbers from several groups focuses on the role played by the driven Russian guide for one of the teams, who saved three lives (and who died in an avalanche the following year). In 1997 our reviewer, Michael Parfit, called the book "raw but powerful." I MAY BE SOME TIME: Ice and the English Imagination, by Francis Spufford (Picador USA, $15), is a history of Arctic and Antarctic exploration centering on the exploits of great British adventurers like Robert Falcon Scott and James Cook. "With his book, just as with the endeavors of the polar pioneers, the journey might be worth it for its own sake," Robert R. Harris wrote here last year.
 
THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY
By Samantha Gillison. Owl/Holt, $13.
In this first novel, an American researcher takes his wife and young daughter to a remote village in Papua New Guinea, where their fragile family unit is tested after the girl joins the local culture, escaping more and more often into the rain forest. The result is an "exceptional story," Elizabeth Gaffney said here last year.
 
THE SPANISH INQUISITION: A HISTORICAL REVISION
By Henry Kamen. Yale University, $15.95.
The author argues that the popular image of the Inquisition as a barbaric, all-powerful scourge is a 19th-century myth, and that the tribunal was actually weak and its methods more humane than those of most secular courts. Last year our reviewer, Richard L. Kagan, called this "the best general book" on the subject "both for its range and its depth of information." The same publisher has reissued PHILIP OF SPAIN ($17.95), Kamen's biography of Philip II, who reigned during the Inquisition in the 16th century and who is often portrayed as an intolerant religious zealot. In presenting the monarch instead as a cultured Renaissance prince, this nuanced portrait is "a fine achievement," Hugh Thomas wrote here in 1997.
 
MAN WITHOUT A FACE:
The Autobiography of Communism's Greatest Spymaster
By Markus Wolf with Anne McElvoy. Public Affairs, $14.
The former chief of East German intelligence tells how he spent more than 30 years planting moles, running agents, orchestrating betrayals and living the secret life. He "comes across as a clever and cultivated man" who nonetheless "chose to follow a dark star," David Wise wrote here in 1997.
 
IDENTITY
By Milan Kundera. Harper Perennial, $13.
The hero of this dreamlike novel sends his girlfriend anonymous love letters to pick up her spirits, with disastrous results. "Kundera lucidly discloses the psychological obsessions of the two lovers and how these obsessions lead to repeated miscommunications," Robert Grudin wrote here last year. The same publisher has reissued LAUGHABLE LOVES ($13), a collection of the author's tales steeped in anger and fascination with the Communists running the show in Prague in the 60's. In 1974 our reviewer, Paul Theroux, called Kundera "a magnificent short-story writer" whose "best humor always seems to be rooted in authority situations."
 
THE HUNTERS
By James Salter. Vintage International, $13.
The author's first novel, originally published in 1956, is about a fighter pilot's harrowing tour of duty in the Korean War and the jealousies and competition among his fellow squadron members. Praising the book in these pages, George Barrett urged readers to "curl up for a flight . . . so 'clear you can see tomorrow.' "

 BODY:
Veterans BOULEVARD in Metairie, La., is like a million other commercial strips in America: zoned for business, not beauty. On this Sunday most people appear to be either shopping at the mall or going to the movies. The idea that they might be reading books seems remote.
But wait. The busiest place in sight is the Barnes & Noble superstore. I must circle for a parking spot, and when I enter the store I recall the economist Tyler Cowen's argument that the best way to sustain serious literature is through a vigorous market. Here is a table devoted to "The Complete Idiot's Guides." But here is another marked "New Selections From Small and University Presses." Is it true that a rising tide lifts all books? 
 Yet there must be drawbacks to treating books as commodities. One need not be a Marxist to share Ellen Goodman's qualms about "bookstores selling coffee, coffee shops selling books." Is it really O.K. to sell Godiva chocolate bars next to the cash registers?
Cowen would point out that this is nothing new. After all, the first lending libraries (which arose, along with commercial publishing, in 18th-century England) not only charged their middle-class (largely female) clientele a fee to borrow books but also turned a profit selling "hats, teas, perfumes, medicines and tobacco."
Next in line was the blockbuster. In 1862, Graham Robb writes in his recent biography of Victor Hugo, "the first part of 'Les Miserables' (Fantine') appeared in the wake of a mammoth advertising campaign in Paris, London, Brussels, Leipzig, Rotterdam, Madrid, Milan, Turin, Naples, Warsaw, Pest, St. Petersburg and Rio de Janeiro." Even before orchestrating that campaign, Hugo was a celebrity author.
Still, it may be objected that today the bubbliest hype is not lavished on writers of Hugo's stature. Consider Diet Coke's recent gambit: to attach excerpts of new novels to 12- and 24-packs, in the hope that millions of cola drinkers would get hooked and buy not only the books but more Diet Coke. The featured authors -- Maeve Binchy, Nora Roberts, Barbara Taylor Bradford and Elmore Leonard -- were about as market-tested as the beverage.
Moreover, ever since Thomas Whiteside wrote "The Blockbuster Complex" in 1981, it has been an article of faith among literary pessimists that an increasingly conglomerated publishing industry pursues mass market success to the detriment of the so-called midlist books that are often the lifeblood of the culture. This is worth worrying about but, moseying through the Metairie superstore, I find it hard to get too alarmed. There are so many titles on the shelves, I am tempted to agree with Alvin Kernan that "the Gutenberg age will come to an end" not with an "absence of books" but with a "bibliographic surplus."
This fear is not new either. Kernan quotes Diderot: "Eventually the world of learning -- our world -- may drown in books." Two centuries later there are more books in the world than Diderot ever dreamed of, and our heads are still (more or less) above water. Is it possible that the literary culture -- especially in America -- is simply doing what it has always done, which is to thrive without a single authoritative center?
During the last few years the country has seen an astonishing grass-roots revival of reading as a social activity. The publishing industry didn't create this revival, but it is doing its best to tap into it. Katherine Barrett, director of publicity for Vintage Books, says that the proliferation of book clubs, on-line chat rooms, and bookstore-based discussion groups constitutes "a whole new level of reading that is communal and pops up everywhere."
One sign of this revival is the willingness of certain media outlets to include programming about books. National Public Radio and C-Span have long done so because they reach a fairly upscale, literate audience. But soon the stores will be setting up displays of books mentioned in Tina Brown's new magazine, Talk. And Don Imus, the host of the nationally syndicated radio show "Imus in the Morning," not only flogs books but has joined Barnes & Noble and the A&E cable channel in bestowing four annual book awards, three for $50,000 and one for $100,000.
True to form, when Imus launched his awards a year ago, he also launched a pre-emptive strike against all those "elitists" who might knock the host of what he called a "hideous radio program" for posing as an authority on books. One prime target was Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post (whom Imus called "an annoying little gnat"); Yardley responded that he had no problem with the prizes and in fact agreed with Imus that the traditional awards are "only rarely bestowed upon . . . books about subjects or ideas that do not dovetail with the ideological consensus of the intelligentsia."
Suddenly I feel the need for a latte. What exactly is literature's problem? Is it awash in an uncharted sea of text? Or is it gripped by "elitists" and "intelligentsia"? Whenever I feel this confusion, I recall what Irving Howe once said in reply to the standard complaint that the New York literary scene was "incestuous": "It only looks that way from the outside." The real problem is that Americans yearn for a center -- for a cultural capital, if you will -- but also resent the idea. So our centers (they are plural) keep forming, dissolving and forming again.
This ambivalence is brought into sharp relief by a display in the next aisle: "Oprah's Book Club." Imus sells thousands of books, but Winfrey is Queen Midas of the Midlist. For the past three years, every book she has recommended has experienced a significant bump in sales, and many have become runaway best sellers. "Once the announcement is made, it's like a tidal wave," Susan Fleming-Holland, a publicist for Simon & Schuster, observes. "All we can do is get out of the way."
"Oprah's Book Club" is a bit like the superstore itself -- a sign of popular enthusiasm for books that gives intellectuals the willies. The reasons are the same ones I was pondering this Sunday: commodification, the blockbuster mentality and the feeling that the culture either lacks a center or has surrendered its center to the wrong people.
But don't confuse Winfrey with Diet Coke. For all her power, she is not part of some blockbuster machine, engineering popularity in advance. On the contrary, she focuses on a category of books voted least likely to succeed in the marketplace: literary fiction. And the publicists say she is surprisingly immune to their appeals. Indeed, many of her selections are books that nobody is flogging because they have been in print for a number of years.
It doesn't help that Winfrey works in television. The comment of Richard Roeper, a columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times, who wrote about Winfrey's fans, is typical: "How wonderful that they're reading again. How sad, too, that it took a TV personality to change their ways." Why sad? Because all that television-watching has ruined them for reading, even when persuaded to pick up a book?
If this were so, then the human specimens in this superstore would be significantly different from those in Blockbuster Video half a mile away. But the only difference I can see is that the latter are less happy -- and no wonder. They and especially their children are being assaulted by loud commercials and by the candy and other junk food that Blockbuster pushes as the natural accompaniment to watching a film. Maybe what is in evidence here is not some McLuhanesque gap between print and electronic culture but rather the difference between pandering to the lowest common denominator and offering people something uplifting.
I use the word "uplifting" advisedly, knowing that it carries a load of condescension. But that is precisely my point. The secret of Winfrey's golden touch is her willingness to shoulder the mantle of cultural authority -- which, ironically, most literary people seem desperate to shrug off. She can do this because her appeal to viewers has never been based on the exploitation of their social and emotional problems (in the manner of Jerry Springer) but on self-help: a trendy term that nonetheless subsumes older and more deeply ingrained notions of self-improvement and (yes) moral uplift.
Winfrey's selections reflect a coherent sensibility: she favors novels about people, mostly women but some men, who are up against hard circumstances but who manage to endure, if not prevail, in the spirit of what Ralph Ellison called heroic optimism. This isn't how we are supposed to read literature in the late 20th century, but never mind. To say that is to raise a whole different set of worries about the decline of literary culture -- namely, all that serious writers and readers have been doing to hasten it.

CARE AND EQUALITY
Inventing a New Family Politics.
By Mona Harrington.
206 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $24. 
 There is a category of issues in Washington that consists essentially of problems too big to solve. Long-term care for the elderly and disabled is one of them. The need is immense, the current system satisfies almost no one and almost nobody expects anything major to be done anytime soon.
Most of the problems-too-big-to-solve are tied to fundamental changes in how we live, but politicians have a hard time acknowledging this. All of which explains why Mona Harrington's "Care and Equality" is so bracing. Regardless of one's politics (and Harrington's are decidedly liberal), it is refreshing to witness someone actually struggling with the policy implications of real life.
Harrington, the author of three previous books on women and politics, begins with a simple observation: The country is suffering a caretaking crisis with an obvious cause -- the exodus of women from the home into the work force. Somebody else has to care for the children and the aging parents who were once the responsibility of stay-at-home wives and mothers. "We have patchwork systems," she writes, "but we have come nowhere near replacing the hours or the quality of care that the at-home women of previous generations provided for the country."
Most women, she argues, don't make enough for really first-rate child care. And only the truly affluent can handle the costs of long-term care; most Americans who enter a nursing home end up, sooner or later, on Medicaid, the health program for the poor. Yet Harrington notes that government and much of business still operate as if there were an unpaid army of caregivers at home. And the reigning ideology still holds that the family is responsible for the family, that barring some special circumstance like extreme poverty, caring for children and other dependents is a personal, not a public, concern.
This position, Harrington suggests, makes sense for traditionalists and conservatives, who essentially believe that the stay-at-home mother is the best of all possible choices, and one that society should do its best to promote. But it does not make sense for liberals. Which brings her to the main point of the book: a plea for a new "mainstream liberal politics of the family."
Harrington acknowledges that this will not be easy. Liberals are most comfortable with the defense of individual rights -- for example, the right of women to compete on equal terms in the work force -- and often apprehensive that the claims of the family will crowd out those rights. Yet because liberals have helped create this new world, she argues, they have an obligation to confront "the tortuous implications of moving women from the separate sphere of the home to a position of full, meaningful equality."
When it comes to actual policy prescriptions, Harrington often relies on liberal standbys (major subsidies for child care and health care; across-the-board subsidies for low-income workers) that would have a hard time passing in a Democratic Congress, let alone the current Republican one. Still, this book is not intended to provide an incremental agenda, but to be a call to arms. So, for example, she urges liberals to confront the idea that paid family leaves, which are the norm in many other countries, are simply impossible here. "The bar to paid leaves in the United States is not economic," she says. "It is ideological."
She is at her best and most passionate in writing about the values of care and equality: how they have almost inevitably collided in recent years, when so much has changed in the culture and so little in government and business. She broods over the welfare debate, and over the potential and the disappointments of the Clinton Administration.
Harrington sees the rise of a new, more feminized politics -- pioneered, in many ways, by President Clinton -- and applauds it, although she correctly understands that it could become a politics of small gestures. "To move beyond rhetoric to the reality of change, liberals need to be careful of substantively empty political appeals to women, encouraging the appeals but insisting on substance." And she brushes aside the notion that the needs of the family are not the stuff of politics, arguing that the country no longer requires the "warrior hero leaders" of the past. What could be more important, she demands, than building supports for the new families that, like it or not, women's equality has created?

Panama Converting Canal Zone for Tourism

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: PANAMA

 BODY:
ON Dec. 31, the United States is scheduled to complete the transfer of the Panama Canal to Panama. The 50-mile passageway -- a wondrous feat of United States engineering -- transports more than 13,000 ships, including cruise vessels, and 190 million tons of cargo a year between the Pacific and the Atlantic.
But the transfer, which is being carried out in steps according to treaties signed in 1977 by President Carter and Brig. Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera of Panama, who died in a plane crash in 1981, also includes about $4 billion worth of property in what was known as the American Canal Zone. If Panama's ambitious plans are realized,232,278 acres occupied by American military installations to defend the canal will be transformed into an international hub of commerce closer to a mini-Singapore, with the potential of increasing tourism and exports and adding millions to the economy. 
 "The idea is to take advantage of the infrastructure we already have and use interesting concepts, looking for new markets," said Ricardo Icaza, marketing manager of the Interoceanic Region Authority, created in 1993 to manage the property relinquished under the canal treaties.
Buildings on the military bases -- barracks, hospitals, schools, houses and offices -- are already being turned into private housing, hotels, industrial parks, ports, universities and sports facilities. A new 310-room hotel, the Sol Melia, is scheduled to open this December in what used to be the School of the Americas, where Latin American military officers trained. The former military base of Amador is being turned into a tourism complex, set to open in 2001, that is meant to attract the passengers of more than 300 cruise ships that transit the canal annually but do not stop. The complex will offer hotels with views of Panama City and passing ships, casinos, golf courses, shopping centers and marinas.
Near the small town of Gamboa, at the canal's midpoint, a $25 million eco-tourism project over 91 acres, the Gamboa Tropical Rainforest Resort, is expected to open next year. The development on the banks of the Chagres River, about 45 minutes from Panama City by car, will include a 100-room hotel and marina in a natural setting that offers rain-forest trails, bird watching and fishing.
As the Canal Zone, which occupied close to 10 percent of the national territory after the waterway was completed in 1914, has gradually reverted to Panama under steps mandated by the treaties, some tourism projects have already been completed. Within the Soberania National Park not far from Gamboa, the privately run Canopy Tower hotel opened last January in a former military radar tower. In an ingenious conversion, the circular, galvanized-steel tower building topped by a 30-foot-high yellow dome is now a five-story, six-room "eco-lodge" with a 360-degree view of treetops. There are plans to add four guest rooms nearby.
"The potential is enormous for the adaptive re-use of facilities," said Pierre Cowart, a visitor from Chicago on his honeymoon, who with his wife was spotting birds through a telescope from the tower's observatory. A construction manager by profession, he commented, "It's an architectural challenge."
Both Panama and countries like Spain and Taiwan have already invested $1 billion, mostly in tourism and maritime projects due to be finished over the next five years, Panamanian officials say. More than 100 such projects are under way.
Still, there is also great uncertainty. Many Panamanians I talked to noted that some of the properties that have reverted to Panama since 1995 are already deteriorating. Most of the nine military bases that make up the most valuable property are being transferred this year. The property's fate hinges on the ability of Panama to attract more investors, Panamanian officials say.
It is a tall order for Panama, which has greeted the Americans' departure with a mixture of national pride and anxiety. Besides disposing of the valuable real estate the United States is leaving, Panama must replace the jobs and income earned from the American bases -- up to $350 million a year at one time -- and operate the canal, which brings in about $545 million a year in tolls. The Government must also oversee an expansion of the canal already under way and prevent deforestation of the watershed, under the scrutiny of both Panamanians and much of the world.
Historically, most of the canal's revenue has been invested in maintenance and modernization, but there are worries among Panamanians and Americans that governments here could be tempted to divert canal money for their own use or politicize its operation, lowering the canal's standards and safety. But the newly elected president, Mireya Moscoso, who will take office on Wednesday, has promised to keep the canal free of corruption and nepotism and use it to reduce high unemployment and poverty among the population of 2.8 million.
"All of Panama is monitoring very closely what will happen to the canal," an American official here said. "They all feel it's an asset that belongs to the whole country."

HEADLINE: The Milosevic Generation

BYLINE: By Blaine Harden; Blaine Harden is a reporter for The Times. His last article for the magazine, on Milo Djukanovic, the President of Montenegro, appeared in April.

 BODY:
In the cafe at Tennis Club Max, not far from where American cruise missiles shredded Slobodan Milosevic's house, a law student explained the secrets of being certifiably crazy in Serbia.
"My final diagnosis from the army, the one they stamped on my passport, says I am a paranoid depressive," he said proudly. 
 As Serbs with racquets thwacked away a humid Balkan afternoon on clay courts in front of our table, the law student told me how his finest moment of make-believe madness, what he called "my extraordinary performance," had helped him to escape the war in Kosovo.
Unlike Serbia's previous lost wars in the former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, which the law student saw coming months in advance, the Kosovo conflict broke out too quickly for him to make his usual preparations. In the past, he had left his shoulder-length hair unwashed for weeks. In a well-chosen uniform of rubber gardening boots, worn-out pants and ragged sweaters, he muttered obscenities, spoke of suicide and cried uncontrollably. The Yugoslav Army psychiatrists were impressed; on six separate occasions, they exempted him from service.
In the spring, when NATO began bombing and Yugoslav Army recruiters came sniffing after conscripts again, the law student had no time to grow a convincing head of nut-case hair. Working with his parents, the law student, who is 26 years old and not nearly crazy enough to allow his name to appear in this magazine, came up with Plan B.
His mother called for an ambulance from Lazar Lazarevic Psychiatric Hospital (where the chairman, insanely enough, is Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic). She said her son was once again acting odd. Meanwhile, in his bedroom in the house where he still lives with his parents, the law student sprawled out on the floor beneath a window, and his father smashed it to pieces. While the family waited for the ambulance, both parents sprinkled shards of glass on their son's head. He was whisked off to the hospital, where -- refusing to speak to doctors or nurses -- he spent the Kosovo war taking antidepressant pills, hiding them under his tongue and spitting them out in the bathroom.
While the law student whispered his story to me, a prominent surgeon, from a Serbian family that has produced doctors for generations, sat down at the table next to us. He had come to Tennis Club Max to watch his 7-year-old daughter take lessons. The surgeon had time on his hands. Taking advantage of United Nations sanctions imposed during the Bosnian war, he put down his scalpel six years ago and became a gasoline smuggler. It was an excellent move. The Government pays doctors about $140 a month; gasoline smugglers with government connections make many thousands of dollars a month. The surgeon has made so much money that he no longer smuggles. He plays tennis instead.
A bit later in the afternoon, after the law student had left, Radovan (Rade) Markovic sat down in the same chair to wait for his regular doubles match. He arrived with 10 thick-necked, skinheaded young men carrying automatic weapons. They staked out the perimeter of the tennis club, whispered into radios, hid behind trees.
Markovic, a short, beefy man with a steel-gray crew cut, is the head of state security and a protege of Milosevic's wife (but no relation to her). Besides being the country's top spy master, Markovic commands state paramilitary forces that helped lead the campaign of murder, theft and house-burning in Kosovo that war crimes investigators say killed at least 11,000 Kosovar Albanians. American officials say he is likely to be indicted by the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague, but Markovic has not allowed this unpleasantness to rattle his tennis game. Throughout the three-month Kosovo war and on into this summer, he played at Tennis Club Max as much as weather permitted. The weather, however, has been rough.
All summer, the rain punished Belgrade. Thunderstorms rolled over the city night after night, flooding homes, washing away cars and ruining the clay courts at Tennis Club Max. The booming storms kept Serbs awake, making them feel as helpless and hunted as on those spring nights when American missiles were picking apart government buildings. By midsummer, with the storms still pounding the city, it was widely rumored that the American Government was orchestrating the rain.
I found Tennis Club Max through Helena Zdravkovic, whose father owns the place and plays doubles regularly with Markovic, the state security boss. Helena drives a Mercury Capri convertible with expired Florida plates, but the police let her get away with it. They seem to know whom her father plays tennis with. Belgrade is that kind of town.
Welcome to the capital of Serbia, where bureaucrats with bodyguards and blood on their hands have become private-club swells, where middle-class professionals have been forced to choose between penury or criminality, where feigned lunacy is a sane way to stay safe.
Four lost wars, international isolation and gangster economics have combined to make Belgrade especially cruel to the young people who have come of age during the 12-year reign of Milosevic. The city has descended into its own sad, slacker category among major European capitals. It's a metropolis where hard work, professional excellence and saving for the future are wastes of time.
This is the Milosevic generation. Unemployed or stuck in jobs that usually pay less than $100 a month, young Serbs between the ages of 18 and 30 typically live with their parents, spend nearly all their money on night life, postpone marriage, avoid parenthood and put off plans for the future -- except to get out of the country. Estimates of the number of university-trained young people who have fled the city since 1990 range from 100,000 to 300,000. That's a catastrophic drain of talent and skills from a nation where in 1991 just 622,000 people in a population of 10 million had more than a high-school education. This summer even the option of running away has run out. The war in Kosovo forced most Western countries to close their embassies in Belgrade, making obtaining visas far more difficult.
"Delayed gratification is what the whole civilized world is based on, but in Belgrade, it makes no sense," says Svetlana Logar-Djuric, a prominent psychologist at the University of Belgrade and the mother of an 18-year-old son. She has spent several years researching, among other things, the lives of Belgrade's smart set -- those whose professional parents had, as late at the mid-1980's, constituted the only well-paid, widely traveled middle class in the Communist bloc.
"For young people here, it makes sense to be depressed," she says. "Many go to bed at 4 o'clock in the morning and sleep all day. They don't see a point in growing up to become responsible adults. The city teaches them to be helpless."
Her own son, Jovan, scolds her for having wasted her time working long hours to earn a Ph.D. He has a point. Her university job pays approximately $100 a month, and the money always arrives several months late.
"If you are a criminal, you are, like, cool," Jovan said one afternoon as we sat with his mother and four of his high-school friends in their Belgrade apartment so choked with cigarette smoke that it was difficult to see across the cramped living room. (Jovan and his friends were all chain-smokers.) "You can't blame anyone for being a criminal. I have respect for those who have the will to do what they want. Life in the fast lane -- how can that not be attractive?" His friends' heads bobbed in agreement.
Burglary, for instance, is one of the few promising career paths for savvy young Serbs. Home is where the money is -- about $2.5 billion, according to the Yugoslav Association of Banks. In the Milosevic era, it's much less risky to hide money in a mattress than to deposit it in a bank. The regime has seized the hard-currency savings accounts of most private depositors -- about $4.1 billion in the last decade. The regime also tacitly encourages the young to consider careers in car theft. The streets of Belgrade are filled with gleaming late-model cars that have no license plates. They are driven by mean-looking young men and are often ignored by the police. For the past two years, the Government has offered a monthlong amnesty to car thieves, allowing them to register any car, even one that is obviously hot, in order to raise money from licensing fees. Many of the vehicles have been swiped by gangsters and paramilitary thugs from other republics in the former Yugoslavia, as well as from Western Europe.
As much as Jovan and his friends were mesmerized by life in Belgrade's fast lane, they saw dark motives behind the West's bombing of their city. They told me that the reasons for the war were: American fear of a united Europe, the desire of the military-industrial complex to use up its old bombs and multinational corporate hunger for Serbia's mineral wealth. As for war crimes, Jovan and his friends told me to get real.
"It was war," Jovan said. "As much as Serbs did something bad, so did the Albanians."
Besides the streets flooded by unrelenting rains, the conspiracy theories, the stolen cars and the 20-somethings who were morbidly depressed, Belgrade was drowning in denial.
Some of it was merely the posturing of a defeated demagogue, as state-controlled television insisted in late June that Serbia had won the war. At a time when about 35,000 NATO troops had occupied Kosovo and when Kosovar Albanians, bent on revenge, were harassing, ripping off and murdering Kosovar Serbs, Milosevic's minions were announcing what every sentient Serb knew to be a lie. "Our country's territorial integrity and sovereignty have been defended," Momir Bulatovic, the Yugoslav Prime Minister, said in parliament.
More fundamental and more pernicious was the denial that bubbled up in conversation this summer with well-educated young people in Belgrade. Almost without exception, they could not bring themselves to admit that atrocities had been committed in their name. Even as war-crimes investigators were digging up mass graves in Kosovo, they refused to concede what was obvious to the rest of the world: Serb forces had committed crimes against humanity on a scale and with an organized savagery that was grossly disproportionate to the threat posed by ethnic Albanians.
The people of Belgrade, about a fifth of Serbia's 10 million people and 40 percent of its college-educated population, were far less upset at the bestial way in which the war was fought than by the fact that Milosevic had compounded their poverty and isolation by losing it.
I first started coming to Belgrade as a reporter in 1990, as Yugoslavia was beginning to come apart. On the first day I set foot in the country, I had the dubious privilege of spending several hours sitting next to Milosevic, listening to a windy lecture about wronged Serbian greatness, unable to get a question in edgewise and trying not to stare at his exceptionally big ears. He struck me then not as a nationalist zealot, but as an opportunist, scrambling to save himself from the fate of other Communist thugs from across the former East bloc. In 1989, most of them had been tossed out of office, jailed or, in the case of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his Stalinist and much-hated wife, Elena, lined up against a wall and machine-gunned to death. Milosevic, incidentally, also has a Stalinist, much-hated wife.
The Serbian leader dodged this bullet by hiding behind nationalism and exploiting his republic's fear of foreign domination. The splintering of Yugoslavia in the early 1990's, which left about two million Serbs outside of Serbia, gave Milosevic an excuse for using violence to change borders and protect his people. Then a swaggering nationalist regime in Croatia bullied Serbs and handed him an even better rationale for war. When there were no facts to justify Serbian paranoia, Milosevic used state television to manufacture them. He showcased a grisly procession of mutilated corpses. They were introduced to viewers as the bodies of innocent Serbs slaughtered by Croats or Bosnian Muslims or Kosovar Albanians. It worked. After the evening news, calls often flooded into spouse-abuse hot lines in Belgrade, as wives screamed that their husbands were beating them up.
Milosevic used nationalism as a kind of Orwellian Victory Gin. It intoxicated the masses and blurred their vision as everyone around Milosevic / his son, his ministers and his paramilitary henchmen -- got rich off smuggling and war profiteering.
The final pillar of Milosevic's nationalism was murder -- of civilians whose sole crime was not being Serbian. I stayed in Sarajevo during the worst of the Serbian siege of the Bosnian capital. It was a barbaric exercise in which Serbs in the surrounding hills used artillery and sniper fire to randomly murder tens of thousands of people, most of them unarmed civilians. I remember being bounced out of bed by shells that struck apartment buildings near the pension where I was trying to sleep. The silence after an explosion was often broken by the screams of people discovering that their children or their parents had been blown to pieces. I visited these shattered apartments and once, after leaving, found a bit of human flesh sticking gumlike to my shoe.
But it never occurred to me in the early part of this decade that the Serbs of Belgrade were collectively responsible for these and other horrors perpetrated by the Milosevic regime. Far from it, Belgrade was for me an intellectual and cultural oasis in the ruins of Yugoslavia.
Tito's brand of Communism had allowed Belgrade's middle class to become far more affluent and Westernized -- from foreign travel and foreign investment, from a hybrid economy that mixed socialism with private enterprise, from a flood of foreign movies, books and music -- than residents of any other capital in Eastern Europe.
Until the war in Bosnia began in 1992, Belgrade had been the destination city in the East bloc for young Poles, Czechs and Hungarians seeking to be cool. It teemed with outspoken politicians, well-informed journalists and insightful academics -- not to mention beautiful women, smart nightclubs and excellent restaurants.
Milosevic was a curiously tolerant dictator. As long as he controlled television, he allowed the intelligentsia to fuss and fume against his regime in their low-circulation magazines.
That tolerance dried up after mass demonstrations in the winter of 1996-97 nearly brought down his regime. Milosevic imposed Draconian laws that all but silenced criticism. During the Kosovo war, one of the few journalists who continued to denounce the regime was shot dead in the streets of Belgrade.
Atrocities in Kosovo this year have blackened the name of Serbia as never before. Outside the country, the very word "Serb" took on the sinister resonance of "Nazi." Even if they were not the ones doing the fighting, an argument grew that Serbian civilians should be held morally responsible for crimes committed in their name.
In Belgrade this summer, though, people didn't feel responsible. Nor did they tolerate politicians who suggested that they were. At the huge opposition rally last week in Belgrade, as during earlier rallies outside the capital this summer, speakers who said that Serbia had been "shamed" in the eyes of the world were careful to blame Milosevic and a few maniacs in his regime -- and to distance the people of Serbia from any accountability for the conduct of the war.
I had asked Helena Zdravkovic, who is 21 and speaks perfect American-accented English, to take me around Belgrade. Having spent her teen-age years hanging out at Tennis Club Max, she was familiar with the life styles of the rich and criminal. She went to an elite public high school in Belgrade, and many of her closest friends were the children of middle-class professional parents who in the past 10 years have slid into poverty. She was both a player in the city's social scene and a skeptic, having studied journalism for the past two academic years at Florida International University, in Miami, and the American University in Paris. She plans to attend Emerson College, in Boston, next year.
Helena also happened to be blond, attractive and fitted out in fetching summer dresses, which does not hurt in Belgrade. Her father, Dejan Zdravkovic, opened Tennis Club Max nine years ago after retiring at the age of 40. He had made what he told me was a substantial amount of money in Italy selling machine tools to governments around the world. Most of the equipment was for making cannons and artillery pieces.
He came home to Belgrade and opened the club in the exclusive residential diplomats' neighborhood of Dedinje. He did it, he told me, because he wanted to spend more time with his wife and two children and play lots of tennis with his friends. The club has just 35 members, many of them businessmen who have grown rich under the United Nations sanctions imposed this decade on the Milosevic regime.
"Sanctions are paradise," Dejan said as we sat beneath "Just Do It!" sun umbrellas in the cafe of his club. "Normally, you import and you pay duties and then taxes. But under sanctions, if you know the right people, you pay no duties and no taxes, and you have the excuse of charging more. Sanctions are what cemented Milosevic's power."
Dejan, who drives a bright red Porsche with four-digit license plates that signal to police his connections to the regime, said repeatedly that he hates what Milosevic has done to Serbia. But he told me that he is a pragmatist.
"Tell me who surrenders money and power voluntarily?" he asked. "I'll tell you. Nobody."
Although Dejan and his wife, Ivana, play tennis, do business and socialize with well-connected people in the regime, they are nervous about the future. They are sending both their children to college in the United States. Ivana, a former professional translator who operates a travel agency exclusively for tennis club members, prefers that the children stay on in the States after college. Their son, Pedja, 19, won a four-year tennis scholarship to the University of Hartford and starts there in the fall.
Helena plans to return after college; she doesn't want to live anywhere but Belgrade. Her boyfriend, a tennis coach and concert clarinetist, is here. So are her friends and the comfortable accouterments of her upper-middle-class life. On a hot July morning, Helena treated me to one of those accouterments -- an apartment-turned-boutique in central Belgrade that admits only customers known to the owner. The shop, which has no name, sells designer clothing and fashion accessories shoplifted from Italy and smuggled into Serbia.
The owner, a Montenegrin with a shaved head, gold chains and leather vest, kissed Helena (and glared at me) before we climbed the stairs to his third-floor boutique. He is a regular at Tennis Club Max, where he comes with the latest issues of Vogue and Marie Claire to sit with well-heeled women. They point to clothes that tickle their fancy. His men in Italy then try to steal them. During the owner's brief conversation with Helena, he told her that one of his men in Italy had "fallen," meaning that he was arrested trying to break into a warehouse full of merchandise.
There were video cameras on the stairs leading up to the shop and a monitor inside that gave clerks a chance to scrutinize visitors before letting them enter. Helena, of course, was more than welcome. The place was piled high with panties and sunglasses, handbags and evening gowns. I saw pink-and-gray stiletto-heeled Versace shoes in the living room, Fendi white leather skirts in one bedroom and a handsome charcoal-gray Kenzo business suit in the second bedroom. Most of the clothes bore stickers from the stores where they had been stolen. The prices were about one-third retail. Helena was not impressed.
"It is nothing like it was last year," she said. "I mean I could find really nice clothes for myself and I am really picky."
The shopkeeper explained to Helena that the springtime war in Kosovo had constricted his supply line for summer fashion. But with the war over, he was expecting new shipments.
Then we were off in Helena's convertible, her 6-month-old, purebred English bulldog, Boobi, drooling in the back seat, for a look at what American cruise missiles have done to Belgrade. Like ice-pick punctures in the neck, the chilling quality of the strikes was not their size but their placement. We stopped at an intersection in the heart of the city. At each corner of the intersection, but only at each corner, there were ruins. The Serbian Government center, the foreign ministry and two defense ministry buildings had been reduced to rubble or were fire-gutted shells. The precision of the destruction suggested a war with an invisible, all-seeing enemy and of a city helpless to protect itself.
Eerily, all around the destruction, traffic flowed, shops were open and apartments were being lived in. Except for long lines for rationed gasoline, the surface of everyday life in Belgrade seemed remarkably placid. The summer's rain and heat had produced bumper crops, and fresh vegetables and meat were plentiful. But the surface was deceptive. The war in Kosovo had plunged the Serbian economy into free fall, incomes were collapsing and the United Nations World Food Program was warning of massive wintertime shortages of food, electricity and fuel.
We were invited to a late lunch in the private restaurant of a friend of Helena's father, a former gangster turned prominent businessman. We met in his office at a gleaming car dealership in the city center and were served espresso by a team of leggy, young female attendants whose skirts were short and T-shirts tight. Besides automobiles, the businessman imports blue jeans, designer sportswear, gasoline and engine lubricants. He told me, rather vaguely and under the condition that I not use his name, that he enjoys profitable connections with the Milosevic Government. But as a precaution against Milosevic's possible ouster, he said, his wife and children live in Athens.
In the weeks before we met, the opposition movement in Belgrade had been holding demonstrations around Serbia, demanding that Milosevic resign. The businessman said he did not approve, not because of any affection for Milosevic, but because it would probably be bad for profits. According to him and according to American Government officials, opposition parties in Serbia often demand kickbacks and bribes from businessmen, just like the ruling Socialist Party that Milosevic controls.
"I think it is more expensive to deal with opposition politicians than with the Socialists," the businessman told me. "The new parties are very hungry for bribes. I am afraid that any political change may be worse."
The businessman got his start in Belgrade's gangster economy in the early 1990's, using money acquired from several years of working in Germany as a thief, according to a longtime friend. Asked how someone gets ahead in Milosevic's world, the businessman, with a straight face, said, "Everybody who is smart, who is willing to spend 16-hour days in the office like I do, can work and do well."
Being smart and hard-working have nothing to do with getting rich in Serbia, says Robert S. Gelbard, who until this summer was the United States special envoy to the Balkans. Gelbard, who spent the past two and a half years watching the Milosevic regime, estimates that only a few thousand people have profited from the crony capitalism of what he calls "Serbia Inc."
"This is a kleptocracy," he says. "People who are senior members of the party structure or of the Government have been sucking the country dry, although the terrain has become pretty arid."
A few of the kleptocrats are notoriously well connected to the regime. Milosevic's only son, Marko, made a fortune smuggling gasoline and cigarettes. The paramilitary warlord, Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan and indicted in 1997 for war crimes in Croatia and Bosnia, amassed a fortune of his own in gasoline smuggling and money laundering in the early 1990's before turning to politics, marrying Serbia's hottest pop star in a ceremony broadcast on state-run television and buying a Belgrade soccer team. (Apparently nervous about the future in Belgrade, Arkan sounded out officials in Belgium about moving there; he was told that he would be arrested.)
Private businessmen have also made fortunes by paying off the regime to secure import licenses that give them monopolies inside Serbia on consumer goods. The real players in Serbia Inc., though, are Government ministers who typically regulate and award contracts to firms that they also control. Dejan Kovacevic, for example, is the Serbian minister of construction, as well as chairman of Mastrogradnje, a major construction company that wins large government contracts from his own ministry.
The Serb businessman who attributed his wealth to intelligence and hard work took Helena and me to lunch at his private restaurant, which he bought this summer and where the only diners are his friends and business associates. With a Puccini opera playing softly in the background, we were served caviar pasta and an elegant pinot noir in the restored dining room of a 19th-century town house. The conversation turned, as did nearly every conversation I had this summer with Serbs in Belgrade, to Kosovo.
Describing the Kosovar Albanians as "the most criminal people in the world," the businessman said Americans should have known what the Serbian reaction would be to the NATO bombing.
"When you put your bombs on Belgrade, we had to make ethnic cleansing in Kosovo," he said. "This is normal. Everybody in Serbia knows it, even little children."
The downwardly mobile in Belgrade do not mind being quoted by name. Helena took me one evening to meet her friend Darko Susnjar, who grew up in Belgrade's upper middle class, but who has since been skidding into the ranks of the working poor. He worked this summer as a ticket taker on a private bus, making about $5.50 for a 12-hour day.
With a ring in his left ear, day-old stubble and long brown hair tied in a ponytail, Susnjar, 26, bears a passing resemblance to a young version of the comedian George Carlin.
We met at a pizza place beside the Danube River in Zemun, a suburb of newish but dismal apartment buildings. Darko was late because thieves, for the third time in a month, had tried to steal his 1983 Opel Cadet. The car's door and trunk locks had all been broken, and he had just learned that it would cost $125 to fix them. That was about a month's pay.
"My car is 16 years old and falling apart. I can't understand the mentality of people who want to steal that kind of junk," he said.
Darko was depressed, and not just about the car. An only child, he lives with his parents and admits to being a desultory student at the University of Belgrade. Like many students there, he sees no point in graduating. He studies ethnology, a field that he acknowledges is a waste of time, given the circumstances in Serbia.
"If someone had told me 10 years ago that I would be working on a bus, I would have had to fight him," Darko said, after a beer.
He grew up expecting more. His parents were supervisors at two major hotels in Belgrade, he said, making a combined salary of more than $70,000 a year until the early 1990's. Foreign investors have since pulled out of the Intercontinental Hotel, where his mother worked. His father worked at the Hotel Yugoslavia, which on May 7 was hit by three American cruise missiles. The Americans were apparently trying to take out the hotel's casino, which was partly owned by Arkan, but missed by a few feet and gutted a wing of rooms in the hotel.
Darko and his family live near that hotel, and he happened to be out that Friday night in May getting a hamburger at a fast-food kiosk. He paid for his burger a few minutes before midnight, just as the missiles ruined his father's livelihood.
"I stood there for a minute and watched the hotel burn," Darko said. "What to do? I walked home and ate my hamburger. Now, from day to day, we sink lower. You ask yourself, How much more?" He said his parents now live on a sort of severance pay that totals about $45 a month.
"Until this country went to hell, my mother and father and I had really great lives," he said. "They took me all over the world. We lived like normal people in Europe. We went to the sea. We went skiing. We had normal new clothes and normal new cars, not junk like now. We used to fly to Rome to go shopping. My father once called me long-distance from CBGB in New York, where he was on a business trip, just to say that he was in the place where the Ramones got their start. These are the reasons why I can't picture myself as a ticket taker on a bus."
Darko has a plan to escape. It depresses him, but still it's a plan. He calls it the "Green Card" option, a reference to the 1990 movie in which Gerard Depardieu marries Andie MacDowell to win legal residency in the United States. Darko's Andie MacDowell will be his girlfriend's sister, who lives in Lucerne, Switzerland.
"She doesn't like it, but she will do it," he told me.
I asked Darko about politics, mentioning that I had been attending opposition rallies and heard a couple of speakers who dared to mention Serbian atrocities in Kosovo.
Darko, who listened to Radio Free Europe throughout the war, had also heard about atrocities. He did not argue that they were justified by Albanian treachery. He simply did not care to talk about the subject. To avoid thinking about war and to salve depression brought on by the summer of endless rain, Darko said he was reading 19th-century novels and listening to sunny Cuban music.
"Politics here is a kind of sickness, and I'm not interested," he said. "Democratic change will take many years. In the meantime, the Serbs will hibernate, like bears. At this time, Thanatos is much stronger than Eros. It is dark here now. That is our reality."
The morning after we drank beer with Darko, thugs attacked young people from the opposition Democratic Party who were asking residents in the suburb of New Belgrade to sign a petition calling for Milosevic's resignation. Three opposition party workers were injured, and one was hospitalized with head and internal injures. As usual in Belgrade, no arrests were made. The incident was not reported on state television.
While the opposition activists were getting their heads kicked in, Helena and I were just two blocks away in a newly built shopping center that was leaking in the summer rain. Shoe-shop clerks took advantage of a clear morning to set hundreds of pairs of soaked sneakers out on a sidewalk to dry in the sun. We went to a bar in the shopping center to have coffee with a young woman who, until that morning, had worked as a news writer at a television station in Belgrade.
BK Television is a private station owned by the five Karic brothers, among the richest businessmen in Serbia. The station has sleek broadcast studios, attractive anchorpeople and a jazzy news format. But it slavishly toes the Government line. When it mildly challenged the regime in 1997, Milosevic threatened to take away the station's broadcast license.
Ivana Konstantinovic, 22, a diminutive woman with large brown eyes, has worked for BK Television for nearly three years. Mostly, she repackaged news from state-controlled television, trying to make it into a more zippy product. She cut out words like "hegemony" and "international organs." But still, as she conceded over coffee and nearly a pack of cigarettes, her final product was usually distorted and misleading.
"We tried to tell the truth, but it was a matter of luck whether we succeeded," said Ivana, also a student at the University of Belgrade studying international relations. "Sometimes, by being clever, we could tell things the Government didn't want known. During the rallies against Milosevic in 1996, we were not allowed to say how large the crowds were. So we said buses were having trouble getting through the city."
In the wake of the Kosovo war, state television this summer demonized Serbian opposition leaders, often calling them traitors and spies in the pay of the C.I.A. Ivana dutifully rewrote these accusations, although she said she did not believe them. She could mention opposition rallies only after they had been denounced by Government officials.
Ivana wants to get out of Serbia with her boyfriend, Bojan Dragicevic, a technician at BK Television. Her three best friends have already fled to Botswana, France and Holland. That was before the war in Kosovo and before the visa situation tightened. She now lives at home with her parents, both of whom are engineers. One designs plastic bags, the other works in a tractor factory. Ivana gets paid about $110 a month, which is roughly a tenth of what she would have been paid for the same job a decade ago.
"In this situation," she said, "that is quite good money for me."
On the morning we spoke, Ivana had been promoted. She had started a new job as an early-morning on-air personality, reading traffic reports and community-service bulletins.
"I was very depressed writing lies," she said, "Now on the morning program, at least, I can honestly look into the camera and say: 'There is no electricity this morning."'
For young women in Belgrade, career choices tend to lie somewhere on a continuum between honest-impoverishing and criminal-lucrative. In the dispiriting middle lies the temp work done by "sponsor girls" -- middle-class high-school girls who tart themselves up and trade their bodies to gangsters in return for designer clothes, cell phones and fancy dinners.
The European, a Belgrade magazine banned by the regime at the beginning of the year, described a sponsor girl as "a symbol of the absolute commercialization of sexuality, the newest manifestation of the subjugation of women. She is the target of malicious gossip and the dark subject of her fellow teen-agers' dreams, the reason for her parents' distress."
I had dinner with two buxom, bejeweled and elaborately made-up young women, one of whom used to date Helena's brother. We met around midnight in the Fortress, an elegant new outdoor restaurant built amid Roman and medieval ruins on a hilltop at the confluence of the Danube and Sava Rivers. It's an expensive place where gangsters gather late at night to show off new cars, gold chains and teen-age babes in designer duds. The heavy night air smelled of grilled beef and American cigarettes and French perfume. Serbian rock music washed across the terrace from a nightclub next door.
The young women agreed to meet me only to discuss the phenomenon of sponsor girls, not to talk about themselves. But after about a half-hour of conversation, they both began to slip in and out of the first person while explaining the costs and benefits of hanging out with older men with guns, shaved heads and deep pockets.
"If you are with a guy who makes his living that way, you can be the center of attention," said Olja Karleusa, 18, who was dressed in a powder-blue satin jacket over a tight tank top. Her dyed blond hair was teased Tina Turner style and her milky white lipstick matched her nails.
"Gangsters are a normal element of life," Olja said. "The girls don't think they are doing anything wrong. The possibility of earning money is very small. Everyone here does illegal stuff, so it seems so normal."
Her friend, Milena Markovic, 19, who wore glitter makeup on her cheeks and whose breasts were bursting out of a low-cut T-shirt that said "Power Girl," told me that every high-school girl in Belgrade is tempted by the life gangsters can offer.
"It feeds your ego if you are with a guy like that," she said.
Helena had told me that Olja's boyfriend is a Belgrade criminal whose best friend was shot this summer in a cafe. Olja did not want to talk about it. She and Milena did want to talk about the short shelf life and poor marital prospects of a sponsor girl after she turns 24.
"The guys go from one girl to another and there is a very small chance of him falling in love," said Olja. "There are so many girls that he can always find another younger one."
"The guys are aware of the situation and that they have all the power," added Milena.
"They realize what scum the girls are and they use them," Olja said.
The more they talked, the angrier they became and the more "they" became "we."
"We are furious because without a gangster friend, you can't really enjoy Belgrade," said Olja. "Girls have no possibility to do what they want with their lives unless they are from rich families."
Both the girls had graduated from high school and said they were planning on enrolling this fall in the law faculty at the University of Belgrade. It didn't make sense to become a lawyer in a country without laws, they said, but they didn't know what else to do.
I asked them about Kosovo, about the bodies of Albanians that were being dug up there from mass graves and if they were aware that outside Serbia, many people had the impression that Serbian forces had committed genocide.
It was as if I had belched or insulted their makeup. The conversation paused awkwardly. Both girls seemed offended.
"I don't know what happened in Kosovo," Olja said, dismissively. "I didn't hear that we did any more atrocities than what the Albanians did to us."
They wanted to talk about the weather. Both Olja and Milena said the summer's thunderstorms reminded them of the spring months when Americans bombed Belgrade. They said they'd been having trouble sleeping and that they'd heard the Americans were causing the rainstorms.
I said I did not think that was very likely. They left for another nightclub.
It was about 1 a.m. but the restaurant was still crowded. Sullen men were knocking back whiskey and being adored by young women who looked like Olja and Milena. A friend of Helena's spotted us and invited us for a drink. He was eager to talk about Kosovo. In fact, Vukoje Dobric, a Serb who was born and raised in Kosovo, found it difficult to talk of anything else. He chain-smoked cigarettes and drank beer after beer, and his left leg twitched incessantly. A medical student, he looked much older than his 20 years. His nerves seemed shot.
Vukoje lives in a Belgrade apartment next door to what used to be the headquarters of the Federal Interior Ministry. The massive building was demolished this spring by American cruise-missile strikes. They came at night, as Vukoje, just a few yards from the blazing building, lay terrified in his bed.
His parents fled their home in the Kosovo town of Klina two weeks after Milosevic signed the June peace deal that pulled Serbian forces out and let NATO in. They left behind two houses, two pharmacies, several cars and more than 40 acres of land that had been in the family since the mid-19th century. On the night I talked to Vukoje, his parents and four other relatives were sleeping in the two-bedroom Belgrade apartment he had been sharing with his sister.
"My parents just sit in the apartment all day long," Vukoje told me. "They don't do anything. I am afraid they are going to go crazy. I blame the Americans for not protecting the Serbs from the Albanians. I blame Milosevic for losing in Kosovo. I blame my parents for not selling out and leaving sooner. They left everything we own behind."
Before I could ask about the Serbian war crimes, Vukoje acknowledged that Serbs had done "a lot of bad things."
"You have maniacs and war is like that," he said. "But someday the Americans are going to discover who the Serbs are and who the Albanians are. The Albanians want to take over. They will live 50 in a house."
Vukoje said Serbs will wait until NATO loses interest and take Kosovo back by force. It did not matter to him that Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo by more than 9 to 1.
"I know that what is mine is mine, whether I live to see it or not," he said. "No one can take it away from me. The Turks took our land for 500 years, and we took it back."
The next day I visited Vukoje's apartment and spoke to his father, Rados, who is a pharmacist. As recently as last year, Rados said, he could have sold his houses and land to Albanian buyers for about a half million dollars. He held on until June, when, panicked by what returning Albanian refugees might do to his family, he gave his keys to an Albanian neighbor and fled.
"I had a new Mitsubishi Pajero and I told my neighbor he could keep it, if he protected my house," said Rados, who did not know if his property had been protected or burned.
I asked him about the future. He looked at his medical-student son and shook his head in disgust.
"I don't see any future for him," Rados said. "I made him study to be a doctor. But when I see that a doctor in Belgrade makes 250 German marks a month about $140 and does not get paid on time, I don't know what to tell him."
Rados said he had always expected war in Kosovo. His father had been shot by Albanians in 1945. He bought an apartment in Belgrade 15 years ago as a precaution -- a place away from Albanians who he suspected might one day kidnap his son and rape his daughter.
I asked Rados if he felt the Serbs had done anything wrong in Kosovo and mentioned the mass graves being dug up by war-crimes investigators.
"I am not a politician, how should I know?" he said. "NATO bombing was the biggest crime. No one wants to be our friend. We have been betrayed by everyone."
Rados was proud that he had refused to sell his land in Kosovo. Like his son, he believed Serbs would one day fight to get it back. If he did not get the land back before he died, well, there were more important things than death: "Something inside told me I would be guilty and sinful toward the graves of my ancestors if I sold."
At Tennis Club Max on the afternoon before I left Belgrade, Helena and I spent an afternoon with her next-door neighbor, a 19-year-old who seemed to know precisely what Serbia needed before it could embrace democracy.
Vlada Pejovic, who has a long, sad face and large brown eyes, graduated this summer as the valedictorian of the Nikola Tesla High School for Engineering. Since he was 15, he has been tutoring high-school seniors (including Helena) on how to take the S.A.T. so they can get into an American college.
"People here think all the world is against us," Vlada told me. "But I don't think the world has interest in us. There is a mass hypnosis here. The Government wants to stay in power so it suffocates free thought."
Before democracy can gain a foothold, Vlada said, the first thing Serbs have to do is be honest with themselves and come to grips with what happened in Kosovo, as well as in Bosnia and Croatia.
"Until that happens, they are going to blame the world, rather than their own leaders," he said.
Vlada, though, had no idea who would teach Serbs the truth. He was planning to travel to Budapest to take the college boards. During the bombing of Belgrade, he had made up his mind. He was getting out.
The night before coming into Belgrade, I had dinner with Milka Tadic, a prominent Yugoslav journalist. During an evening in which she grew increasingly combative and angry, she warned me not to be taken in by Serbs who claim that they do not know about the atrocities committed in their name in Kosovo.
"The silence in Belgrade about what went on makes me really sick," she said. Tadic is the managing editor of Monitor, a weekly political magazine published in Montenegro.
"Serbs don't want to know, but most of them know," she went on. "They have satellite dishes and short-wave radios. They know, but they don't care. All they care about is themselves. For them, Albanians are not really human beings. The Serbs believe they are the chosen people. It is racism. I hate to say it, but it is like what the Germans did."
As our dinner ended, Tadic told me a jarring story about the huge winter demonstrations that nearly toppled Milosevic two years ago. She remembered a chant -- Go to Kosovo! Go to Kosovo!" -- that University of Belgrade students shouted when the police confronted them with clubs.
Tadic said the students objected to police brutality only because it inconvenienced them. "These are the nice young liberals of Belgrade," she said.
I argued with Milka that night. I said it was unfair to tar an entire people for the depravity of their leaders. But after a month in Belgrade, after listening to intelligent and cultured people dismiss the savagery in Kosovo as "no worse than what they did to us," I came to share Milka's rage.

 BODY:
What is to be done with the old and the sick?
To policy makers, the question is urgent, for we are making old people faster than we are making young ones. To old people and their families, the urgency is far greater. For a policy maker, a nursing home is an alarming expense; but for an elderly man or woman, it can look like the last step, full of backward glances, before the grave. And so states are experimenting with alternatives for those who do not need constant monitoring. One unusual approach -- foster care -- is drawing the attention of states around the country. The principle is simple: a family is leased for someone who needs one. In practice, when it works, a new family is cobbled together in a home where adults and children laugh and sometimes bicker, and where the roooms smell like dinner, not ammonia. Programs vary. In New Jersey, a caregiving family earns roughly $1,200 a month. For the state, the cost is less than half that of a bed in a nursing home; for most patients, Medicaid and Social Security pay the bill. So far, New Jersey's program serves only 85 people -- but more mature programs, like Oregon's, serve more than 5,000. 
 Under its license from the state, Senior Citizens United Community Services of Camden County, a nonprofit group, puts prospective caregivers though a 15-day certification course. They train at a nursing home, submit to a criminal background check and receive an inspection to insure that their homes are clean and safe and that the guest's private bedroom has a bureau, night table, lamp, chair and closet.
Like foster homes for children, these houses can be full of reminders that even strangers can develop deep bonds. And like foster homes for children, these houses can feel haunted by people who are not there: the families that for whatever reasons -- work, death, poverty, indifference, bitterness -- do not take care of their relatives. "Many of these people don't have families or have families that live far away," says Suzanne Watson, director of Alternate Family Care, in New Jersey. "Sometimes, the family is close by, but in today's economy, we find that a lot of time both parents have to work."

GRAPHIC: Fortune gives as good as she gets. She teases Weiss about his bossiness even as she fusses over his cookie intake. Their intimacy has become such that Weiss barely reacted when she recently slipped her fingers into his belt loops and jerked his pants up. "He looks like one of those kids going around with their pants down," she muttered. Against Fortune's bantering, Weiss, a former truck driver, has allied with her husband, Jake. They wander the local hardware store in Wenonah together ("It's a man thing," Florette shrugs) and guffaw over "Hollywood Squares." Weiss is divorced; his children are unable to care for him. At 56, he is younger than the Fortunes, who are in their 60's. He grumbles that their grandchildren make too much noise, but Florette counters that he gave one of them a present.
Photos: The Fortunes and Dennis Weiss: Dennis Weiss longs for life on his own, and most of all for the boat in which he used to drift, engine off, down the Delaware River. But since a stroke crippled his right side, he cannot manage alone. And being able to give Florette Fortune grief about her steaks -- they are so rubbery, he cracks, that he can bounce them off the floor -- is far preferable to the nursing home where he spent 10 months.
Over dinner recently, Florette tried to explain why she didn't share Weiss's love of boats. "I guess I'm just an old lady who likes to stay home," she said. Glimpsing the opening, Weiss grinned, then thought better of it and muttered, "Never mind." Bending into the refrigerator, Jake Fortune warned, "Now, don't you say anything and get us both in trouble."; Martha Pollack and Rose Polo: On Martha Pollack's dining-room wall in Gloucester, pictures of Rose Polo's grandkids hang among those of Pollack's sons. Polo's daughter and son- in-law both work, and Polo, 87, is a diabetic requiring vigilant care. Almost three years ago, she moved into Pollack's tidy town house, near enough to her daughter for regular visits. The two women fit. As girls, each was pulled out of school to help at home; each grew up under a strict father, they discovered in their chats together. Both are Catholic, and they like to watch Mass on TV and to visit Pollack's shrine to the Blessed Mother by the tiny fishpond in the backyard. Pollack's 3-year-old grandson, David, calls Polo Wosie. He likes to come over and watch television with Kailey, Polo's own granddaughter. As a child, Pollack dreamed of being a nurse; she relishes the discipline of preparing Polo's six small meals a day and testing her blood sugar twice, at 10 A.M. and 4 P.M. Once a week, Pollack permits "a cheat" -- spaghetti, say -- but thanks to her care, Polo no longer has to take insulin shots. After Pollack cooks and Polo sets the table, they say their separate prayers. Their meals are often silent. The two women know each other so well by now, and they agree on so much.; Frances Chandler and Alphonsa Joyner: For almost three years, Alphonsa Joyner lived with Frances Chandler and her family in Lindenwold. Yet Chandler's name just would not stick in her memory. Joyner has Alzheimer's disease. She would finish telling a story, like the one about her father selling root beer from a truck in Pennsylvania, and then start right over again. She would tell Chandler's children that it was time for bed at high noon. She would stuff her beloved books under her mattress to hide them from her sisters, who are dead. She would say that she had to leave, because she needed to get home to take care of her children. Sometimes Chandler wondered why Joyner's children did not take care of her. "I guess not every family's close," she said. A former cook, Chandler liked the idea of working at home, and like many foster caregivers, she was already accustomed to caring for the old. It was by thinking about her own mother, who died at 91, that she found the patience to care for the woman she calls Ally. But the disease stole more of Joyner's self-control, and she moved into a nursing home earlier this summer. Two weeks later, when Joyner somehow bumped her head, the nursing home called Chandler. "God, I hate to hear this," she said. Maybe, with a home health aide, she could have kept Ally. "I could have tried something," she murmured to herself. (Photographs by Ed Kashi)

HEADLINE: His Father Is a Rebel Leader . . .

BYLINE: By Randy Kennedy; Randy Kennedy is a Metro reporter for The Times.

 BODY:
The tableau is, if not typical, at least familiar: a young man living dirt cheap so he can pay back the costs of a top-flight education (Harvard, magna cum laude; Columbia graduate school, with honors) that he hopes will take him places. But a simple phone call to the West Harlem railroad apartment of Philippe Wamba can blur this snapshot beyond recognition.
Sometimes the call is from a friend who warns him that his father is, once again, in the sights of an assassination plot. Or it's his mother assuring him that his father is O.K. Or it's reporters wanting to know what he has heard. When the phone rings this afternoon, there's just a click on the other end and then static. "That was probably my dad," he says. "A lot of times he calls, and it doesn't go through." 
 This is because Dad, Prof. Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, is calling from an unreliable satellite phone in sub-Saharan Africa, where he leads a rebel faction in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- a lush, resource-rich country a quarter the size of the United States -- seeking to overthrow a Government that itself came to power through rebellion in 1997, when the nation was known as Zaire.
Wamba is a tall 28-year-old who has inherited his father's steam-shovel jaw and almost monastically serious demeanor. He has also inherited from him something much more important. Both men are examples of a quiet phenomenon and one that has been steadily growing for years: American higher education's role as a kind of finishing school for the foreign elite -- many of whom return home to become leaders in politics, business, diplomacy, the military, even in armed insurrection.
For the last several years, Philippe Wamba has spent a lot of time trying to measure the effects of this unusual export system. In a memoir he has written that will be published by Dutton this month, "Kinship: A Family's Journey in Africa and America," the difficult conclusion he draws is that living in two worlds often means belonging to neither. "African-Americans," Wamba writes, "usually saw me as an African, and though I didn't often admit it, many Africans, both at Harvard and at home in Tanzania, considered me an American, or at best an inauthentic hybrid." The memoir describes a complex sort of double alienation, or what Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Harvard professor and one of Wamba's mentors calls a kind of "Black Boy,' squared," referring to Richard Wright's famous memoir.
So where does a young man like Wamba go from here? How long can he carry on with day-to-day life in America before the pull of life-and-death politics back home becomes too strong? There are constant reminders of how stark that choice will be. One day not long ago, for example, Wamba and one of his brothers tried to call their father. But he couldn't talk: he was busy with rifle training. Wamba dia Wamba had no military experience before trading in the title of history professor for that of rebel leader; his military advisers decided it would be good for the professor to learn to use a Kalashnikov.
"He told me," Wamba says, "that he had hit seven out of nine bull's-eyes."
The lives of Wamba and his two younger brothers, Kolo and Saleem, can be divided fairly neatly into two parts: before and after Dec. 19, 1981, the sweltering day that made their family different from others they knew.
All three were born in the United States -- their Congolese father married an American woman he had met in the French club while attending Western Michigan University, in Kalamazoo, and he taught at American universities for several years. But the brothers grew up mostly in Dar es Salaam, on Tanzania's coast. Their father's political writings, harshly critical of Congo's enduring dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, made it too dangerous for them to live in his native country.
But in 1981, Wamba dia Wamba (his sons have adopted a shortened version of his last name) attempted a brief, dangerous trip back into Zaire to visit family and friends. He sneaked into Kinshasa, the capital, and sent for his wife and sons. That December day, the Wamba brothers stepped off the plane looking forward to an emotional first homecoming to their true African heritage. What they got instead was a welcoming committee of armed Zairean soldiers, who told them their father had been arrested.
The brothers tell slightly different versions -- kind of family Gospels -- of the nightmarish weeks that followed. Philippe, 10 at the time, remembers frantically scanning crowds for familiar faces. Kolo, a Columbia University graduate who is now a doctoral physics student at Stanford, was 7 and recalls coping through denial. Saleem, a sophomore at the University of Central Florida, in Orlando, was just 4 then and retains the stark child's impressions of the runway, the brightly lighted airport, the clutch of discordantly smiling officials. "They were all nice -- but in the way a villain in a movie is nice," he says.
Their father was held in a notorious prison, where he was interrogated about his anti-Mobutu writings, beaten with a buckled belt and given little to eat. It took five weeks of international pressure to secure his release. For Philippe, it was a turning point. "Africa was not a mystical, magical and beautiful place as I had thought," he writes in "Kinship." "Instead it was a place inhabited by evil and dangerous men -- black men at that -- who had imprisoned and beaten my father. . . . My nave romance with Africa was over."
Despite their father's increasingly strident political activism following his arrest, the boys managed to have something resembling a normal middle-class upbringing in Dar es Salaam. Like much of the world, the city was desperately in love with American culture, and whenever the Wamba brothers visited relatives in the States they were expected to return with essential staples of 1980's African-American teen-age culture: parachute pants, high tops -- and anything that had anything to do with Michael Jackson.
In his memoir, Wamba recalls how Tanzanians would turn every American pop totem inside out, improvising Swahili lyrics to Jackson tunes or adding traditional African steps to break-dance routines. After African-American hip-hop fans began to wear leather Africa medallions, the medallions also caught on among Wamba's African friends, "in an attempt to emulate African-Americans celebrating Africa."
Though each Wamba brother has held onto his United States citizenship, all three -- and especially Philippe -- were ambivalent about following their father's lead and leaving Africa to get an American education. Nonetheless, at age 16, Philippe won a scholarship to the Armand Hammer United World College outside Las Vegas, N.M., the American campus of a slightly loopy, utopian school system that prepares foreign students for something bigger than college. Wamba recalls: "One of my teachers there told me that he went to a conference of American high-school teachers and another teacher said to him, 'I'm in the business of preparing good American citizens.' My teacher said: 'Yeah? Well, I'm in the business of preparing good foreign ministers."'
If it seems strange to think you could run into a Congolese rebel leader or his son at your college reunion, consider this: Alongside Wamba dia Wamba in the leadership of his rebel group is a Stanford alumnus whose son now attends Berkeley. To the north, a rebel commander in Sudan's perpetual civil war earned his doctorate in agricultural economics from Iowa State.
As of last year, there were 481,280 foreign students in colleges in the States, the highest number ever. In the mid-1970's, there were less than half as many. Only a fraction of these students ever rise to prominence, of course, but there are dozens of marquee examples: Benjamin Netanyahu (M.I.T.); Kofi Annan of Ghana (Macalester College, in St. Paul); King Abdullah II of Jordan (Deerfield Academy, Georgetown University), and, more recently, the son of Hun Sen, the Khmer Rouge soldier who became prime minister of Cambodia by way of a coup (West Point).
At Harvard, dozens of Wamba's wealthy foreign classmates lived a college experience most students wouldn't recognize -- many had bodyguards, drivers and hotel suites instead of dorm rooms. They existed in a version of what ambassadors' children call the diplomatic bubble. Students like the daughter of Moshood K.O. Abiola, the late Nigerian magnate and opposition leader, were ducking into limousines after their Harvard classes. Wamba, meanwhile, lived in the dorm and relied mostly on scholarships and loans; his father's teaching career was never lucrative, and his mother, Elaine, remains a moderately paid French instructor in Tanzania. He scrubbed bathrooms and policed the campus video-game arcade to make money. "I had a bike," he adds.
But his frustrations in college centered on the sometimes stunning ways the idea of Africa was addressed, or not addressed, everywhere from the classroom to the media. Once, a fellow student asked whether, as an African, he was used to wearing clothes. ("They gave me these at the airport," Wamba replied dryly.) He was also surprised to find that even as they celebrate the ideological concept of Africa, some African-Americans seemed to find actual Africans "too white." He observes: "African-Americans often look to Africa with an unrealistic sense of romanticism. And Africans often look over here with those same exaggerated expectations."
For a memoir, "Kinship" is a guarded book, and Wamba can be the same way in person -- far more comfortable dealing with ideas than with revealing himself. In conversation, he speaks distantly about his father's dangerous life. In the next breath, he becomes furious over how an episode of "Lateline," an NBC sitcom that spoofed network news, used his father's name in a story about a fictional African coup.
"I suppose they picked it because they think Wamba dia Wamba just sounds like a funny African name," he says indignantly. He stews for a moment. "It was sort of ironic," he concludes. "I've never heard Peter Jennings say my dad's name, but it shows up on a sitcom."
Not long ago, Wamba visited an American cousin in Boston, and at a Cambridge bar they bumped into a friendly guy who turned out to be Congolese. Wamba was pleased to share a beer with someone from the "homeland." As it always does with expat Africans, the talk turned to politics. Wamba dia Wamba's rebel group was then mounting a serious challenge to the new regime of Laurent Kabila. Though Kabila's autocratic style had made him unpopular, few Congolese wanted another civil war. In fact, before Philippe's conversation in the bar got very far the friendly guy declared: "All of these rebels should be killed. They're just destroying the country."
His cousin nudged him, and he decided to let the remark pass. "In that particular context, it was just not worth getting into it," Wamba says. "What good would it do?"
The story illustrates the obstacles Wamba faces in trying to navigate his two worlds, even on rare occasions when they come together. But such stories raise another question, one on which Wamba's book is largely silent: in what context does the author want to place himself? It sometimes seems as if he has not yet made up his mind. "I didn't really subscribe to that idea," he says, "that elites should send their kids here to get an education and then they come back and occupy some automatic role of leadership."
But he came here anyway. Now he worries about what happens if he goes back, whether his education has cost him some part of his African identity. In Africa, it was often said that those who lingered too long abroad had joined the "Been-to Tribe." "They acculturate, get some strange ideas and cultural values and then they go home and they don't fit in anymore," Wamba says -- describing, perhaps, himself.
The question is particularly full of contradictions for the Wamba brothers. To ignore the possibility of going home and contributing something to Africa with their expensive degrees is to be un-African; to act as though some form of leadership is a birthright could be a disastrous display of arrogance.
When I visited Wamba's youngest brother, Saleem, he was working weekends at a McDonald's in Orlando to save money for a trip back home. He was decidedly unenthusiastic about America, brightening only when I asked what he would do if Kabila ever fell from power and he could live in Kinshasa. He said he would definitely go, "at least for a while." But in the same breath, he admitted that he doesn't "know squat about Congo," and worries about ever being expected to follow in his father's footsteps. "In Africa," he said, "politics is like someone with multiple personalities -- it's dangerous, and it changes without warning."
The middle brother, Kolo, worries about those expectations too. Nearly all his waking hours are spent buried in a basement astrophysics lab at Stanford. Despite his colleagues' opinions -- There's no physics in Africa," one bluntly told him -- he says he hopes he will ultimately end up in Africa, maybe in Congo.
In his living room, Kolo keeps a world map pocked with tiny holes where pushpins once marked Dar es Salaam and an unnamed brown expanse in far western Congo: a farming village called Zabanga, where his father grew up. But he, too, said he has no plans ever to get involved in politics. He agreed with Saleem, who said, "Of all of us, Philippe looks like the one who's drifting in that direction."
After a week of trying, I finally reached the man who might have the most interesting response to the question of Philippe Wamba's future: his father. Ernest Wamba dia Wamba spoke via his unreliable satellite phone from a hotel room in Pretoria, where he had traveled to watch Nelson Mandela pass the torch to a new South African president.
Wamba dia Wamba's voice sounded gravelly and tired. Kabila's reign has not resulted in the kind of changes Wamba dia Wamba and others had hoped for in their country. But this new rebellion had splintered, with one major armed faction (backed by Rwanda) claiming that Wamba dia Wamba was no longer its leader. Soon there were three competing groups. Wamba dia Wamba had been calling for a negotiated political settlement since last summer, but others sought a purely military victory. Just as his sons had warned me, he seemed deeply distracted.
But he became animated when the conversation turned to how his American education had prepared him for a life in African politics. "To put it simply," he said, "I was not radicalized about Africa until I came to the United States. It is strange, but I became much more aware of what was going on in Congo in the United States than I had ever been in Congo."
About Philippe, he answered my questions indirectly, with a story. "When he was in secondary school, I asked him, 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' And he said, 'Secretary General of the U.N."' Wamba dia Wamba pauses and begins to laugh. "This child was so young!"
I once asked Philippe Wamba what he saw himself doing if he were to join his father in Congo. He stressed that it was a subject he did not want to get into, but he did anyway. "If he were doing something I didn't believe in politically it would be different," he said. "But there's no contradiction, and I do somehow want to be involved in whatever way I can."
Could that ever mean learning how to use a rifle himself? He paused and the tone of his voice changed. "This is kind of sensitive stuff, because my mother told me that if I went and got military training and joined any kind of movement, my citizenship could be in jeopardy. So it's not something where I would necessarily want to say, 'Yeah, I'm going to join."' Then he smiled a little. He said he had a dream, and though it was unlikely to come true, he liked to think about it: "I want to start the 21st century living in Africa."
Now, though, that plan seems more unlikely than ever. Weeks before his book's publication date, his advance is almost gone, he still has thousands in student loans to pay off and he has agreed to take a job at an Africa-related Web site in Boston. And in Congo, the situation is at its most precarious. A cease-fire agreement reached in July has by mid-August sparked open fighting among the rebel factions themselves.
One key reason is Wamba dia Wamba, whose insistence on signing the agreement caused a rival group to balk. The dispute over which rebel faction is legitimate -- and thus who might have a say in any negotiations with Kabila -- erupts into battles that leave dozens dead in Kisangani, where Wamba dia Wamba and his Uganda-backed faction are based. "I'm supposed to be the main target," he tells a CNN correspondent.
Philippe somehow sounds calm about it all; he spoke to his father by phone, he says, even as the attack was under way. "He actually said he'd probably be dead if it weren't for the Ugandans protecting him," he says. He has also spoken to his mother, in Tanzania, who he says is more worried than ever but seems to be holding up.
Congo remains a fragile proposition whose future is impossible to predict. "Who knows how it's all going to play out?" Philippe says.
Then, unexpectedly, he turns almost introspective. "I guess on some level we've sort of resigned ourselves to it," he says. "But there's also some element of faith in this, a feeling that he's fulfilling some kind of larger destiny." After all, his father could have been killed in captivity by Mobutu all those years ago, and there have already been several other attempts on his life.
"We feel," he adds solemnly, "that he would already be dead by now if that were meant for him. Maybe that's just to reassure ourselves, and it's not true. But it does reassure us." From this distance, anyway, reassurance is about all Philippe can hope for.

BYLINE: By Stacey D'Erasmo; Stacey D'Erasmo is the author of "Tea," a novel that will be published in the fall.

 BODY:
I was having a pricey macrobiotic dinner with my friend B. the other night when she sighed. "What's wrong?" I asked, though I knew: there was a man in that sigh somewhere.
B. told me she was going to leave New York, because, she said, waving a chopstick, "it's all so 'Sex and the City.' "I reminded B. how talented and beautiful she is, how well placed her friends are. But she was adamant, and gave me two MAC lipsticks she wouldn't be needing anymore. 
 B. hasn't been living in New York long, which might make it seem as if this vignette is about what has befallen B. since she came to the big city, but I think it's a vignette about what has befallen B. since she got cable. Though if she weren't watching "Sex and the City," she could as easily have fallen under the spell of "The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing," by Melissa Bank; "A Certain Age," by Tama Janowitz; "Bridget Jones's Diary," by Helen Fielding, or even just "Ally McBeal." And next season the parade of the anxiously unmarried continues, with a movie version of "Mansfield Park"; Coerte Felske's novel "The Millennium Girl," about single women trolling for rich husbands, and a flotilla of television shows in which single urban women (and men) hunt in vain for love. In nearly every medium, the marital quest of the fashionable, sexually well-traveled, 30-something woman has become so popular as to seem like the dominant narrative of life on earth right now.
And B. has begun to show telltale signs of having become a character in such a narrative. She used to be an indifferent dater; now she's a font of amusing stories about bad dates. She used to wear jeans; now she wears cleverly demolished track pants. She always wanted to get married; now she talks about marriage with a certain wry hopelessness. She was always sexy; now she has acquired sexual ennui, along with a tattoo.
They're a quippy, chain-smoking lot, these new single heroines, swathed in a glamorous melancholy. They have affairs with sophisticated older men, like Jane, the heroine of Bank's book; they calculate the commitment return on certain sexual acts, like the women on "Sex and the City"; they laugh about femininity's self-flagellating rituals, like Bridget Jones. They say that all they want is that ring on their finger, but they say it with such a self-mocking air that you could mistake it for shtick (if they didn't say it quite so often).
How far removed they seem from their ostensible forebears, the young ladies of Jane Austen's novels. Whereas Austen once contrived by many a fetching narrative strategy to marry them off, the present-day chroniclers contrive by equally fetching comic plot lines to keep their creations unwed -- and noisily unhappy. And they seem almost as distant from more recent ancestors, most notably Ann Marie, the heroine of "That Girl." She stayed single, too, but with a fresh-faced, late-60's optimism: she waved to the bridal mannequin in the shop window as if to say, "Later -- after the 70's." Today's bachelorettes exude a been-there-done-that weariness. The best a girl can do, they suggest, is to fashion disappointment into a cunning little outfit and make a glittering accessory of your tears.
Indeed, bored by sodomy and hopelessly reverent about true love, these well-groomed women have more in common with the men in "The Boys in the Band." Those men made self-hatred (albeit a more virulent form) seem fabulous, too -- the look of irony being so much more becoming than the look of agony.
But if that melodrama was a perverse call to liberation, the new single-girl pathos seems more like a plea to be unliberated, and fast. These characters really do just want to get married; they just don't want to look quite so nave about it. They combine Eve Arden's wit with Doris Day's values, laughing throatily as they refit old cultural norms for a post-modern season.
It makes for a versatile backlash ensemble. Who'd feel threatened by economically powerful, independent women as long as they're dissolving into tears? And nonbacklash types can laugh at the sexy jokes while noting approvingly the portrayal of men as dogs with power. At the core, though, the new single girl, tottering on her Manolo Blahniks from misadventure to misadventure, embodies in her very slender form the argument that not only is feminism over. It also failed: look how unhappy the "liberated" woman is! Men don't want to marry her! And if she's seductive -- so witty, so smart, such great shoes -- she's also a scarecrow, a walking warning to women that it's really cold being free, and though it may seem fun, it's not that much fun at all.
It's difficult to know whether real single women are as distressed as their fictional counterparts. All that's certain is that real women, in droves, are investing themselves in the prolonged unweddedness of these unwed heroines. It's an odd, ambivalent sort of heroism -- of the sad and solitary clown -- but it's the one women seem to want. Perhaps it's because they know, in a way that the prefeminist Ann Marie denied, that marriage doesn't solve all your problems. It never did. Wedding band or not, we're all single girls now.
At dinner, B. pushed her brown rice around and recounted a marriage she had just heard about. The bride had met the groom while she was at a women's college. "Her friends said, 'It's like a feminist dream,' "B. recalled. "Is that what the dream was?"

"The idea for the show was a young woman who moves to the city by herself. But the network wanted me to live with an aunt. I told them: ' "The Fugitive" doesn't even have a city. Why do I have to have a family?'
"The show ran for five years. They wanted me and Donald to get married on the last episode, but instead, I took him to a women's-liberation meeting.
"In our day, Donald always went home. Boys and girls then were certainly enjoying sex, but the comedy of the time was not honest about it. "Sex and the City" is just phenomenal in its honesty. And "Ally McBeal" is important. In my show, everybody loved the girl. Even the mailman. But seeing a girl get rejected is healthy for a young audience."
