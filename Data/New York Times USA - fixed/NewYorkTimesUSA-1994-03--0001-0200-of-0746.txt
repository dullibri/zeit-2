HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
Peace Talks Suspended Pending Efforts by U.S.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The next round of talks in Geneva among the three warring factions in Bosnia has been put off while diplomats from the European Union and the United Nations wait to see whether Washington can broker a separate peace between Bosnian Croats and Muslims.
Officials of Croatia, Bosnia and the Bosnian Croats met today for a third day in Washington with State Department officials to discuss a United States proposal to unite Croats and Muslims in a federation that would cover just over 50 percent of Bosnia. 
 Although the plan excludes Serbs, the European Union mediator, Lord Owen, said on Sunday night that he fully supported the effort and wanted to give Washington time to try to develop the idea.
"My attitude is that I am genuinely pleased that the United States is engaged," he said. "I've felt all along it would be incredibly difficult to see a settlement with the United States as bystanders."
 
Scattered Reports of Fighting
 He added that the final success would turn on the details, from the precise lines on the maps to the question of who controls the police forces.
Last week the commanders of the Bosnian Croats' militia and the mostly Muslim Bosnian Army signed a cease-fire agreement. There have been scattered reports of fighting, but generally, the cease-fire appears to be holding.
The Geneva talks had been scheduled to resume in late February or early March. The last round broke up in mid-February, when NATO was threatening air strikes against Serbian gunners surrounding Sarajevo.
Lord Owen described the American proposal as broadly consistent with efforts undertaken in Geneva to date, even though some United Nations and European officials have been dismissive of the American effort. "My only reservation," Lord Owen said in an interview, "is that it must be done in a way that the Serbs can live with it too."
Under the current plan, the entity created by Bosnia's Muslims and Croats -- nominal allies against the Serbs until they began fighting each other in April -- would be joined in an economic federation with neighboring Croatia. The last plan on the table in Geneva calls for the division of Bosnia into three ethnic republics.
Washington has had little direct involvement in diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting, and the Administration has been unhappy with proposals that would partition Bosnia.
 
Contemptuous of U.S. Plan
 Some officials of the United Nations and the European Union have ridiculed the American proposal for a Croatian-Muslim union in Bosnia as ill conceived because it does nothing to address Serbian grievances. Asked for his reaction to the proposal, one top United Nations official said, "You don't really want to know what I think."
Washington's determination to take an increasingly active role in Bosnia is broadly welcomed in Europe. But there continues to be a frustration that the United States is still not willing to commit ground troops to United Nations peacekeeping efforts in the country.
In an interview, Yasushi Akashi, the United Nations special envoy to Yugoslavia and its former republics, said the major challenge facing the peacekeeping operation was finding the troops necessary to separate and disarm the warring factions.
Although he did not criticize Washington for its refusal to send ground troops to Bosnia, he said international powers had "to put their money and their troops where their mouth is."
"If they are very interested in bringing about peace in Bosnia," Mr. Akashi added, "it is quite clear that agreements reached have to be implemented on the ground," and to that end American troops would be especially helpful.

HEADLINE: Clinton Travels for Rostenkowski, and Major

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Feb. 28

 BODY:
President Clinton divided his time today between two leaders in political peril, flying to Chicago to offer an effusive tribute to Representative Dan Rostenkowski and then moving on for a rendezvous here with Prime Minister John Major of Britain.
Both stops were preceded by some tension. Mr. Rostenkowski, a Chicago Democrat who faces a difficult primary election on March 15, is the subject of a Federal criminal investigation. White House officials had debated whether Mr. Clinton should be seen as taking sides in the race. 
 Mr. Major, who is under pressure to call elections sooner than the April 1997 deadline, has watched his popularity plunge to 13 percent in public opinion polls. British officials have complained that Mr. Clinton has contributed to the Prime Minister's plight by giving short shrift to what leaders of the two countries have long referred to as their special relationship.
 
Speaking With Fervor
 But no signs of friction were evident today, particularly in Chicago, where Mr. Clinton shared a limousine with Mr. Rostenkowski, slung an arm around his shoulders and repeatedly praised him, saying he had shown courage and leadership as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
"It is not up to me to know or make judgments about all the things that are of concern to the people of Chicago," Mr. Clinton told an audience at Wright Junior College. But the President spoke with fervor in saying that had it not been for Mr. Rostenkowski's help on the budget and other legislation last year "this economy today would not be on the right path it's on."
Urging the crowd to demand that their political leaders stiffen their spines and act, Mr. Clinton said: "The one person you don't have to say it to is Dan Rostenkowski; it's in his bones, and he will do it, too."
Mr. Rostenkowski, who has been under Federal investigation for 19 months, faces accusations that he misused money from the House post office and his campaign. The White House regards his support as important for passage of health care legislation.
 
Not an Endorsement
 At a news conference last week, Mr. Clinton noted that the 18-term Congressman had "not yet been charged with anything." But he also emphasized that his visit did not constitute an endorsement of Mr. Rostenkowski, who in the most recent public opinion poll was running just ahead of his main Democratic rival, State Senator John J. Cullerton.
The official purpose of the President's trip to Chicago was to give two speeches on crime, one at a high school.
Mr. Clinton is only the latest of top Administration officials and lawmakers to go to Chicago on behalf of Mr. Rostenkowski. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich made an appearance with him last week, and Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, and former Mayor David N. Dinkins have helped him raise money.
Today, even as Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago joined Mr. Clinton in lauding him, Mr. Rostenkowski responded with characteristic dourness, slouching in his chair and wearing a perpetual grimace.
In Pittsburgh, President Clinton greeted Mr. Major at the Air Force Reserve's section of Pittsburgh International Airport and then spent the evening playing gracious host to his Conservative counterpart.
It was Mr. Clinton, the White House said, who suggested that the two leaders meet so informally. The visit included a working dinner in the scenic Tin Angel restaurant, which the men reached by a funicular railway, the Duquesne Inclined Plane. From the top, they looked down on a fireworks display from the point where the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers join to form the Ohio. The two leaders were accompanied only by their national security advisers.
 
Evening Talks
 Mr. Major recently returned from Russia, and the two leaders planned to spend the evening discussing, among other topics, the situations there and in Bosnia.
The leaders were to fly to Washington tonight aboard Air Force One, and Mr. Major was to spend the night in the Lincoln Bedroom, the first foreign leader to stay in the White House as Mr. Clinton's guest.
Since Mr. Clinton took office, British officials have bristled at what they regard as insufficient American attention to British concerns and even insensitivity toward them. Relations were particularly strained last month, when the United States granted an entry visa to Gerry Adams, the political leader of the Irish Republican Army.
Although White House officials have privately pointed to Britain's diminishing importance in the world, Mr. Clinton sought to show that relations between the two countries remain warm and strong by wearing a tie adorned with representations of the American and British flags. Nonetheless, the White House did not schedule a joint news conference during Mr. Major's two-day visit, a courtesy usually extended to visiting foreign leaders.

HEADLINE: NEW HEALTH PLAN STRESSES MEDICARE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The chairman of an important Congressional subcommittee is drafting a proposal to expand Medicare to cover millions of people who lack insurance, as an alternative to President Clinton's health care plan.
Under the proposal, devised by Representative Pete Stark, chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, the Government would collect premiums from consumers and employers through the Internal Revenue Service. The proposal would give most Americans the option of enrolling in the new expanded Medicare program or in a private health insurance plan. 
 Mr. Stark said he intended to use his proposal as a basis for negotiation when his panel begins drafting health legislation next week. He briefed White House officials about the proposal on Friday and is trying to round up support on his subcommittee.
There is no guarantee that the proposal, the opening shot in what is likely to be a yearlong Congressional battle over health legislation, will be approved by Mr. Stark's subcommittee, much less by the full Ways and Means Committee, the House or the Senate. But Mr. Stark is in a strong position to push for the ideas in his proposal.
 
Goals Are Shared
 The goals of the Stark proposal are identical to those of President Clinton's health plan: to guarantee health insurance for all Americans and to control medical spending so it is growing no faster than the economy as a whole after the year 2000. But under the Stark plan, the Government would collect insurance premiums and provide health insurance directly to millions more Americans than would be covered by the Government under Mr. Clinton's proposal.
The Stark plan focuses on the 39 million people without health insurance, and he says his proposal would be far less disruptive to people who already have coverage.
In an interview tonight, Mr. Stark, Democrat of California, said, "My goal is to start with the uninsured, to guarantee that they have health insurance as simply and inexpensively as possible, and to leave alone the 180 million people who are privately insured."
A confidential summary of Mr. Stark's proposal, which he prepared with his staff, says: "All individuals would be covered under a private health plan meeting Federal insurance standards or in a Federal plan, which would be called Medicare Part C. Enrollment in Medicare Part C would be automatic, unless an individual is enrolled in a private health plan."
 
Alike and Different
 Mr. Stark said that under his proposal employers with more than 100 employees would have to buy private insurance meeting Federal standards.
Medicare covers 36 million people who are at least 65 years old or disabled. Part A of Medicare covers hospital care; Part B covers doctors' services. Mr. Stark's proposal would open Medicare to people who are unemployed, people who have no connection to the labor force and low-income people now in the Medicaid program, regardless of age.
Mr. Stark's proposal resembles the Clinton plan in some ways. The Congressman would, for example, require employers to pay 80 percent of insurance premiums for employees, regardless of whether they enrolled in private health plans or Medicare.
The Stark proposal differs from the Clinton plan in fundamental ways. Under Mr. Stark's proposal, employers and consumers could voluntarily buy private insurance through purchasing pools, or health alliances, but would not have to do so. Premiums would be paid to the Federal Government under Mr. Stark's proposal, not to the alliances as under Mr. Clinton's plan.
Under Mr. Stark's bill, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would set premiums for the comprehensive package of health benefits envisioned under Part C of Medicare. "Employers would pay the premiums to the I.R.S. in the same fashion as payroll taxes are paid," the summary says. Employers would withhold the employees' share of premiums, just as they now withhold Social Security payroll taxes.
Under Mr. Stark's proposal, the Federal Government would set annual goals for public and private health spending, enforced through fee schedules like those used for doctors and hospitals under Medicare.

Hardest Task of the 1990's: Raising Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
If revived inflation is just around the corner, as many seem to believe, you probably won't be finding any at your local KFC chicken restaurant.
"We haven't had a price increase at the retail level since 1989," said Gary Gerdemann, a spokesman for the 5,000-restaurant chain, once known as Kentucky Fried Chicken. "When we see an increase coming, we go and engineer it out." 
 He says the company expects its basic costs to rise about five-tenths of a percent in 1994, but it plans to "engineer out" this amount to hold its own prices steady. This means KFC might switch suppliers, reduce packaging, ship materials in bigger lots, even change a recipe.
When might menu prices go up? In this climate "I could not entertain the thought," Mr. Gerdemann said.
To be sure, the size of KFC, a Pepsico subsidiary, gives it immense bargaining power and it also operates in one of the nation's most ferociously competitive industries.
Yet the forces holding prices down among the giants of fast food -- at McDonald's, a spokesman said his company expected to hold the line for at least the next several months -- are at work throughout the economy. A survey of a random dozen companies disclosed relatively little upward pressure on prices apart from a few highly visible pockets, notably steel, lumber and other building materials.
And even steel may have peaked. "We're beginning to see the price recede already" for scrap, said Terry S. Lisenby, controller for the Nucor Corporation, a steel producer based in Charlotte, N.C.
This suggests that the Federal Reserve can take its time lifting short-term interest rates, which are still barely above zero when adjusted for inflation, while still reassuring long-term investors that the buying power of their capital will be preserved.
"We don't see any threat of inflationary pressures in 1994," Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, said. He noted that wage growth had slowed to a creep and that long-term interest rates are nearly two percentage points lower than they were 15 months ago.
These various findings, sketchy as they are, were supported by figures published yesterday by the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago. Although its overall business barometer posted a small gain for February, the component showing prices paid by corporate buyers fell to 56.7 from 59.3 in January.
National figures on purchasing managers' activity, which normally track local surveys, are to be published today.
With the Federal Reserve in a publicly avowed stance of seeking to prevent a revival of inflation -- as opposed to responding when it appears -- markets have become extraordinarily sensitive in recent weeks to every scrap of price data.
Thus, bond prices tumbled on Feb. 17 when the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that 30.4 percent of the companies it surveyed in its region were paying higher prices, and none were paying lower prices. An even larger proportion expected higher, rather than lower, prices six months ahead.
On the day of that report, the markets seemed largely to ignore the report that the national Consumer Price Index rose not at all in January, a reaction that might be partly explained by the perception that the Philadelphia survey was more current than the consumer data.
A spokeswoman for the Philadelphia Fed, Rossana Mancini, said yesterday that officials there were surprised by the reaction to the survey, which is confined to about 150 companies having at least 350 employees each, but she added that there was no reason to think the results were skewed.
Many analysts say the findings were simply "overinterpreted," a view shared by some Fed officials in Washington.
Recent data certainly would seem to provide little cause for price worries. For example, producers of goods ready for sale to final users managed to raise prices a mere two-tenths of 1 percent in the last 12 months. And goods in earlier stages of the production pipeline -- raw materials and intermediate goods -- each rose less than 1 percent.
Even in steel, which unlike fast food has enjoyed robust demand during this upturn in the business cycle, the price pressure is blunted. Just ask Woody Brown, president of Kingsbury Inc., a Philadelphia producer of bearings for large machinery.
General Electric, a large customer, told Kingsbury that it wanted a 10 percent price reduction this year. Kingsbury's response has been twofold: to try to get G.E. to accept a higher-quality product at the same price and to try to get concessions from Kingsbury's own suppliers, what Mr. Brown calls "kind of a dominoes effect."
One Kingsbury supplier is Delaware Valley Steel, a service center, which stocks and cuts products to customer specifications. Sometimes, said Michael Weiser, a vice president there, specifications can be changed. In other cases, he leans on the mills he buys from to cut prices or maybe he "eats" an increase himself. And sometimes, as of late when bad weather, high car production and sharply higher tariffs on imports have caused a scramble for supplies, prices just have to be raised.
But while Mr. Weiser expects further increases this year -- perhaps up to 10 percent -- he recognizes the existence of a strong counterforce. "Everybody's under pressure" to keep prices down, he said.
The executives surveyed generally described minimal-to-moderate cost pressures consistent with economists' predictions of a fourth straight year in which the Consumer Price Index rises only about 3 percent.
"We have not been able to fully recover the increases we've been seeing," mainly in wood and steel, said Ken Sendelweck, assistant treasurer for Kimball International, a Jasper, Ind., maker of office furniture with revenues of $625 million a year.
"Certainly there are more signs of inflation now than six months ago," he added, referring to what he sees in everyday life. "But the culture has evolved to the point where if you don't see it on sale, you don't buy it."
 
A 'No Problem' Outlook
 At the Haws Drinking Faucet Company, a producer of fountains and water coolers based in Berkeley, Calif., Patrick T. Kelly said prices of metals, the company's main raw material, are well behaved.
"We do not anticipate a problem, at least in the near term," said Mr. Kelly, who is vice president for sales and marketing. He said the 2 to 3 percent price increases the company put through on its industrial lines earlier this month would probably stand for the whole year and that increases on its commercial products would probably come to 2 to 4 percent when they were decided in April.
In Wichita, Kan., Tory Lehr, controller for Kreonite Inc., described as "fairly steady" the prices of plastics and metals his company uses to make photographic equipment. Even though Kreonite is relatively debt free, Mr. Lehr fretted that the Federal Reserve had added to business costs, including those of its customers, when it raised short-term interest rates recently.
 
A Dissenting View
 The most vociferous exception to the general belief that there is little risk of inflation taking off was expressed by A. C. Phillips, chairman of the Phillips Lumber Company in Cedar Hill, Tex., a suburb of Dallas.
"It's just as crazy as it can be," he said of lumber prices, which rose again recently after a late-1993 pullback and are now 25 percent higher than they were six months ago.
The soaring prices result mainly from a boom in housing, from rebuilding after the summer's Midwest floods and the January earthquake, and from environmental restrictions on logging in the Northwest. Raw materials used for construction have jumped 15.3 percent in the last 12 months, the Producer Price Index shows.
But while Mr. Phillips predicts that the overall inflation rate will be "at least 4 percent" this year, builders he talks to are expressing concern about their houses remaining affordable, especially if the Federal Reserve tightens further.
"I think raising the interest rates was a bit premature," he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Buoyed by an Inflation Index

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Government securities moved higher yesterday, buoyed by the Chicago purchasing managers index, which showed an easing of inflation in February, and by more reassuring comments from Federal Reserve officials.
The purchasing managers' report is not the best barometer of future inflation, traders said, but because Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last week that the report was something the Fed paid attention to, the market did also. 
 The bond market received another lift in spirits from remarks by a Fed official, Lawrence B. Lindsey, who indicated that the quarter-point increase in the Federal funds rate would be enough to quell inflationary pressures.
Both the data and remarks by Mr. Lindsey appeared to have a calming effect on bond investors, whose nerves have become frayed since the central bank's Feb. 4 interest rate increase drove up short-term rates by 25 basis points. A basis point is one- hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Second-Guessing Fed
 The move by the Fed to increase rates and stem inflation before it could pick up steam caused investors to wonder whether the central bank actually did see inflation pressures building. Last week, that investor concern turned into a selloff, and the Fed tried to reassure the markets that inflation was not an immediate threat, adding that short-term interest rates would probably go higher.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 21/32 , while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.65 percent, from 6.71 percent on Friday. Interest rates on intermediate maturities were also down, with a three-year note at 5 percent, from 5.05 percent, and a five-year note at 5.57 percent, from 5.63 percent.
The Chicago purchasing managers index, which measures economic activity in the Chicago area, shows a strong economy when it is over 50. It rose to 60.3 in February, compared with 59.6 in January. Its employment component slipped to 52 from 53.3, and the inflation component declined to 56.7 from 59.3
Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Kemper Securities Inc., said he was happy with the market yesterday, as the long bond backed away from its 6.75 percent resistance level. "Interest rates today," he said, "while a lot higher in yield than a few months ago, were much better than in the recent carnage when the yield on a long term bond was up as high as 6.73 percent."
 
Little Selling Noted
 Last week, a number of cash-pressed foreign investors sold Treasury securities, while there was little such selling in the market yesterday, Mr. Chalasani noted.
This week the market will wade its way through more economic data, including numbers from the National Association of Purchasing Management, expected today. Also scheduled are a revision of the fourth-quarter gross domestic product and personal income for February.
"With today's positive tilt in the market," Mr. Chalasani said, "the upward-revised G.D.P. to a forecast 6.5 percent will have no impact considering the market's gyrations of last week. Perhaps no further tightening will come."
At the Government's regular weekly auction of short-term bills yesterday, the average rates were moderately higher compared with those at last week's auction, with the three-month at 3.40 percent, up 7 basis points, and the six-month at 3.61 percent, up 8 basis points.
Following are the results of yesteray's Treasury bill auction of new three- and six-month Treasury bills:
 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)	 	 		 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	99.141	98.175	Discounted Rate	3.40%	3.61%	Coupon Yield	3.48%	3.73%	High Price	99.146	98.180	Discounted Rate	3.38%	3.60%	Coupon Yield	3.45%	3.72%	Low Price	99.141	98.175	Discounted Rate	3.40%	3.61%	Coupon Yield	3.48%	3.73%	Accepted at low price	20%	44%	Total applied for	$58,643,683	$52,665,493	Accepted	$12,743,255	$12,741,796	Noncompetitive	$1,224,213	$913,996	
 
Both issues are dated March 3, 1994. The three-month bills mature on June 2, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on Sept. 1, 1994.

HEADLINE: Staten Island Secession, the Debate That Wouldn't Die, Now Reaches Albany

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
The Staten Island secession movement -- a five-year quest that began as a quixotic dream but somehow survived referendums, court tests, political deals and the scorn of doomsayers -- moved toward a climax in the State Legislature yesterday with the unveiling of a bill to make the borough an independent city.
The bill's prospects were not highly rated, even by its chief sponsor, State Senator John J. Marchi, the father of the movement and chairman of a commission that has laid plans for a City of Staten Island, complete with mayor, council, comptroller, courts, schools and other trappings of a modern municipality. 
 The Republican-controlled Senate is expected to support the bill, but not the Democratic-dominated Assembly, mainly because half its members come from the city and are loath to see it divided. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has maintained a studied neutrality, and Senator Marchi conceded yesterday that a vote on the measure was at least a year off.
 
'This Is Very Serious'
 But the Senator and other secessionists, buoyed by overwhelming support among Staten Islanders in a crucial charter referendum last November and the survival of a movement many political observers regarded as a joke when it began, predicted intense negotiations in the Legislature.
"It's not part of a game," Senator Marchi declared at a news conference in the State Capitol in Albany after introducing his measure in the Senate. "This is very serious. This is the business of democracy."
The bill, which would transform the city's smallest borough, with 375,000 people, into the state's second-largest city and about the 40th in the nation, presents legislators and the Governor with choices none relish -- to dismember a city consolidated in 1898, or to rescind the right of self-determination they granted in 1989 by approving legislation that let the secession process begin.
The charter provisions incorporated into the bill introduced yesterday call for a city led by an elected mayor, a 15-member city council and a comptroller as chief financial officer. The officials would be elected in November 1995 and take office on Jan. 1, 1996.
It also calls for a nine-member board of education elected by cumulative voting, in which each voter would have nine ballots and could cast them for any number of candidates or all for one candidate. The system, which strengthens minority candidates, was championed by Lani Guinier, whose nomination to head the Justice Department's civil-rights division was withdrawn by President Clinton last year amid criticism of her writings.
The bill also would set up courts, but retain sitting judges in criminal and civil courts, superior courts and family and surrogate courts. It would shift the College of Staten Island from the City University to the State University of New York and would retain the rights of all civil-service employees.
 
Victories in the Courts
 When the idea of allowing Staten Island residents to vote on secession was raised at that time, legislative leaders expected the plan to die quietly. But largely for political reasons, the Senate, the Assembly and the Governor failed to kill it, and in a 1990 vote the residents opted to secede.
New York City challenged the process in court, saying the secession vote, without the city's consent, violated the "home rule" provision of the state constitution. The state's highest court rejected the city's claim, ruling that the referendum creating a Staten Island charter commission was merely advisory. But it left open whether secession by Staten Island was constitutional.
In the next three years, the 13-member charter commission named by the Governor mapped a plan for a new city. Last Nov. 2, in a second referendum, Staten Island residents voted 2 to 1 to approve the charter.
Secession raises many political and economic issues. Staten Island voters gave Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani his narrow election-victory margin last fall and he would not like to lose the borough. Staten Island gets nearly $200 million more in services from the city than it gives the city in revenues, according to a city study, and secession opponents say that independence would mean huge tax increases and service reductions.
Staten Island could charge the city to use the landfill at Fresh Kills, but might have to pay to use the city's water supply. Beyond such questions, the borough remains linked to the city in intricate ways, from bus and ferry lines to bridges and less tangible ties, including senses of identity and historical continuity.

HEADLINE: Big Losses As Emerging Markets Fall

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The stock and bond markets of the developing countries have lured both big and small investors in search of higher returns in recent months, despite their reputation for high risk and volatility.
That volatility was in evidence last week as these markets -- mainly in Latin America -- fell sharply, ending a phenomenal yearlong bull market and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses among leading banks and brokerage firms that deal in their securities. 
 Small investors were hurt as well as many of the new mutual funds that invest in the market fell sharply, leading to a rush of redemptions.
 
 
Dealers Post Losses
 Many of the major dealers in emerging market securities lost $30 million to $100 million in recent weeks, traders estimated yesterday. The largest dealers include J. P. Morgan & Company, Chemical Bank, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and ING Securities. But the effect of the market drop will not be seen until these companies release their first-quarter reports in April.
Morgan, among the largest dealers in the market, with a reputation for taking large trading positions, was said by traders at other firms to be especially hard hit. A Morgan spokesman declined to comment.
"It was a pretty tough week," said Peter R. Geraghty, president of ING Securities, a unit of a large Dutch bank and a major dealer in emerging markets debt securities. "I'm sure that everybody lost money. People went into the downturn fairly long."
Most dealers keep large inventories of emerging market securities. And those positions -- unlike those in more established markets -- are difficult to hedge, for example, by selling some securities short. Moreover, most dealers continue to be optimistic about the long-term prospects of the markets.
The selloff was initiated by the aftershocks from the Federal Reserve's move to raise American short-term interest rates in early February, an action that has roiled other, more established bond and currency markets around the world.
But the emerging markets fell faster and further than many traders had expected when the rate cut was announced. Brady bonds, the securities created out of restructured bank loans to developing countries, fell 6 percent last week, but rebounded about 1.5 percent yesterday, according to a J. P. Morgan index. Brady bonds rose by 44 percent in 1993.
Emerging market stocks fell by 6 percent last week, according to a Baring Securities index, with stock markets in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil down about 10 percent.
Traders said that the largest dealers handled more than $2 billion of securities on Thursday, the busiest day of the week.
Stephen W. Dizard, the head of emerging markets trading at Salomon Brothers, said his firm was able to keep losses to a minimum.
"We were one of the few houses to take a cautious view," he said. "We were maintaining the positions we needed to serve our customers. Otherwise we were basically out of it."
Salomon was cautious, Mr. Dizard said, because technical indicators showed that many emerging markets investors had become overextended. Many of the banks that hold portfolios of Latin debt securities took the fall in the market as a sign to sell their holdings and take profits, he said.
While the recent losses may hurt the first-quarter results of the leading firms, it is unlikely to lessen their commitment to what has been an extraordinarily profitable business.
J. P. Morgan, for example, had estimated trading revenue from emerging markets activities of $200 million in the fourth quarter of 1993.
Indeed, dealers have grown used to volatile markets, having weathered big declines in 1991 and 1992.
"Most of the big houses have been there, done that, and experienced the good times as well as the bad," Mr. Geraghty said.
Traders said that many hedge funds -- aggressive investment companies that typically manage money raised outside of the United States -- had heavily leveraged positions in emerging markets debt and faced margin calls last week, causing some to sell. Some hedge funds had borrowed as much as 90 percent of their positions, traders said.
The emerging markets problems come at a time when hedge funds also face substantial losses from the volatility in European interest rates and the fall of the dollar against the yen after the United States and Japan recently broke off negotiations over trade.
 
Questions for Mutual Funds
 Among the biggest questions for the future of the emerging markets is how the recent decline will affect investors who have been pouring money into emerging markets as opportunities in the developed world have looked meager. In particular, traders worry that mutual fund investors in particular may get scared off by the sharp decline and redeem their shares.
Fidelity's New Market Income Fund, which invests in emerging market debt securities, fell by 9.5 percent last week. As a result, by last Friday, investors sold a net of about $32 million in the fund, or about 10 percent of its assets, according to figures provided by Jane Jaimieson, a spokeswoman for Fidelity. And they sold more over the weekend, she said.
"A lot of people have been attracted to the fund based on its strong performance are now reacting to the volatility in the market," she said.
Some mutual fund managers suggest, however, that the market drop is actually an opportunity for them to improve their performance.
"We've been buying all last, taking advantages of values we haven't seen for months," said Isabel Saltzman, a portfolio manager at Scudder, Stevens & Clark.
 
Mexican Bond Trading
 Mexican par bonds, one of the most widely traded forms of Mexican Government debt, now trade at a yield of 2.4 percentage points above the equivalent United States Treasury bond, that's an increase from 1.7 percentage points a week ago, Ms. Saltzman said. "To me that's incredible," she added, noting the bonds had fallen to the levels they were at before the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was seen to improve Mexico's credit rating.
Most emerging market specialists said they expected the markets to rebound slowly over the coming weeks and months because the long-term economies of most developing nations are improving.
"We still believe in the fundamental values in Mexico and Argentina," Ms. Saltzman said. Brazil and Venezuela, she added, will recover more slowly.
Dealers in the emerging markets, however, said they are likely to be more cautious for much of the rest of the year, largely because they have been surprised about how volatile the market remains. Moreover, there has been a recognition that some of the positive events that investors had been expecting -- such as an upgrade of Mexican debt and a completion of the Brazilian debt restructuring -- would be delayed until the end of this year, Mr. Dizard said. "When the time horizon strategy stretches out it makes speculators like broker dealers and hedge funds better sellers than buyers," he said.

HEADLINE: Bond Market Rally Helps Most Stocks Rise

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Heartened by some soothing words from a governor of the Federal Reserve Board and some good news on inflation, the bond market rallied yesterday and carried a depressed stock market with it.
The one exception was the Dow Jones industrial average. It rose for much of the day but was dragged down in the session's last 30 minutes. Most of the fall was attributed to a single tobacco stock, Philip Morris, which was hurt by negative comments last Friday by a Government regulator. 
 And some investors were still nervous about inflation, at least judging by the price of gold, which Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, recently cited as an important barometer of inflation fears. In New York, spot gold futures specifying April delivery rose $2.70, to $382.50 an ounce.
 
Economically Sensitive Stocks
 Nonetheless, economically sensitive stocks like United Technologies, Royal Dutch Petroleum Company, and Pacific Gas and Electric benefited from the stock rally, as well as technology stocks like MCI Communications, Nextel, and Comcast, which announced a new alliance.
But the stock market will have to stage several powerful rallies to regain the ground it lost during February, which ended yesterday. By the end of the month, the Dow industrials had lost more than 143 points, or 3.6 percent, and the Standard & Poor's 500 nearly 15 points, or nearly 3 percent. But the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index lost only 7 points, or less than 1 percent.
What may be more important than last month's losses, however, is the fact that the Dow, the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq index have lost only a fraction of the 5 percent or more "correction" that most analysts expect to see in the stock market.
Yesterday, the Dow fell 6.76 points, to 3,832.02, but the S.& P. 500 rose 1.07 points, to 467.14. The Nasdaq index rose 8.72 points, to 792.50, in part because of the MCI-Nextel alliance.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.66 point, to 259.23, on moderate volume of 267.6 million shares. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining stocks by 1,457 to 727. The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 3.89 points, to 471.34.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve Board governor said in a speech to the Credit Union National Association, a trade group, that the central bank may not have to raise interest rates again. The market for the 30-year Government bond rose 21/32 , with a yield of 6.65 percent, down from 6.71 percent on Friday.
Also, February's Chicago purchasing managers index indicated a drop in prices paid by purchasing executives. And traders' demand was strong for about $25 billion of Treasury short-term notes, further underscoring traders' emerging confidence that long-term rates would not rise.
Philip Morris, which is held by many large institutional investors, was the fourth-most-active stock yesterday at 4.3 million shares and accounted for much of the drop in the Dow industrials. Philip Morris dragged down the index 4.5 points and the overall index fell 6.76 points.
Last Friday, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, David Kessler, asserted that nicotine was addictive and speculated about stricter Government regulation of cigarettes as a drug.

HEADLINE: For Job-Finding Concern, a Troubled Past

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
Its promotion sounds irresistible. The company finds jobs for people on welfare, and, according to its news releases, the government pays nothing for the service until the applicants are hired and working in full-time permanent jobs.
Both Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo have hailed the company, America Works, as a profit-making solution to the welfare burden. Last month both were on hand as New York City announced that it was joining the state in an arrangement that would double the number of people the company would seek to place in jobs. 
 But an examination of the company's performance shows that America Works has left a trail of unhappy officials in other states. The company performed poorly and cost too much, those officials said, and in one case was accused of improperly billing expenses to the state. Cuomo and Giuliani administration officials say they knew nothing of this discontent before hiring America Works.
Moreover, the company's contracts show that contrary to its assertions that it is paid for job placement alone, America Works gets nearly 20 percent of its $5,500 fee simply for enrolling clients in its program -- whether or not the welfare recipients get jobs.
And some social-policy experts have begun to question whether America Works is cost-effective, saying no scientific studies have been done to evaluate how many of the welfare recipients the company placed could have found jobs on their own or through less expensive programs.
America Works got its first contract with New York State in 1989 to place several hundred welfare recipients a year with private employers. After four years, it had signed up more than 1,000 people, most of whom were still on the job three months after being hired.
Both the Mayor and the Governor have lauded America Works for turning some of the city's nearly 1.1 million government dependents into taxpayers. "The best thing about this place is the free-enterprise system," Mr. Cuomo said of the company, while Mr. Giuliani called it "one of New York and America's success stories."
The Governor even reveled in the ripple effect New York's support for the company would have nationwide. "If, as the governor or the mayor of New York, you say America Works on TV, they hear it out there and it's gold," he said.
But the praise stands in contrast with the experiences during the 1980's described by officials in Ohio, in Erie County, N.Y., and in Massachusetts.
Ohio slashed its contract with America Works in 1986, saying that the company charged too much and had found jobs for too few people in the two years it had been operating there. One board member said placement costs came to $24,000 per person.
Ohio officials estimated that they lost millions of dollars dealing with America Works. "We had a very bad experience," said Gayle Channing, who was executive assistant for human services to former Gov. Richard F. Celeste when the state signed a contract with the company in 1984.
Peter Cove, the founder of America Works, who is now mainly responsible for its marketing and promotion, said his company's problems in Ohio resulted from political sabotage in which the company was forced by a supportive Democratic governor onto Republican-run counties set on seeing it stumble.
Erie County, N.Y., decided not to renew a contract with America Works in 1986 amid criticism by local officials that the company did not find jobs for as many people as it had promised and that it would only work with the most motivated clients.
 
'Serious Problems' In Massachusetts
 And in 1987 Massachusetts canceled its contract with a nonprofit employment agency started in Boston by Mr. Cove and later run by Lee Bowes, Mr. Cove's wife and now the chief operating officer of America Works.
An investigation by the state's Inspector General and an independent audit found that money from the nonprofit group, Transitional Employment Enterprises, had been improperly used to help start America Works and that the state was wrongly billed for expenses like singing telegrams and health club dues.
"There were very serious problems about ethics and financial practices," said Philip W. Johnston, who was the Secretary of Human Services in Massachusetts during the investigation. "The experience was not a happy one for us."
America Works is now exploring the possibility of getting a contract with Massachusetts, but its efforts are being resisted by officials who recall the state's experiences with Mr. Cove and Transitional Employment Enterprises.
Joseph Gallant, the state Commissioner of Public Welfare, wrote a memo last September to Charles D. Baker, the State Secretary for Health and Human Services, outlining his concerns about America Works. In the memo he cited the company's fee, which he said was $2,200 higher in New York and $900 higher in Connecticut than similar job-placement programs used by Massachusetts. He also recounted the state's history with Transitional Employment Enterprises and America Works.
Mr. Cove denied that he, Dr. Bowes, his company or T.E.E. had been involved in any wrongdoing, including the Inspector General's allegation that health club dues and singing telegrams were charged to the state. He said the allegations were "a personal political vendetta" by local officials against him, and he noted that the state investigation never resulted in an indictment.
Abraham Levovitz, a businessman from Brookline, Mass., who owns America Works, said he had heard "rumors and innuendo" about the company when he first considered investing in it in 1986. But after exploring the matter, he said, he concluded that the criticism stemmed from "jealous competitors" and politicians unwilling to concede that a profit-making venture should have a place in getting people off welfare. He strongly defended Mr. Cove and Dr. Bowes.
 
Fees for Training Before Placement
 Since coming to New York, America Works has attracted considerable attention both from the news media and national politicians, who point to a range of benefits for the government, which moves people off welfare, and businesses, which get a tax credit and have a four-month trial period in which the new employee is not on the payroll. Much of the acclaim centers on statements by America Works that it charges only for permanent job placements.
But the company's contracts with New York call for it to be paid about $980 of its $5,500 fee for simply enrolling applicants in a weeklong training course, and $3,855 only two days after a person is hired for a permanent job.
In fact, since 1989 New York State has paid nearly $1 million to America Works for people who never found permanent work -- about $133,000 for people who entered the course but never found jobs and about $857,000 for people who did not stay in their full-time jobs for more than three months.
Dr. Bowes said the company does not actually take money for enrollment unless it makes a placement. But she later said the company "made an exception" in certain cases to recoup the costs of a failed pilot project with the state to place and house homeless people. The project, which she said the company took on at the state's request, "was a disaster, and we invested a lot of time, effort and money."
John Haley, the contract manager for the New York's Office of Employment Programs, said, however, that the America Works contract calls for a payment upon enrollment "and they have always charged us for it."
"They may have made up some of the money they lost at the back end on the homeless project by loading up on the front end," he said. "But they did charge for enrollments that did not result in jobs."
 
Keeping the Promise Of Employment
 Even so, the company has fulfilled its promise of helping the state move people off welfare. Through December, America Works had enrolled 1,058 welfare recipients in the city and had helped 923 of them find jobs. Of these, 767 were still working three months after they were hired permanently.
"We feel we've done a great job and delivered a great product," Dr. Bowes said.
State officials say it costs the government about $9,700 a year to keep a family of three on welfare. But people who have studied welfare reform said that it was virtually impossible to measure the cost-effectiveness of America Works without a controlled examination of whether the people the company placed could have found jobs by themselves or through other programs.
"How much of their success is because the population they work with is more motivated?" said Douglas J. Besharov, an expert on welfare reform at the American Enterprise Institute.
New York officials said that while perhaps they should have been better informed about what happened with America Works elsewhere, they were pleased with the company's performance.
The state is currently in its fourth contract with America Works to find jobs for people receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children, most of whom are women. Until now the state has paid 40 percent of the costs, with the Federal Government paying 60 percent. The city will now split the state's share for 450 new clients, at a cost of about $500,000 for the city.
Ilene Marcus, the city's director of social services, said the administration did little if any research into the company and relied heavily on the state's confidence in America Works when the Mayor decided to join the state contract.
Michael J. Dowling, the state's Commissioner for Social Services, said he learned about the company after reading an article in 1987, and after speaking to people familiar with the company's work in Hartford, where it has been operating since 1985.
Connecticut officials said the company found permanent jobs for only 25 percent of the 3,311 people it enrolled. But given the poor state of the local economy, they said they were satisfied with its performance. Audrey Rowe, Connecticut's Commissioner for Social Services, said the success of America Works was comparable to other training and placement programs that the state uses. But she added that it was the most expensive.
After talking to Connecticut officials, Mr. Dowling met with Mr. Cove and encouraged him to bid for a job-placement contract with the state. America Works won the contract, and Mr. Dowling continues to praise it for being placement-oriented and having performance-based payments.
 
Making Money In Several Ways
 But while most other job-placement programs get paid only after a person has been on the job for 60 to 90 days, city and state officials said, America Works gets the bulk of its fee -- $3,855 -- two days after a person has been placed. The remaining $650 comes if the person is still there after three months.
In addition to the placement fee, America Works also makes money in several other ways. During the four months that their clients are working for a private company on a trial basis, the clients are on the America Works payroll, receiving $4.25 an hour, minimum wage. But America Works collects the worker's market-rate salary from the private employer, usually about $7.25 an hour, Dr. Bowes said.
During those four months America Works is also entitled to collect about $1,000 per person from the Federal Government, under an incentive program to share welfare savings with those who employ people on public assistance. And America Works is also entitled to about half the $2,400 Federal tax credit that businesses get for each disadvantaged worker they hire. The rest goes to the companies that hire the employees from America Works.
Mr. Levovitz said that because of the corporate structure of America Works, he is able to use only about 10 percent of the tax credits.
America Works has recently begun working in Indianapolis and is negotiating to open offices elsewhere. Several social-policy analysts said they worry that other cities and states might invest millions of public dollars in America Works because of its reputation alone.
"The truth is we just don't know whether, even if what they do is good, it is worth the price," said Bob Greenstein, the executive director of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research organization. "We need to know more about the return on taxpayers' dollars."

HEADLINE: Amnesty of Foes Brings Disarray To Yeltsin Team

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 28

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin suddenly dismissed the chief of the secret police today and canceled a nationwide television address amid signs that his Government was in deep disarray over a parliamentary amnesty for his opponents.
Nikolai M. Golushko, the spy chief, was apparently fired for refusing Mr. Yeltsin's orders to delay the release of prisoners after Parliament granted them amnesty, Russian officials said today, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
 The confusion over Mr. Yeltsin's plan to address the nation began when one of his aides, Georgi Satarov, told reporters at the lower house of Parliament today that the President would make a nationally televised address tonight and announce a decree aimed at "calming passions" after the amnesty for the leaders of the revolt against Mr. Yeltsin's Government in October.
 
Yeltsin Fails to Give Speech
 But there was no address tonight, and television news said no speech had ever been scheduled. However, officials at the television center said plans for an address had been canceled.
The ouster of Mr. Golushko, who has the title of head of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, was almost certainly unrelated to Moscow's tit-for-tat expulsion today of an American official, James L. Morris, listed as a counselor at the United States Embassy.
Mr. Yelstin had broken the old K.G.B., or Committee for State Security, into two parts: foreign intelligence, led by Yevgeny M. Primakov, and the Security Ministry. Recently, Mr. Yeltsin told Mr. Golushko to reorganize the Security Ministry into the Federal Counterintelligence Service, supposedly stripping the ministry of border troops and domestic political surveillance.
The Russian officials' view of Mr. Golushko's dismissal was supported indirectly by Aleksei I. Kazannik, an ally of Mr. Yeltsin's who resigned as Prosecutor General two days ago after refusing a similar order from the President.
Mr. Kazannik said today that he had refused a direct order from Mr. Yeltsin to keep in prison seven of the men who led the October revolt. Mr. Yeltsin's aides argued that Parliament had exceeded its powers and had granted a pardon to those not yet tried instead of an amnesty to convicted criminals.
Mr. Kazannik said Mr. Golushko had received a similar order.
 
Leaders of Revolt Released
 On Saturday, former Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, former parliamentary Speaker Ruslan I. Khasbulatov and other leaders of the rebellion walked out of the prison where they had languished since early October, when Mr. Yeltsin sent in tanks to shell the Parliament building. More than 140 people died.
Elections on Dec. 12 produced a new Parliament dominated by nationalists and Communists who supported the amnesty as a direct political challenge to Mr. Yeltsin. Under the new Constitution that Mr. Yeltsin pushed for, he has no right to veto an amnesty declaration and it requires no vote in the upper house, where he has more supporters.
Mr. Rutskoi and Mr. Khasbulatov view the elections and the amnesty as a justification of their actions in opposing Mr. Yeltsin's dissolution of the old Parliament and Constitution. Mr. Yeltsin's recent, more nationalist tone and support for a softer, slower transition to market economics are also closer to Mr. Rutskoi's and Mr. Khasbulatov's previous political positions.
Mr. Morris, who arrived in Moscow only recently and is presumed to be the C.I.A. station chief here, was given seven days to leave Russia after Moscow's chief intelligence officer in the United States, Aleksandr Lysenko, was expelled by Washington in response to the case of Aldrich H. Ames, a C.I.A. official who is charged with spying for Moscow.
 
No Further Expulsions Now
 The White House spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, said today that while Washington regretted the expulsion of Mr. Morris, there were no plans for now to expel any other Russian official.
The C.I.A.'s Moscow station, counter to the notion bred by spy fiction, has always been relatively small given the intensity of Soviet surveillance, former intelligence officials say. During the cold war there were as few as two operative C.I.A. agents in Moscow, and during the 1950's there was no station chief, the officials say.
In the early 1960's a respected officer named Paul Garbler became station chief, under the cover of assistant naval attache. But he fell under suspicion from the agency's chief counterintelligence officer, James J. Angleton. Mr. Garbler was compensated by the C.I.A. in the 1980's for the damage done to his reputation by Mr. Angleton.
Yeltsin spokesmen said today that Mr. Golushko's dismissal was for "personal reasons." But Lefortovo prison, where the amnestied prisoners were held, was under the control of Mr. Golushko's agency until transferred by presidential decree on Saturday to the Prosecutor General. That suggests that Mr. Yeltsin thought Mr. Kazannik would keep the prisoners after Mr. Golushko refused to do so.
The likely replacement for Mr. Golushko will be his deputy, Sergei Stepashin, the Itar-Tass news agency said.

U.S. Protests Expulsion
 WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (Special to The New York Times) -- A State Department spokesman said today that the United States "protested in the strongest possible terms" the expulsion of Mr. Morris.
The spokesman, Mike McCurry, said Washington's decision on Friday to expel Mr. Lysenko "was an entirely justified action in light of the involvement of the Russian intelligence service in the Ames espionage case."
By contrast, he said, "the expulsion of the U.S. diplomat from Moscow is purely an act of unjustified retaliation."
The spokesman would not identify Mr. Morris by name or title, referring to him only as "an embassy officer."
"We reserve the right to take further action if there are others who are implicated in connection with the Ames case," Mr. McCurry said. "We will continue to assess, as that investigation and prosecution develops, what further measures might be necessary."

HEADLINE: Mexico Seen as Barrier To a Broader Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is concerned that the Mexican Government may seek to block its plans to bring more Latin American countries into the North American Free Trade Agreement, an internal Administration document shows.
Congress has required President Clinton to list by the end of June those countries with which the White House plans to negotiate free trade deals. 
 But a lengthy memorandum reviewing the Administration's trade policy plans for Latin America shows hidden concerns, not expressed publicly by American officials, that Mexico could block those plans.
At the heart of the concerns is a worry, born of Clinton and Bush Administration contacts with Mexican officials, that Mexico will not want to share its special access to the United States economy with other countries that have similar low-wage economies and compete with Mexico.
 
Fears of an Alliance
 The chief worry is that Mexico will ally itself with the next entrant into the free trade pact and the two countries will together prevent the United States and Canada from proceeding with their plans for a giant free trade area covering the Western Hemisphere, with potential extensions into Asia.
"Mexico reportedly is not interested in allowing other countries in the region into an arrangement that offers considerable benefits, which were achieved because of its relationship to the United States," the document says, with the word "not" printed in boldface type. "Obtaining consensus to expand the Nafta could become increasingly difficult if Mexico's reluctance were overcome for the admission of a couple more countries (e.g. Chile) and one of these newly acceded nations blocks further FTA negotiations."
The document also suggests a way to get around such objections by limiting the voting power of future entrants to the North American pact. While the United States, Canada and Mexico would have equal votes on decisions to expand the pact, future entrants would only receive votes based on the volume of their trade.
 
A Strong Denial
 A copy of the memorandum was obtained from a person involved in the Administration's decision-making on trade policy. The document was part of the basis for an inconclusive White House discussion in mid-February of United States trade policy regarding Latin America, said an official who insisted on anonymity.
Mexico's Ambassador to the United States, Jorge Montano, strongly denied in a recent interview that Mexico would seek to block expansion of the North American pact. He pointed out that Mexico had negotiated a separate free trade pact with Chile.
Charlene Barshefsky, one of three deputies for Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, wrote the memorandum to her counterparts at six other agencies, including the State Department, Treasury Department and the National Economic Council. She declined to comment on the document.
Anne Luzzatto, the press secretary for the Office of the United States Trade Representative, said a review of trade policy regarding Latin America was under way, but she declined to discuss the memorandum.
The internal document proposes that the President publicly offer membership in the North American pact to solidly democratic governments in Latin America -- and possibly Asian countries like Singapore -- that meet several criteria, including following several years of economic reforms approved by the International Monetary Fund.

The Inventive Meets the Tailored in Italy

BYLINE: By BERNADINE MORRIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MILAN, Italy, Feb. 28

 BODY:
With the local economy scraping bottom and recovery spotty in prime markets like the United States and Japan, Italian designers faced a quandary as they prepared their fall collections. Should they jolt the world with wildly inventive designs or focus on the expert tailoring and luxurious sportswear that made their reputations? Both approaches were evident as the shows for fall, the most important selling season of the year, began over the weekend.
Perhaps more important than these design decisions was the emphasis most major houses placed on their secondary collections. These lower-priced and generally younger-looking clothes are projected to raise interest in fashion, which seems to have lost the priority it enjoyed in the world market in pre-recession days. 
 The single biggest trend in the first days of the shows was the emphasis on men's styling. The clothes range from classic pants suits by Antonio Fusco, which are worn conventionally with a handkerchief in the breast pocket and a tie, to the frock coats of Dolce & Gabbana.
With their use of corsetry details and their revival of Beatles styles, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana established their house as a major trend-setter. Now, they are pushing the men's wear look, with black fitted jackets or long coats, pipestem pants and white shirts. It works just fine.
 
Coral and Apple Green
 They make other fashion suggestions, like patchwork dresses, clear plastic jackets and tweedy shorts to keep their reputation as avant-gardists. But it is their neat black suits that will be remembered as their main contribution to fashion for fall.
The mannish pants suit turns up at Gucci, too, but the emphasis is on long fitted jackets over short fluttery skirts, and colors like coral and apple green. With high-heel ankle boots and opaque white tights, the effect is feminine despite the crisp tailoring.
Gianni Versace introduced his two secondary collections, Istante and Versus, in a luxurious tent set up in the courtyard of his home in the center of Milan. Both shows had a lively, upbeat feeling.
The surprise at Istante was the return of the dress, always very short and usually with a high waistline. For a generation of women brought up on jackets and skirts or pants, these shapely dresses in colors like apple green and aqua suggest a different way to put themselves together.
Versus is a jazzier collection of fake fur pieces imitating spotted cats, along with leathers in colors like bubble-gum pink. Most of the skirts are astonishingly short. When a mid-length style appears on the runway, it's an eye-opener. Perhaps Mr. Versace is just testing the waters.
Valentino's Oliver collection mixes fragile chiffon with sturdy wool or velvet. The chiffon is used for wispy short skirts or easy pants, and it contrasts with the thicker wool jackets. For added impact, the thin fabric is shaded in bands from yellow to pink or blue to purple. The idea works best when the contrasts are not too extreme, as in a gray flannel jacket over chiffon pants in different shades of gray. A big knitted cardigan over the jacket adds another gray element to the interplay of textures.
 
Revitalizing the Missonis
 A year ago, the daughter of Ottavio and Rosita Missoni branched out on her own, making clothes to attract women in their 20's and 30's. Calling her venture Team Angela Missoni, she avoided the intricate knitwear patterns that are her parents' signature. In fact, her best styles are all black or all white: long skinny jumpers over sheer blouses. Tunics that fall in handkerchief points, wrapped waists and hips, and bra-like tops pulled over knitted cardigans are some of her lively ideas.
Buoyed by their daughter's success, the Missonis have revitalized their own collection. In addition to their intricate knitted patterns, as dense as Persian carpets, they have introduced broad stripes in colors like terra cotta and blue. Fish-net panels and three-dimensional effects vary the textures. A metal thread woven through or a flash of sequins adds a special glow for evening.
The stripes look young and uncomplicated in short skirts with waist-length jackets for day. Scoop-neck dresses with flippy skirts can be worn over bare skin or T-shirts. Long knitted coats wrap everything up cozily.
Minimalism has come to Milan. Alan Cleaver and Keith Varty, two British designers who have made Byblos a young, swinging Milanese company, stick to basic colors like silver, white and medium blue. Fitted jackets in varied lengths, easy coats and an occasional bolero are key pieces. Everything looks neat and wearable. So what if all the models wore tousled blond wigs. This is fashion, after all.

Obstacle-Strewn Road to Rethinking the Numbers on AIDS

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Determining how many Americans are infected with the virus that causes AIDS is an imprecise science at best. But Federal health officials are trying again, and it appears that the current estimate of one million will be lowered.
The estimate, made in 1989, represents the midpoint of the range reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. It set the figure at 800,000 to 1.2 million. The widely cited one million midpoint figure has been attacked as too low or too high, depending on the critic's point of view. 
 The centers plan to make a new estimate in July, and in preparation the agency invited independent experts to meet last week to report and review relevant data. Although some of their estimates went as high as a million, most ranged from 600,000 to 800,000.
The new estimate could have critical health, political and economic ramifications. For planning purposes, health officials need to know where and how many new cases of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, are occurring. Determining the national trend in H.I.V. infections and identifying geographical hot spots is crucial to making budgets, developing sound public health policy, evaluating the success of prevention programs and determining research needs and priorities.
There are various reasons why it has been so difficult to obtain accurate information about H.I.V. Laws around the nation preclude testing a person for H.I.V. without permission. Furthermore, many people at high risk refuse to take part in household surveys because of concerns about protecting confidentiality and insurance coverage. Proposals for mandatory testing have met with strong resistance from civil libertarians, advocacy groups and others.
Another obstacle to making accurate national estimates is the fact that the United States is battling not one but several AIDS epidemics, and they are not behaving in the same way.
The main epidemic has been and still seems to be among white gay men. But among that group, the incidence of new H.I.V. infections seems to be leveling off, if not declining. Meanwhile, other epidemics, particularly the one involving black women in the South, seem to be rising. The various patterns of the epidemics add to the complexities of determining how many Americans are infected with H.I.V. and how the number has changed over recent years.
Projecting a national total from small, focused studies is fraught with risk. Participants at the meeting pointed to many gaps in the available data as they assessed the strengths and weaknesses of the various statistical methods for making the estimates.
"There's no one way to do it that is right," said Dr. Meade Morgan, an expert with the centers, explaining why his team would check results from several methods against each other before making an estimate.
To health officials, the absolute number of H.I.V. infections is less important than whether the number of new H.I.V. infections is rising or falling. Ideally, statisticians want to know that number each year. But because such data are not collected nationally for H.I.V. and no national study has encompassed all high-risk groups, extrapolations must be made from small studies and surveys.
Calculations from cases of full-fledged AIDS can also be helpful. A major problem in using AIDS cases, however, is that they then reflect the status of the epidemic in the year individuals became ill with AIDS and not when they became infected with the virus, which is generally a silent process that produces no symptoms.
The delay in progression from infection to AIDS in adults is, on average, about 10 years, though the number can vary significantly.
Dr. James Curran, who coordinates all AIDS activities at the Atlanta centers, said a major problem was lack of knowledge about who had become infected with the virus over the last five years. "We don't know whether the incidence of H.I.V. in the United States in 1993 was different than it was in 1991 or 1989, and we do not know yet whether the current figure exceeds or is less than the number of deaths from AIDS," he said.
Dr. Harold W. Jaffe, the centers' top AIDS scientist, said there was ample evidence that the newly infected were different, as a group, from those who were getting infected 10 years ago and that the driving force of the epidemic was changing.
Several studies strongly suggest that the AIDS epidemic may have peaked nationally among gay men. As of last September, the latest month for which data are available, gay men had accounted for 183,344 of the 334,344 cases reported in this country since the disease was first recognized in 1981.
But the transmission of H.I.V. has by no means stopped in gay men. Studies in Chicago and Denver showed that 2.5 percent of gay men in their teen-age years and early 20's were becoming infected each year. Another study showed that despite an overall decline in new infection rates, many young gay men were becoming infected with H.I.V. in San Francisco and Berkeley, Calif.; the highest rates are in black gay men.
The question is whether there is enough transmission among young gay men to create a second wave of AIDS that would rival the one of a decade ago when the figures for H.I.V. infection ranged from 10 to 20 percent a year.
A federally sponsored national survey of childbearing women shows that the number of H.I.V. infections is rising gradually among women in general, but has risen sharply among black women in the South.
Participants said the number of infected users of intravenous drugs was probably not increasing.
Statistical data about other diseases are often as imprecise as those for H.I.V. infection. Advocacy groups for a particular disease tend to cite the highest number of affected people to show the magnitude of the ailment's effects on society and to get a larger share of Federal health money. But figures for other diseases seem to get less scrutiny than do those for H.I.V.
Officials at the Federal health centers say their estimate will be based on the best available scientific data. But an estimate lower than a million is bound to be criticized.
"So many people have so much invested in the epidemic that anything that makes it look like it is going away, that there may not be as many infected people as some once had thought, causes panic among the investors," one conference participant said in an interview. Funds are often cut for diseases perceived as no longer being public health threats. Sometimes a resurgence follows. Tuberculosis is a striking recent example.
If the new estimate for H.I.V. infection were substantially lower than a million, some fear that the public and the Government would see less need for financing for education and prevention, the very tools that have been credited with stemming the rise in some areas, if not nationally.
"It is very scary what the fallout from low numbers could be," said Dr. Neil Schram, a member of the Federal centers' advisory committee on H.I.V. prevention and a representative of the American Association of Physicians for Human Rights. "My fear is that when people look at the numbers, everybody is going to feel the epidemic is over."
A new problem has arisen to increase the difficulty of revising the estimate. In 1993, the centers began using a revised definition of AIDS, leading to a significant increase in the number of cases. For the first nine months of 1993, 85,526 cases were reported, a rise of 148 percent over the 35,479 cases reported for the same period in 1992. Any statistical method based on AIDS cases used to arrive at a new estimate of H.I.V. infections must take account of the changed definition.
To overcome the problem for future estimates, researchers are trying to develop new ways to estimate the number of newly infected people from spot surveys that could eliminate the need to follow large groups for many years.
Even if the C.D.C. substantially lowers the estimate from one million this July, however, one point about the epidemic seems certain: AIDS is not going away. The disease that was unknown before 1981 will remain endemic in this country. In what numbers remains to be seen.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
Aqueduct Measures Snow by Days Lost

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
What is so rare as a day in June? How about one in January or February with actual racing at Aqueduct?
Those days were especially rare in this year of snow followed by sleet followed by snow. And from the highest track official to the lowliest railbird, cancellation of 14 of the first 51 racing days of the winter season, most recently last Wednesday , is anything but a joke. 
 "This has been absolutely the worst winter I've ever had the privilege to be involved with," Richard Migliore, a veteran New York jockey, said between races on a recent race day between snows.
Noting that cancellations had cost him many of his rides, Migliore pointed out that jockeys who don't ride don't get paid.
"We're not on salary," he said.
Bob, a clubhouse bartender who preferred to keep his last name to himself, echoed the point, saying his tips were down 20 percent. "I can't sell to people who aren't here," he said.
 
A Month Behind
 Robbie Davis, a leading New York jockey, noted that the series of snow days and freeze-outs had cost local riders more than an occasional payday. "It knocks you out of any chance of being in the top 10 in the nation," he said. "You're giving everybody else a whole month head start practically."
Even some people not involved in racing have been affected. Gertrude Arbona, for example, isn't a bettor, but she can tell when Aqueduct is closed. If it gets to be afternoon and her 81-year-old husband, Ray, is still underfoot, she knows something is amiss.
Like many inveterate horseplayers, Ray Arbona has a wintertime ritual, in his case, hopping the Q27 bus at his Bayside corner in Queens, transferring to the Q46 to Kew Gardens, then taking the Q37 to Aqueduct.
Ask him a familiar question as he comes away from an automatic betting machine after making his hour-long, three-bus trip and Arbona supplies a familiar answer: "I've lost a few dollars."
Those losses are the lifeblood of the New York thoroughbred industry, and according to Jerry McKeon, the president of the New York Racing Association, the not-for-profit corporation that runs the thoroughbred tracks in New York State, this year there have been far too few of them.
"Depressing," he said. "This game is one that is very much tied to momentum. If you get on a negative roll, it takes days to overcome that, and we've never been able to. We'll get going and then two or three days later, Whack! an ice storm or a snowstorm."
The season has been especially frustrating because the interruptions have kept officials from getting a reading on this winter's bold new experiment, supplementing a reduced card of seven live races with betting on five simulcast races from Gulfstream Park in Florida. (On weekends, the mix is now nine live races and five on simulcast.)
 
Live Races Preferred
 The mixed card was necessary, McKeon said, because recession and competition have cut the number of horses available for Aqueduct's winter season by some 40 percent, from more than 2,400 last year to fewer than 1,500 this year.
In theory, a card of 12 races, or 14, should be more profitable than the traditional nine-race format, especially since the track gets to keep an extra percentage point of the betting on the televised races.
In practice it doesn't work out that way, largely, McKeown said, because a live race draws about twice as much betting as a televised race, even one involving superior horses and bigger cards.
"People prefer to root for the home team," he said.
 
The Money Drain
 Even so, the experiment has shown promise, with the first six-day run of races this year generating a larger handle than the comparable week a year ago.
Over all, though, comparisons between 1993 and 1994 are disheartening. Attendance, now running more than 100,000 below last year, is off more than 35 percent, and even including this year's handle on Gulfstream simulcasts, total on-track betting is down some $30 million, or more than 30 percent.
Thanks in part to an unprecedented streak of good, or at least racing-possible, weather recently, the attendance and handle gaps have narrowed considerably since the last big snow, on Feb. 11.
Part of the catchup came over the three-day Presidents Day weekend, when the track, as a gesture of appreciation to its frustrated fans, waived admission and parking fees, drawing more than 10,000 fans on each of the three days.
The 1993-94 comparisons were especially satisfying on Sunday. A total of 10,989 fans bet $2.6 million. That was $2.6 million more than a year earlier, when racing was canceled because of snow.
Despite the recent catchups, the racing association expects losses to be bigger than usual this winter. The association holds a winter season to subsidize the industry, expecting to lose about $7 million (and to make it up in the spring, summer and fall seasons). This winter's losses are projected to increase to $11 million, more than can be made up later.
In addition to lost revenues, operating costs, which McKeon says generally run five to six times higher in winter than in other seasons, have been even higher this winter.
At Belmont, where Aqueduct horses are stabled, there are 60 barns, each with 6 doors, said McKeon. Factor in the single-digit temperatures of one memorable January night and the result was 360 doors frozen shut.
For safety reasons, crews on double shift receiving time-and-a-half pay cracked open two doors in each barn, then cracked ice on the horse paths so the horses could get to the training track. "Then we had to put chains on the trucks so we could get the horses to Aqueduct," McKeown said.
And after all that? "Racing was canceled," he said.

HEADLINE: Our Tourists Can Save Russia

 BODY:
1To the Editor:
Not that I dispute your facts on crime in Moscow in "Riding Shotgun in Capitalist Russia" (Business Day, Feb. 16), but by overdramatizing events that have become commonplace in our own society, you do damage to one of the few areas of Russia's fledgling free market economy that work: tourism. 
 Tourism is one of the few ways Americans can help support economic transition in Russia without having to support massive United States aid. Tourism puts hard currency into the system quickly. A post-cold-war trading and tourism partner creates a safer world than a poverty-stricken closed nation with nuclear arms. Not to mention the mutual understanding that develops when people from different countries visit one another.
I am co-owner of an American-Russian company that arranges travel and business needs for people who visit Russia. As a result of your article, we received four cancellations, two from New York and two from Florida. Yes, only four, but how many Russian lives are affected?
The four guides and four drivers they would meet in their 12-day stay would continue to be employed by a private company (instead of a state-owned factory). In addition, the gratuities those Russians would likely receive from those four people would feed their families for a week! The two managers in Moscow and St. Petersburg would receive a profit-sharing bonus in dollars that are deposited in a United States bank for them to spend at the end of the season. (Are you listening, American retailers and bankers?) The Russian families where the tourists booked a "dinner party in a home" may not without them have meat this month.
Then, there are baggage handlers, taxi drivers, street artists, waiters, hotel maids and bartenders, who depend on tourists to provide security for their families in a chaotic system. As a side note, the female manager of our Moscow office was an engineer in a state-owned institute making $100 a month just four years ago. Last month she bought her family an apartment in Moscow with her profit sharing from last season. The manager of our St. Petersburg office, formerly a low-paid teacher, and his wife spent last November in the United States. They spent $2,000, an unheard-of sum two years ago. This is the free market working, folks!
Think about how the New York City Visitors and Convention Bureau would react if foreign newspapers started publishing articles about how dangerous New York City is. If you're not sure how much money and public relations effort would be spent to protect New York tourism, just ask Florida.
And, readers, if you've been considering visiting Russia, but The Times has convinced you it's too dangerous, think about this. Last year in New York nine innocent commuters were gunned down on a suburban train. How many gang-related assaults and murders did the New York area experience last month? How many foreigners were ripped off by unscrupulous taxi drivers last year? How many people get mugged every day?
People travel to understand one another's cultures, to see the world with new eyes, to walk in another's shoes. Russia needs America more than ever, not because of our aid, but because of our people. I know a lot of Russians (and Americans) who would be happy to tell you about what's beautiful, what's hopeful and why you shouldn't miss seeing Russia this year!

HEADLINE: Observer;
The Recovery Room

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
We spent three weeks where it never snows and there lost touch with the news, which is often fatal to journalists. In journalism survival requires a zealot's belief in the importance of the present moment, and three weeks of refuge from present moments can leave that faith in tatters.
Three weeks without immersion in the millions of absolutely vital present moments that constitute journalism's definition of three weeks -- Ah reader, would you believe how little of consequence really happens in three weeks? 
 Would you believe maybe nothing?
"A cease-fire in the Balkans you call nothing?" someone will ask, someone fleetingly lifting eyes and ears from the cannonading of present moments pouring in from CNN, New York Times, Connie Chung, "Inside Edition," ESPN, "Oprah," Time, "Entertainment Tonight," the whole, in fact, madhouse of what is called "information," such is the parlous state of the language, Heaven having refused to help us.
"Information," indeed. Information's job is to enrich us, not to bury us in popcorn.
Information, as opposed to "information," would not shout of a cease-fire in the Balkans, but sigh quietly of "another cease-fire" in the Balkans, nudging us to reflect that in lands where firing has gone on eternally it would be foolish to hope for much from "another cease-fire."
As for the mass murder in Israel, it is notable for the great number of victims in a single incident, but matched against the number of Arabs and Israelis killed since their killings began years ago, it is a trifling number. Diplomacy will or won't be impeded, but only for the moment, and afterward it will succeed or fail in its own time, and probably, over the long run, do both.
You ask, "After three weeks of abstinence from present moments, how do you know of these things?"
A quick study, reader. That's how. The journalist who cannot fly from Washington tonight, land in Ulan Bator tomorrow afternoon and three hours later file a comprehensive report on the political, economic and moral crisis confronting Ulan Bator is not worth the cardboard it takes to make a press card. He must be a quick study.
Preparing to re-enter the world of present moments, I buried myself two hours ago in the newspapers of the past three weeks. They tell of the Balkans and Israel and of incessant blizzards coating the north in ice, abandoned cars and those sinister creations of the snow-removal artists, ancient blackened mountains of curbside snow that are urban America's winter wonderland.
These stories provide a shameful twinge of sadistic pleasure for one who has passed three weeks where the climate was perfect day and night and the only annoyance a woodpecker wearing his beak out on the house's clapboards.
Still, even the evil-weather stories show how fragile journalism's memory can be. They bring to mind an insupportable New York winter 10 or 12 years ago when a grotesque black tower of snow stood, apparently unmeltable, at Hudson and Jane Streets well into August, if I remember correctly, and if not, so what? "The artistic lie is always preferable to the inartistic truth, except in journalism," according to Henry James, who despised journalism.
And no wonder, I say to myself, as I wade through thousands of square yards of prose about young people engaged in ice-and-snow sports and dance in Norway.
This is intertwined with a tawdry tale about one Tonya Harding, whose fate in these frigid endeavors so fascinates all America that scarcely a couch potato can bear to turn off the television no matter how mercilessly CBS wields its brutal commercials.
So obsessed with Tonya Harding, America apparently lost all interest in President Clinton. The President, whoever he be, is America's superstar, for the obvious reason that Presidents lend themselves to the simple situation-comedy format which television, being an entertainment medium, needs to convey news. Imagine trying to get the TV audience interested in some 500 Congressmen and their families.
So for three weeks of breathtakingly vital present moments, President Superstar gave way to a sad waif in an ice rink. The thought begins to thrill me. Must be time to resume journalism.

HEADLINE: U.S. AND RUSSIANS BROKER NEW PACTS FOR A BOSNIA PEACE

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
Working on parallel diplomatic fronts, the United States and Russia brokered separate agreements today that were meant to move Bosnia and Herzegovina closer to peace.
In Moscow, Russia succeeded in persuading the leader of the Bosnian Serbs to permit the reopening of the airfield near the Bosnian Muslim town of Tuzla for relief flights of food and medicine. In Washington, negotiators for the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Croats signed a framework agreement to unite the parts of the country that are under their control. 
 While the United States and Russia have a general agreement that Washington will pursue the Bosnian Muslims and Moscow will work on its Serbian friends, the separate diplomatic negotiations do not a represent a carefully orchestrated effort to end the 23-month war in Bosnia, which has cost more than 200,000 lives.
 
U.S. Was Not Informed
 Indeed, senior American officials acknowledged that the United States was not even aware of the details of the latest Russian plan that was accepted in Moscow today by the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, after Russia promised to send its own observers to the Tuzla airfield.
While the two initiatives reflect the common desire in both capitals to find a formula for peace, the Russians are also motivated by a determination to foreclose any use of military force against the Serbs, who share the Orthodox Christian religion with the Russians. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has threatened air strikes against the Serbs if they refuse to allow the airport to open by next Monday.
 
Second Set of Concessions
 Dr. Karadzic announced the concession on Tuzla after meeting today with the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev. The decision came a day after NATO fighter jets shot down four Serbian airplanes that the Western alliance said had violated a United Nations-appointed no-flight zone.
It was the second time in less than a month that the Bosnian Serbs have made major concessions under the protective arm of Russia, in the face of Western threats of force. Last week, Russia persuaded them to remove their heavy guns from hills ringing Sarajevo before NATO carried out its threat to bomb them.
But senior Administration officials said that Russia would be allowed to send observers to the airport only under the auspices of the United Nations peacekeeping force.
In a last-minute, but elaborately choreographed, signing ceremony held by Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the State Department, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic of Bosnia, Foreign Minister Mate Granic of Croatia and Kresimir Zubak, the political leader of the Bosnian Croats, signed an accord to create a Swiss-like federation of cantons or municipalities made up of areas where a majority of the population is either Muslim or Croat. The cantons will have authority over police, education, culture, housing, public services, tourism and radio and television.
Both populations would enjoy equal protection under the law, with a central government responsible for foreign affairs, national defense and commerce.
 
Economic Union
 In a separate signing, Mr. Silajdzic also accepted a preliminary accord with Mr. Granic to join the Muslim-Croatian entity in Bosnia in a financial and economic confederation with the Republic of Croatia.
"This agreement shows how much can be accomplished, even after bitter years of violence, when the two sides sit down together," Mr. Christopher said, adding, "It shows that peace is possible.
In a statement issued by the White House, President Clinton praised both agreements as "a major step in the search for peace in Bosnia," pledging that, "The United States will continue to work closely with the parties throughout this process."
Although Mr. Christopher and the negotiators heralded the accord as a breakthrough, its obvious deficiency is that it does not deal with the Serbian faction in Bosnia, which controls more territory than either of the other two factions. Senior Administration officials acknowledged that as the military victors in the Bosnian war, the Serbs will not have much reason to join the Muslim-Croat entity, even with substantial inducement.
The goal of today's Muslim-Croatian agreement is to create an economically and politically independent state that would avoid a three-way partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina along ethnic lines.
 
A Loose Confederation
 A likely scenario will now be for the United States and the Europeans to press for the newly created union to join with the Serb faction in a loose confederation with separate executive authority, as envisioned under current United Nations-European Union negotiations in Geneva, a senior Administration official said.
But other senior Administration officials hope that the Serbs will somehow prefer to be aligned with what is envisioned as a democratic, economically vibrant Muslim-Croat entity rather than to try to secede from Bosnia and be annexed to Serbia.
A senior administration official briefing reporters after the signing ceremony conceded that the agreement covers only 32 to 33 percent of the territory of Bosnia. The rest is controlled by the Serbs.
Brent Scowcroft, the former national security adviser and now a director of the Forum for International Policy, told reporters today that the agreement between the Bosnian Muslims and Croats would do little more than allow diplomats to claim a triumph.
"If anyone thinks this is going to put pressure on the Serbs," he said, "it's not going to work."
 
Details to Come
 Today's agreement grew out of informal discussions last year between President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, who will now be called upon to negotiate the details of their own confederation.
Talks between the two Governments are expected to begin in Vienna this Friday, and the two leaders have been given a deadline of March 15 for completing work on their confederation.
As an inducement to the Croatian Government in Zagreb, the initiative holds out the promise of substantial economic and political incentives. Croatia and the Croats in Bosnia would no longer be threatened by economic sanctions. And the confederation of the Sarajevo and Zagreb Governments would be given access to Western European economic structures and be invited to participate in NATO's "Partnership for Peace" plan that will extend some of the benefits of NATO, but not membership, to the former Warsaw Pact countries.
The accord creating the Muslim-Croat entity guarantees all refugees and displaced people the right to return to their homes and the right to "have restored to them any property of which they were deprived in the course of ethnic cleansing and to be compensated for any property which cannot be restored to them."
 
A Major Concession
 In today's accord, the Croats made a major concession in accepting the idea of creating ethnic-based municipalities. The Croats fear that they will be dominated by the Muslims, who outnumber them, and initially demanded a union of two discrete Muslim and Croatian pieces of territory, rather than a federated state.
In a suggestion of how ambitious the agreement's goals are, it envisions a common army after a transitional period, despite the fact that the Bosnian Government and the Croats have been locked in bitter fighting for nearly a year.
But it leaves some details to be resolved, including a precise map defining the borders of the cantons because so many of the borders depend on the Serbs. "There cannot be a final agreement without a map, and a map depends on the Serbs," one senior official said.
The White House spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, said that Russia did not inform the United States in advance of its initiative on Tuzla, but added that this was not a matter of United States concern. "I think they're trying to be helpful," she said.

HEADLINE: Senate Turns Down Amendment On Balancing the Federal Budget

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The Senate tonight rejected a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget, killing the proposal for at least this year.
The vote was 63 to 37, leaving the measure four votes short of the two-thirds majority required for a constitutional amendment. 
 The measure, sponsored by Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, never stimulated the grass-roots support its backers had hoped for. It failed after intense, skilled opposition by Senators Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and George J. Mitchell of Maine, who raised the specter of political, economic and constitutional perils.
 
Maneuvering by Opponents
 The two Senators also solidified wavering opponents by arranging for a vote on a much weaker version of a balanced budget amendment, a plan that was overwhelmingly defeated but still provided a political comfort zone for a few senators. Seven senators voted for the weaker version and rejected the Simon version.
Backers in the House insisted that they would still press for a vote there next month, but Mr. Mitchell, the majority leader, declared he would not bring it up again in the Senate.
"This is it," Mr. Mitchell said. "Under no circumstances over which I have any control will this be brought up again, this session, this Congress, this year."
But Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said: "It's going to happen. If not this year, next year or the next year."
 
'Political Posturing'
 Mr. Mitchell delivered the closing speech against the proposal, saying, "The balanced budget amendment now before us is a bold example of political posturing." But he said he understood that some members felt a need "for political cover."
Forty-one Republicans and 22 Democrats voted for the amendment tonight, while 3 Republicans and 34 Democrats voted against it. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, voted in favor. The five Democratic Senators from the New York metropolitan area -- Bill Bradley and Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York -- voted against it.
In an interview, Mr. Mitchell said many members of both parties had made it clear to him that they thought the amendment was a bad idea but feared for their re-elections. "If this was a secret ballot, this amendment would not get a majority," he said.
Mr. Dole, meanwhile, criticized the Clinton Administration's opposition to the amendment, saying, "The bottom line is this Administration is looking for every excuse in the book to spend more money than Americans are willing to pay for in tax dollars."
He said that without the amendment the nation would be like a family "that struggles year after year with a growing credit card debt because it can never quite tighten its belt enough to pay off the principal."
But at the White House this morning, President Clinton said the amendment would produce legislative paralysis.
"It amounts to turning the whole future of America over to 40 percent plus one of each house of the Congress," he said, referring to the provision that would allow deficit spending only if three-fifths of each house agreed, giving the two-fifths minority effective veto power. "In an intensely partisan atmosphere, that's a recipe for total paralysis."
Under the Simon amendment, which would have taken effect in 2001, Federal spending could not exceed income unless Congress agreed in sufficient numbers to allow a deficit. It would have required separate three-fifths votes to increase the national debt, the accumulated total of annual deficits.
Supporters contended that the measure was the only way to force Congress and the executive branch to halt years of deficit spending. "There is a day of reckoning," Mr. Simon said. "We ought to stop this before we get to the edge of the cliff."
Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, a reluctant supporter, called the measure "the worst method proposed for eliminating our persistent Federal deficit" -- except for all the failed alternatives that had already been tried. But he said it was "the only way to force Congress and the executive branch to face up to the problem."
Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, rejected that sentiment, saying, "The only thing that will stop this spending is courage, and courage cannot be legislated into the Constitution."
Mr. Byrd said the "amendment undermines a basic principle underlying our representative democracy: the principle of majority rule." He said its requirement of three-fifths majorities would be an invitation to "gridlock and blackmail."
He also denounced one change that had been made in the Simon amendment to secure votes, a provision that would bar courts from issuing any orders to increase taxes or cut spending. Mr. Byrd said that would either prove ineffective or enable the executive branch to ignore Congress and cut any spending it liked.
 
Lonely Battle
 Only last fall, the amendment seemed likely to pass. But Mr. Byrd, who attacked it almost alone for months and rallied opposition, and Mr. Mitchell, who went after Democrats one by one, worked tirelessly against it.
The substitute amendment, proposed by Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, was an important tactical step toward making opposition easier. It had several loopholes, including guaranteed protection for Social Security, and the Reid alternative made it easier for some senators to vote against the Simon proposal and still tell their constituents they had supported a balanced budget.
Rejected on a 78-to-22 vote, the substitute never had a chance of adoption. But that was not its purpose. As Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, Mr. Simon's chief Republican ally, called it, it was a "hastily contrived fig leaf."

HEADLINE: Japanese Premier May Soon Dismiss Key Adviser

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 1

 BODY:
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was reported today to be ready to expel his chief Cabinet secretary from a crucial policy-making role, a step that is likely to encourage those who want faster changes in the economy and closer ties to the United States.
After seven months of unstable government and several policy zigzags, Mr. Hosokawa was described as being on the verge of ending a longstanding battle within his Government by casting his lot with the conservative. 
 He met today with the leaders of the seven parties and reportedly described the shuffling as an attempt to refocus on important economic issues -- resolving a trade dispute with the United States and jolting the economy out of recession. But few doubt that the real aim is to remove Masayoshi Takemura, the chief Cabinet secretary and once his closest ally.
A Cabinet shuffle would be a major victory for the most conservative thinker in the Government, Ichiro Ozawa, who holds no official post but has been Mr. Hosokawa's key strategist. But the shake-up could drive deeper the wedge that has split the right and left wings, and could complicate the already painful decision-making process.
Mr. Takemura and Mr. Ozawa share Mr. Hosokawa's commitment to cleaning up the electoral system and removing some of the layers of regulation that control the economy. But Mr. Takemura believes in consensus-building and gradual change. Mr. Ozawa, the strongman of the coalition's second-largest party, favors a faster pace and thus has long been seen as a closer ally of the United States.
Mr. Takemura has hinted that the small party he heads might quit the coalition if he is dropped; the Socialists, the coalition's largest party, also oppose a Cabinet shuffle.
Even if the disputed shuffle does not take place, it is clear that Mr. Takemura and his moderate policies have fallen out of favor.
Up to now, the split between Mr. Takemura and Mr. Ozawa has left the Government careering on key issues, leaving all sides fuming.
For instance, early this month Mr. Hosokawa announced a $140 billion stimulus package to lift the economy out of its recession. It included a three-year income-tax reduction and then a large increase in the sales tax to cover the loss in revenue.
The tax proposal, which had been pushed by Mr. Ozawa, brought down a storm of protest and Mr. Hosokawa withdrew it the next day.
Not long afterward, Mr. Hosokawa again took Mr. Ozawa's advice and backed a union of most of the parties in his coalition to create a counterweight to the Liberal Democratic Party, which the coalition ousted last summer after it had held power for 38 years.
But the idea of a two-party system -- a central tenet of Mr. Ozawa's philosophy -- contradicted Mr. Hosokawa's pledge to maintain a multi-party system, which Mr. Takemura supports.
If there has been a motif in Mr. Hosokawa's decisions, it has been to side with the conservative bureaucrats he had vowed to override. Whether the issue was taxes, trade negotiations or deregulation, Mr. Hosokawa has hewed to the demands of the ministries.
"Hosokawa has been relying completely on the bureaucrats," said Takashi Inoguchi, a political scientist at Tokyo University. "It is doubtful that will change."

HEADLINE: Administration Outlines Hopes for Health Savings

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
With its health care plan battered by critics on the left and the right, the Administration tried today to revive interest in the proposal by asserting that every state would save money if Congress approved the plan in precisely the form recommended by President Clinton.
The Administration's estimates are rosier than those by various governors, Republicans and independent researchers. In addition, lawmakers from both parties say Congress will make major changes in the President's plan. 
 The Administration said New York State would save $8.6 billion under the plan, or 9 percent of what it would otherwise spend on Medicaid and certain types of long-term care for disabled people from 1996 to 2000.
In addition, it said, New Jersey would save $3.7 billion, or 19 percent; Connecticut would save $1.2 billion, or 12 percent, and California $6.5 billion, or 11 percent.
 
Doubt About Savings
 Taken together, the Administration said, states would save at least $46 billion, or 8 percent of what they would otherwise spend on health care over the five years.
Richard M. Cook, a health policy adviser to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, disputed the estimates, saying, "We don't believe there will be an $8.6 billion saving for this state." At the most, Mr. Cook said, the President's proposal may save New York $1 billion over five years. But, he warned, such estimates are uncertain because the Clinton plan is "predicated on a model of competition that has not been tested."
Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents 91 hospitals in the metropolitan New York City area, said: "The report is incomplete. It does not show the impact of the President's proposed Medicare cuts, which would be devastating to New York hospitals, especially teaching hospitals."
The study made public today was conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services to show the effects of the Clinton plan on state budgets. Administration officials said they would issue a separate study in several weeks to show the effects on hospitals, doctors and medical schools.
 
Support on One Side
 The Administration's estimates assume that Congress will approve all elements of the Clinton plan and that the cost controls proposed by the President, including Federal regulation of private health insurance premiums, will be 100 percent effective. But lawmakers are not only expecting major changes in the plan; they also say they doubt that the cost controls can slow health spending as much as the Administration says.
Nevertheless, Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors' Association, said: "The Administration's estimates, in the aggregate, are plausible. There would be potential savings for states under the plan as drafted."
Moreover, Mr. Scheppach said, the Administration tried to prevent big cost increases for the states.
Despite these efforts, he said, governors are split about the merits of the Clinton plan. They do not agree on the wisdom of Mr. Clinton's proposal to require employers to provide health insurance for their employees nor do they agree on his proposal for a national health budget, setting limits on spending for a standard package of benefits.
Kenneth E. Thorpe, a deputy assistant secretary of health and human services who supervised the study, said the savings would occur for three reasons.
First, Mr. Thorpe said, many people now enrolled in Medicaid, a Federal-state program for low-income people, would be shifted to private health insurance plans, relieving the states of a large financial burden.
Second, he said, the Federal Government would establish a new program of home care for severely disabled people, substituting Federal money for state financing in many places. And, third, the Clinton plan would reduce state spending on health care for active and retired state employees.
But Gail R. Wilensky, an economist who headed the Federal Health Care Financing Administration under President George Bush, and William Kristol, who was chief of staff for Vice President Dan Quayle, said the estimates were implausible.


GRAPHIC: Administration estimates of savings from President Clinton's health care plan through the year 2000.

HEADLINE: New Economic Data Send Stocks Down

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stock and bond traders pounced on new economic data yesterday, furiously examining the numbers for symptoms of inflation. And when they found them they sold furiously, sending stock prices down and interest rates up sharply.
Both the stock and bond investors assume, with little clear and convincing evidence for now, that a strong economy necessarily carries with it a strong dose of inflation, which would hurt the investment value of bonds, raise the borrowing costs for corporations and thus hurt the price of stocks as well. 
 The markets are also assuming that disquieting inflation news in February, when the economy was chilled by record winter storms and hobbled in California by an earthquake, means even worse inflation news later as the skies clear, California rebuilds, and the economy begins to trot.
 
Signs of Renewed Inflation
 And so when both stock and bond traders saw signs of renewed inflation yesterday in the report from the nation's purchasing managers, they did not like it. The 30-year bond,, one benchmark for fixed-income securities, leaped to yields not seen since June 1993 and the Standard & Poor's 500 receded to a price level not seen since December 1993.
Interest rate-sensitive companies like Travelers Inc., the big insurance company, economically sensitive companies like Monsanto, the chemical processor, oil companies like Chevron, and utilities like Pacific Gas and Electric were all hurt.
On Monday, the bond market had rallied on what it saw as a sign of declining or stable prices in the Chicago purchasing managers' report, carrying most of the stock market, except for the Dow Jones industrial average.
But yesterday, the 30-year bond was down 115/32 at 93 5/16 , with a yield of 6.77 percent. The Dow dropped 22.79 points, to 3,809.23, while the broader S.& P. 500 dropped 2.70 points, to 464.44. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index, which has outperformed larger companies so far this year, fell 3.86 points, to 788.64.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite index fell 1.42 points, to 257.81, on moderately heavy volume of 304.5 million shares. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks, 1,449 to 716. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 1.38 points, to 469.96.
The turning point in market psychology this year was the quarter-point rate increase by the Federal Reserve Board on Feb. 4, which bond traders seem to want the Fed to do again to assure them that the central bank will stamp out inflation. The hapless stock market, which mirrored the rise in interest rates with its own selling, is moving defensively so big portfolio managers will not be too embarrassed when they report quarterly performance figures.
"The bond market wants the Fed to move more aggressively, meaning a 25-basis-point rise is no more than a token," said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Chemical Securities Inc., referring to the increase on Feb. 4. "But the stock market wishes Greenspan hadn't had the idea in the first place." Mr. Lieberman's reference was to Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
Bond prices only dipped yesterday after the early morning report of a revised gross domestic product -- 7.5 percent, instead of the expected high of 7.0 percent. The positive surprise in the data was that inflation was very low in the last quarter of 1993 despite the strongest growth in 10 years.
But it seemed that bond and stock investors ignored this positive price news to focus their anxieties on a big rise in the February price index from the National Association of Purchasing Management, a trade group of corporate buyers.
Bond traders put faith in the index, despite its flaws. The purchasing managers' index rose to 67 percent, the highest since October 1990. But historically, changes in the index have shown little predictive power for wholesale and consumer prices.
And the February index can be produced so quickly (the month ended on Monday) because it simply asks manufacturers whether prices rose, not by how much or whether the increases were in economically important products or services.
The stock market has still far to go to complete the widely expected "correction." Elaine Garzarelli, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, has said she expected a price drop of up to 7 percent following the Fed's Feb. 4 interest-rate rise. That would imply a Dow of about 3,690, an S.& P. 500 of about 447, and a Nasdaq index of about 742.

HEADLINE: Trying to Produce Doctors With a Sensitive Touch And a Grasp of Economics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW HYDE PARK, L.I., Feb. 28

 BODY:
For their clinical education course at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, the five young doctors had just completed an eight-hour shift working as nurses and they still sounded a little shellshocked, sitting around a conference room table, discussing what they had learned.
"You see the effects of all these blood tests we doctors order," said Dr. Pierre Herard, who spent the day hunting clean bed pans, untangling patients snagged in intravenous tubes and waiting for countless blood test results from the hospital laboratory. "And I realize, sometimes we doctors order all these blood tests and we don't even check them." 
 "Sometimes?" said Ann Marie Sanna, a nurse.
"A lot of the times," Dr. Herard said.
"A lot of interns feel a drive to take blood every morning," said Dr. David Gamburg, an intern himself. "In fact, I have felt that drive."
Tagging along with nurses, the interns are forced to notice the work, time and expense that goes into the batteries of tests that they routinely order, often with little thought to cost. They noticed the patients' arms, black and blue from being pricked so often.
"When my grandmother was in the hospital," Dr. Gamburg said, "I confronted the intern: 'Why did you take so much blood?' Couldn't give me a reason. You get 7 tubes with 7 c.c.'s -- 50 c.c.'s a day. Finally they have a reason. The poor patient's anemic!"
The day with the nurses is part of a new academic program at Long Island Jewish, aimed at turning out a revolutionary new breed of doctors -- sensitive to patients and nurses and aggressive about holding down hospital costs.
 
Cost Cards for Doctors
 Dr. Steven Walerstein, the program director, frequently reminds his interns that a series of 20 blood tests, ordered daily for a patient by most doctors, costs $35, when often, all that is needed is a test for the blood's four electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate) for $19. This year, for the first time, the 39 first-year doctors doing their residency in internal medicine all carry a small card in the pockets of their white coats that lists the comparative costs of the most common intravenous antibiotics.
Efforts to make young doctors more cost-conscious are hardly new, but as the debate over national medical costs intensifies, education programs like the one at the Long Island hospital are spreading and growing more formalized. For the last three years at the University of Minnesota, interns in the family practice program have been required to spend two weeks with the business manager of a clinic to learn about the costs of medical services and the economic pressures fostering a greater reliance on outpatient care.
This spring at Georgetown University, interns will compile their own list of cost-effective medications and then prescribe from that list. "Instead of just handing them a list, this forces them to balance the effectiveness of the medications with their cost," said Dr. Kevin Schulman, director of the school's clinical economics research unit.
At Long Beach Memorial Medical Center in California, family practice interns pose as patients and are checked into the hospital for a day, complete with fake diagnoses and fake casts. "They're poked and probed and they see the bill," said Ron Yukelson, a hospital spokesman. "Ninety-five percent of them have never been a hospital patient, and this is a chance to show them how to walk in the patients' slippers."
This year the hospital plans to conduct a mock malpractice trial to teach interns the importance of proper documentation on patients' charts.
"This is just beginning in a formal way in many places and will become much more prevalent," said Dr. Jordan Cohen, the incoming president of the Association of American Medical Colleges. "A lot more medical training programs will be doing these kinds of things very soon."
Dr. William Jacott, vice chairman of the American Medical Association's Board of Trustees, said many intern programs now put the daily cumulative bill on a patient's hospital chart to expose young doctors to treatment costs. "They see the impact of ordering blood gases every four hours instead of twice daily," he said.
Whether training medical students to be more cost-conscious will actually produce more cost-conscious doctors is another matter. Dr. John Eisenberg, chairman of medicine at Georgetown University, is skeptical. "You can teach them in medical school and then they go out on their own where cost-consciousness is not practiced, and that's the end of it," he said. "The question isn't how many medical programs; it's whether they make a difference."
Last fall, in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Eisenberg published a review of studies conducted in the last decade that had tried to change doctors' medical practices. "My conclusion is that education alone usually doesn't work," he said.
But the directors of the program at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center point out that this is not a matter of educational altruism; there are growing financial pressures. In the last decade most insurance companies have gone from compensating the hospital for each test to providing a flat fee according to the diagnosis.
"In a pneumonia case, we'll get a standard fee," Dr. Walerstein said. "If the person's in for four days and gets the minimal blood work and X-rays necessary, the hospital makes money; if it's two weeks, thousands of X-rays, thousands of blood tests, you lost money."
 
Pressure on the Interns
 A hospital has a limited ability to control the diagnostic practices of the veteran attending physicians who have offices in the community and visit the wards to see their patients on daily rounds; but a hospital has a good deal of sway over its medical interns and their practices, and that is where the push is coming.
"I think we're beginning to change the culture," said Dr. David Dantzker, acting president of Long Island Jewish. At his daily 7:30 A.M. meeting with senior interns to discuss the previous day's admissions, Dr. Dantzker constantly probes them on cost-effectiveness. At a meeting today, when an intern suggested a second battery of tests for a patient, a colleague commented, "Hillary's not going to like that."
Dr. Walerstein believes the Clinton health care plan and the spread of managed care make these young doctors more receptive than their predecessors. "As managed care penetrates the market, these companies will track their physicians," Dr. Walerstein said. "If Dr. A's cost for hypertension care is regularly 20 percent higher than Dr. B's, Dr. A may find himself out of the program. Our trainees understand it's in their interest to be cost-effective."
The hospital's revamped advanced clinical skills program for internal medicine offers cost-analysis classes in diagnosing respiratory problems, urinary infections and lower back pain. Dr. Walerstein has interns pull out their pocket price lists and explains that they can often treat a bacterial infection of the urinary track with gentamicin for $21.55 a day, instead of ticarcillin/clavulanate at $100 a day.
The course advocates using traditional diagnostic methods when possible, as opposed to performing high-tech tests. "We have produced a generaton of trained physicians that feels insecure without technology," Dr. Walerstein said. "Instead of listening to a lung and saying it sounds the same as yesterday, they need a test to confirm. It's become a practice to order blood tests every day just to see the stupid numbers that don't mean anything."
The program promotes the idea that the humanistic approach can pay financial dividends. "If they spend 15 extra minutes talking to a patient with lower back pain," Dr. Walerstein said, "they may learn he's going through several personal stresses in his life that explain the pain -- and save expensive diagnostic tests."
One reason for spending the day with a nurse -- a program originated at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine in 1989 -- is to show the intern how much more nurses talk to patients than doctors.
"I noticed the patients speak to the nurses differently; there's more closeness," Dr. Mani Ushyarov, one of the first-year interns, said at the end of his nurse shift. "It's like the doctor's not a part of the family."
Dr. Gamburg said: "We all know the tricks to avoid talking to a patient. You say to the patient, 'Don't talk right now; let me examine your lungs. Don't talk right now; let me take your pulse.' The nurses can't escape the way we do."
Nor could the young doctors during their day as nurses. Dr. Isidore Miah fed an elderly woman breakfast and lunch. Dr. Calvin Pan changed a woman's diaper twice in 10 minutes.
A half dozen times, Dr. Herard untangled the feet of the patient in room 430 from the intravenous tubes. As Dr. Herard crawled around the floor chatting with the patient, his nurse-partner for the day, Eileen Fitzgerald, listened from the hall. "He's good with the patients," Mrs. Fitzgerald said. "You don't always see that."

HEADLINE: Flake and His Church Agree to Repay Federal Money

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
In a settlement to a civil suit brought by the Justice Department, Representative Floyd H. Flake and the church he heads in Jamaica, Queens, have agreed to repay $530,000 in Federal money that the government had claimed was improperly used to help build a church school.
With interest dating to 1982, when construction on the school started, the repayment will add up to $925,000. 
 The settlement is the latest chapter of a case that began when the Department of Housing and Urban Development provided loans to help build a senior-citizen housing project sponsored by the Allen A.M.E. Church, which the congressman serves as pastor.
 
First Amendment at Issue
 The alleged misuse of the money to build a community center connected to the church school came to light at the time Mr. Flake and his wife, Margaret Elaine, were indicted on Federal tax-evasion and embezzlement charges. In April 1991, the tax case was dismissed for lack of evidence.
The settlement of the civil suit, first reported yesterday in New York Newsday, includes no admission of wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Flake or the church.
"We are a church that has been at the forefront of economic development, education and housing in the community," Mr. Flake, a Democrat, said yesterday, "and as we continue into our next phase it was incumbent upon us to get this matter behind us so that we can move forward."
The repayment, in 48 monthly installments, is to be made by Mr. Flake and the church to the Allen A.M.E. Housing Development Corporation, the church-sponsored organization that built the senior-citizens housing project.
Mr. Flake contended yesterday that it was proper to use the money to build a community center connected to the school because the center served the general public.
But Robert Begleiter, chief of the civil division in the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District, said, "It was for the purposes of the church school, and there happens to be something called the First Amendment." The First Amendment, among other things, stipulates the separation of church and state.
 
Prosecution Was Defeated
 Mr. Flake's congressional chief of staff, Edwin Reed, said the money used to build the community center became available because "they brought the housing project in on time and under budget."
"When we set up the corporation for the multiservice community center, we set it up as the Allen Christian School," Mr. Reed said. "That was the mistake." The center provides space for community meetings and services, he said, but classes for the school are also held there.
When the use of the money for the center was discovered, Mr. Flake persuaded officials in the regional Housing and Urban Development office to forgive the misspending. That decision was later rescinded.
On April 3, 1991, at the request of prosecutors, all the criminal charges of tax evasion and embezzlement against Mr. Flake were dismissed in Federal court in Brooklyn. The case ended after three weeks of trial in a complete defeat for the prosecution.
The Flakes had been charged with not reporting $177,578 of income from two sources that they deposited in a ministerial expenses fund. The Government charged that the money was used to buy such "personal" items as jewelry, clothing, toys and a life insurance policy.
One source of those funds, prosecutors said, was a "parsonage allowance." The other was a program to transport elderly residents of the housing complex to shopping centers and elsewhere.
Jurors interviewed after the dismissal said that the Government's case was weak and was undermined by its own witnesses.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Helps Neediest Cases Rest on a High Note

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
With a push in the final days from several Wall Street firms, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund ended its annual appeal on Monday with the second-best campaign in its 82-year history.
The fund raised $4,590,568.69 from nearly 13,500 contributors during the three-month drive. The donations will help seven social-service agencies feed, house and provide medical care to tens of thousands of poor New Yorkers. 
 While the number of contributors declined from the previous year by about 500, those who did give reached deeper, allowing this year's drive to exceed the 1992-93 total.
 
Wall Street Comes Through
 "We are delighted that a surge of donations from readers in the last few days enabled our drive to finish on such a high note," said Arthur Gelb, the president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund. "And on behalf of the seven benefiting charities, we thank those who contributed so generously. There were fewer donors this year, but many of those who did contribute gave more than in previous years, and some gave two and three times to make sure that the campaign would not lag behind last year."
The appeal surpassed the 1992-93 drive, which raised $4,469,034.47, with the help of contributors at 13 Wall Street firms, who gave checks and cash last week worth more than $135,000, a 70 percent increase over their gift the year before. This year's appeal was second only to the 1991-92 campaign, which raised $5,083,550.81.
As in the past, The Times paid the campaign's overhead costs so that all the money was given directly to the social service agencies, which provide such services as emergency rent help for those in danger of eviction and vocational training for mentally ill former drug abusers.
The money has been used to find safe, clean shelters for homeless families, like Jerome Crawford and Melonie Owens, who lost their apartment last year and moved with their three children into Pelham Fritz Apartments, a residence operated by the Children's Aid Society in East Harlem. The center provides apartments for 33 homeless families and helps them find permanent housing.
In mid-December, after staying three months at the shelter, Mr. Crawford and Ms. Owens moved into their own four-bedroom apartment a few blocks away.
The money has also been used to buy furniture for families who previously slept on the floor, to provide medical exams for thousands of children, to give Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners to the hungry and to help immigrants and the newly unemployed negotiate the maze of the city's human resources system.
In addition to monetary support, the attention the appeal brought to the plight of some of the most indigent cases also had an effect. Three men who had been out of work for more than a year because of the economic downturn found jobs after their stories were told in articles and employers called.
 
Publisher Is Proved Right
 The appeal was started in 1912 by The Times's publisher, Adolph S. Ochs, who reasoned that if the newspaper's readers knew about the suffering around them, they would be eager to help. Contributors from New York and around the world have proved him right, collectively increasing their giving nearly every year. The initial appeal received 117 gifts totaling $3,630.88. In 1970-71, the fund passed the $1 million mark, in 1983-84 it passed the $2 million mark and in 1988-89 it raised more than $4 million for the first time.
All donations received after Monday will be credited toward next year's appeal, which will begin on Thanksgiving Day.

HEADLINE: Jean Gottman, 78, a Geographer Who Saw a Northeast Megalopolis

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS 

 BODY:
Dr. Jean Gottmann, the French geographer who scrutinized the Northeastern Corridor of the United States and defined it as a new social, economic and political entity he called Megalopolis, died on Monday at his home in Oxford, England. He was 78.
The cause was cancer said his wife, Bernice. 
 During the 1950's, Dr. Gottmann conducted a landmark four-year study of the Northeast under the auspices of the Twentieth Century Fund. His report became a model for examinations of smaller but similar regions.
His first view of the area's future was optimistic.
In the study, published in 1961 as "Megalopolis: The Urbanized Northeastern Seaboard of the United States," Dr. Gottmann concluded that the area "was the cradle of a new order in the organization of inhabited space." It was almost 600 miles long and at the time had 30 million inhabitants.
At the time, he said, Megalopolis stretched from just north of Boston to just south of Washington, had gained many characteristics of a single city and had become pre-eminent in the policies, arts, communications and economy of the United States.
In spite of fears for the future of Megalopolis expressed by city planners, Dr. Gottmann said the area's future was bright in part because it had an "extremely distinguished population" that was "the richest, best-educated, best-housed and best-serviced group of similar size in the world."
Dr. Gottmann used the term Megalopolis in defining the region, a word he credited to ancient Greeks who coined it for a newly founded city intended to be their largest. The city never fulfilled those aspirations, but Dr. Gottmann retrieved the long lost name for modern usage.
Dr. Gottmann's four-year examination was the fruit of 20 years of thought and study of human and economic geography, which led to his initial, generally optimistic, view of the region.
 
Optimism Wanes
 But in a retrospective in 1975, Dr. Gottmann was to take a more cautious view. He said that many large and growing American and foreign cities were faced with challenges that had not been foreseen. Among them were the unexpected demand for social services in the midst of shrinking employment prospects and increasing human stress.
"Local government powers and planning theory in general are not adapted to deal with the entanglements of the new situation," he wrote. "The city becomes a mosaic of diverse but poorly adjusted pieces, offering more contrasts than harmony. The present mutation of American cities reflects the dynamics of a society in search of new structures and a new ethic."
Dr. Gottmann began his academic career at the University of Paris, where he received a doctorate in geography. During World War II he taught at Johns Hopkins University, returning to France after the war to teach at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes, an affiliate of the Sorbonne.
In the 1950's he was also a member of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton.
Among his other books were "A Geography of Europe" (1951) and "Virginia at Mid-Century" (1955), the latter written under the auspices of the Mellon Foundation.
After leaving the University of Paris he became a professor of geography and the head of the department of geography at the University of Oxford. He retired in 1983.
He is survived by his wife.

HEADLINE: G.D.P. Up at 7.5% Pace In Last Quarter of '93

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The Government reported today that the economy lunged ahead at a 7.5 percent annual pace in the final quarter of 1993, the strongest performance in nearly 10 years, but most economists stuck to the view that growth has already slowed in the new year and that the risk of revived inflation remains low.
In sharply raising its late January estimate of a 5.9 percent rate of expansion in gross domestic product -- the nation's total output of goods and services -- the Commerce Department said much of the revision resulted from a jump in exports. The Government, however, did not expect exports to continue at their fourth-quarter pace, given the weak economies of American trading partners. 
 The revision to a 7.5 percent growth rate, the fastest since a 7.9 percent burst in the first quarter of 1984 when the economy was emerging from the 1981-1982 recession, lifted the economy's growth for the full year to 3 percent, from the 2.9 percent that had been announced a month ago.
It compared with advances at a rate of 2.9 percent in the third quarter, 1.9 percent in the second quarter and a scant eight-tenths of 1 percent for the January-March period last year during which Bill Clinton was inaugurated as President.
While investors reacted calmly to the revised G.D.P. report, later in the day stocks tumbled and interest rates rose on a report from corporate purchasing managers that showed prices in the industrial sector were firming.
But neither report did much to alter the view of most analysts that the economy is settling back into a more sustainable growth rate of about 3 percent.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said one reason the economy was likely to slacken from its sizzling fourth-quarter pace was that trading partners who remained in recession would be unable to maintain their purchases of American exports, which jumped $2 billion in December and accounted for half the increase.
The Clinton Administration was restrained in its assessment of today's batch of economic data, which also included January declines of 3 percent in sales of previously owned homes and of 1.2 percent in spending on construction. Both were held back by weather.
At a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.22 million, home sales were still the second highest on record, while the fall in construction, to $505.5 billion, was the first since April.
"We believe the economy will continue to grow this year in the neighborhood of 3 percent," said a senior official who appeared in the White House briefing room under ground rules that she not be identified.
What traders seized on at a time of hypersensitivity to signs of possible higher inflation was the latest survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management, a group of corporate shoppers. The survey's price index climbed to 67 percent last month, the highest since 1990, from 59.8 percent in January.
Yet the market response, some suggested, may have been overdone, since the Federal Reserve seemed unlikely to be much swayed either by the G.D.P. report, which covers a quarter that ended two months ago and which provided reassuring inflation figures, or by the purchasing managers' survey, which the Fed may have already anticipated when it raised short-term term interest rates on Feb. 4.
Indeed, close scrutiny of the purchasing survey showed only 28 percent of respondents paying higher prices last month, the same proportion as in January. The only change was a shift of five percentage points from the "lower prices" category to the category of managers, now 66 percent, who said prices neither rose nor fell.
 
Weather Played a Role
 The survey is intended to reflect the breadth of inflation, not its intensity, observed Kevin Logan, an economist at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. Moreover, like various other indicators of late, the survey was no doubt affected by severe winter weather. The price of rock salt, for example, is said to have tripled or quadrupled in some places.
Besides the trade sector, which was revised upward by $11.5 billion at an annual rate, G.D.P. also benefited from an extra $4.7 billion in spending on personal consumption, the report showed.
Recovery from last summer's floods in the Midwest and drought in the Southeast added at least four-tenths of a percentage point to the fourth-quarter expansion, the department said.
Besides an expected slowdown this year in exports to Europe and Japan, which some analysts predict will be offset by increased sales to Latin America and elsewhere, the economy is seen as being held back this year by continued sluggish growth in incomes, by the effect of higher taxes on the free-spending wealthy and by monetary and fiscal policies that are at least modestly restrictive.
 
An Inflation Gauge
 Today's report also showed that the department's price index for gross domestic purchases rose at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter, one-tenth of a point higher than estimated last month.
G.D.P. expressed in current dollars, rather than in constant 1987 dollars, jumped at an 8.8 percent rate in last year's final quarter, up from an initial estimate of 7.4 percent. Based on the fourth-quarter data, the annualized G.D.P. was $6.532 trillion in current dollars, and $5.232 trillion in 1987 dollars.
The purchasing managers' report, based on a survey of executives at more than 300 industrial companies, showed that while the manufacturing sector expanded for the sixth straight month in February, growth of the overall economy slackened. The group's overall index was at 56.6 percent last month, down from 57.7 in January; anything over 44.5 percent indicates an economic expansion.
"The economy continued to grow in February although at a slightly lower rate than in January," said Robert J. Bretz, head of the association's business survey committee. While weather problems "clearly contributed" to the slowdown, he added, growth in new orders and order backlogs "definitely was less."
Data included in the gross domestic product for the fourth quarter of 1993 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

Rates Climb on Report Of Inflation Pressures

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Interest rates climbed to their highest level in almost a year yesterday as investors sold on economic data that bore evidence of inflationary pressures building in the economy.
The selloff came after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its price index climbed in February to its highest point since 1990. The report rekindled speculation that the Federal Reserve would move again on short-term interest rates as it did on Feb. 4. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 115/32 , to 935/16 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 6.77 percent, from 6.65 percent on Monday, and was the highest since June 1993. For bondholders, that meant a loss of $12.31 for every $1,000 bond.
Short maturities also came under pressure yesterday. The three-month Treasury bill rate rose 9 basis points, to 3.49 percent, the highest since July 1992. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Although traders and analysts attributed the selloff to the purchasing management report, many thought the market's reaction was overdone.
"The N.A.P.M. index shows only the market's direction of prices, not how far they are going," said Joseph Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg Securities in New York. "But the market is reacting to them as if they are hugely higher."
 
Positions Examined
 Larry Daly, senior vice president and senior portfolio manager for the Global Investment Trust for Putnam Investments, said the market might be approaching an oversold position.
Mr. Daly who saw just as much weakness in the overseas markets for Treasury bonds yesterday, said people were re-evaluating their positions in the markets after having misinterpreted the amount of tightening needed to ease market concern about inflation.
"Not happy with the size of the Fed's last interest rate hike, the market is now wondering if instead the Fed shouldn't have made a larger move," he said. "Their concern is that small moves will only lag behind the market, instead of getting ahead of it."
Joseph V. Battipaglia, managing director of Sterling Advisors, a division of Gruntal & Company, said low interest rates were more of a crutch than market watchers had believed. "So when the reasons for low rates are removed, it creates enormous volatility and each bit of news raises concern," he said.
 
Another Increase Seen
 Mr. Battipaglia said comments by Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, left little doubt that there would be another increase in short-term rates. Mr. Parry said it was unlikely that one step was going to be enough, and "that added some fuel to the fire," Mr. Battipaglia said.
The next closely watched economic report, February unemployment, is scheduled to be released on Friday.
Analysts say that any tightening by the Fed will now be an admission that inflation is an immediate problem, and would prompt another selloff.
But Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, does not see inflation as a threat yet. "The Fed's job is to prevent any potential overheating of the economy that will produce inflationary pressures in 1995 and 1996," he said.
Mr. Fine said that if the central bank continued to move in increments of a quarter-point, it might not be enough to curb inflation. He expects the Fed will increase the Federal funds rate to 3.50 percent from 3.25 in the near future.

HEADLINE: Mafia Defector Says He Lost His Faith

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
Facing the twin perils of an underworld death threat and a 30-year prison sentence, Anthony Accetturo defected as the top Lucchese crime family leader in New Jersey to become a Government witness because, he says, the Mafia's current bosses have discarded the secret society's traditional principles.
"The new generation that is running things threw all the old rules out the window," said Mr. Accetturo in an interview Monday in a northern New Jersey prison where he is being held in a witness protection wing. "The key word is greed. All they care about is money, not honor." 
 After a lifetime of avoiding Federal convictions on major felonies, Mr. Accetturo, 55, was convicted in August on New Jersey charges that he was the leader of an organized-crime faction and on charges of racketeering and extortion. Two weeks later, while awaiting a minimum sentence of 30 years and a maximum of 60 years, he agreed to cooperate with the New Jersey Attorney General's office, where, not coincidentally, a boyhood friend works.
 
A Mafia History
 Law-enforcement experts on the Mafia say that Mr. Accetturo's 35-year voyage from a $75-a-week apprentice to the highest rungs of the Lucchese family and his ultimate downfall as a mob chief encapsulates the turbulent modern history of most of the nation's Mafia groups.
Although several higher-ranking Mafia members have defected and testified at criminal trials in the last decade, Mr. Accetturo is the first major turncoat from the New York area to be publicly interviewed.
The interview, in the presence of three members of the New Jersey Attorney General's office, was conducted on the condition imposed by prosecutors that The New York Times would not identify the prison in which Mr. Accetturo was being held.
 
The Path of Opportunity
 A portly, moon-faced man, 5 feet 9 inches tall and 220 pounds, Mr. Accetturo smiled frequently and responded freely during most of the 80-minute interview. He said that as a young man, growing up in Orange, N.J., and in Newark, he was was drawn to a life in the Mafia because he had few other economic opportunities. He asserted that in the blue-collar Sicilian-American neighborhoods of the 1950's and 1960's, acceptance into the Mafia was viewed by many of his contemporaries as "an honorable and respected thing, like a dream, like some people want to become a doctor."
Sicilian Mafia groups and their parallel organizations in America have long referred to themselves as the honorable or honored society and as Cosa Nostra, Sicilian for Our Thing.
Portraying his leadership role in the Lucchese family as that of a benevolent businessman, Mr. Accetturo claimed that he merely sought to enrich himself and his confederates and that he had avoided violence.
However, on the orders of Melaine B. Campbell, a New Jersey deputy attorney general who observed the interview, he refused to answer questions about murders he had participated in or sanctioned. Law-enforcement officials familiar with information gleaned from Mr. Accetturo said he has admitted knowledge of conspiracies that led to at least 13 slayings.
At his trial on racketeering charges this summer, Mr. Accetturo was acquitted of a charge that he authorized the 1984 murder of Vincent Craparotta, a Lucchese associate suspected of withholding payoffs to family leaders from an extortion plot. No other charge involving a killing has ever been brought against Mr. Accetturo.
Heeding an admonition from Ms. Campbell, Mr. Accetturo also declined to specify the payments he accumulated as a crime boss from secret holdings in companies, how much the Lucchese family made from illicit gambling, loan-sharking, extortion and labor racketeering, and how the money was laundered.
"Let's just say it was multimillion-dollar business," Mr. Accetturo said, his brown eyes twinkling. "In the best times, I had a six-figure income from legal businesses and I never had to apply for food stamps."
Born in 1938, Mr. Accetturo said he dropped out of school after completing the sixth grade. His father, a butcher in Orange, and his mother, a seamstress, placed little value in traditional education, he said.
At the age of 16, Mr. Accetturo began living with relatives in Newark, and he said he became the leader there of a West Side gang of 50 to 60 teen-agers. Because he was a ferocious street fighter, Mr. Accetturo said he acquired the nickname Tumac, based on the caveman hero of the 1940 movie "One Million B.C."
At the age of 17, Anthony (Ham) Dolasco, a Lucchese family soldier, or "made" member, aware of Mr. Accetturo's tough-guy reputation, recruited him to work in an illegal gambling and loan-sharking organization.
"I came up with the old mustaches," Mr. Accetturo said, referring to a Mafia term for guarded, unflamboyant gangsters. "They didn't talk, you had to use your mind and street sense to figure out things. Whatever they told you was only on a need to know basis."
Mr. Dolasco, according to Mr. Accetturo, ran the largest numbers racket in Newark in the 1960's. When he died in the late 1960's, Mr. Accetturo was put in charge of the operation.
According to Mr. Accetturo, the Lucchese family prohibited the induction of new soldiers from the early 1960's until the mid 1970's, trying to maintain secrecy and prevent law-enforcement infiltration. Although he ran several rackets for the family for almost a decade, Mr. Accetturo said it was 1976 when he formally took the Mafia oath of omerta, the swearing of loyalty and secrecy.
 
Saint's Picture Is Burned
 He said that Joseph Abate of Margate, N.J., who was the head of the Lucchese family in New Jersey in the 1960's and early 1970's, and Michael Pappadio, a Lucchese soldier, drove him to a house in New York City for a meeting with Anthony (Ducks) Corallo, then the boss of the family. At a simple ceremony, he said, a picture of a saint was burned and he intoned: "May I burn in hell like this saint if I betray my friends."
For Mr. Accetturo, the induction "was the greatest honor of my life."
Reflecting on his activities in the Lucchese family, Mr. Accetturo said that like most Mafia members and their associates, he flourished in the 1960's and 1970's. Many law-enforcement officials acknowledge that feeble law-enforcement efforts from the 1930's through the 1970's generally failed to check the growth of the nation's 20 or so crime families.
The nation's five largest organized-crime groups -- the Lucchese, Gambino, Genovese, Colombo and Bonanno families -- originated in New York City and operate throughout the metropolitan region. The Lucchese family is the only one, law-enforcement experts say, that had three semi-independent factions: Brooklyn-Queens and Long Island, Manhattan-Bronx and New Jersey.
Mr. Accetturo, who had a home in Livingston, N.J., moved to Hollywood, Fla., in 1970 to avoid testifying before the New Jersey State Investigation Commission.
He said that Mr. Corallo had effectively put him in charge of the New Jersey faction in the early 1970's even before his formal induction and that he was named a capo soon after taking the oath of omerta. At most, he said, the "made" members of the Lucchese group in New Jersey numbered 20, but more than 100 associates worked for him. He used a trusted aide, Michael Taccetta, as his street boss in New Jersey, communicating with him by telephone and at meetings in New York City.
 
Juror Was Bribed
 "In them days, we were disciplined and coordinated," he said. "The other guys weren't," he added, referring to law-enforcement agencies.
The equations began to change in the 1980's and the indictments came thick and fast, Mr. Accetturo said. In 1985 he and 19 other Lucchese members and associates were indicted in Newark on Federal racketeering and narcotics trafficking charges.
All 20 defendants were acquitted in 1988 but last September, Mr. Taccetta admitted bribing a juror in the trial. Mr. Accetturo, in the interview, declined to say if had known about the bribe and possible jury tampering.
After the 1988 acquittal, Mr. Accetturo was imprisoned for 20 months for refusing to testify before the New Jersey Investigation Commission.
Further trouble for Mr. Accetturo emerged when a life sentence was imposed on Mr. Corallo after his conviction in New York on Federal racketeering charges in 1987. In 1988, Vittorio Amuso replaced Mr. Corallo as boss of the Lucchese family and he named Anthony Casso as underboss.
Mr. Amuso and Mr. Casso, Mr. Accetturo said, began cutting into his independence and demanded larger shares of the loot than Mr. Corallo had taken. Mr. Corallo, he insisted, rarely asked for more than $10,000 a year while the new bosses wanted almost every penny raked in by the New Jersey faction.
He said that when he resisted, Mr. Amuso and Mr. Casso also put out a contract to kill him and his son, Anthony Jr., falsely claiming that he "was a rat."
"They had no training, no honor," Mr. Accetturo said of Mr. Amuso and Mr. Casso. "All they want to do is, kill, kill, get what you can, even if you didn't earn it."
Mr. Amuso, 58, was convicted in 1992 on Federal racketeering and murder charges and sentenced to life imprisonment. Mr. Casso, 52, will go on trial later this month in Brooklyn on Federal racketeering and murder charges.
Mr. Accetturo said state prosecutors had made no promises of a possible reduced sentence for his cooperation and possible testimony at criminal trials. But his sentencing has been postponed and prosecutors said that the extent of his cooperation would be made known to the sentencing judge. (New Jersey law-enforcement officials, who spoke when granted anonymity, said that Mr. Accetturo had given them a wealth of information, including details of secret Lucchese family holdings in construction companies and real-estate development projects in New Jersey, North Carolina and Florida.)
Switching sides, Mr. Accetturo said, was eased somewhat by the presence of Robert T. Buccino, deputy chief of a unit in the attorney general's office that has been on his trail for last eight years. Mr. Accetturo and Mr. Buccino were boyhood friends in Orange.
Claiming he was remorseful about his criminal activities, Mr. Accetturo said he wanted to warn potential Mafia recruits that the organization "is no longer an honorable secret society, there is no glamour like in the movies and most of the families are becoming street gangs."
"Either you wind up in the can, your life finished like me, or dead," he said.

HEADLINE: Banks May Pay Fees to Be Regulated

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen proposed today to pay for the consolidation of bank regulatory agencies by charging Federal examination fees to large state-chartered institutions like Chemical Bank and the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.
The Administration plan, put forward by the Treasury Department today to the Senate Banking Committee, would collect $50 million a year from these banks, said Frank N. Newman, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance. 
 It would create a single Federal banking agency that would take over most of the bank-supervision responsibilities of the Federal Reserve, which now examines many of the big state-chartered banks, but does not charge them fees for doing so. The proposed agency would also replace the Treasury Department in regulating banks and savings and loans, and would take over most regulatory responsibilities of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as well.
 
Origins of System
 The nation's dual banking system, with Federal and state charters, evolved in the 19th century. The two kinds of charters are quite similar now except for differences in examination fees. State and Federal charters have gone in and out of fashion in the past, depending on the toughness of regulation. Once a bank chooses a charter, it is difficult to change it.
The Treasury Department oversees Federal-chartered banks and charges them fees that would be reduced under the proposed agency to the extent that the consolidation of agencies saved money, Mr. Newman said. He estimated the savings at $150 million to $200 million a year, but the Federal Reserve and the Congressional Budget Office have questioned whether significant savings could be realized.
The description of fees was the only new element in Mr. Bentsen's plan, which he presented today to Banking Committee. Several Republican senators said that before legislation could pass, the Treasury Department would have to resolve its differences with the Federal Reserve, which is strenuously resisting the plan, saying it reduces its ability to keep watch on economic activity across the nation as it sets interest rates.
Banking lobbyists criticized the planned fees today, contending that Fed-regulated banks already pay indirectly for examination because they are required to deposit money at the Fed that earns no interest.
Mr. Newman told reporters after the hearing that banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System derive a variety of benefits from membership, so their zero-interest accounts at the Fed should not be considered an unofficial exam fee.
 
Republican Comment
 Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, suggested that the Administration's enthusiasm for trimming the Fed's powers might be partly motivated by a desire to help the largest bank company in Arkansas, the Worthen Banking Corporation, and its largest stockholders, the Stephens family. The bank and its ties to the Stephenses have been under investigation by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for more than a year. Worthen lent more than $2 million to the Clinton Presidential campaign, and the Stephens empire led early fund-raising.
Part of the inquiry involves filings with the Fed by the Rose law firm, where Hillary Rodham Clinton used to be a partner.
The Treasury's consolidation of regulatory authority would take the Arkansas bank and hundreds of other banks out from under the Fed's oversight.
Mr. Bentsen responded that he was unaware of any link between Worthen and the Administration's proposal. He said the White House had played little role in developing bank regulatory policy.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Clinton to Reinstate Power to Move Fast On Japan Sanctions

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
President Clinton has decided to sign an executive order reinstating his broad legal authority to impose trade sanctions on Tokyo quickly, an action that the Japanese have warned would mark an escalation in the brewing trade conflict between the two countries.
Senior Administration officials said the President had accepted the recommendation from his economic advisers and had asked his National Economic Council to meet tonight to decide when the order should be signed and what elements it should contain. An official announcement is expected soon. 
 Since the United States broke off trade talks with Japan two weeks ago after Tokyo refused to accept American demands for numerical indicators to show whether or not it was opening its markets, the Clinton Administration has been considering measures to compel Japan to open markets for insurance, telecommunications, autos and medical equipment.
Administration and Congressional officials said that after considerable debate, a majority of the President's National Economic Council -- headed by Robert E. Rubin and including Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen; Secretary of State Warren Christopher; Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown; the trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich -- recommended to the President last week that he reinstate by executive order the "Super 301" trade retaliation mechanism.
This would be the trade equivalent of locking and loading a rifle, but without pulling the trigger. The hope among American officials would be that just that ominous sound would get the Japanese to agree to some market-opening initiatives before they are actually named under Super 301.
Some analysts argue that putting such a powerful weapon into place could mark a dangerous increase in United States-Japan trade tensions. But that view did not prevail with the President, who sided with those officials who believe that only credible threats will get Japan to lower its trade barriers. These officials said the President still intended to move cautiously and simply signing the executive order did not mean that he would use it against Japan immediately, although it sends an obvious signal to Tokyo.
Super 301 is a lapsed provision passed by Congress in 1988. It requires the United States trade representative to identify the countries that maintain the most egregious trade barriers and to initiate what are known as "Super 301 cases" to eliminate those barriers. Presidential authority lasts for only two years under the insistence of the Reagan Administration, which thought it interfered with free trade.
 
Authority to Retaliate
 If the United States asks the offending country to eliminate the specific barrier and it refuses to do so quickly, the President has the authority to retaliate by blocking an equivalent amount of that country's exports to the United States. So if Japan is deemed to be creating barriers that prevent the import of $100 million in American telecommunications equipment, the United States would impose punitive tariffs on an equivalent amount of Japanese products to prevent their coming into the United States. The President has 12 to 18 months to negotiate with the offending country before the retaliation takes effect.
The President already has the authority to impose trade sanctions under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. Super 301 is an amendment to that section that requires that any sanctions be imposed more quickly. Without Super 301, some trade cases have dragged on unresolved for nearly a decade.
President Clinton would be signing an executive order that would reinstate Super 301 by administrative fiat. That would give him the authority to both list the offending countries and initiate trade sanction cases against them. But he probably will not name Japan as a violator right away. He will simply reinstate his authority to do so.
The Super 301 law was initially written with Japan in mind, more than any other country. In 1989 Japan was identified under Super 301, focusing on three closed markets -- processed wood products, supercomputers and satellites. In each of the three cases the Japanese agreed to open the markets before retaliation. American officials since then have been generally satisfied with Japanese performance in these areas. Some countries are so eager not to be named under Super 301 that they will negotiate with the Administration beforehand, just to avoid it.
 
Moving at Their Own Pace
 In recent days the Japanese, who had a $59.3 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, have been discussing ways that they may on their own open some of the markets deemed to be closed by the United States, but they have made it clear to Washington that they will move at their own pace. Many American officials are dubious about what Japan will do.
Yoshihiro Sakamoto, a director general of Japan's trade ministry, told reporters in Tokyo on Monday that his country would file a grievance against the United States with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if Washington imposed any sanctions. GATT is the Geneva-based body that governs world trade. The Japanese always threaten to take the United States before a GATT tribunal whenever trade sanctions seem likely.

HEADLINE: Sales of Stock Funds Remain Strong

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Despite the sharp drop in stock prices here and abroad last month, Americans still cannot get enough of equity funds, according to industry executives. But the specter of rising interest rates last month scared them into bailing out of some bond funds, even the ever-popular tax-exempt funds.
A sign of just how fond of stock funds Americans are is this: At Fidelity Investments, the country's largest fund complex and a popular one with trigger-happy investors, customers who took money out of long-term bond funds did not move it to the safety of money market funds. Instead, they put it into short-term bond funds and, most surprisingly, into stock funds, sales of which matched January's record, said Neal Litvack, executive vice president of marketing for Fidelity. 
 But although Fidelity and T. Rowe Price said they had experienced record stock-fund sales in February, inflows for the industry as a whole slowed last month, according to figures from AMG Data Services, which tracks most funds. And international funds continued to attract more than their share of the new investments. These funds, which account for only 20 percent of equity fund assets, attracted half the money going into stock funds.
While February inflows may have slowed some, it comes after a record-setting January. According to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group that released its monthly data yesterday, $18.3 billion was invested in stock funds in January, a record. According to the trade group, sales of foreign stock funds outpaced those that invested solely in the United States for the first time since September 1990 -- and that was a month when investors were pulling money out of domestic stock funds.
In a surge of speculative activity, aggressive growth funds also lured a record amount of money in January, $3.7 billion, and fund managers spent it as fast as it flowed in. The amount of cash in aggressive growth portfolios fell to 8 percent, from 8.3 percent, the reverse of what stock funds as a whole were doing (their cash level rose to 8.3 percent, from 8 percent). Equity funds bought $12 billion of stocks in January, compared with $9.6 billion in December, helping to drive the Dow Jones industrial average to a record high at the end of the month.
The love affair Americans have with stock funds may well continue, if a monthly survey for February that Fidelity commissions from the University of Michigan is to be believed. The survey found that a record 58 percent of mutual fund investors planned to buy stock funds in the next six months, up from 38 percent in January.
This enthusiasm comes even though the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 4 percent last month, including a 96-point plunge on Feb. 4, after the Federal Reserve raised a key short-term interest rate. Investors have been selling because they fear that more increases were on the way. The interest rate on long-term Treasury bonds shot up half a percentage point, ending the month at 6.65 percent (and yesterday got to 6.77 percent).
The investors who are holders of tax-exempt bond funds reacted the most. At Franklin Resources, one of the biggest purveyors of municipal-bond funds, tax-free sales fell by 25 percent in Feburary, a spokesman said. The decline came as a surprise to some fund executives because they had expected many people to buy anything that might keep them from paying higher taxes. "But people are much more worried about rate increases than taxes," said Stephen Gibson, director of retail marketing for Putnam Investments in Boston.
The trend was even more pronounced at fund companies that sell their wares directly to the public without the use of brokers. Both Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price experienced what they described as modest outflows from long-term, tax-exempt funds last month, as investors switched into money markets. AMG, the data services company, reported that no-load fund companies saw $122 million a week move out of municipal funds in February.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises as Rates Surge, But Other Factors Curb Gain

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most other currencies yesterday as American interest rates surged.
Limiting the dollar's advances, however, were the Bundesbank's relatively tight policy stance and continued concerns that the Clinton Administration was seeking to push the dollar sharply lower against the Japanese yen. 
 Interest rates rose in the United States after a survey of corporate purchasing managers showed rising price pressures in February. That spurred talk of a further rise in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
Higher interest rates are bullish for the dollar because they make dollar-denominated assets more attractive. Three-month Treasury bill rates soared yesterday to their highest levels since July 1992 on views that the Fed would soon tighten.
 The purchasing managers' report followed a Government report that the gross domestic product in the fourth quarter rose 7.5 percent, exceeding the Government's initial estimate of 5.9 percent.
 "The numbers helped the dollar along," said one New York foreign exchange dealer.
Buying was tempered, however, by news that the Bundesbank had allowed a key short-term money market rate to fall only three basis points versus expectations of a much more aggressive cut.
The dollar was also buffeted by concerns the Clinton Administration wanted an even stronger yen in order to trim the huge trade deficit.
 To counter these fears, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said he saw no risk of Japan pulling out of American money markets because of a potentially weaker dollar amid trade friction.
 Speaking before a Senate committee, Mr. Kantor said the Administration would act "on a reasonable basis" in tackling its trade dispute with Japan.
But Mr. Kantor's comment had little immediate impact on the dollar.
The dollar was quoted at 104.60 yen in late New York trading, up from 104.50 yen on Monday. It also rose to 1.7085 marks from 1.7037 marks.
Gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery dropped $3.10, to $379.40 an ounce.
And the British pound rose to $1.4895 in late New York trading, from $1.4865 Monday.

HEADLINE: '91 Ports May Warm Shipper And Buyer

BYLINE: By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
NOTHING warms fanciers of vintage port more than icy weather. And nothing warms port shippers more than declaring a vintage. New York's wretched winter was made in heaven for both.
And for consumers, too. The 1991 vintage ports, costing $20 to $30, are arriving in a buyer's market. Added to a glut of 1985 vintage ports in the same price range, the 91's offer immediate savings and future hedonistic value to canny shoppers. 
 Thirty-three of the 91's, tasted privately at the Portuguese Trade Commission two weeks ago, showed succulence, power and longevity.
The earliest Portugal's shippers are allowed to declare vintages is 18 months after their best harvests, but they can wait 34 months. Last year, 40 shippers announced they would release '91 vintage ports. The last major declaration was in 1987, when 31 shippers came out with the 85's.
"Only three or four times in a decade is there a near-unanimous consensus that a vintage port should be declared," said Pat Iocca, an American who is the commission's wine products manager.
In Britain and the United States, the market's acceptance of a vintage port, a house's most prestigious wine, can affect the reputations and prices of its ready-to-drink ruby, tawny and aged tawny ports, all wood-aged.
Vintage ports, which need years of bottle aging to evolve, represent a melange of a shipper's best casks of wine. "The art of port lies in the blending," Joaquim Manuel Calem, the owner of A. A. Calem & Filho, said at a recent seminar on his various ports given by Connaissance & Cie, a Manhattan wine school.
The English have used port, which is fortified with grape brandy and contains 20 percent alcohol, as a substitute for central heating since the 18th century. Because Britain has long been the principal market for vintage port (the United States is second), the early appraisal of the 91's in Decanter, an influential monthly, was awaited.
Its February issue, reporting on a judging by five specialists, said the panel was "very impressed by the overall standard," and thought that the 91's resembled the great 70's and 77's. It predicted that the best wines would last at least 15 to 20 years, if not longer.
At this stage, the high-octane 91's -- dark purple to opaque, with berrylike flavors, some tannic and some svelte -- stun the palate. These young vintage ports, like infants, offer only superficial clues to their adult personalities.
Still, when the long corks are pulled from the black bottles, which must carry the year and the phrase "Vintage Port" or "Vintage Porto," early favorites emerge.
The most appealing, in order of preference (with hairline distinctions), were: Quinta do Noval, Osborne, Burmester, Quinta do Infantado, Fonseca-Guimaraens, Cockburn's, Martinez, Quinta do Vesuvio, Niepoort, Rozes, Quinta do Castelhino, Barros, Gilbert, Graham's, Croft, Van Zeller's Quinta do Roriz, C. da Silva (Presidential), Feist, Sousa and Pocas.
Tasted another time, Gould Campbell, Smith Woodhouse, Quinta de Vargellas and Warre, all critically acclaimed, might ram their way to the top of the list.
Taylor Fladgate and Fonseca, two major exporters (under the same ownership), dampened the image of the 91's by not declaring 1991 vintage ports under the company names. Instead, they used second labels: Taylor's Quinta de Vargellas (a quinta is a farm or vineyard), and Fonseca Guimaraens. Nonetheless, both wines are outstanding. Sandeman also did not declare a vintage.
The recessions in Britain and the United States depressed both markets for vintage port, which is largely a collector's item and is traded as a commodity that usually appreciates in value as it ages. In the barometric British auctions, vintage port has been sold for less than the original prices in recent years.
Some New York-area merchants and importers say the 91's have fetched little interest. "I don't think they will do that great," said Carlo Russo, the owner of Wine and Spirit World in Fort Lee, N.J. "The only people who ask about 91's are people who had a kid in '91."
He added: "I have a lot of unsold 85's. But I am optimistic. Last fall, after two years of slack sales of vintage ports, things picked up."
With 91's and 85's equally priced, impatient economy-minded customers seeking vintage ports for near-term drinking, especially in the waning days of winter, might prefer the relatively more mature 85's.
Several shippers have produced fewer cases of 91's than 85's, perhaps to generate future scarcity, perhaps to avoid further dampening prices because they may want to declare a '92 vintage.

Good and Bad
At a whither-publishing panel sponsored by the PEN American Center on Monday night, the first speakers were having an elaborate discussion about Martin Midlist, a hypothetical author, and his discouraging prospects when Harold M. Evans all but floored the audience with some solid facts.
Making the point that commerce does not always correspond to culture, Mr. Evans, the publisher of the Random House adult trade division, said the 29 books he published that made it onto The New York Times's 1993 list of Notable Books lost $698,000 collectively. At the same time, he said, the eight books published by his division that recently won awards from the American Library Association lost a total of $370,000. 
 Adding that not all the books lost money individually, Mr. Evans then went on to name some of them, distinguished titles indeed: "Lenin's Tomb," by David Remnick; "Preparing for the 21st Century," by Paul Kennedy; "United States: Essays 1952-1992," by Gore Vidal, which also won a National Book Award. The books achieved generally glowing reviews and a great deal of attention, and received the benefits of much promotional money from the publisher. Mr. Evans revealed some of those figures, too, without matching the figures to the books: the company spent $78,000 to advertise and promote a book that lost $300,000, he said, $71,000 for a book that lost $60,000 and $87,000 for a book that lost $101,000.
Mr. Evans's remarks were refreshingly candid, particularly because publishers usually go to great lengths (even, shockingly, lying outright) in professing that their big-name titles turn a profit. But his revelations confirmed absolutely what publishers often say: that a few big titles a year can help subsidize the rest. That is why something like "Private Parts," by Howard Stern, might cushion the way for other Simon & Schuster books, and why Oprah Winfrey's postponed autobiography would have meant so much to the cash flow at the hyperliterary Alfred A. Knopf.
In Random House's case, Mr. Evans went on to say, all the award-winning books that lost money were paid for by two blockbuster best sellers that together made a profit of $1.4 million. He didn't say what these were, but others in the division speculated that he probably meant "Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now," by Maya Angelou, and "A Woman's Worth," by Marianne Williamson.
Mr. Evans said in an interview that he revealed the figures to point out that companies could publish good books, lose money on them and still have a profitable year when everything was added up. "Publishing has to be viewed as a whole," he said. "We have to balance what we can do over the entire range of books and authors," he said.
 
Best-Seller Lists
 Publishers and authors seem to enjoy few things more than being able to announce that a book is a best seller. But what that really means is surprisingly imprecise. For one thing, there are myriad best-seller lists, calculated by different methods and conveying different degrees of prestige. For another thing, being a best seller doesn't mean that a book will earn back its advance, sell all its copies or even sell a large number of copies, except in relation to the other books on the market.
But people are crazy for lists. And publishers love being on lists because, as Robert Miller, the publisher of Hyperion Books, said: "The more places that call attention to new books emerging as popular, the more there's a chance that people will go to a bookstore and buy them."
Which might be why The Wall Street Journal began publishing its own best-seller list last week. In doing so, The Journal joined a growing crowd of regional lists and the Publisher's Weekly list. USA Today started its list in the fall.
The lists in The Journal and USA Today are clearly attempts to compete with The New York Times's list, whose power often leaves publishers grumbling (particularly when their books don't make it) and which has a major effect on sales because bookstores typically use it to decide which books to discount and which books to display prominently.
Joe Urschel, the managing editor for special projects at USA Today, said that the newspaper began its list "for competitive reasons" and that USA Today made the radical decision to lump all the books together and rate them from 1 to 50 to more accurately reflect the marketplace. Of The New York Times's system of dividing the books into five categories (fiction hard covers; nonfiction hard covers; mass-market paperbacks; trade paperbacks, and how-to, advice and miscellaneous books), he said, "The Times creates five No. 1 best sellers every weekend, so five books can claim that title. With USA Today, there's only one king of the hill."
Under that construction, The Wall Street Journal has two kings of the hill. It separates fiction books from nonfiction, but ignores paperbacks. "We're looking at this as something that gives insight into the business of book publishing both for people in the industry and for interested consumers," said Richard J. Tofel, an assistant managing editor at The Journal. "We thought hard covers were where readers' greatest interest lay."
Mr. Urschel and Mr. Tofel boast that their lists are more timely than The Times's. The Times's best-seller list comes out in The Book Review on Sundays, which, because of the section's production schedule, is two weeks after the data have been been compiled. The Journal and USA Today publish their lists sooner: The Journal on Wednesdays and USA Today on Thursdays. (People who want the information from The Times may, however, pay the newspaper to send them the up-to-date list by fax on the Wednesday that it is compiled.)
Warren Hoge, an assistant managing editor at The Times, said the strength of The Times's list lay in the number and variety of outlets -- 3,050 chain bookstores, independent bookstores and wholesalers -- from which the paper draws its data each week. (By contrast, The Journal polls only chains; USA Today polls both chains and independents, but doesn't factor in sales at wholesalers.)
"This is an area with lots of opportunities for manipulation," Mr. Hoge said, "and I think that the fact that we go to so many more sources to compile our list gives us the best insurance against distortion."
 
Man vs. World Bank
 Bruce Rich is a senior lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington who has often been pointedly critical of the World Bank's environmental record. In his forthcoming book, "Mortgaging the Earth" (Beacon Press), he lets the development bank have it, saying, among other things, that it has been "a prime accomplice in a quiet war against the diversity of humankind's cultures and our planet's biological inheritance."
Management at the bank is clearly not happy about this, nor is it taking it lightly. In an internal memo that someone leaked to Mr. Rich and that he in turn made available, Alexander Shakow, the director of the bank's external-affairs department, asks 22 senior bank officials to help prepare written responses to many of Mr. Rich's criticisms, for use with journalists, legislators, book reviewers and the like.
"The President's office places a high priority on the speedy and effective preparation of the bank's views in a readable and easily used form," Mr. Shakow wrote.
To Mr. Rich, the memo was an example of just what he is criticizing. "One could not have a better example of the bank's misplaced priorities," he said. "The memo is notable, among other reasons, because it demands that more time of senior bank management be devoted to preparing responses to 'Mortgaging the Earth' than they often devote to environmental or social concerns in major bank loans."
Andrew D. Steer, deputy director of the environmental department at the World Bank, said the bank was not out to discredit Mr. Rich's book but rather to point out where its philosophy differed from the author's, in case anyone asked. He said that this was a new approach, adding, "We are not an institution that has worried enough, perhaps, about our image."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 4, 1994, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A brief report about best-seller lists in the Book Notes column on Wednesday misstated the number of categories in the lists published by The New York Times and their headings. There are six categories, three each in hard cover and in paperback. They are fiction; nonfiction; and advice, how-to and miscellaneous. The report also misstated the day on which faxes of the Times's lists become available; it is Thursday of the week in which they are compiled, not Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Mexico, Pledging Big Changes, Reaches an Accord With Rebels

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico, March 2

 BODY:
The Mexican Government and peasant rebels who rose up against it two months ago announced a tentative agreement today on reforms that could transform the political and economic landscape of Mexico's poorest state.
As part of the draft settlement, which still needs approval by the peasant communities that support the rebels, the Government promised new rights and protection for Indians, changes in the political and judicial systems of Chiapas state, land reforms and a deluge of new social programs. 
 The agreement did not include any binding Government commitments in response to the rebels' call for national democratic changes in the political system that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's party has dominated for 65 years.
 
New Election Laws
 But drawing a clear connection between the demands of the insurgents in the southern state and the growing prospect of further political reforms, the negotiator for the Government said it would support new laws to assure impartial control over elections and the convocation of a special session of Congress this month to approve them.
In a brief statement read by one of its Mayan Indian leaders, the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army said the agreements reflected a "true interest" in peace by the Government negotiator, Manuel Camacho Solis.
The rebels said nothing about the specific content of the accords, however, and their silence resounded with the mistrust shown toward Government promises in the past.
"We now have the obligation to reflect well on what their words say," said a Zapatista leader known as Juan. "We must speak now to the collective heart that orders us. From our own, from the Indians of the mountains and the canyons, will come the signal to take the next step in this road, the destiny of which will either be peace with justice and dignity or it will not."
 
Admission of Shortcomings
 Over the rebels' caution, the 32-point draft accord spoke loudly for itself.
Item by item, it read as an extraordinary admission of shortcomings in the program of rapid economic transformation that only last fall had seemed to crown Mr. Salinas as the envy of modernizing leaders throughout Latin America.
Under one provision, the Government said it would carefully study the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement on Chiapas and its Indian communities.
For those found to be hurt by the pact, which went into effect on Jan. 1 and which gradually reduces barriers to trade and investment among Mexico, Canada and the United States, the draft accords promised the sort of help that the Salinas administration tended to belittle in the past: job retraining, new industries, Government support for the sale of Mexican products that face tougher foreign competition.
Except for issues relating to the country's Indian peoples, the draft accords focus almost entirely on Chiapas, the impoverished agricultural state along Mexico's border with Guatemala to which the Zapatistas' Jan. 1 rebellion has generally been confined. Yet Mr. Camacho did not hesitate to speak of their possible effects on the rest of the country.
Should the agreements take effect, he said, "Chiapas will be converted into a very important laboratory where we will be able to evaluate new answers to the social problems and those of justice and freedom in the poorest zones of the country.
"To the extent that those changes show themselves to be valuable and effective, they will of course have an impact on the rest of the nation."
The 19 Zapatista representatives to the talks are expected to leave San Cristobal on Thursday and begin traveling through the highlands and the rain forest to seek approval for the agreement among the peasants.
That process could take several weeks and bring demands for modifications. But the mediator in the talks, Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia of San Cristobal, said he expected the two sides to meet again before the end of March.
As he sat flanked by Government negotiators and masked rebel delegates in the cavernous 16th-century cathedral where the two sides have been meeting for 10 days, Bishop Ruiz warned of "dark or cynical forces that oppose the path of history."
But the more immediate questions lay with the rebels, who have spoken constantly of Mexican Governments that promise changes they never make.
The insurgents' 34 formal demands, made public today for the first time, were striking in both their simplicity and their broad scope.
Point 9, for example, asked for hospitals and clinics, enough doctors and enough medicine. Point 15 called for an end to discrimination against Indians. Point 11 asked not only for the construction of housing in all rural communities, with electricity, roads, potable water and the like, but also for "the advantages of the city, like television, stoves, refrigerators, washing machines, etc."
 
Some Demands Ignored
 The Government virtually ignored some demands, like that for political trials of two past governors of Chiapas, Absalon Castellanos and Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido. It responded to others essentially by promising to study them.
Still, the Government also seemed to have seized some of the political initiative with offers of change that implied a new willingness to admit that the impoverished south had fallen behind the industrial hubs of the northern and central regions.
In answer to the rebels' more narrow demands, the proposed agreements call for doubling the pace of rural electrification in Chiapas, licensing an Indian-controlled radio station, rehabilitating state hospitals, building clinics, increasing investments in housing and other basic services, financing scholarships for Indian children and improving schools.
Under new laws contemplated in the settlement, racial discrimination against Indians would be outlawed for the first time and special prosecutors would be assigned to such cases. Bilingual education programs would be developed in Indian languages, and the Government would move to stop the expulsion of Protestant Indians from communities dominated by Catholics.
As part of a state-level political reform plan, the accords promised early municipal elections, an overhaul of state election boards, the creation of new municipalities and changes in congressional districts to increase the weight of Indian communities in the Government.
The Government refused a demand that it overturn the constitutional changes it pushed through to eliminate the longstanding promise of land for all peasants who work it. But the Government said it would protect semi-communal farms called ejidos, restore lands taken from peasants and increase aid to poor farmers. Most important, perhaps, it also said it would allow for the expropriation of private lands to break up large holdings "in cases of public utility."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Welfare Advisers Urge Plan Stressing a Need to Work for Wages

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
The task force drafting President Clinton's welfare plan is urging him to abandon traditional work programs for a more stringent approach that denies any cash to welfare recipients who fail to work, officials said.
The endorsement of the plan, called work for wages, was reached at an unusual daylong meeting on Saturday, which for the first time spelled out many of the crucial details behind Mr. Clinton's campaign promise to "end welfare as we know it." 
 To keep families from coming onto welfare, for instance, the task force also wants to spend an extra $2 billion a year on child care for low-income workers. That would, in effect, double the Government's annual spending on such programs.
And to reduce the number of jobs needed, the task force wants to phase in the program over 10 years or longer. The work requirements would apply only to mothers born after 1972, a move that would initially exempt about three-fourths of the caseload.
 
Cost Put at $7 Billion
 While Saturday's meeting spelled out important new details on the emerging plan, several issues remain unresolved. Perhaps the most important is how to pay for the program, which is expected to cost up to $7 billion a year.
The work-for-wages plan would mark a sharp departure from previous work programs for welfare recipients. Those programs, sometimes called workfare, continue to send out welfare checks while requiring recipients to show up on a job site, often in a government office.
Studies indicate that those programs have done little to move people into private jobs. And critics say welfare rules make it too difficult to penalize recipients who do not show up for work.
The work-for-wages program, by contrast, would try to simulate a regular job better. States would pay private companies, government agencies or nonprofit groups to hire welfare recipients for a limited period. Those recipients who do not show up for work would get no cash at all.
 
Threat Seen to Some Families Seen
 Some advocates for the poor say the work-for-wages plan could harm vulnerable families by exposing them to the whims of employers without a welfare system to fall back on. They fear, for example, that a mother could be accused of poor work habits, dismissed from her job and left without any eligibility for cash assistance.
The task force is also uncertain about how to treat welfare recipients who complete a work program but still cannot find regular jobs on their own.
Allowing families to continually re-enroll in a work program could prove costly and dissuade people from seeking independent jobs. But barring re-enrollment could leave families with no support.
The recommendations were discussed today at a two-hour Cabinet meeting, as the Administration moves to fulfill one of Mr. Clinton's most popular campaign promises. He has vowed to expand training opportunities for welfare recipients and require those still unemployed after two years to join a work program. Under pressure from Congress, he has promised to deliver a bill this spring.
 
Secrecy Called Excessive
 The task force drafting the Clinton plan is made up of 32 officials from 10 Federal agencies. For the past several months, however, most of the work has been done by the group's three co-chairmen: David T. Ellwood and Mary Jo Bane, who are Assistant Secretaries of Health and Human Services, and Bruce Reed, a White House aide.
As they presented their findings on Saturday, they cloaked them in an unusual amount of secrecy. The task force members were given less than an hour to read a 45-page paper, which they were not allowed to keep. Each page was stamped with the member's name, to prevent anyone from removing a page.
Several people who attended the meeting, annoyed at what they called excessive secrecy, agreed to provide accounts of the discussion. "I mean, you're talking about very complicated stuff, and we have to read it all there," said one person at the meeting.
The group also endorsed a provision that would require welfare mothers under the age of 18 to remain in their parents' home rather than set up independent households. The move is intended to dissuade young women from becoming pregnant.
In addition, the group called for the Treasury Department to find a way of giving low-income workers advanced payments on the refundable tax credits they now collect at year's end. The idea is to make work more immediately rewarding.
The group also voted to allow states to let 10 percent of their caseloads remain in training for longer than two years -- to pursue higher educations, for instance.
 
Program for Wage Earners
 In backing the work-for-wages approach, the task force hopes to create a more effective and dignified set of work programs. "In principle, persons are wage earners, rather than recipients," the confidential paper said, according to the notes of one person who attended the meeting. Participants receive paychecks, not welfare checks.
But only as long as employers remain satisfied. Some advocates worry that employers may not be able to accommodate the often-chaotic lives of young, unskilled mothers. People on welfare often accept jobs, but lose them frequently as spirits flag or problems arise with child care or transportation.
Under a strict work-for-wages scheme, they might no longer have a cash welfare system to fall back on.

HEADLINE: Cavendish Journal;
Shielding Solzhenitsyn, Respectfully

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAVENDISH, Vt., March 2

 BODY:
Joe Allen, the affable proprietor of the Cavendish General Store, will chat about the weather, his homemade kielbasa ("the best in the country"), the town budget, even about his former wife. But when it comes to directions to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's house, Mr. Allen isn't talking.
"I don't give directions," he told a visitor this morning. "I don't care what your story is. That's what Solzhenitsyn wants." 
 There are 1,323 people in this mountain town, and surely all of them know the way to Mr. Solzhenitsyn's house. But they have guarded his secret for nearly 18 years, and they were still guarding it this week, even after he announced he was going home to Russia, now free of the Soviet government that exiled him in 1974 over his book "The Gulag Archipelago."
Privacy is still honored here in New England, and in Cavendish the Nobel laureate was able to live and work as he wanted, in solitude. His neighbors understood the distance he needed. They greeted him at the Post Office but never asked for his autograph. And they say they never thought of him as particularly aloof.
"We respected him," said John Stearns, a former town selectman.
Over the years, Mr. Stearns said, he had wondered about the suffering Mr. Solzhenitsyn had endured in the gulag. "That prison business was terrible," he said. "We don't talk about it. You don't talk about these things."
The townspeople never tried to capitalize on their most famous resident, though the local economy could certainly have used a boost. They never referred to "Cavendish, home of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Nobel laureate." In fact, the only sign that mentions him is the one outside the general store that reads: "No Directions to the Solzhenitsyn Home." Mr. Solzhenitsyn, for his part, thanked them on Monday night in an emotional farewell speech at the annual town meeting.
"You were very understanding; you forgave me my unusual way of life and even took it upon yourselves to protect my privacy," he said, speaking in Russian as his son Stephan translated.
He told his neighbors that they had helped make possible the most productive years of his life. "I have done all that I wanted to do," he told them. Here Mr. Solzhenitsyn, now 75, has completed "The Red Wheel," an epic history of the events that led to the Russian Revolution of 1917.
The 200 people who had gathered at the Cavendish Elementary School to approve the $659,015 budget (which includes the town's first fax machine) gave him a standing ovation.
At town hall today, Richard F. Svec, the town manager, said he had often thought of Mr. Solzhenitsyn writing in his farmhouse behind the fence. "While you and I are talking, a mile and a half away in the woods, he's in his office doing his work," Mr. Svec told a visitor. "That's pretty exciting. I know there's a person in this town who has devoted his entire life to the subject of that nation, its culture, its politics, its history. And even though he's half a world away, he's still right in it."
Still, for Mr. Solzhenitsyn, his wife, Natalya, and their three sons, Cavendish has been home. "Exile is always difficult, and yet I could not imagine a better place to live, and wait, and wait for my return home, than Cavendish, Vt.," he said in his speech. His two-story farmhouse, with pond and tennis courts, will remain a home for his sons Ignat, 21, a piano and conducting student at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and Stephan, 20, a junior at Harvard University. The oldest, Yermolai, 23, lives in Taiwan.
The farewell speech was only Mr. Solzhenitsyn's third public appearance here since his arrival. The first was at the town meeting in March 1977, when he introduced himself and explained why he had come. "I chose this place," he said. "I dislike very much large cities with their empty and fussy lives. I like very much the simple way of life and the population here, the simplicity and the human relationships. I like the countryside, and I like the climate with the long winter and the snow, which reminds me of Russia."
He said that in Switzerland, where he had begun his exile, he had been besieged by strangers. "And so for hundreds of hours, I talked to hundreds of people, and my work was delayed, and I had no means to stop people from coming," he said.
Here, Mr. Solzhenitsyn had an entire town to keep strangers from his door. Mr. Stearns recalled that the Solzhenitsyns arrived in the spring -- mud season in Vermont. The mud, Mr. Stearns said with a chuckle, helped ward off visitors. "They'd come up here with their city tires and get stuck in the mud," he said. "My boys would tow them out, and charge them a helluva price for it."
Mr. Solzhenitsyn declined a request for an interview today through his son Stephan. Stephan, who said his parents planned to return to Russia at the end of May, didn't want to talk about Cavendish anymore than Cavendish wants to talk about his father.
"It's between us and the town," he said.

HEADLINE: Victor of Budget Battle, Byrd Invokes An Army of Kings, Poets and Patriots

SERIES: The Lawmakers: A periodic look at the titans of Capitol Hill

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
"Once again the Senate has justified my faith in the institution, and the Constitution still lives."
Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia offered that heroic analysis on Tuesday night after the Senate rejected, with three votes to spare, a constitutional amendment to require the Federal budget to be balanced. 
 No one expects understatement from Mr. Byrd. But neither did anyone doubt that he believed what he was saying. After invoking the Greeks, the Romans, the barons who wrested Magna Carta from King John and finally the framers in Philadelphia, Mr. Byrd had prevailed against an amendment he regarded as a monstrosity.
For months Mr. Byrd had been the point man. "He was publicly visible, rallying opposition at a time when the amendment seemed to have great public support," said Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, his successor as majority leader.
Mr. Byrd spurred the White House, unions and other groups to action, and they spread sometimes hyperbolic fears of the effects of any amendment. He worked with them, organized hearings, went to news conferences. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, first a rival and then an ally over 31 years in the Senate, said, "He has been very effective in marshaling the economic arguments, the constitutional arguments and the political arguments."
That might not have been enough to get the 34 votes needed to block the measure. Every year there are more senators here who have promised voters to support a balanced budget amendment. Mr. Byrd's strategy at first was delay, dragging the fight out with a long list of amendments intended to upset the delicate coalition supporting the budget amendment. No one knew if that would work.
But he was working with Mr. Mitchell, and Mr. Mitchell was busy, talking to every Democrat, urging each one to oppose the plan and, last week, judging that they were close enough to victory to risk a vote.
Still, Mr. Byrd was out front, the symbol of the opposition.
But he is an odd symbol in Washington these days. A 76-year-old Democrat and the senior Senator from West Virginia, serving since 1959, Mr. Byrd is not only a self-taught historian; he is a piece of living history, a throwback to the days when two-hour speeches full of classical allusions drew crowds to the Capitol. He is uncomfortable with television, unskilled in what he scornfully dismisses as "the 20-second sound bite."
While most modern members of Congress try to juggle the political hazard of being seen as a big spender with the political advantage of getting good stuff for the home folks, Mr. Byrd's commitment to domestic spending is unabashed.
He reminds an interviewer that Henry Clay was committed to public works, which he broadens to include schools, and research and development and other "investments in the country's future." He is proud of the billion or so dollars he has steered to West Virginia since he abandoned the "grubby work" of being Senate majority leader in 1989.
 
Protector of Senate
 He intimidates on the floor. He counts favors carefully. At times he sounds like a one-man committee supervising conduct for this very special club. He voted against the confirmation of Clarence Thomas in part because he felt the judge had insulted the Senate by injecting racism into the hearings. Last fall he urged Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon to resign because, in fighting a subpoena for his diaries, he had "chosen to protect himself at the expense of the Senate."
His opponents on the balanced-budget amendment suggested that he opposed it because it would curb the spending he presides over as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the spending he defends when it aids West Virginia or other states.
But he contends that the amendment's gravest flaw was that it would surrender the hard-won power of the purse to what he plainly regards as the lesser branches of Government, the executive and the judicial.
Listen to him explain his opposition to the amendment: "The basic reason why I think it is a bad idea is that it certainly carries within it the seeds for the destruction of this Government, its structure, as we know it, the constitutional system, checks and balances, and separation of powers."
"The basic power which is probably more fundamental than any other power in the Constitution is the power of the purse," he said recently.
The most recent proof of this power was a Congressional vote to withdraw American troops from Somalia, as a provision in an appropriations bill. Mr. Byrd said, "When we passed legislation here saying that the President has a deadline of March 31 to get them out of Somalia, after which there will be no more funds, that was the claw in the trap."
"When we say 'this amount of funds and no more,' we are getting to the marrow of the bone."
And why must Congress resist anything that diminishes its control of the purse?
"That power of the purse belongs to the people. And that is where it is vested. It is vested in the branch that represents the people, elected by the people. Judges are not elected by the people. The President is not directly elected by the people. He is elected by electors."
To many other senators who would not yield an inch to Mr. Byrd in their belief in themselves and their own respect for the Constitution, of course, this amendment was an imperative to get the nation's finances in order. Some senators who opposed it before voted for it this week, as their last hope.
But others, Mr. Mitchell said, simply never made the distinction between a vote on an ordinary bill and changing the Constitution itself. And many members who told him that the amendment was a bad idea voted for it anyway because their constituents liked it.
 
Fear and Pork
 But a few senators will hit back at Mr. Byrd. One Republican who harbors no fears, Senator John McCain of Arizona, said, "I see fear and intimidation on the part of some of my colleagues who fear losing their pork."
And as evidence of what he considers Mr. Byrd's basic purpose, he carries around the Congressional Record's account of the passage of a provision for $20 million for 500 more jobs in West Virginia, at a Federal Bureau of Investigation center that Mr. Byrd got moved there, in the words of the amendment, "without regard to any employment ceiling imposed by the President or by law."
"I'm fed up to here," Mr. McCain said, holding his hand just under his nose.
Mr. Byrd tore a strip off Mr. McCain not long before that, ridiculing his attack on highway demonstration projects by reading the Senate a letter asking for help on that very kind of spending in Arizona.
On another day he thwarted Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who was later an ally on the constitutional amendment, by preventing a deep cut in an appropriations bill from coming up for a vote. Mr. Kerrey appealed to Mr. Byrd's "fairness" to waive his parliamentary advantage and allow an up-or-down vote.
Mr. Byrd refused. "I have no compunctions about fairness," he said. "I will go home with a clear conscience tonight. The Senator from Nebraska knows the rules." He concluded by comparing himself to the current heavyweight boxing champion, Riddick Bowe, saying: "There comes a time when a fellow who crawls into the ring with the champ, if it is Mr. Bowe or whoever it is, he has to take his chances with the same gloves Mr. Bowe uses. And that is where we are now. We are in the ring."
But sometimes hardball backfires. Senators do not like to be humbled.
Many Senators thought Mr. Byrd's tactics worked against him last spring when Republicans, enraged by Mr. Byrd's parliamentary devices, filibustered and killed President Clinton's economic stimulus bill.
Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, perhaps Mr. Byrd's closest friend in the Senate and the senior Republican on the Appropriations Committee, said his party colleagues' attitude was, "This is one time we can get even for all the past experiences we think we lost on."
Mr. Byrd takes pride, but not joy, in his legendary command of the rules. When he was leader, he read the rules and all the precedents before each session of Congress and knew them as well or better than the parliamentarians who help other senators. But he called that effort "boring," and the need to spend hours negotiating agreements for votes "a grubby piece of work."
 
An Escape Route
 So when the chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee became vacant at John Stennis's retirement, he saw an escape route. He is pleased with the change. "I have more time to devote to West Virginia," he said. "I have more time to devote to things that are fulfilling and meaningful to me: reading of history, the reading of great literature, Milton's Paradise Lost, Emerson's Essays, Dante's 'Divine Comedy,' Shakespeare. There is no comparison."
Some younger Democrats were pleased that he left the leadership. They thought he was archaic in an age of television, not a good spokesman for the party. And his image is not necessarily much better these days: he is attacked as the epitome of pork-barrel politics, thwarting popular will so he can spend more.
Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, a research organization in Washington, has no patience with that view. A leading Congressional scholar, Mr. Ornstein said that was "about as ridiculous a stereotype as you can imagine."
 
Defender of System
 "Robert Byrd," he said, "sees himself deep down as the defender of our constitutional system, of the Constitutional role of Congress, especially the Senate."
He is not unique in his concern for the institution. Mr. Hatfield, who like Mr. Byrd was a poor boy who rose through politics, shares some of his feeling for the history of the place. So do others, like Mr. Mitchell or Mr. Kennedy. But Mr. Byrd talks about it more, worries about it more.
"Clearly the Senate is not what it once was," Mr. Byrd said. "It isn't the institution, but those of us who make up the institution. We don't have the same inspiration, the same goals, the same motivation. Most important today is the 20-second sound bite, making of the headlines."
He said, "It is not as uplifting as it once was."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Some analysts see a spurt for Texas Instruments, finally.

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
AFTER a day spent hearing his Texas Instruments executives forecast the longest economic recovery in history, strong worldwide demand for chips and the screaming success of new products, even Jerry R. Junkins, the company's chief executive, saw the need for some balance.
"We've about worn you out with all these positive attitudes," he told a roomful of analysts and money managers at the company's headquarters here yesterday, with a broad grin. "I'd like to try to correct that." 
 He went on to say that about $1.5 billion of the company's operations, out of annual sales of $8.5 billion, were falling behind his profitability goals, and that the company probably would not keep financing all of the inventions his aides had boasted of just minutes earlier.
Texas Instruments predicts that the world's semiconductor demand will grow 17 percent this year. Mr. Junkins, while noting that his company's own sales growth has outpaced the semiconductor market's, warned that slower rises in personal computer purchases could reduce increases in chip demand to the single digits.
Mr. Junkins had good reason for remaining cautious. Last year's record sales and profits came after a long stretch of disappointments to analysts and customers alike. The analysts, however, sounded as enthusiastic this week as if they had been at a meeting for Motorola or Intel, two semiconductor companies that over the long run have had much hotter stocks.
Mr. Junkins had some reasons for boasting, also. He hardly had to remind anyone that five years ago his company looked like a doomed victim of military budget cuts and a crowded semiconductor market dominated by the Japanese.
Since then, it has invested heavily in the development of the specialized chips that go into cars, high-powered computer work stations, cellular telephones and computer components including hard drives and audio and video equipment. Texas Instruments still makes the familiar pocket calculators, but its other consumer products are now limited to a few high-end laptop computers.
To smooth out performance in the cyclical semiconductor industry and overcome investor seasickness, the company has improved efficiency and found joint venture partners abroad -- a point company executives illustrated with perhaps a few too many slides showing jagged fever charts becoming as gently rolling as the Dallas landscape.
After missing most of the stock market's advance during the late 1980's and early 1990's, Texas Instruments has recently been trading near its 52-week high of 84.25. But its closing price yesterday of 83, up 1.375, on the New York Stock Exchange still leaves it at about 13 times analysts' estimated 1994 earnings of $6.25 or so a share, compared with about 15 times earnings for the broader market.
Does Texas Instruments deserve better? While Motorola, which makes not just chips but also the cellular phones several of the analysts were toting, trades at about 20 times projected earnings, Intelcarries a multiple of about 11.
Some analysts suggest that Texas Instruments might now enjoy a delayed spurt. "If you look at those other companies, you had a doubling or tripling of value," said Mona E. Eraiba of Gruntal & Company. "This is the only major stock in the semiconductor group that didn't do well."
What's more, the current market cycle, with reviving inflation fears and rising interest rates, could well favor cyclical companies, especially those whose products offer the technology to improve corporate efficiency.
But don't ask Texas Instruments to become the next Intel, dominating a market as much as Intel does for the chips that are the brains of most personal computers. This week, Mr. Junkins sounded like a reformed addict, promising that a company once hooked on seeking market share was now religious about its profit margins.
But then, Texas Instruments could do quite well without ever taking off like Intel.

HEADLINE: Hint of U.S. Trade Escalation Draws Warning From Japan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 2

 BODY:
The Japanese Government reacted warily and with a touch of anger today to the prospect that President Clinton might be preparing to reinstate a tough trade law that would allow him to impose sanctions on Japan if it refused to open its markets.
Some senior Administration officials said in Washington on Tuesday that Mr. Clinton had decided to sign an executive order reviving the measure, known in official shorthand as Super 301, which would significantly add to his arsenal of weapons in persuading Japan to remove barriers to the import of foreign goods and services. 
 A formal announcement is expected as early as Thursday morning, Administration officials say.
The Japanese are deeply concerned about Super 301 because it can be used on relatively short notice, involves unilateral administrative action by the President, and can result in stiff tariff increases on Japanese exports to the United States.
The provision had lapsed several years ago, to the relief of the Japanese. Although a revived measure could be applied to any country that maintains high trade barriers, Super 301 is widely regarded as aimed specifically at Japan, which had a $59 billion trade surplus with the United States last year.
Trade negotiations broke down at the time of Mr. Clinton's meeting last month with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The United States and Japan have both said they wanted a cooling-off period before resuming discussions on removing Japanese barriers to imports and reducing the trade imbalance.
But Japanese officials regard the possibility of Super 301's reinstatement as an escalation of the simmering tensions. Masayoshi Takemura, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, described such a toughened American position as unproductive. "We strongly urge the U.S. Government to take sensible action," Mr. Takemura said.
Washington is gambling that the reverse is true, that the threat of sanctions will force the Japanese to make concessions.
Officials at the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry here tried to calm the atmosphere, but said that they felt the use of the Super 301 clause would be a grave error.
Japanese officials had previously said they would consider filing charges against the United States at the principal forum for trade disputes, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, if Washington took action on its own. They have also hinted that they would consider their own sanctions in retaliation, the first shots in a possible trade war.
Today, a Foreign Ministry official said, "The Government of Japan strongly requests that the U.S. Government act in the spirit of self-restraint and good sense."
An official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry added: "If, in fact, the U.S. Government decides to reinstate the so-called Super 301, it would be deeply regrettable. We should not start trade wars. We should not change the world trading system into a bunch of unilateral measures. Once we start doing this, we would start going down a slippery slope."
The officials repeated Mr. Hosokawa's statement that Japan is preparing to take a series of measures on its own to open markets to foreign-made goods, and that tough American sanctions are thus unnecessary. The Japanese Prime Minister has said that he will lift some barriers to imports, deregulate portions of Japan's economy and take stronger measures to jolt the economy out of recession, which would draw more imports.
"Especially after the summit," the International Trade and Industry official said, "people are talking about their concerns on the possibility of trade wars. What is important in both countries is not to overreact."
Super 301 was first passed by Congress in 1988. It requires the United States trade representative to identify countries that maintain the most egregious trade barriers and to initiate cases to eliminate those barriers. The measure lapsed because the Presidential authority lasts for only two years.

HEADLINE: State Power Authority Chief Opposes Contract With Quebec

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 2

 BODY:
The new president of the New York Power Authority told a legislative hearing today that New York State should reject a 20-year, $5 billion contract to buy electricity from Quebec because of possible environmental damage in Canada and because of a sharp decline in the demand and price for electricity in the state.
"From a straight business point of view, why would we want to buy more of this stuff when we've got enough?" said S. David Freeman, who took over as president and chief executive of the authority on Tuesday. 
 The contract was supposed to expand and extend an agreement that has been in place for almost 20 years. Under the current contract, Quebec, which has high winter demand but big surpluses of power in the summer, sells power to New York, where the pattern is the opposite.
The new agreement, which has already been signed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo but which has an escape clause, would have provided Consolidated Edison with 780 megawatts of capacity, almost as much as the Indian Point 2 nuclear plant, every summer from 1999 to 2018.
 
Demand and Price Dropped
 Because of the recession and investments in energy efficiency, however, the demand for power and the price of power have dropped sharply in the last two years, and Con Edison and Hydro-Quebec had been renegotiating the contract.
Another factor is a growing internationalization of the environmental movement, with environmental advocates in New York arguing that cleaning up New York's air with hydroelectric power should not come at the expense of the aboriginal peoples of Quebec's far north, where hydroelectric dams would be built.
Environmentalists called Mr. Freeman's remarks today a stunning victory for their position.
Ashok Gupta, senior energy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that only three years ago, Hydro-Quebec expected to sell New York $18 billion worth of electricity in the next two decades. A separate contract, $13 billion for a year-round supply of 1,000 megawatts, was canceled two years ago.
 
Like Sharing Vacation House
 Mr. Freeman praised the idea behind the contract, which is called a diversity contract because the physical diversity of the New York and Quebec systems can make seasonal exchanges useful. He likened it to two families sharing a single vacation house, one preferring to vacation in summer and the other in winter.
But the contract at issue would also have required New York to buy 3 billion kilowatt-hours a year from Quebec at a price that looked reasonable when the deal was cut in 1989 but is now over market. (A kilowatt-hour is the amount of electricity needed to run ten 100-watt bulbs for an hour; a typical suburban house uses about 6,000 kilowatt-hours a year.)
Hydro-Quebec has proposed revising the deal so that each side would benefit from the other's surplus.

HEADLINE: Concern Is Voiced in Croatia's Capital On Serbs' Reaction to Bosnia Accord

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, March 2

 BODY:
The peace accords signed by Croatian leaders and the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government on Tuesday were hailed today by politicians and foreign diplomats here, but they warned that the accords signed in Washington cannot be fully successful unless Serbs are persuaded to accept them.
The only force able to persuade the Serbs to do so, they said, is Russia, and some diplomats said they were encouraged by Moscow's recent performance. 
 "What happened in Washington represents a real breakthrough, and there is hope for a comprehensive settlement because the whole climate here has changed in the last few weeks," said a European ambassador here.
"For the first time, the Serbs are on the defensive," he continued. "They've been forced to stop shelling Sarajevo, they've been slapped down by having four of their planes shot out of the sky, and their friends in Russia have told them they can't count on unconditional support from Moscow. If the Russians put the kind of pressure on them that the Americans are putting on the Muslims and Croats, then there's the prospect of an end to all this madness."
 
'If It Leads Us to Peace'
 The Bosnian Serbs' leader, Radovan Karadzic, speaking in Moscow today, said he welcomed the Washington agreement "if it leads us to peace and not to war."
Dr. Karadzic's bid for support in Moscow had evidently fallen far short of his expectations. Russian officials endorsed NATO's downing of four Serbian bombers that were violating the no-flight zone over Bosnia on Monday. They also persuaded Dr. Karadzic to allow the airport at Tuzla to reopen for humanitarian aid flights.
"Karadzic was expecting the Russians to line up behind him, and they didn't," said a diplomat involved in the Washington talks. "It's going to be very difficult to bring the Serbs on board, but that is the ultimate aim. This whole thing is intended to make it easier to reach a global peace settlement."
Under the accords signed in Washington, Muslims and Croats in Bosnia are to join in a federal state divided into autonomous regions like those that make up Switzerland and Belgium. The state will then join in a confederation with Croatia.
 
Target for Completing Talks
 Details of the union are to be drawn up at a new round of talks scheduled to begin on Friday in Vienna. Both sides aim to conclude the talks with a final agreement by March 15.
While Bosnia's Muslims and Croats are at the bargaining table in Vienna, diplomats said, strong efforts will be launched to persuade the Serbian nationalists in Bosnia and Croatia to join the new confederation. Serbs now control about 70 percent of Bosnia.
In Moscow, Russian officials expressed cautious interest in the Washington agreement. Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, told the Interfax news agency that the agreement was "a new twist" that could lead to peace in Bosnia "if things go right."
"The formation of the federation permits the resolution of some complicated questions which had blocked the talks," Mr. Churkin said. "For example, the need for territorial division between the Muslims and the Croats becomes obsolete. The Muslim demand to get access to the sea is also lifted."
 
Incentives From the U.S.
 The United States, which was the driving force behind Tuesday's agreement, is expected to offer various incentives to help stabilize the new Croatian-Muslim confederation. American officials are likely to offer direct aid and also encourage international financial institutions, which have stopped lending money to Croatia, to begin doing so again.
If the Bosnian Serbs agree to join the new confederation, they could be offered similar incentives. Their agreement might also lead to lifting the crippling economic sanctions that are in place against the Serbian Government in Belgrade.
Croatian politicians today expressed fear that the Washington accords, instead of tempting Bosnian Serbs to join a new confederation, might lead them to try to form a confederation of their own with Serbia proper.
 
'A Good Opportunity'
 "The agreement is a good opportunity for Croats and Muslims to solve their problems, but neither group would gain much if the Bosnian Serbs are left out of the confederation," said Ante Dapic, a member of Parliament. "Croats and Muslims cannot allow Bosnian Serbs to secede from Bosnia and unite with Serbia."
Another uncertainty in the agreement is the future role of Serbs in the self-proclaimed Krajina Republic, a section of Croatia that is controlled by local Serbian nationalists with backing from Belgrade. Efforts will be made to entice them to join the new confederation, but they are likely to resist if their sponsors in Belgrade encourage them to do so. The region they control includes nearly one-third of Croatian territory.
Before the Washington talks began, United States officials had warned the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, that his country faced increasing isolation and even the possibility of economic sanctions if it did not stop supporting anti-Muslim campaigns in Bosnia. Other friends of Croatia, including Germany and the Vatican, also urged Mr. Tudjman to change his policy.
The change is profound, because it means that Mr. Tudjman is effectively giving up his dream of creating a "greater Croatia" in which Croatia would absorb regions of Bosnia in which Croats live.
 
'A Big Shock'
 "It's a big shock for our political scene," said Slaven Letica, a commentator and former Tudjman adviser. "Only two weeks ago Muslims were supposed to be our worst enemy."
Mr. Tudjman has enough political power to crush any opposition to the accord from militant Croatian nationalists, but it is not certain that Muslim leaders will be so successful in assuring that Muslim militants support it.
"It is axiomatic that generals who are losing like to negotiate, while those who are winning often prefer to keep fighting," said one diplomat here. "In fighting between Muslims and Croats, Muslims have the upper hand, so Muslim generals may not be so interested in a peace plan at this point. Both sides will have to do a lot of explaining to their people, but the Muslim leaders will probably have the harder time."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Fighting Intensifies in Bosnia
 SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, March 2 (AP) -- As accords in principle were hailed abroad, Serbian nationalists intensified their attacks in scattered areas of Bosnia today, pounding some Muslim enclaves, blocking relief convoys and violating the cease-fire in Sarajevo.
Serbian artillery hammered the enclave of Maglaj in northern Bosnia and pressed an offensive against the northwestern area around Bihac.
A United Nations military spokesman, Lieut. Col. Bill Aikman, said that Serbian artillery also fired on the Muslim town of Breza, north of Sarajevo.
The spokesman said Serbs also fired three rocket-propelled grenades at positions of the Muslim-led Bosnian Government around the Jewish cemetery in downtown Sarajevo. United Nations officials quoted Serbs as saying that they had broken the truce because Government forces were reinforcing their trenches in violation of the cease-fire accord reached three weeks ago.

HEADLINE: Setback for Japan's Leader on Trade Issue

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 2

 BODY:
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's efforts to resolve a bitter trade dispute with the United States and to revive the faltering economy suffered a major setback today when he announced that he had been forced to abandon a campaign to remove a dissident from his fractious inner circle of advisers.
It was a startling display of political weakness, in which Mr. Hosokawa apparently succumbed to threats that several parties, including the Socialists, might quit the coalition Government if he forced out the official and pursued a more conservative course. 
 Mr. Hosokawa said he would focus on uniting his Government, which is so divided between its right and left wings that it is unlikely that Mr. Hosokawa's coalition will be able to pull together behind the bold economic and trade policies he has said are needed.
Mr. Hosokawa's long-expected Cabinet shuffle was to have included the removal of Masayoshi Takemura as the chief Cabinet secretary. Mr. Hosokawa and Mr. Takemura, both the heads of small parties, were once so close that they agreed to merge their parties to push an agenda for change.
But Mr. Takemura has proven more moderate than Mr. Hosokawa, particularly on critical economic issues.

HEADLINE: Harvey Leibenstein, Harvard Professor, 71

 BODY:
Harvey Leibenstein, an author and professor of economics at Harvard University for 20 years, died on Monday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 71.
He died of cancer, his wife, Margaret, said. 
 Beginning in 1967, Dr. Leibenstein held the Harvard chair of Andelot Professor of Economics and Population. He retired in 1987.
He was the author of several books on economic theory, including "Economic Backwardness and Economic Growth" (1957), "Beyond Economic Man" (1977) and "Inside the Firm: Inefficiency of Hierarchy" (1987).
In his 1977 work, Dr. Leibenstein argued for a concept of "selective rationality" as the basic psychological assumption to explain human economic behavior. This, he said, is a compromise between the way people would like to see themselves behave and the way they would wish to behave in the absence of any constraints.
Dr. Leibenstein held degrees from Northwestern and Princeton universities and was a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley from 1951 to 1967.
Besides his wife, he is survived by a brother, Rabbi Ben Dov Leibenstein of Chicago.

Bankers Trust Denies Rumors of Europe Loss

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Amid rumors that Bankers Trust had sustained huge losses in European markets, the company's stock did not open for an hour and a half yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, until Bankers Trust denied that it had lost money.
Shortly before 11 A.M. yesterday, the bank issued a short statement that said that "its operations thus far for 1994 have been profitable." At 11:02, Bankers Trust's stock finally opened for trading at $79, down $1.75. Nearly one million Bankers Trust shares traded yesterday, triple the usual volume, mostly at prices below $78, although the stock closed at $78.50, off $2.25 for the day. 
 The market was reacting to rumors, mainly in Europe, that Bankers Trust had lost money in the recent sharp and unexpected rise in European interest rates and fall of the dollar against the yen. Bankers Trust takes very large, often aggressive, proprietary positions -- those positions taken for its own account rather than as part of serving customers.
 
Lower Profit Seen
 Indeed, a person familiar with the results of the bank said that its profit from such trading would be significantly lower in the first quarter than in recent quarters. "It's not going to be a great quarter, far from it, but their are not going to be losses," said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Bankers Trust earned $590 million from trading for its own account last year. The bank is generally considered to be among the leaders in systems to control its trading risk.
Nonetheless, most analysts expect that trading results for Bankers Trust and other banks will be lower this year than last year's record levels. And it is not unusual for aggressive trading firms to have a bad quarter from time to time.
"One of the prices one pays with an average return on equity of 20 percent is a certain amount of short-term volatility," said Raphael Soifer, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman. As measured by its return on equity, Bankers Trust has been among the most profitable American banks.
Some rumors said that the bank had sustained losses in its dealings in derivatives, complex transactions that have values related to underlying markets, like options on currencies. The person familiar with the bank's results said that its derivatives business was not hurt in the same manner as its proprietary trading. Bankers Trust is a leading dealer in derivatives mainly on behalf of customers. Its proprietary trading is largely holdings of bonds and currencies.
 
Bond Prices Lowered
 In the last two months, many traders and investors have lost money because bond and currency markets have performed the opposite of expectations. Most traders started the year confident that interest rates in Europe would continue to fall and that the dollar would continue to rise.
When the Federal Reserve moved to raise short-term rates early last month, it caused an unexpected chain reaction around the world raising rates -- and lowering bond prices, which move in the opposite direction -- in other markets. Moreover, the dollar was weakened by fears of a trade war after negotiations between Japan and the United States broke down.
The market moves were exacerbated, traders said, precisely because so many people had bet in the other direction. Aggressive investors, like hedge funds, who had borrowed on margin to buy European bonds, were forced to sell them as the market declined, leading to a cascading wave of sales. And many institutional investors were moving to liquidate positions as well out of caution, leaving few buyers in the market.
"Some people are saying they lost a lot of money; others say they were able to duck and get out, but I haven't heard any rumors of people who made a ton of money," the head of trading at a large New York bank said.
 
Bid-Ask Spread Widens
 A portfolio manager at a large international bond mutual fund said that bond dealers were far more willing to sell bonds than buy them in recent weeks and that consequently the bid-asked spreads, or the difference between a price a dealer will buy and sell a security, had widened. "Traders at two firms told us that their managers had ordered them to reduce the size of their positions," the portfolio manager said.
The volatile markets have substantially increased trading volume with customers at many banks and brokerage firms. As a result, those that did not have large proprietary positions may actually have good quarters.
Because of the rumors, two credit agencies said yesterday that they were affirming their rating of Bankers Trust's debt.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Rises 0.5%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
Despite bad weather and low levels of savings, consumers stepped up their spending by five-tenths of 1 percent in January, matching December's satisfying gain, the Commerce Department reported today. It was the 10th consecutive increase in this indicator, which covers two-thirds of business activity.
"That's some kind of evidence that the household sector is maintaining its spending momentum," Paul W. Boltz, economist at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, said. "That's an impressive number." 
 Personal incomes, meanwhile, eased three-tenths of 1 percent, the first decline since July. But incomes would have posted a sizable advance had it not been for the California earthquake and other special factors.
 
A Gain in Wages
 The wage and salary component surged 1 percent for the month, intensifying the nervousness of securities markets that have become highly sensitive of late to any hint of potential inflation.
Inflation fears were still troubling investors this morning as stock and bond prices, also affected by turmoil in European markets, dropped sharply. But both markets eventually rebounded to finish higher on the day. [Pages D8 and D16.]
In a separate set of economic statistics today, the Government reported that sales of new homes plunged 20.1 percent in January to an annual rate of 695,000. Economists and industry analysts generally dismissed this drop, which followed a 13 percent jump in December, as reflecting severe weather and a normal correction from what had been the strongest monthly pace since 1986.
The decline in new-home sales in the storm-battered Midwest was 35.2 percent but, in something of an anomaly, sales gained slightly -- though from a very low level -- in the Northeast.
 
Help-Wanted Index Off
 Bad weather was also cited today as the main reason for a four-point drop in January, to 106, in the index of help-wanted advertising published by the Conference Board.
Although the jump in wages and salaries roiled Wall Street, economists cautioned against what they called premature conclusions of revived inflation.
"The likelihood of any acceleration of significance is now exaggerated," John Lipsky, chief economist for Salomon Brothers, said. Economic data in the winter months are often subject to erratic swings because seasonal adjustment factors are very large, he noted.
Somewhat more concerned, however, was John E. Silvia of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. He agreed that while the markets had probably been overreacting to recent price data, "wages and salaries are just very strong" and may even be understated, he said.
Mr. Silvia said he thought the Commerce Department report was not capturing all the income now earned by part-time workers and by a new group of self-employed consultants who were let go by corporations that reduced their numbers of workers.
The report said incomes were reduced by uninsured losses to homes and businesses from the California earthquake. The loss of rental income for residential property alone was $39.9 billion at an annual rate.
Also reducing January incomes were lower subsidy payments to farmers, higher taxes for social insurance and retroactive Social Security benefits payments that had inflated incomes in December.
Partly offsetting these factors were cost-of-living adjustments to several Federal transfer programs and pay raises for Federal personnel, both civilian and military.
With all special factors excluded, personal incomes advanced by seven-tenths of 1 percent, the report showed.
In continuing their rapid spending, consumers reduced their savings in January at an annual rate of $47.2 billion -- to $157.5 billion in January from $204.7 billion in December.

HEADLINE: Chancellor Presents Plan To Rebuild School System

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL 

 BODY:
Warning of the stresses of growing enrollment and educational failure, Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines sketched out a broad plan yesterday to rebuild the school system, from cutting administrators in high schools to reorganizing the city's huge and costly special education program to experimenting with year-round schooling.
Mr. Cortines told the City Council that school enrollment has topped one million this year for the first time in 15 years, and that with even more students expected, the Giuliani administration has not made plans to provide seats for them. He predicted that 117,000 more seats would be needed over the next decade -- twice the total school enrollment in Boston. 
 "When I came to New York City I found a school system in crisis," he said at a hearing of the Council's Finance Committee, called to discuss Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's budget. "The only item on my agenda is strengthening teaching and learning."
 
Different Strategies
 He said he was working on many different strategies to accomplish this -- from cutting administrative waste to protecting the school system from deeper budget cuts proposed by Mr. Giuliani that he said could end up hurting students.
His proposals include these:
*Shifting special education programs from the central board to the 32 community school districts. Mr. Cortines said the current system has "nine layers of adminstration before you get to the student." He said that schools use current programs to get rid of difficult students who may not need special education and that minority boys continue to be disproportionately sent to special education.
*Setting up pilot projects to run schools year-round, to cope with overcrowded school buildings. Students would attend school for 30 days and then get 15 days off, throughout the year. He said the plan would require cooperation from parents and the school employee unions.
*Setting tighter requirements to make sure the money for textbooks and library books does not get diverted for other school supplies. He said he may also ask for a waiver from the state so that citywide reading tests could be administered every other year, rather than every year.
*Staggering the school day so that buses and full-time school bus drivers will be able to take several loads of children to school, a proposal that would require complicated discussions with drivers, teachers and parents.
In his testimony, Mr. Cortines reported for the first time that a student census conducted last October found that enrollment had reached 1,016,728. It was the highest enrollment since 1978. Last year 995,465 students were reported enrolled in the city schools
 
Cutbacks in Capital Spending
 Despite this enrollment challenge, he said, the Giuliani administration, looking to reduce debt-service costs and to enhance the confidence of investors, slashed the city's capital spending plan for schools. While the administration proposed spending $3.3 billion over the next five years, Mr. Cortines had proposed a $7.5 billion spending plan.
He said the administration had cut the Board of Education's capital spending plans so deeply that he would be forced to drop all plans to construct new schools and rebuild old ones. Instead, he said, the school system would have to spend all available funds replacing leaky roofs and failing boilers.
The construction freeze, he said, would block the building of 33 new schools, with 30,000 seats, and 17 modernizations and additions that would add 3,700 more seats.
"Unless the city rethinks its planning assumptions, it will be setting the stage for a capacity crisis in the near future," Mr. Cortines said at the hearing.
He said Mr. Giuliani's budget office wanted the school system to lease space and reschedule classes to deal with the problem. But he said the administration did not have "even the rudiments of a plan for dealing with the problem."
To lease enough space for the 117,000 students who need seats would require 12 million square feet of space -- the size of the entire World Trade Center complex -- over the next decade, he said.
 
Wave of New Immigrants
 Mr. Cortines attributed much of the enrollment increase to a wave of new immigrants settling in the city: 138,000 immigrant students have entered the schools in the last three years.
Emanuel Tobier, a professor of economics at New York University, said the rising enrollment was also driven by a higher birthrate and a "reduced suburbanization," with fewer middle-class families with children moving to the suburbs.
As a result, the city's official count showed 1,016,728 students last Oct.31, up from 995,465 a year earlier. School enrollment had peaked at 1,149,068 in 1972, just before the onset of the city's fiscal crisis, and dropped to a low of 919,633 in 1982.
In his testimony, Mr. Cortines presented himself as a school reformer, deeply troubled by a pattern of failure in scores of city public schooos, who was focusing on paring the school bureaucracy and shifting resources into school districts, schools and ultimately into the classroom.
 
Exposition of Agenda
 It was in part an exposition of the agenda he brought with him to New York and in part an effort to seize the initiative from the Giuliani administation, which has called for much sharper cuts in the school bureaucracy, eliminating much of the school administration, but no cuts in teaching.
Mr. Cortines said that by the end of March he would distribute a deatailed budget request outlining how the budget cuts proposed by the administration would affect schoolchildren if it were carried out.
He said he was going to cut back in administrators at every level, reduce the cost of administration in high schools and order freezes for school disricts with too many administrators, as well as review the the central bureaucracy job by job.
And he said he was planning to rebuild the special education system, which he said "spends enormous sums of money to comply with mandates without necessarily providing a quality education."
He attributed the problem to a split in responsiblity between the central board and school principals. "No one is responsible for these children," he said.


GRAPHIC: The New York City Board of Education announced yesterday that the total mumber of students in the public school system had risen above one million for the first time in 15 years, partly because of a huge influx of immigrant students.

HEADLINE: Brazilians Get Serious On Inflation and Deficit

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRASILIA, March 2

 BODY:
Brazil is mounting yet another effort to reduce its 2,500 percent annual inflation rate and achieve economic stability, a step that is necessary to make Latin America's largest nation more attractive to foreign investors.
Television talk shows today featured Government officials introducing Brazil's seventh anti-inflation package in eight years and fifth new currency in a decade. 
 This hyperinflation has been a major obstacle to investment from the United States, Brazil's largest trading partner, creditor and investor. If Brazil joins other Latin American nations in radically reducing inflation, the country may become attractive to investors who lost interest over a decade widely seen abroad as a time of economic chaos.
To prepare Brazilians for living again with a hard currency, the Government started this week to carry out what some economists call "disguised dollarization."
Unlike Argentina, which has established a legal parity between the dollar and the peso, Brazil has opted for a unit of account, called the Real Value Unit, which is to indirectly track the dollar's value.
For several months, store prices are to be listed both in these constant units and in the steadily eroding currency, the cruzeiro real. Within a few months, planners say, the Real Value Unit will become Brazil's new currency.
 
Assault on Budget Deficit
 Behind the scenes, the planners say, measures are being taken to attack inflation's structural cause, a $12 billion budget deficit, compared with a gross domestic product of $450 billion and an $89 billion national budget.
"We are going to balance the budget this year," Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso promised in an interview here today. Mr. Cardoso, who is expected to run for President in October, is banking his political future on the plan. After he became Finance Minister last May, monthly inflation increased from 30 percent to 40 percent today. The surreal annual rate of 2,500 percent reflects the power of compounding, month after month.
Brazilians are uncertain whether this latest plan will work, but there are indications that the nation is indeed moving slowly in the direction of economic stability.
The trend, if continued, would be extremely important for a country with an economy roughly the size of Russia's and with 155 million people, making it Latin America's giant.
Though Brazilians are notorious for tax evasion, tax collection is now running at $5 billion a month -- up one-third over last year's levels. The economy is expected to grow 4 percent this year, which will further increase tax revenue, and beyond that, national revenue sharing with states and cities is to be cut by $9 billion this year. All these imply deficit cuts.
Moreover, a privatization program is gradually paring down state industries that grew unimpeded during the era of military rule, from 1964 to 1985.
 
Year of the Auction
 Starting this month with auctions of a state shipping company and a state petrochemical company, 30 companies are to be sold to private investors in 1994. The Government, taking advantage of billions of dollars already pouring into Brazilian stock markets from abroad, plans also to sell its minority holdings in private companies -- about $900 million worth of shares -- this year.
"I want to see more cutting of expenditures," said Alexandre Barros, a political-risk analyst here. "You can raise tax collection, balance the budget and finish off development."
In this inland capital, free-market ideas of small government are slowly penetrating the walls of the Brazilian Congress, too. Starting this week and running to March 31, Congress is to function as a sort of constitutional forum.
"The sense of Congress is to open the market," Mr. Cardoso, a Social Democrat, said. He predicted that Congress would sell some telecommunications to foreign companies and the oil sector to allow foreigners to enter into joint exploration and production ventures with Petrobras, the state oil company.
A survey published today of the 584-member Congress found that 83 percent of the members believe that foreign investment is very important for economic growth, that two-thirds want private-company participation in telecommunications, and that half call for erasing legal differences between foreign and local companies.
"I have changed, the left has changed, Congress has changed," said Augusto Carvalho, a Congressman from the Popular Socialist Party, which used to be called the Brazilian Communist Party.
"We're not against foreign capital that can create jobs and bring technology to the country," Mr. Carvalho said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Up After Rate Rise Earlier

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities rebounded to finish slightly higher in volatile trading yesterday, battling back from another sharp rise in interest rates, this one ignited by an overnight slump in world bond markets.
But according to market participants, the market's surprising turnaround yesterday does not mean that the recent selloff is over. Many analysts say nothing has changed since the bond market decline began in February because investors are still afraid of inflation and waiting for another rate increase by the Federal Reserve. The first rise in short-term rates, on Feb. 4, set off the selloff. 
 "The fact that we had such a selloff overseas didn't really bode well," said Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading specialist at CS First Boston. He said he does not think yesterday's rebound was an indication that the market had hit bottom because "we did not see the kind of end user purchases at the bottom that you would expect to see if that were the case." He was referring to investors who plan to hold on to securities for a long time.
"I think people were not ready to buy at these yields and say they really offered value," he said. "They are still waiting on the Fed to drop the other shoe."
 
No Changes in Fundamentals
 Peter Hirsch, the head of the government trading desk at Salomon Brothers, said he also didn't see any changes in market fundamentals. "If someone says the market has bottomed, they are the same people who said it was bottoming at 6.25, 6.50 and 6.75 percent," he said.
But he did say that after the overnight blowout in the world bond markets, "people came into the office today and saw that prices of Treasury securities were too cheap to pass up."
In European trading, the yield on the 30-year bond got as high as 6.92 percent after the German Bundesbank announced that its main guage of money supply growth rose 20.6 percent at an annual rate in January. That immediately raised the specter that the long anticipated decline in interest rates in Europe would slow down, which touched off selling in European bond and stock markets that spilled over into sale of United States Treasury securities.
In New York, the Treasury's 30-year bond gained 5/32 in price, to 93 15/32 in late trading, for a yield of 6.76 percent, down from 6.77 percent on Tuesday. In the shorter-maturity bill market, rates were down moderately, with a three-month bill down three basis points, to 3.46 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
One economic report yesterday may have served as the catalyst for some buyers and helped recoup the European losses. January new-home sales plunged 20.1 percent. But analysts at C. J. Lawrence said that the decline was related to the harsh winter weather and that sales are considerably higher than levels a year ago.
Other data released yesterday showed United States personal income down three-tenths of 1 percent and personal spending up five-tenths of 1 percent in January. The market was largely unaffected by the data, even though there were some signs of economic growth in the reports. The data reflected the impact of the Los Angeles earthquake, analysts said. Excluding the quake, income was up seven-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Imposing of Trade Sanctions
 Mr. Alexy said another factor which had cast a shadow over the bond and dollar yesterday were the reports that President Clinton had decided to sign an executive order reinstating his powers to impose trade sanctions, which could mark an escalation in the trade dispute between the United States and Japan.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/Donoghue Inc., an Ashland, Mass., firm that provides research and analysis for retail and institutional investors, said that the Japanese were buyers of United States Government securities for years and still hold a lot of them in their portfolios. "There is concern that a trade war between the two countries could make the Japanese, if they chose to do so to get back at us, sell some of those U.S. Treasury bonds, and drive rates up here," Mr. Frank said.
"And though it will not happen, the threat is all that is needed with investors already nervous."
Mr. Frank, who thinks the bond market has overreacted to inflation fears, expects the economy to slow in the first quarter, but with enough carry-over momentum from the strong fourth quarter to maintain some solid growth through the first half of the year. "But forget the kind of growth you saw at the end of last year," he said, when the economy surged at a 7.5 percent annual rate.
"There is nothing else out there in the economy that you can say will continue to lift it," Mr. Frank said. "And we won't be revisited by a lot of the strength that we've already seen, such as autos and housing."
For that reason, he said the market could rally in the second half of the year as inflation fears ease. "Yields may not come down to the old lows in 1994 before inflation fears kicked in, but certainly they'll be close enough," Mr. Frank said.

HEADLINE: Annual Ritual Begins as Cuomo and Legislators Argue Over Forecasts of Tax Revenue

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 2

 BODY:
The backroom sparring over the state budget began in earnest this week as Democratic and Republican legislative leaders said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has underestimated tax revenues for the coming fiscal year, and they called on him to make deeper tax cuts and increase spending on schools, parks and social programs.
The economic forecasts released this week by the Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Republican-controlled State Senate are nominally based on the same general premise as projections released by Mr. Cuomo in January: that the state's economy is improving, but only sluggishly. 
 Yet in arriving at different estimates of tax revenues for the fiscal year beginning on April 1 -- both the Assembly and the Senate say Mr. Cuomo has underestimated those revenues by about $450 million -- the legislators and the Governor demonstrated that such forecasting can be bent to political aims, particularly in an election year.
 
A Middle Course
 For Mr. Cuomo, who is seeking his fourth term, that aim has been to steer a middle course between tax-cut advocates in the Senate and social spending advocates in the Assembly, all while trying to fashion himself the strong steward of an economy battered by two recessions.
Thus, in his proposed $33.4 billion budget, Mr. Cuomo has recommended only moderate tax cuts and moderate spending increases. And in issuing a more conservative economic forecast than both houses, Mr. Cuomo has positioned himself to chide the lawmakers for being spendthrifts.
"I've tried to get them to spend less, but they are going to say let's spend, spend, spend," Mr. Cuomo said of the Republicans this week. "That's what they've been doing for the last 12 years."
But legislators from both major parties -- whose political survival often depends on how much state aid they win for constituents -- say Mr. Cuomo has purposely low-balled his revenue estimates to parry their demands for cutting taxes or expanding programs.
"Again this year, the Governor would deny New Yorkers significant tax relief by underestimating revenues," said the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican. "It is critical that our priority be tax relief to help prime our economic resurgence."
 
Revenue Projections
 Though the differences between the legislative leaders and Mr. Cuomo are not small, they are not as large as in past years. For that reason, all three sides say that an agreement on revenue projections, traditionally the starting point for serious negotiations over spending, could be reached this week.
That would leave negotiators on schedule to pass an on-time budget by April 1, something they have not been able to do for nine years running. To do that, they will have to agree by March 24, before the Passover and Easter holidays, to avoid pushing negotiations into the second week of April.
Once they agree on a revenue figure, the legislators and Mr. Cuomo will have to decide how to allocate the additional money.
The Senate Republicans, who say they believe the state will collect $458 million more than Mr. Cuomo has projected, want the money used to increase aid to suburban schools and for sharp cuts in an array of business taxes.
 
Ending State Hotel Tax
 Though Mr. Cuomo has called for reducing the corporate surcharge and phasing out the state hotel tax on rooms costing more than $100 a night, the Senate has proposed making deeper cuts in the surcharge and eliminating the hotel tax this year. They have also proposed reducing the personal income tax.
The Senate's tax-cutting agenda would cost the state more than $1 billion in the fiscal year starting on April 1. That money could come not only from improving tax revenues but also from cuts in welfare programs, aides to Mr. Marino say.
The Assembly Democrats contend that the state will collect $448 million more than Mr. Cuomo predicts. They want that money used to restore cuts in Medicaid services proposed by Mr. Cuomo and for additional aid to urban schools. They are also preparing their own economic development package that would provide tax relief to poor families and to businesses that create new jobs.
"We would like to target money to create jobs," said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat.
The three sides must also grapple with how to use an anticipated surplus in the current budget. Mr. Cuomo's aides estimate that this surplus will grow to about $700 million by March 31. The Senate estimates the surplus will be $760 million; the Assembly, about $815 million.
Mr. Cuomo has recommended using $110 million of the money to begin a state takeover of local Medicaid costs this year. New York City's Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has endorsed the plan, but the Senate and the Assembly have not agreed to it.
 
To Improve Credit Rating
 Mr. Cuomo has also called for using surplus money on several measures intended to improve the state's credit rating. Those include repaying in this fiscal year a $120 million Medicaid payment not due until the next fiscal year and adding $82 million to a special fund to cover state litigation costs. Legislative leaders have not yet endorsed those ideas.
The legislative leaders are also expected to reject some of Mr. Cuomo's revenue-raising ideas, including his proposals to collect unclaimed bottle deposits from beverage wholesalers and to create a new Keno game. If they do, they will have to plug a $124 million hole in the budget, probably using the surplus.
"Our theme is don't read the $448 million as real yet," said one Assembly leader. "Not until you've found the money to replace all the things the Governor wants that you aren't willing to do."

HEADLINE: Rise in German Money Supply Roils Markets in the U.S.

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
There were few American economic statistics to stampede the high-strung financial markets yesterday, so stock and bond traders looked all the way to Germany for their daily dose of excitement, and the stock market fell sharply, then surprisingly rebounded, in heavy trading.
The Dow, which plunged 50.65 points at one point, closed up 22.51 points, at 3,831.74. The Dow's gyrations of more than 76 points for the day set off the anti-program trading rules of the New York Stock Exchange for the second time in five sessions. 
 The violent price movements underscored how American anxiety about inflation has spread to world markets, where ambiguous data on the recovering American and European economies have prodded traders both here and overseas into looking for the smallest sign of resurgent inflation.
At the very least, the session also showed how reluctant American investors were to participate in the much-heralded correction in stock prices.
 
 
German Money Supply
 The proximate cause of yesterday's turmoil was clear. Europe, shocked by news that the German money supply had expanded sharply, shunned United States Treasury bonds, which the American stock market had been watching for inflation news of its own. The yield on the long bond soared to 6.93 percent in early morning trading overseas, a level not seen since late May 1993, then fell back to 6.76 percent, a decline of 1 basis point from the day earlier. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The few economic statistics that were reported yesterday were generally positive for fighting inflation, so the markets ignored them. January personal income decreased three-tenths of 1 percent, instead of the expected rise of three-tenths of 1 percent. New-home sales in January equaled an annual rate of 695,000, below the expected 750,000. On the other hand, January personal consumption rose five-tenths of 1 percent, more than the anticipated three-tenths of a percent.
"It's unbelievable what we pay attention to sometimes," said Frederic T. Leiner, bond market strategist for Continental Bank in Chicago, referring to the report by the Bundesbank that a measure of the Germany money supply jumped at an annual rate of 20.6 percent in January. But he expects the American stock and bond markets to stabilize soon, if the rise in long-term bond rates persists above 6.75 percent.
 
 
'Negative Effects'
 "Long-term rates are high enough that we'll begin to see negative effects on the economy" that will dampen whatever inflation exists, Mr. Leiner said.
For his part, Donald W. Kimsey, senior stock market analyst for Smith Barney Shearson, sees a decline in stock prices continuing for months, perhaps into the third quarter. Like a bus driver accelerating, then braking, the decline is "not going to be nice and neat," he said.
Today -- when February car and truck sales are due to be reported -- may be relatively tranquil compared with tomorrow's session, when the Government releases data on the February unemployment rate and the rise in nonfarm payrolls.
The Dow's gyrations yesterday set off "circuit breakers," which are designed to slow the lightning-fast reflexes of computer-guided trading programs and begin when the Dow moves 50 points or more from the previous day's close. A 250-point decline would lead to a one-hour trading halt; 400 points two hours.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index, meanwhile, rose 0.37 point, to 464.81. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 5.17 points, to 783.47.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.34 point, to 257.47, on volume of 361.1 million shares. But declining stocks led advancing stocks by 1,404 to 788. The American Stock Exchange market value index closed down 3.64 points at 466.32.
The stock market still has far to go to complete the widely expected correction. Elaine Garzarelli, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, has said she expects a price drop of up to 7 percent following the Fed's Feb. 4 interest rate increase. That would imply a Dow of about 3690, an S.& P. 500 of about 447 and a Nasdaq index of about 742.
In a report issued yesterday, Ms. Garzarelli was even less bullish than before. She said her statistical model of the market had declined to 57.5 percent from 63.5 percent; a reading below 30 percent is a sell signal.
Economically sensitive stocks continued to show strength yesterday, as they have recently. The highest price increases in the 30 Dow component stocks were for such companies. Caterpillar rose 3 1/8, to 112; General Motors gained 2 3/8, to 60 1/2; Chevron advanced 2 1/8, to 87 1/4, and Alcoa rose 2, to 76 1/2.

HEADLINE: 'Creeping Crash' Is New Investment Nightmare

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
When Americans worry about the stock market, they dread The Big One, a crash like the 1987 stock market meltdown. But after a three-year rally that carried the Dow Jones industrial average up almost 70 percent to a record high, the stock market seems to be edging down slowly but inexorably. And some investment veterans increasingly fear something worse than the crash.
Their nightmare is that stocks will suffer gradual but persistent declines, the financial version of Chinese water torture. Such a "creeping crash" would mark the return of traditional bear markets, the slow and painful sort that prevailed before the 1980's. 
 While changes in investing habits, regulations and technology can work to prevent a quick, sharp drop, Wall Street savants argue, no one has repealed the cycles that bring bear markets and falling prices.
For investors, especially the relative neophytes who have been pouring billions of dollars a month into equities through mutual funds, a creeping crash would be even more traumatic that a sharp plunge.
A slow-motion crash would come as a surprise. Since 1982, every time investors have lost money in stocks, the pain has been over quickly and the recovery has been swift. Indeed, people have profited by "buying the dips," which works only if stocks rebound; in a slow-moving decline, that would amount to throwing good money after bad.
Millions of Americans have found a comfortable home in the stock market, confident that they can ignore the market's day-to-day gyrations because in the long run stocks will go up. But in a prolonged slide, the long run could well turn out to be five years or more. Everyone who had to sell their stocks or mutual funds in the meantime -- to buy a house, send a child to college, or for retirement -- could end up with a lot less money than they had expected or needed.
Even if their losses were only on paper, people would feel poorer, which would make them reluctant to borrow or spend. A long and deep decline, some economists say, could slash corporate profits and retard economic growth.
But the worst effect of a creeping crash would be psychological: it would destroy the confidence and optimism of millions of people who have not lived through a prolonged bear market. For those who survived the last one, which began in 1973, it was an epic event, one they recall the way soldiers remember their worst campaigns. Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president of Charles Schwab & Company, summed it up in one word: "Pain."
To be sure, the stock market could climb from here; yesterday, the Dow plunged more than 50 points before rebounding sharply, closing the day up 22.5 points. But the gurus on Wall Street generally agree that the bear market is coming closer. And when the rally ends, it will not go with a bang, but with a long, drawn-out whimper.
"I don't think it's true, but it's certainly possible that we're in a bear market," said David Shulman, an equity strategist at Salomon Brothers. "But when we do have one, and I can guarantee you we will, it will be a drip, drip, drip one."
The Dow has already tumbled almost 4 percent since the end of January, but the decline has not come in one fell swoop. The Dow plunged 96 points on Feb. 4, after the Federal Reserve raised a key interest rate, but stocks worked their way back up almost to their previous high. The Dow closed up on more than a third of the trading days in February.
Still, the trend over all has been down, and choppy, leaving the Dow up just 2 percent for the year, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index slightly in the red.
A creeping slide would be a big change from the market meltdowns of recent memory. In the "Saddam Hussein" stock drop of 1990, the market tumbled more than 20 percent in 90 days. But the carnage quickly ended, and it was only a matter of months before investors recouped their losses.
 
Similarities to 1987
 That is also what happened in the crash in 1987, when the Dow plunged 508 points in one day, a drop of more than 20 percent. But by December stocks had begun to rise again. The brave souls who started buying stocks soon scored big gains.
That is not the way earlier bear markets had worked. The downdraft that began in 1980 lasted 21 months and slowly cut stock prices by 27 percent. The bear market that started in 1968 took 18 months to knock down stock prices by 36 percent.
The grizzly of all bear markets, which began in 1973, lasted for 21 months and ground down stock prices by almost 50 percent. If such a market decline began today, the Dow would touch 2,000 by the fall of 1995.
But memories are short, and investment professionals who deal with the public are worried. "If we get a correction that lasts six months, you'll see people jumping out of windows," said Harold Evensky, a financial adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. Preparing his clients for a long, slow decline, he added, "is our major concern -- what we spend most of our time on."
 
A Rush to Equity Investing
 Many Americans have plunged into equity investing in the last five years, driven by falling interest rates that slashed the returns they could get in more conservative vehicles like bank certificates of deposit. More recently people have been shoveling money into stock funds because they are optimistic about the economy.
But the new investors have heard that they should use every drop in the stock market as a chance to go bargain hunting, and that advice has paid off. Indeed, the willingness of Americans to buy stocks whenever the market has suffered a setback has helped keep the market buoyant through the longest rally in history.
But there are signs that the stock market rally may have run out of steam, leaving it vulnerable to a downturn. Figures from AMG Data Services, a company in Arcata, Calif., that tracks funds, indicate that while huge sums continue to flow into mutual funds, the inflow is slowing. Half the money is going to funds that invest only overseas, which will not help United States markets.
 
'Anything Could go Wrong'
 Eventually, Americans will run out of money. "Households own more equities now than any time since the early 1970's," said Gail Dudack, a strategist for S. G. Warburg & Company. "It's not a record level, but anything could go wrong now -- say the U.S. market gets choppy -- and those money flows could grind to a halt." Ms. Dudack had predicted a decline of 10 percent in the Dow when the index neared 4,000. "And I feel that if I'm wrong, it's because it might be more," she said.
Without cash to push up stock prices, the market may become vulnerable to the problems that have been looming for some time. By traditional measures -- earnings, dividend yields, book value -- the stock market is radically overvalued, according to data from the Leuthold Group, a research company in Minneapolis. Indeed, only when compared with short-term Treasury bills do stocks look cheap. And short-term interest rates have hit bottom and are, in the words of Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, more likely to rise than fall.
"Ratcheting downwards -- that's the way you should think of it," said Byron R. Wien, director of United States portfolio strategy for Morgan Stanley. "The market is vulnerable to the most serious correction it's had since the fall of 1990."

Dollar Drops as Mark Rises And Stocks and Bonds Fall

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most foreign currencies yesterday, as fears of German inflation supported the mark and trade tensions with Japan pushed up the yen.
Early steep losses in United States stock and bond markets also put pressure on the dollar, dealers said. 
 "Everything was chaotic this morning with the dollar weakening due to the horrific German money supply figures and weaker stocks and bonds markets," said William Arnold, chief foreign exchange dealer for the Chemical Banking Corporation.
A closely watched measure of German money supply used by the Bundesbank rose 20.6 percent in January. The report dashed hopes of any near-term cut in official German rates, and the dollar tumbled in early trading. Money supply growth is viewed by some economists as a sign of inflation.
The dollar settled at 1.7043 marks in late New York trading from 1.7085 on Tuesday.
While German central bank officials attributed much of the rise to special factors, many dealers said the news spurred prospects that interest rates would remain steady for now.
The dollar also tumbled on overnight reports that President Clinton was set to renew a unilateral trade tool known as Super 301 to put pressure on Japan to open its markets.
The news sparked fear of a United States-Japan trade war and sent the dollar to its lows. A late-morning statement by President Clinton that no final decision had been made on Super 301 lifted the dollar off its lows, dealers said.
Later in the day, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said he did not expect a trade war with Japan but that the two sides would work on the dispute "in good faith."
Nevertheless, traders remained skeptical about the dollar's outlook against the yen. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 104.25 Japanese yen, down from 104.60 on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery dropped to $378.90 an ounce, from $379.40 an ounce on Tuesday.
Also, the British pound rose to $1.4964 in late New York trading, from $1.4895 Monday.
Other late New York dollar rates, compared with Monday's quotes, included: 1.4318 Swiss francs, down from 1.4367, 5.8055 French francs, down from 5.8170; $1.3530 (Canadian), up from $1.3512 (Canadian), and 1,685 Italian lire, down from 1,692.

Economists are keen to give the inflation-proof bond a try.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
HAVE interest rates on United States Treasury bonds soared because the demand for capital is blooming along with the American economy? Or are frightened lenders simply reacting to the first whispers of inflation in the air?
The question kept popping up at last Saturday's meeting in Germany of finance ministers and central bankers of the major industrial nations, in spite of the more pressing issue on the agenda of aid to Russia. And it obviously bothers the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who, while too much the old-school gentleman to say so, is vexed by talk that he might let inflation get out of hand. 
 By no coincidence, Mr. Greenspan last week again raised the notion of creating a different sort of Government security whose market price would provide a nearly definitive test of whether investors are indeed frightened by inflation: bonds with both the interest payments and redemption value indexed to the cost of living.
The idea has yet to catch the fancy of the Treasury, which, according to the Congressional Budget Office, has clear legal authority to issue an inflation-proof bond. Indexed bonds are already a marketing success in Britain, where one new Government bond in five is linked to consumer prices. And fresh talk of indexing is cheering up some academic specialists, who have long been enamored of the prospect. "Is there any economist who doesn't like indexed bonds?" asked Robert Hall of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.
A garden-variety bond carries a fixed interest "coupon" and a set redemption payment -- say, interest of $35 every six months for 30 years and a payment of $1,000 at the end. But the market value of such a bond over its life is driven by a variety of forces. Part of the interest, after all, represents the expected real return on capital, while part is compensation for the expected fall in the purchasing power of the dollar. Mr. Greenspan would like to know which part is which, in order to assay expectations about price changes.
That is where indexed bonds fit in. Suppose Uncle Sam issued a bond where both the interest coupon and the redemption value rose with the general price level. Since the interest rate demanded by investors need not include a premium for expected inflation, the difference in market interest between the indexed bond and the rate on an ordinary bond of the same maturity ought to reflect expectations of inflation.
Suppose, for example, that regular 30-year bonds yield 7 percent and the comparable 30-year indexed bond yields 3 percent plus an annual cost-of-living adjustment. That would imply investors expected inflation to average the difference (4 percent) over the next three decades. Well, not quite: a piece of the four percentage point difference may represent the return that investors would willingly give up to know for certain what their investment would be worth in the future. But Benjamin Friedman, an economist at Harvard University, thinks it would be "close enough" to be informative.
Actually, the idea of creating a window on inflation expectations is not the first virtue of indexed bonds that comes to economists' minds. James Tobin, the Nobel laureate in economics at Yale University, sees it as a dandy way for investors, particularly "small, unsophisticated investors," to save for retirement.
As important, Mr. Tobin suggests, indexed Government bonds would make it possible for big financial institutions to hedge their own long-term inflation risks, allowing insurance companies, pension funds and banks to market inflation-proof retirement products.
Then, too, Mr. Hall argues, indexed bonds would reduce the Government's temptation to inflate its way out of debt. "No one should want the Government to write i.o.u.'s in ordinary dollars if the Government controls the future value of the dollar," he said.
Last but hardly least, issuing indexed bonds should save money -- especially in times when the public is irrationally skittish about inflation. Mr. Hall was a member of an advisory committee to the Reagan Administration that proposed an indexed bonds-only policy, a seemingly natural fit for a President committed to a low-inflation policy. "If they had taken our advice," he recalls wistfully, "they would have saved a half-trillion dollars in interest."
If indexed bonds are indeed the best idea since knee guards for skaters, why hasn't the Treasury already issued them? In fact, the Treasury has accumulated piles of studies favoring indexation, but has yet to act.
The Treasury's reluctance reflects the worry of getting stuck with the bill for an unanticipated burst of inflation -- hardly a sterling rationale if the alternative is to stick it to the public. But in part, too, it reflects skepticism that investors are ready for something new.
That skepticism frustrates policy makers who want to give indexed bonds a try. "Suppose we gave the party," one Government official suggested. "Nothing terrible would happen if nobody came."

HEADLINE: Inflation and Rate Worries Sink Stocks Across Europe

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 2

 BODY:
Investors drove down the price of stocks and bonds across Europe today on fears that inflation may be on the rise in the United States and that interest rate cuts in Germany may come more slowly than expected.
With markets in London, Frankfurt, Paris and other financial centers gripped by a doggedly negative psychology, prices fell precipitously early in the day, with the London stock market at one stage down by 75 points, or 2.3 percent. 
 Over the last month, the markets, which opened on a bullish note in 1994, have fallen 7.7 percent in London, nearly 9 percent in Paris and more than 7 percent in Frankfurt.
Prices recovered later in the day in most European markets today as investors again began focusing on the more positive long-term outlook, including the likelihood that European interest rate reductions would continue, albeit at a slightly slower pace, and that a gradual economic recovery would help corporate profits and share prices.
"It was an extremely volatile day driven by fear in the markets rather than by the economic fundamentals," said Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel & Company, an investment firm in London. "The economic fundamentals still point to weak growth in Europe and therefore to further downward pressure on inflation and to further cuts in interest rates."
In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading issues closed at 3,248.1, down 22.5 points for the day. French shares lost 38.46 points, with the CAC-40 index closing in Paris at 2,144.66. Share prices in Germany fell to a three-month low as Frankfurt's DAX-30 index dropped 46.72 points, to 2,020.33.
Stock prices in Spain, Belgium and Sweden also fell sharply.
The selloffs continued a downward trend that began early last month when the Federal Reserve nudged up some short-term interest rates in the United States. Most European share prices had already fallen sharply on Tuesday on fear of renewed American inflationary pressure.
In the European bond markets, where many investors have suffered big losses over the last several weeks, prices swung wildly during the day and closed mostly lower. The prices of German bonds fell especially sharply, with the yield on the 6 percent coupon bond due in 2003 jumping to 6.39 percent, from 6.19 percent on Tuesday.
Selling of French Government bond futures was so intense early in the day in Paris that trading had to be halted temporarily, but prices later recovered after hitting a seven-month low. British Government bonds closed up slightly.
Many large institutional investors and hedge funds have suffered big losses in European bonds and in the currency markets in recent weeks, and analysts said some of today's selling may have reflected their need to raise cash to cover their positions.
 
 
German Inflation Indicator
 But the main trigger for the selloff today was the release of figures showing a much higher-than-anticipated rise in a key indicator of inflation in Germany. The indicator, a measure of money supply known as M-3, showed a 20.6 percent annualized rate of growth for January. Bundesbank officials had warned over the last month that the figure would be distorted by technical factors and that the markets should not read too much into it.
Even so, the rise was far higher than even the most negative forecasts, and suggested to many traders that the German central bank would feel restricted in its ability to stimulate the economy out of its torpor through further interest rate cuts out of fear of kindling a fierce level of inflation.
"The M-3 figure has confirmed a slowdown in the pace of rate reduction in Germany without eliminating it," Warren Oliver, an economist at S. G. Warburg Securities in London, said.
Without a continuation of the Bundesbank's general policy of small but steady rate reductions, other European nations, especially France, would have difficulty reducing their own rates without risking a sharp devaluation of their currencies. As a result, German economic and monetary policy ripples across Europe and through the European markets.
 
 
Following Frankfurt
 "The other European economies will find it difficult to move on their own," Robert Thomas, an economist at NatWest Capital Markets in London, said. "All of them are going to be forced to take their cue from Frankfurt."
The markets, analysts said, were particularly sensitive to the news from Germany because of the report on Tuesday that a widely followed economic indicator in the United States, the National Association of Purchasing Managers' price index, suggested that inflationary pressures could be increasing there.
A resurgence of inflation would lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again, a step that would decrease the value of bonds and make stocks relatively less attractive to investors.

Wallboard Maker Picks Top Officer

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
The National Gypsum Company said yesterday that it had named Stephen M. Humphrey president and chief executive of the nation's No. 2 wallboard maker, effective March 21.
Mr. Humphrey's appointment is the second in as many months at National Gypsum, which has experienced a number of management changes that began during its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization hearings. 
 The company, based in Charlotte, N.C., emerged from under Chapter 11 after nearly three years under court protection last July 1.
Mr. Humphrey, 49, is currently the president of highway products for the Rockwell International Corporation's automotive division. He succeeds Peter C. Browning, the previous chairman, president and chief executive, who left the company on Oct. 31 for a post as executive vice president of the Sunoco Products Company.
Last month, Mr. Browning was succeeded as chairman by C. D. Spangler Jr., whose family-owned Golden Eagle Industries of Charlotte controls about 10 percent of National Gypsum's stock.
Another high-ranking executive, J. Michael Conaway, previously National Gypsum's chief financial officer, left the company in December 1992 to join the Fluor Corporation. He has not been replaced.
 
 
'Well-Rounded Individual'
 Mr. Humphrey, whose background would not seem to make him an obvious choice for the job, "is a well- rounded individual who is the kind of person we're looking for to fill the C.E.O. job," said Allan V. Cecil, a company spokesman.
At Rockwell, Mr. Humphrey is responsible for a $1.3 billion truck component business. He previously had sales and marketing jobs with the General Electric Company.
The housing industry's collapse during the recession pushed debt-laden National Gypsum into chapter 11 in 1990. The company could not service its $2 billion debt, taken on in a management-led buyout in 1986.
While new owners of a once-bankrupt company might be expected to make management changes, Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer for National Gypsum's creditors, sees the departures in a different light.
The new owners' loyalty to old management apparently only lasted as long as they proved useful. "I'm sure it was all done in a polite way," he said. "But from looking at what happened you can see the sentiment."
The previous management proposed a pessimistic business plan that pulled down the company's expected revenue projections. Junior creditors opposed the plan. A section that was ultimately severed from the version approved by the court included management contracts that pushed up salaries, bonuses and severance for five officers, including Mr. Browning and Mr. Conaway. Their actual severance terms have not yet been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Bienenstock said.
Since National Gypsum issued new shares at $14 in July after emerging from bankruptcy, the company has raised prices and cut its work force. Last month, it reported fourth-quarter earnings of $14.1 million, compared with a loss of $33.5 million a year earlier. Yesterday, the company's shares closed at $40.75, down 50 cents, in Nasdaq trading.
Strong housing demand has helped buoy margins at National Gypsum, which has a 25 percent share of the wallboard market, second to USG Corporation's 35 percent. Single family housing starts last year reached their highest level since 1986.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 11, 1994, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on March 3 about a change in leadership at the National Gypsum Company referred incorrectly to the disclosure of severance terms for the previous chief executive and chief financial officer. Details of the executives' departures were indeed disclosed in Federal filings, in March and November 1993; the executives received no severance pay, as their departures were voluntary.
The article also referred incorrectly to a business plan submitted by the previous management. National Gypsum said the plan was not intentionally pessimistic.

HEADLINE: Union Chiefs Accept Plan On Severance

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
The leaders of New York City's municipal labor unions said yesterday that they would accept one of the essential components of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's preliminary budget plan: severance payments to cut at least 7,600 jobs from the government payroll.
Details of the severance package have not yet been negotiated, and the unions said they would seek the best possible deal for workers willing to leave city government. 
 But the willingness to accept the loss of so many city jobs appeared to reflect a realization by the unions that the Mayor was serious in his intent to reduce the size of city government and that a severance package was better than wholesale layoffs.
The Mayor still needs the approval of the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation to use $200 million in a M.A.C. surplus fund to offer the severance package to workers.
Despite accepting the severance plan, the union leaders were sharply critical of the Mayor's plan to close a $2.3 billion gap in next year's budget by making deep reductions in spending and cutting 15,000 jobs.
 
Services at Issue
 In announcing the response by the Municipal Labor Committee, a coalition of the city's labor unions, Stanley Hill, the committee's chairman, said the plan was "top-heavy against workers" and would diminish services for New Yorkers.
But given the considerable concessions the Mayor has demanded from the unions in his budget plans, the committee's response appeared restrained when compared to the confrontational statements heard from the city's labor leaders in past showdowns with mayors over budget cuts.
Mr. Hill said the union leaders were willing to negotiate with the Mayor. And he pointedly would not reject any concessions Mr. Giuliani had demanded out of hand.
"We're not accepting anything right now," Mr. Hill, who is president of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said at a news conference at the council's headquarters on Barclay Street near City Hall. "But we're willing to deal with this problem, knowing there's a $2.3 billion deficit out there."
 
Linchpin in Mayor's Plan
 The severance package is a linchpin of Mr. Giuliani's plan to balance the city's $31.2 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1. The Mayor has said he favors offering severance rather than resorting to layoffs, because it has less impact on city services.
The job cuts would fall heavily in the agencies that serve the city's poor, including a target of 3,600 jobs -- or almost half the total -- in the Department of Social Services, city officials say.
The details of the plan, including the amount of the severance packages and the number of workers to be offered them, will be determined after negotiations between the unions and the Mayor's office.
Mr. Hill said the unions would hold their first talks with Randy Levine, the Commissioner of Labor, who heads the Mayor's negotiations, on March 8. Mr. Hill said Mr. Levine outlined the administration's initial offer in a telephone call last weekend. Although the Mayor's office has declined to spell out publicly the details of its severance offer, an official said yesterday that it would include cash payments based on salary and the number of years of service, as well as health benefits for as long as a year after workers leave the payroll. Mr. Hill said the packages would still allow workers to receive unemployment compensation.
An important concession that the Mayor's aides say they need to make the severance plan work involves an agreement by the unions to allow the redeployment of workers between city agencies. The Mayor's budget director, Abraham M. Lackman, said this week that with an agreement on reassignments, the severance would be offered to about 70,000 workers to reach the total of 7,600.
Appearing with the leaders of many of the city's unions, Mr. Hill said that the unions would bargain for "a much more attractive package" of severance comparable to those offered by private companies.
Beyond the general agreement on severance, the response by the Municipal Labor Committee, whose 50 unions represent almost 300,000 public employees, included some pointed criticism of many of the Mayor's assumptions in his budget plan.
The report challenged Mr. Giuliani's contention that the municipal work force is too large, arguing that it is comparable to other major cities. And it said that the Mayor had underestimated revenues for the next fiscal year by as much as $200 million and could save hundreds of millions more by improvements in the way agencies spend money on supplies.
The unions' leaders also made it clear that another important element of the Mayor's plan -- the use of $200 million in savings from the pension funds for the city's unionized workers -- needed to have their agreement.
The committee also called on the Mayor to involve workers in the review of city agencies for waste and to share savings from productivity measures with the workers, something one administration official said yesterday was not out of the question.
The Mayor's office reacted cooly to the unions' criticisms of the preliminary budget plan. One administration official said the unions offered no real alternatives for closing the $2.3 billion gap. "There's not a single proposal in it," the official said.
While Mr. Hill said the unions would keep all their options open, noting that a strike or other job action "is always possible," the unions appeared unwilling to confront the new Mayor directly at this point.
Capt. Richard D. Brower of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association said the unions would give the Mayor a chance. "Nobody," he added, "is looking for a fight."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Japan Cellular Pact Held Near

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 3

 BODY:
The United States and Japan are moving closer to an agreement that would avert pending sanctions against Japan by vastly accelerating access to Japan's cellular telephone market for American equipment.
The talks, in which a powerful Japanese politician is playing a behind-the-scenes role, could still veer off course. But people involved said an agreement could be reached as early as this weekend. 
 The accord is coming as Washington continues to weigh further retaliatory measures against Japan in the wake of the breakdown last month of broad trade negotiations under the new framework signed by the two nations last year.
 
 
Accord Could Cool Tensions
 An agreement on cellular phones could help cool trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and could influence the Clinton Administration to give Japan more time on other areas.
However, a cellular phone agreement by itself would not solve the bigger question of what to do about framework negotiations. There the main issue has been whether Japan would accept numerical goals for opening its markets to foreign goods and services.
President Clinton last month announced that the United States would impose sanctions on Japan for violation of a 1989 trade treaty aimed at providing access for cellular equipment made by Motorola Inc.
But the list of proposed Japanese products on which tariffs would be placed is not expected to be disclosed until the middle of this month. The sword hanging over its head had induced the Japanese side to make concessions, some officials said.
 
 
'Comparable Market Access'
 In the 1989 accord, Japan agreed to provide "comparable market access" for Motorola in the region from Tokyo to Nagoya. A cellular telephone company that was already operating in that region -- using different technology -- was persuaded by Japan's Government to build a second system using the Motorola technology.
But the company, Nippon Idou Tsushin Corporation, known as IDO, invested far more heavily in its first system, which used technology developed by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation. As a result, IDO now has about 310,000 subscribers using the N.T.T. technology compared with a little more than 10,000 subscribers using the Motorola technology.
A new agreement being forged by Motorola and IDO calls for IDO to vastly accelerate the construction of base stations using the Motorola equipment.
Those involved in the talks say the the two companies have pretty much agreed on a timetable for IDO to build the Motorola infrastructure. That schedule would be close to Motorola's demand that 159 new base stations be built within 18 months. Previously IDO had said it would build 130 new base stations over the next three years, and that it did not have the financial resources to do any more or go any faster.
 
 
Other Issues
 There are still other issues to be worked out. The United States wants IDO to actively promote the Motorola system while freezing further development of new base stations and new channels for the system using N.T.T. technology.
And the United States Government wants the Japanese Government to guarantee that IDO carries out its promises. A Japanese official said today that it would be difficult for the Government to guarantee a commitment by a private company.
One catalyst for the negotiations, which began in earnest last weekend, was the involvement of Ichiro Ozawa, a politician who is the chief strategist of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition Government. Mr. Ozawa has been meeting privately with the United States Ambassador, Walter Mondale, about cellular phones and other issues.
Mr. Ozawa, a fixer whom the American Government has relied upon in the past to override Japan's bureaucracy, negotiated the 1989 cellular phone agreement.

HEADLINE: Indian Chief and Waterbury's Mayor Announce Plan for a Casino

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., March 3

 BODY:
The leaders of an embattled Indian tribe and a financially struggling Connecticut city joined today in an imaginative economic development project intended to solve all their problems and realize all their dreams: a gigantic casino that would generate more than a billion dollars a year.
The city, Waterbury, would give the tribe, the Golden Hill Paugussetts, land for a casino, resort hotel, museum, bingo hall and tribal village, relieving the nearly landless tribe of the need for a legal war it is waging in several towns and cities to win back ancestral territory. 
 The Paugussetts, in return, would not only withdraw their land-claim suits, which have made real-estate transactions difficult in some towns, but would also pay Waterbury almost a third of their casino profits. The city would distribute half of that revenue, projected at more than $100 million a year, among other communities, and keep the remaining half.
So far, however, the agreement is only between Aurelius H. Piper Jr., known among the Paugussetts as Chief Quiet Hawk, and Edward D. Bergin, known in Waterbury as Mayor.
Before any casino opens high on a hilltop overlooking the Naugatuck River, little more than a mile south of Waterbury's best-known landmark, Holy Land U.S.A., Quiet Hawk must not only win Federal recognition for his tiny tribe and negotiate a gaming pact with the state, but also establish his authority over the Paugussetts themselves.
Today other tribal officers, who aided the state's defense against the Paugussett land claims last year by challenging Quiet Hawk's authority over the tribe in court, said they had never heard of the Waterbury plan.
"This Waterbury thing would have to go before the tribal council, and nobody in the tribe has heard of it," Snow Owl, a member of the Tribal Government Committee, said in a telephone interview from the tribe's small reservation in Colchester. "It's totally bogus."
Quiet Hawk's motives have been questioned almost from the day in 1992 when the Paugussetts filed their first land suit, claiming most of downtown Bridgeport, where City Hall sits atop Golden Hill. The tribe wasn't really a tribe, its opponents said, and its goal wasn't a reservation and self-sufficiency, but a casino like the Mashantucket Pequots had recently opened in eastern Connecticut.
The real goal of the land claims, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said, was to hold property owners hostage until the state agreed to help the Paugussetts win the Federal recognition and sovereignty they need to operate a casino.
As more suits were filed in Trumbull, Southbury and other towns, Quiet Hawk acknowledged that they were financed by out-of-state investors interested in a casino in the Bridgeport area. The casino, he said, was necessary to attract investors who would help the poor tribe pursue its claims.
He suggested that attacks on the tribe, whose members are descendants of interracial marriages, were racially motivated.
Today, reaction in Hartford was quiet. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who fought unsuccessfully to block the Pequot casino, was out of state. Lieut. Gov. Eunice Groark said the realization of the Waterbury plan was so far in the future that it was not worth thinking about.
Mr. Blumenthal, who only last week argued against an Indian land claim before a Federal appeals court, said the Paugussetts still needed Federal recognition to resolve any of their claims. Quiet Hawk is appealing the decision of a state judge who had dismissed the suit on grounds that he did not represent the Paugussetts.
 
Praise From Bridgeport
 But the plan announced by Mr. Bergin, the Waterbury Mayor, was cautiously praised by the Mayor of Bridgeport, Joseph Ganim, whose office sits on contested land and whose city, like Mr. Bergin's, has long sought new revenue to relieve homeowners of high property taxes.
"It sounds like he's put together a good deal that would give revenue to not only Waterbury but 90 other municipalities," Mr. Ganim said. "At the same time he would be able to extinguish existing land claims."
The first hurdle under the agreement is Mr. Bergin's. He cannot pursue the project unless residents endorse the concept in a city referendum. If they do, he would then lobby on behalf of the tribe's efforts to win Federal recognition and a gaming pact with the state.
 
Something for Everyone
 If the tribe can overcome those obstacles, Waterbury would give it 200 hilly acres of city-owned land on its southern border with the town of Naugatuck for the casino, hotel, museum and bingo hall. The city would later buy the tribe 500 acres, not necessarily in Waterbury, for its village.
The financial arrangements, as envisioned by Mr. Bergin, offer something to nearly everyone. At a time when the state says it can't afford property-tax relief for homeowners, Waterbury would receive 30 percent of the casino's profits, keeping half of that for itself and distributing the remaining 15 percent among 90 communities, using a formula based on their tax rates and the amount of public housing within their borders.
One percent of the profits would go to neighboring Naugatuck, for its troubles, and 1 percent would go to the town where Waterbury buys land for the tribal village.
The aid plan would bypass the state government, which this fiscal year distributed $88 million from the Pequots (received in return for barring slot machines anywhere else in Connecticut) to towns and cities.
 
A Plan for the Money
 Mr. Bergin has already sketched a plan for spending Waterbury's $100 million or more a year, in a city that is stretching, as it does in most years, to meet its $208 million annual budget.
While other Waterbury officials are likely to have their own ideas, he proposes that the money not go toward financing the general budget, but be dedicated to special uses, from property-tax rebates to neighborhood sports groups. A 2 percent share would finance the 500 acres due the tribe.
The largest single share, 25 percent, would go not to improve the city's schools, but to finance a student-voucher plan to allow families to choose private schools.
Mr. Bergin, who approached Quiet Hawk with his plan, used understatement in summing up the possibilities. "Obviously," he said, "if we're successful, we'll be able to address a lot of our problems."

HEADLINE: Big Investors Suffer as Foreign Markets Sour

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Investment firms and banks that like to make big bets in the world's financial markets routinely lose millions of dollars here and millions of dollars there on the expectation that taking risks with investments can reap handsome rewards.
But in the last few weeks big bets on European and Asian markets have gone suddenly and unexpectedly bad, and the millions here or there have grown to be more like billions of dollars and more, Wall Street investment experts say. 
 The losers include financiers like George Soros, who acknowledged losing $600 million because of a bet on the Japanese yen by his hedge funds, which make aggressive investments for large private investors and institutions. Bankers Trust is believed to have lost perhaps as much as $100 million trading foreign bonds in recent weeks, some analysts said.
The bets by Steinhardt Partners in world bond markets have led to a loss of 15 percent to 20 percent in the firm's funds so far this year, which translates into about $650 million.
Madis Senner, global bond portfolio manager for Chase Manhattan Private Bank, said he thought it was obvious why a lot of the bets, especially those in the European bond market, went wrong. But he was still a loser.
Why? Competitive pressure, he said. "I was 50 percent to 70 percent in cash last summer, and I started to underperform, so I put half to work at the top of the market," Mr. Senner said. "I would have been on the cover of Business Week but I buckled like a moron. Why did it catch me by surprise? Because the market kept going up and I had relative performance to be concerned about."
Lesser firms have also been hit, like Eastbridge Capital, which also suffered losses on the gamble that European bonds would rise in price. Instead, they fell when interest rates rose in the United States and the interest rate decline slowed in Europe.
As a result some firms have reigned in their traders and taken a more cautious stance, at least for now, after heavy losses.
"There is a lot less leverage in the market place today than a week ago," said William Ferrell, the head of Ferrell Capital Management, which runs a fund that invests in proprietary trading. "A lot of people are getting out of the market and getting clear to shore after the turmoil."
While hedge funds can move quickly, their size is dwarfed by the vast pools of money from longer-term investors like insurance companies and mutual funds. But these players have also been selling bonds and getting more cautious after their bets went wrong.
"I saw a portfolio manager at a very large Swiss bank last week who converted 40 percent of his fixed-income investments to cash over three days," Mr. Ferrell said. "He was very anxious about the market and didn't want to take a risk."
But many Wall Street experts and traders at the affected firms said the losses would not stop them from making such big bets again because they know that some losses are the cost of making big profits. "If you could make the money they do without occasionally taking a good beating, everyone would want to do it," Paul DeRosa, managing director of Eastbridge Capital, said of the big trading firms.
And while acknowledging the losses on these bets, many firms still argue that they are ahead for the year so far. In response to speculation about losses on Wednesday, Bankers Trust said it had made a profit over all so far this year. People close to the firm said the trading operations were still in the black.
Firms are also apparently not blaming their losses on individual traders.
"Anyone lost their jobs? Not a single soul," said Peter Gonye, a principal of Egon Zehnder International, an executive search firm. "This is a systemic problem, and no one individual can be faulted for their judgment when it is psychological and not fundamental factors that have caused the market to trade down."
 
A Bank Undaunted
 At Bankers Trust, the traders are largely on the sidelines now, but the bank is undaunted and ready to jump back into the market, said Kelly Doherty, the head of the global trading group.
"Our level of activity is low because there don't seem to be as many obvious trends," Mr. Doherty said. "If we feel we will have a good idea next week, we will do what we always do -- we'll go after it."
Even if the bank had made some wrong bets on the markets, Mr. Doherty said, it had not changed its commitment to proprietary trading -- taking bets on markets for its own account.
"We believe our approach to risk management is solid and I certainly don't want to change it," he said. "Over time, that is what will distinguish us in the market."
"This is not an easy business," he added. "It isn't the leading contributor to earnings every month or every quarter, but we have tried to approach it consistently."
 
Some Windfall Profits
 It has been difficult to determine how much a firm has been hurt when particular trading bets have gone bad because traders in other parts of the firm who make different bets may be making money at the same time.
At some firms, traders of derivatives have had windfall profits because the markets have been more volatile than expected. Derivatives are transactions based on underlying markets, like an option on currency or interest rates.
In general, derivatives traders set up complex portfolios that are hedged so they are not sensitive to the up-and-down movements of the markets. Instead, they bet on whether markets will be volatile or calm. And at one big bank, the traders took a large position in January that the market would be volatile and it paid off handsomely.
The funds Mr. Soros manages lost $600 million on Feb. 14 by betting that the yen would continue to fall against the dollar. It did not. After trade talks between Japan and the United States broke down, the yen surged by 5 percent in one day. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive, which is why the Clinton Administration has tried to push up the yen.

Bullish Chrysler Moves To Beef Up Auto Plants

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 3

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation, bullish about its long-term prospects after introducing several highly acclaimed new car and truck models, said today that it would spend $1.8 billion over three years to increase its manufacturing capacity by 17 percent.
Chrysler's move could be among the first of many in spirited jockeying among the Big Three auto makers to capitalize on rising vehicle sales -- particularly of sport-utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans -- over the next two to three years. The Ford Motor Company has been trying to squeeze extra capacity from its assembly lines, especially for its hot-selling utility vehicles and light trucks, and the General Motors Corporation recently announced actions to increase truck capacity.
 
Thousands of New Jobs
 Chrysler said it was undertaking a series of actions, including canceling its plans to shut down one of its two assembly plants near St. Louis. Over all, Chrysler will increase its worldwide vehicle-making capacity to 3.5 million units a year from about 3 million currently. The increase is expected to generate as many as 6,000 jobs in the United States and Canada, the auto maker said. Some jobs will go to laid-off union members but at least several thousand new workers will be hired. 
 Chrysler "wants to be a strong player, and in recent history they haven't been," said J. Michael Losh, G.M. vice president and group executive for car and truck divisions. The distinctively styled Dodge Ram pickup has been a hot seller since it was introduced last fall; Chrysler's decision to expand production assures much tougher competition for full-size pickups from Ford and G.M., which had the market mostly to themselves for many years.
"We realize that we have to strike while the iron is hot, and nowhere is the demand hotter than in Jeep and Dodge Ram pickup truck sales," said Robert J. Eaton, chairman and chief executive of the No. 3 auto maker. "If we don't move ahead now, we might miss opportunities for improved sales in North America, including exports to Mexico under Nafta. At the same time, we could lose jobs that new sales could bring."
Among its various moves, Chrysler said it would cancel plans to shut a plant in Fenton, Mo., known as the St. Louis North plant, and would retool the plant to add capacity for an additional 130,000 full-size Ram trucks, starting in the third quarter of 1995. Part of the plant's production will be devoted to extended-cab versions of the Ram, which Chrysler has not yet started to produce but for which there is strong consumer demand.
"These actions will touch virtually all of our facilities and many of our suppliers," Mr. Eaton said. "The involvement of the unions and state and local governments will be crucial to the successful implementation of these plans."
Chrysler did not specify what it was requesting from local units of the United Automobile Workers union or local governments; presumably the auto maker will seek tax abatements and changes in work rules.
 Another feature of Chrysler's expansion will be a third work shift at the auto maker's Jefferson North Assembly plant in Detroit, which builds the Jeep Grand Cherokee, a popular sport-utility vehicle that has been in short supply at dealers.
Employees at Jefferson North, on Detroit's east side, have been working overtime for nearly two years to meet demand for the Grand Cherokee. Many have said they like the extra pay but they are tired, and the union has been pressing Chrysler to hire more workers.
Mr. Eaton said one bottleneck to increased vehicle production had been the availability of engines and transmissions. Since September, the auto maker has committed to raising engine and transmission production by 400,000 units a year. Chrysler said today that it would spend $120 million at its Trenton, Mich., engine plant to build an additional 100,000 3.3-liter engines for mini-van production.
Chrysler also said it would spend $20 million on capital improvements at its Belvidere, Ill. assembly plant, which produces the new Neon subcompact, adding about 14,000 units of capacity.
 The auto maker will also consolidate production of its Dodge Dakota midsize pickup at its assembly plant in Warren, Mich. That will permit additional production of the Jeep Cherokee and Wrangler models at its Toledo, Ohio, assembly plant.
 Mike Aberlich, a Chrysler spokesman, said surveys showed that more and more younger buyers -- the group that marketers call "Generation X" -- reported that they want to buy a sport-utility or some other trucklike vehicle. "In 1989, 10 percent said their dream vehicle is a sport-utility," Mr. Aberlich said. "Now it's 20 percent."
Mr. Losh, the G.M. vice president, noted that with the exception of the recession of the early 1980's, light-truck sales as a proportion of total vehicle sales have been increasing for 25 years. Today, light trucks account for about 40 percent of total sales, up from 30 percent two decades ago. At Chrysler, the light-truck segment, including the company's popular mini-vans, accounts for almost 60 percent of total sales.
The Japanese auto makers have been notably weak in light trucks. One reason is a 25 percent tariff on many models. But Mr. Losh said he thought that Japanese auto makers had not developed many of the products, like full-size pickups, that American buyers want.

Surpassing Predictions, Vehicle Sales Jump 19.8%

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 3

 BODY:
Automotive sales shot up 19.8 percent last month, compared with February of last year, exceeding even the optimistic expectations of industry executives, forecasters, retailers and Wall Street analysts.
Sales of light trucks were particularly strong as the Big Three auto makers capitalized on their advantages over Japanese competitors in mini-vans, pickups and sport-utility vehicles. But the strong sales, combined with recent price increases by the auto makers, could provoke further moves by the Federal Reserve to ward off inflation. 
 "That's a legitimate concern," said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. "It's almost too good. This is above the top end of the range we thought possible."
 
Another Surprise
 Mr. Heinbach noted that February was the second consecutive month in which many analysts were surprised on the high side.
Sales in January had been surprisingly strong in light of bad weather and the California earthquake. So some analysts expected that sales might drop back a bit in February.
Nevertheless, sales of all vehicles reached 1,150,665 for the month, compared with 960,142 a year earlier. Light-truck sales were 446,811, up 23.3 percent; car sales rose 17.7 percent, to 703,854. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for sales of domestically produced cars was 7.3 million for the month, up from a 6 million annual rate last February.
The Big Three auto makers continued to win customers back from Japanese auto makers. The Big Three captured 74.4 percent of sales for the month, compared with 73 percent a year earlier. The market share of the Japanese dropped to 21.2 percent from 22.1 percent last year. All other imports, meanwhile, accounted for 4.4 percent of the market, down from 4.9 percent a year earlier.
The Big Three's trade organization, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, was crowing about the rebound. "America's car companies are leading America's manufacturing resurgence and economic recovery," said Andrew H. Card Jr., president of the group.
 
 Car dealers were particularly effusive, having contended with weak new-car sales and slim new-car profit margins for several years. "Everything is selling," said Tony Lunt, the new-car sales manager at Simpson Buick-Oldsmobile in Downey, Calif. "Every Buick across the model line." Ben Arthur, new-car sales manager for Bob Maloney Ford-Mercury Inc. in Rogers, Ark., said: "We're looking for our best year ever. We're in a good situation."
 
 
 
Grasping for Superlatives
 Auto executives, so glum only a few years ago, were struggling to find new superlatives. "Sales of Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Rams are so hot you could fry eggs on them, but with mini-vans you get bacon," said Theodor R. Cunningham, executive vice president of sales and marketing for the Chrysler Corporation.
For the month, Chrysler's total vehicle sales rose 22.9 percent, to 176,550. Chrysler's light-truck sales rose 34.9 percent, to 111,906, while sales of cars, virtually all of which are built in North America, rose 11.9 percent, to 62,007.
The Ford Motor Company's vehicle sales rose 12.9 percent, to 293,066. Car sales rose 6.4 percent, to 153,225, while light-truck sales rose 21.4 percent, to 136,569. (Ford's vehicle total includes 3,272 medium- and heavy-duty trucks.) Sales at Ford of domestically built cars were 153,225, up 6.4 percent.
 
 
 
G.M. Gains 26.6%
 The General Motors Corporation's vehicle sales rose 26.6 percent for the month, to 400,985. The total consisted of a 28.4 percent increase in car sales to 253,289 and a 23.5 percent increase in light trucks to 145,336. G.M.'s sales of domestically built cars were 250,183, a 29.8 percent increase. Sales of domestically built light trucks were 144,402, up 23 percent.
The Toyota Motor Corporation's total sales fell 8 percent in the month to 69,947 vehicles, but that total included a 7.7 increase in Corollas built in North America, to 12,539, and an 11.8 percent decrease in North American-built Camrys. Toyota's Lexus luxury-import division was down 15.9 percent for the month to 5,175.
The Honda Motor Company's sales rose 24.6 percent, to 56,476. Car sales were up 21 percent; the monthly total includes sales of 1,628 Passport sport-utility vehicles, Honda's first entry in the light-truck segment.
The Nissan Motor Company posted vehicle sales of 54,536, up 29.9 percent. Nissan's Infiniti luxury division reported a 7.7 percent gain to 3,491, led by strong sales of the J30 luxury sedan.
The Mazda Motor Corporation's monthly sales rose 23.1 percent, to 25,859. The Mitsubishi Motors Corporation's sales were 19,032, up 34 percent.

HEADLINE: BROOKLYN BRIDGE SHOOTING;
Indistinct Picture of Shooting Suspect

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
An emerging portrait of Rashid Baz, incomplete and often contradictory, seems notable mostly for its lack of distinction.
Several acquaintances describe Mr. Baz, the suspect charged with 15 counts of attempted murder in the shooting of a vanful of Hasidic students on the Brooklyn Bridge, as a man of mixed religious background with no particularly strong or sophisticated political beliefs. He was an unremarkable student, an often unemployed worker. One acquaintance said he admitted using drugs to relieve his boredom, but the police could not confirm that and said he had no previous police record. 
 The 28-year-old Mr. Baz, according to the accounts offered by people who had come in contact with him in his Brooklyn neighborhood, is the son of a Druse -- an offshoot of Islam -- father and a Muslim-Palestinian mother.
Mr. Baz came to the United States a decade ago to escape the violence of Lebanon. "His mother pushed him to go more than anything, he told me," said an employee of a Sunset Park pizza store who declined to give his name but described himself as Mr. Baz's "one friend."
 
Talk of the Massacre
 The worker, who said he last saw Mr. Baz three or four days ago, said there had been a conversation about the massacre of Muslims by a Jewish settler in Hebron on the West Bank last week. The two men expressed horror but not surprise over what had happened to their fellow Arabs in the Israeli-occupied territory.
"We both agreed it was crazy -- an inhuman thing to have happened," he said. "But we asked what was to be done -- that it was a Jewish state." But while the store employee said he himself would be eager to "make jihad" or "a holy war" against the Israelis, but he said Mr. Baz had not expressed any such militancy.
After emigrating from Lebanon in 1984, Mr. Baz appears to have made only modest efforts at meeting the requirements of his student visa. He married, but separated, and held what a relative called "odd jobs," until being hired in the last year as a driver for the Pioneer Car Service in Brooklyn.
The police add their own touches to the picture of Mr. Baz. Mr. Baz appeared to be a man who harbored grudges, owned weapons and was perhaps capable of violent eruptions of emotions, say senior law-enforcement officials.
"For the moment, it seems he was riding around with a chip on his shoulder and a lot of guns, waiting to have the chip knocked off," said a law-enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 
Seen as Ordinary Student
 Mr. Baz, known as Ray to his friends, began his odyssey in the United States by living with his uncle, Jamel Akel, in Park Slope, Brooklyn. He soon enrolled as a commuter student at Rockland Community College.
But Mr. Baz, taking only single courses a semester, left after his term in the summer of 1985. According to school records, he never provoked any disciplinary action from the school, nor was he a member of any campus organization.
"We have students from nearly 30 countries," said Dr. Neal A. Raisman, president of Rockland Community College. "Juding from his records, he was not one of our stellar students."
Mr. Baz seems not to have left his mark on many other endeavors or people. Those who crossed his path in Sunset Park described him as quiet and as a man capable of becoming upset that his aunt spanked her children. One neighbor on 45th Street said he could be less than gracious, once failing to help someone on the block whose car was stuck in the snow. One woman who would meet him in the local pizza store said he would sit and drink his coffee -- "no sugar," she said -- and talk without great passion about the day's topics.
"The one time I felt I got a look into his brain," said the man who runs the store, and who describes himself as a Palestinian from the West Bank, "was when he said the one thing he wished for politically was for there to be an Arab United States. He said he didn't care what kind of government it was, just that all the Arabs could live together."
 
'Didn't Know How to Pray'
 The store worker said that Mr. Baz had come to call him his "Palestinian uncle" and that his embarrassment at his lack of religious observance once became so great that he agreed to attend prayers at a Bay Ridge mosque.
"But he didn't even know how to pray," the worker said.
Two officials with the Bay Ridge place of worship, the Musab Bin Omair, said they had never seen Mr. Baz at prayers, although 600 to 700 people might worship on a Friday.
"But of course what he did goes against all of our beliefs," said Marwan Khaled, secretary for the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge. "What happened was an act of terrorism by an individual. To kill any innocent people is an act of terrorism."
Mr. Baz's world took a different spin when he was hired by Bassam Reyati to drive for the Pioneer Car Service last year.
Mr. Reyati, a Jordanian who bought the enterprise four years ago, ran a car service that employed seven drivers, said his wife, Amalia. The establishment, hit with summonses for unlicensed drivers since 1992, is facing "padlock hearings," said officials with the Taxi and Limousine Commission. Mr. Reyati was arrested along with a third man, Hlal Mohammad, on Wednesday and both were charged with hindering prosecution and weapons possession.
"They could have fights, argue," Mrs. Reyati said of her husband and his drivers. "But they were like brothers, also."
Hazin Abuhakmeh, a dispatcher at the car service who Mr. Baz picked up every morning, said Mr. Baz was a solid employee.
Two months ago, Mr. Abuhakmeh said, Mr. Baz was held up by several black youths from the neighboring Red Hook Houses. "Then, I saw him mad," he said.
An employee at Fourth Avenue Pizza said Mr. Baz showed up recently under the influence of drugs. When asked why he was engaged in drug use, Mr. Baz said he did it because he was bored or to relax, the employee said.

HEADLINE: Gold Is Ignoring Wall St.'s Inflation Fears

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Why, if gold is such a good indicator of inflation, as Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, recently told Congress, have traders around the world shunned gold?
The price of gold should be rising because of inflation fears. Stock and bond markets dropped again yesterday over just such concerns, with the Dow Jones industrial average declining 7.32 points, to 3,824.42. And today's session could be another nervous one if the January employment data defy expectations. 
 Traders will examine today whether the data, known as nonfarm payrolls, almost doubles, and the unemployment rate remains the same, as expected. If job creation expands even more or unemployment drops, or both, the markets will probably interpret the numbers as inflationary, analysts say.
 
Gold Is Oasis of Calm
 But the gold market is likely to be largely unmoved. It has been an oasis of calm lately. Gold closed down slightly yesterday for the fourth consecutive session. Why?
"The gold market is saying that there is no evidence of inflation in the system," said Daniel S. Weissman, vice president for precious metals trading at MTB Bank.
Moreover, Mr. Weissman said, the customers that have been driving up the price of the precious metal in recent months, like the Chinese and Koreans, are scaling back and big portfolio managers are selling gold to raise cash -- often to cover their losses in the stock and bond markets.
Yesterday, the Standard & Poor's 500 index declined 1.80 points, to 463.01. But the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 1.11 points, to 784.58.
 
30-Year Treasury Bond
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 24/32 to 9222/32 , at a yield of 6.83 percent, up 7 basis points from the day before. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
By contrast, gold for April delivery fell 60 cents, to $378.30 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Gold has lost about 3 percent of its value since since Feb. 4, when the Fed nudged short-term interest rates higher. Gold traders have mostly ignored inflation-related news that plunged the stock and bond markets into turmoil.
Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader for the Chase Manhattan Bank, said: "As long as the gold market believes inflation is being neutralized by higher interest rates, the gold market stabilizes. It's the fear of un-neutralized inflation that raises gold prices."
For its part, the Dow plunged in the first half-hour of trading, attempted to recover for most of the session but closed down, the fifth declining session out of the last six.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index closed off 0.79 point, to 256.68, on volume of 292 million shares. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by 1,190 to 950. The American Stock Exchange market value index closed down 0.67 point, to 465.65.
Eighteen of the 30 Dow component stocks dropped in price, including several economically sensitive stocks. Aluminum Company of America dropped 1 5/8, to 74 7/8, and General Electric dropped 5/8, to 105 1/4. Disney dropped 1, to 45 3/4, despite a London debt trader's description of Euro Disney's debt as attractively priced.
The biggest percentage decliner on the New York Stock Exchange was First Union Real Estate, once a leading real estate investment trust. Its lofty stock price had defied industry analysts' longstanding criticism of the company's high debt and questionable real estate projects.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Drop On More Inflation Fears

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities declined yesterday, despite a return to relative stability in world bond markets. On Wednesday, a plunge in world bond markets set off selling of American Treasury securities.
Weakness in yesterday's session was traced to those bond investors still concerned with inflation ahead of today's scheduled employment report for February. Also weighing on the market was fear of a potential trade confrontation between the United States and Japan, which some analysts termed overblown. But other analysts say the threat is just as real for a market where nerves have frayed more each day over the last month. 
 In late trading, the price of a 30-year Treasury bond was down 24/32 to trade at 9222/32 as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.83 percent, from 6.76 percent on Wednesday.
Shorter-maturity Treasury bills were mixed with a three-month bill rate unchanged at 3.46 percent and a six-month bill at 3.67 percent, up a basis point. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
An Inflationary Move?
 President Clinton's decision to reinstate tough trade powers weighed on the market because some saw trade sanctions as protectionist and potentially inflationary, traders said. It could set the stage for United States producers to raise prices on manufactured goods as prices of imported products are forced up because of tariffs.
Leon C. Brand, global market specialist at NatWest Securities, said that with the overseas markets somewhat stabilized, investors turned their attention to today's unemployment data, which will be delivered to a market still in the dark over how much of the surge in fourth-quarter economic growth has has carried over into 1994.
Because of the market's concern about inflationary pressures building in the economy, analysts said the jobs data would be scrutinized for signs of growth.
Guaranteed to attract particular attention in the report, the analysts said, will be the average hourly earnings figure, which will be following an increase of eight-tenths of a percent in January. A flat hourly earnings number would provide the market some reassurance that wage inflation is not a near-term threat, analysts added.
Some market watchers, however, are not expecting the data to be illuminating because of weather-related distortions.
Mr. Brand of NatWest said the consensus forecast was for an increase in nonfarm payroll jobs of 138,000. But the range of forecasts runs from 50,000 to 275,000.
 
Other Data Reported
 Treasuries were not influenced by data showing United States factory orders rose 2.1 percent in January. Prices had dipped earlier after a report that showed a surprisingly large plunge in jobless claims. The claims in the week ended Feb. 26 fell by 57,000, to 318,000, from a revised 375,000. Analysts had expected a drop of 21,000. But while the drop was large, analysts said it might reflect distortions from weather rather than any significant change in the labor market.
Mark Grant, managing director and head of fixed-income investing in Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said the market needed a period of stability to regroup. "But right now," he said, "there is a lot of volatility in the market, being fueled by large investors repositioning themselves after going out on the yield curve for better yields. Perhaps much further out than was probably prudent."
At the Treasury's one-year bill auction yesterday, the average rate was 4.03 percent, up from the 3.59 percent at the last auction on Feb. 3 and the highest yield since May 28, 1992, when it was 4.07 percent.
The following are the results of the new one-year bill auction:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops Against Yen As Japan Dispute Intensifies

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
An escalation in the trade dispute between Washington and Tokyo sent the dollar lower against the Japanese yen yesterday.
But the dollar strengthened slightly against the German mark and some other European currencies. 
 Meanwhile, gold prices eased in American trading after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange, gold for April delivery slipped 60 cents, to $378.30 an ounce.
Currency traders said the dollar fell on official word that President Clinton had resurrected a punitive provision of American trade law that could result in sharply higher tariffs for Japanese imports. Although the dollar partly recovered, it ended in New York at 103.88 yen, down from 104.25 yen on Wednesday.
"There was a knee-jerk reaction to sell the dollar," said Curtis Perkins, a trader on the foreign exchange desk at the Chemical Bank in New York.
Mr. Clinton's move had been expected but was still seen as an inflammatory step in the prolonged dispute over Japan's large trade surpluses with the United States. Talks over ways to reduce the surplus collapsed last month.
 
Some Pressure to Sell
 There is an underlying assumption in the currency markets that the dollar must decline in value against the yen to help resolve the dispute. A cheaper dollar makes American goods more affordable in Japan and Japanese goods more expensive in the United States, which could help narrow the trade imbalance.
"It wasn't a real surprise to anybody," Jack Griffin, vice president on the corporate foreign exchange desk at the New York branch of Japan's Fuji Bank, said of the Clinton move. "There was some selling pressure when the news came out but that abated."
The dollar did rise to 1.7100 marks in New York, from 1.7043 on Wednesday. The gain came after Germany's central bank took no action on interest-rate policy after a regular meeting.
There had been some speculation that the Germans might nudge up interest rates after money-supply figures released on Wednesday suggested a possible rise in inflation. The dollar had plunged in value against the mark in response because higher German rates would make mark-denominated investments worth more.

HEADLINE: January Factory Orders Up For Sixth Gain in a Row

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
Factory orders increased in January for the sixth consecutive month, helped by strong demand for aircraft, the Commerce Department said today. But the report also suggested a leveling off in the manufacturing pace as shipments fell.
Separately, the Labor Department reported a sharp drop in new claims for unemployment benefits last week. 
 The 2.1 percent rise in January factory orders, to a seasonally adjusted $272 billion, extended the best string of pickups in six years. The last time there was a longer series of monthly increases was during the nine months from September 1987 through June 1988.
Analysts said the report was further evidence of an expanding economy, but noted that factory business was strongly pumped up in January by booming aircraft orders.
Total transportation orders, which includes cars as well as airplanes, shot up 14 percent after a 3.7 percent gain in December.
But excluding transportation, total factory orders rose only a scant three-tenths of 1 percent, after an increase of 1 percent in December.
"The report is pretty consistent with current economic conditions showing the economy doing nicely after adjustments for weather and the California earthquake," Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis, said.
Possibly because of harsh weather, shipments dipped in January for the first time since mid-1993. They fell only one-tenth of 1 percent but the slackening was evident in virtually every product category except cars and planes.
Order backlogs grew six-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $444.6 billion, the first bump upward in unfilled orders since February 1993. That suggests factories have enough business in hand to keep busy.
In the report on first-time claims for unemployment benefits, the Labor Department said claims dropped 57,000 in the week that ended Feb. 26, to 318,000 -- the lowest since the week of Christmas.
The weekly number of first-time claims has whipsawed this year, making it hard to construct an accurate picture of the employment situation. Bitter cold and winter storms caused temporary layoffs, but the weather also kept some people from filing for claims.
The four-week moving average for new claims, which smoothes out weekly fluctuations, stood at 352,500 in the week that ended Feb. 26. The average remains well above the 324,250 level seen at the beginning of the year.
"We had to be worried about whether increased claims were caused by layoffs or weather," Brian Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said. "It will take time before we thaw out and find out for sure if it's the weather."

HEADLINE: As Farrakhan Groups Land Jobs From Government, Debate Grows

SERIES: Ministry of Hope, Message of Hate -- Second of three articles on the Nation of Islam.

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
The four security guards sit serenely behind the plexiglass barrier in the barren lobby of the Flaghouse Courts housing project. They tell visitors to pass through a metal detector, show identification and name the residents they want to visit. Occasionally, one of the four -- all young blacks whose contract says they earn $11 an hour -- picks up a walkie talkie, zips up his blue jacket and leaves the booth to patrol the building's hallways and staircases.
For the most part, the guards look and act like any other guards keeping watch over a public housing project. Only a patch on the left sleeve -- a white crescent and star and "N.O.I. Security" stitched on a red background -- indicates they represent something different.
 
For Some, a Ray of Hope
 To many residents at Flaghouse Courts, near downtown Baltimore, the presence of the guards from a company affiliated with the Nation of Islam provides a ray of hope for halting the drug dealing and violence that infest the project. 
 But some Jewish groups and legislators like Representative Peter T. King, Republican of Long Island, have complained that employing a company affiliated with the Nation of Islam to protect public housing means taxpayer money is subsidizing a hate group whose leader, Louis Farrakhan, calls whites "devils" and has described Judaism as a "gutter religion."
For the Nation of Islam and its followers, however, the government contracts represent a fundamental shift in financial policy. The organization's leaders are now aggressively seeking work from governments and white-owned businesses. In Baltimore, for example, the N.O.I. Security Agency has, since June, signed contracts with the Baltimore Housing Authority to provide security at 10 high-rise public apartment houses. The contracts will eventually bring in $2.8 million.
It was not always this way. For years the Nation of Islam preached a doctrine that called for economic development, primarily by selling goods to other blacks.
"The businesses were never supported by anyone other than Nation of Islam members," said Iman W. D. Mohammed, who followed his father, Elijah Muhammad, as leader of the group until he moved toward mainstream Islam 15 years ago. "There was no government funding at all during the Honorable Elijah Muhammad's lifetime. That was his policy. He feared government involvement would take away from his control and plans for the businesses."
 
Move to Moderation
 The flow of public money does more than bolster the financial base of the organization. Some former members and other outsiders in academia or community groups who study it see a parallel: as the group's acquisition of government contracts expanded, Mr. Farrakhan's speeches grew more moderate. The contracts have also drawn many public agencies into the national debate over religious freedom and racial bias that has shadowed the Nation of Islam.
The group first ventured into providing private security guards in 1988, when it began patrolling two apartment complexes in Northeast Washington, near the Anacostia River. In 1990, members of the Nation formed the N.O.I. Security Agency, with headquarters in Washington.
The company won contracts to guard federally subsidized apartment complexes in Pittsburgh in 1991, in Philadelphia and Los Angeles in 1992, and in Chicago and Baltimore in 1993. Though several of those contracts have not been renewed, and the one in Los Angeles was canceled, N.O.I. Security has continued to bring in more business.
As privately held businesses, the Nation of Islam affiliates are not required to publish details of their finances, and officials declined to provide them. But based on figures gathered from public records and private estimates, companies associated with the organization have taken in more than $1 million from public agencies since June 1991. And the businesses are ever seeking to increase that amount.
Another security company, New Life Inc., run by Mr. Farrakhan's son-in-law Leonard Farrakhan Muhammad, gets about $60,000 a month from the State of Illinois and Chicago for guarding public housing projects. It is also part of a joint venture negotiating a $5 million contract with the Chicago Housing Authority to manage and guard another project on Chicago's West Side.
 
Treating AIDS Patients
 A chain of health clinics run by a top Nation of Islam official received $213,000 last April in Federal money for a one-year contract to treat AIDS patients in Washington; the chain, Abundant Life Foundation, is also seeking a share of $2 million in AIDS treatment contracts that the District of Columbia government will soon hand out.
N.O.I. Security has also provided security for private companies in Washington, including Federal Express, which employs it to guard its sorting center, and for the Ramada Renaissance Hotel.
These contracts have caught the attention of critics of the Nation of Islam, especially Jewish groups, who say that public money should not go to individuals or companies affiliated with such groups.
"Giving money to hatemongers only empowers and legitimizes them," Alfred H. Moses, president of the American Jewish Committee, wrote in February to Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
Similarly, Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, complained: "Any group seeking federally funded contracts cannot discriminate on the basis of race or religion and government funds cannot be used to proselytize. All these concerns come into play with Nation of Islam contracts."
But Leonard Muhammad bristles at such suggestions, saying, "What we resent, what I resent, having had relatives who fought and died for this country, is for anyone to suggest that because of our religious affiliation we don't have the right to be in business."
Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services say the decision to provide money to the Washington AIDS clinic was made by the District of Columbia government, not by Federal officials. Housing Department officials did not respond to requests for comment on Federal money going to pay the security company.
 
The Reviews
Earning Praise, But Not Invincible
 The security companies affiliated with the National of Islam have chalked up some striking successes and suffered some stunning failures. Nation of Islam security guards generally do not carry weapons but have nonetheless been accused of violence in a few instances. And in some cities they have failed to halt lawlessness at apartment complexes they were guarding.
But in Washington and Baltimore there have been accolades, and more contracts.
"They didn't try to indoctrinate anyone," said Gregory E. Harraka, director of operations for Coakley Williams, a Maryland construction company that hired N.O.I. Security to guard a construction site in Washington. "They put a picture of Elijah Muhammad on a wall of their trailer, but that didn't bother us at all. We don't endorse their philosophy. But, in terms of security, they did a fine job."
That has not been a universal sentiment, and poor evaluations led housing managers in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles to cancel or decide against renewing contracts.
Last year, for example, the managers of a HUD-subsidized housing developmentin Los Angeles dismissed N.O.I. Security after its guards were unable to stop gang violence and drug trafficking. N.O.I. won a $644,000-a-year contract in November 1992 to guard the project, Holiday Venice.
Los Angeles police officials showed the managers photographs and videotapes of N.O.I. guards watching drug sales at Holiday Venice. The police said the guards appeared to have been intimidated by a gang, the Shoreline Crips.
"They went head to head with these guys, and even if the Nation of Islam had been armed, that may not have made the difference, though they certainly would have had more of an impact," said Sgt. Kirk Albanese, who headed a police antidrug unit at the time. "This was not your typical security job at a supermarket. This was as dangerous as it gets."
In Pittsburgh, police officials and some tenants said that there had been no noticeable decrease in crime in the two HUD-subsidized housing complexes guarded by N.O.I. Security. When the contracts expired, management hired armed guards from another company.
The Nation has also not enjoyed spotless records as guards: two members of a Nation of Islam security detail were convicted in 1992 of second-degree murder in the death of an unarmed patron at the Inglewood, Calif., nightclub they were guarding.
 
The Businesses
Taking Money From 'Devils'
 In aggressively seeking public and private contracts, Mr. Farrakhan and his aides have revived an emphasis on entrepreneurship begun under Elijah Muhammad that had flagged when his son W. D., or Wallace, succeeded him in 1975.
"Economic nationalism wasn't as important to Wallace as it was to Elijah," said Salim Muwakkill, who is a former managing editor of Muhammad Speaks, at the time the group's newspaper, and who is no longer a Nation member. "He wanted to transform the Nation of Islam into a community of religious people who might be or might not be entrepreneurial. Economic and political matters would be ancillary."
When Elijah Muhammad died, the group's assets were $46 million, say lawyers familiar with the battle over estate. Poor financial management and a reduction in contributions whittled this down quickly. Mr. Muwakkill said that Mr. Farrakhan's break with Mr. Mohammad (Elijah Muhammad's son changed the spelling of his name) in 1978 had almost as much to do with his anger over the group's sagging financial fortunes as it did with Wallace Mohammad's declaration that whites were no longer to be considered devils and would be allowed to join the organization.
Once on his own, Mr. Farrakhan rebuilt the Nation of Islam's financial base, reinstituting mandatory tithes and expanding the circulation of the group's newspapers.
 
Economic Blueprint
 In addition, Mr. Farrakhan developed what he called an economic blueprint for the Nation of Islam, buying farms and setting up banks and insurance companies and other businesses. The group now sells a line of hair and skin care products started up with a $5 million loan from Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi the Libyan leader.
In February, Mr. Farrakhan announced that the group would spend $1.5 million for a printing operation in Chicago to produce the Nation of Islam's newspaper and, he hopes, other newspapers for black readers. He has also joined leaders of other black religious groups in starting a company to buy broadcast and other entertainment companies. The first purchase of the group, the African-American Religious Connection, was WLGO-AM in Columbia, S.C.
But in courting white companies and government agencies for contracts, Mr. Farrakhan has moved his group beyond just selling goods to blacks. Some analysts suggest that the move is connected to efforts by Mr. Farrakhan to moderate some of his views.
These analysts theorize that the need to keep government contracts was a factor in the demotion of his chief spokesman, Khallid Abdul Muhammad, for the language he used in an anti-white, anti-Jewish, anti-homosexual speech in November.
"It was important to rebuke Khallid; otherwise it would have been hard to reach out to mainstream people," Mr. Muwakkill said. "The playing field in which he is now working is contracts and the kind of things that people must be credible to receive and need some sort of mainstream acceptance, even if it's grudging."
 
The Project
In Baltimore, Relief From Crime
 Crime had been rampant at a number of Baltimore's 16 high-rise apartment buildings for low-income tenants. The situation was the bleakest at Flaghouse Court, a stone's throw from the Inner Harbor and the National Aquarium, two of the city's leading tourist attractions. Drug dealers peddled their wares in the open-air hallways, and sniper fire occasionally rained down on the parking lot of the city's main post office next door.
Last spring, at the suggestion of an acquaintance, Daniel P. Henson 3d, executive director of the Baltimore Housing Authority, began to consider hiring N.O.I. Security. In May, housing authority officials visited the two Washington apartment complexes that use N.O.I. Security guards, and Mr. Henson spoke with company officials.
"In listening to them describe their philosophy the thing that stuck with me was their view that they give respect to get respect," Mr. Henson said in an interview.
Relying on a provision in HUD regulations that allowed him emergency powers to enter into contracts without putting them out for bid, Mr. Henson hired the company to patrol 10 of the authority's buildings at an annual cost of $288,000 for each building, the biggest paycheck yet for N.O.I. The contracts, which have been phased in since June, give the housing authority the right to cancel with 30 days' notice.
 
Crime Cut in Half
 Figures compiled by the Baltimore Police Department show a 50 percent decrease in serious crime at Flaghouse Court in the last half of 1993, compared with the same period in 1992. Housing authority officials say it is too early to evaluate the impact of N.O.I. at some of the other high-rise apartment buildings that N.O.I. Security patrols.
N.O.I. Security is not the only force at work. Before the buildings were turned over to the company, the Baltimore police conducted an apartment-to-apartment sweep, evicting people who could not prove they were legal tenants. The housing authority also installed metal detectors, alarms on all doors leading to the outside, and either wire mesh or plexiglass barriers on the open-air hallways on the bottom floors.
But tenants at Flaghouse Court give plenty of credit to the group they call "the Muslims."
Lawrence Manuel, who has lived in Flaghouse Courts for five years, said that last summer, with the new security guards around, he felt safe enough to sleep with his apartment door open to provide some relief from the oppressive heat.
"It's not Tombstone Territory around here right now," Mr. Manuel said. "It was before, and if somebody else comes back here it will be again."

HEADLINE: Property Tax Changes Are Urged To Help Preserve Northeast Forest

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

 BODY:
A regional commission examining ways to preserve the 26-million-acre forest of northern New York and New England called yesterday for changes in the way the property is taxed to help individual owners keep control of their land. But despite the urging of some conservationists, it did not recommend specific changes in forestry practices or major programs to set up natural preserves.
About 85 percent of the forest, which runs almost interrupted from upstate New York through New Hampshire and Vermont to northern Maine, is privately owned, much of it by paper and timber companies. 
 The panel, the Northern Forest Lands Council, urged the governments of the four states to protect the land from excessive development by acquiring tracts that are especially valuable, if possible. It also called on the states to find ways to protect the many species living in the forest.
The council said its recommendations should be part of a broad strategy to prevent the "breakup of large undeveloped tracts of land and continuing pressure on finite natural resources."
 
Hearings Planned on Ideas
 The council was established by Congress in 1990 amid concern about the future of one of the biggest expanses of forest land in the country. The panel, whose members are appointed by the governors of the four states, has no legally binding authority. Its recommendations, issued in Concord, N.H., serve mainly as a guide for the Federal, state and local governments. A series of public hearings will be held on the panel's suggestions in the next two months.
The council said that the way forest land is taxed poses one of the biggest threats to the forest by encouraging owners to sell their holdings. It called for local governments to tax the land based on how it is currently used, not on what it might be worth if broken up and sold to developers.
"Rising property taxes have severe impacts on the ability of landowners to own and manage forest land," the panel said. "The council has identified this as one of the most significant problems facing forest land across the region because of its effect on private landowners' ability to hold onto their land. In most areas of the northern forest, making sure that property taxes reflect the productivity of the forest will have the most immediate effect."
The state and Federal governments, the panel said, should change estate-tax policies to reduce the pressures on heirs to sell forest land that they inherit, the council said. It also recommended that the governments change the way capital gains are calculated for timber that takes years to grow to maturity by adjusting the capital gains to take account of inflation.
The report was praised by the spokesman for a coalition of environmental groups for its "middle-of-the-road" approach. "Respecting the rights of property owners will be helpful in the long run," said John Sheehan of the Northern Forest Alliance.
But the council received mixed reviews from an Adirondack landowners' group, which chided it for recommending more public land purchases.

HEADLINE: Notice the Steel Strike? 48 Hours Sum Up a Slide

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MARTINS FERRY, Ohio, March 3

 BODY:
A steelworkers' strike used to be feared as a catastrophic event, with the President sometimes preparing the nation for an economic jolt. But on Tuesday, steelworkers staged a strike against a major manufacturer here in the Rust Belt, and hardly anyone outside this region noticed. By this morning, the strike was over and workers were returning to the mills.
The 48-hour job action, which mainly concerned health care and pension benefits, began after talks broke down between the United Steelworkers of America and the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation. The company, one of the nation's 10 largest steel manufacturers, is notable for almost making a profit last year, just three years after it emerged from bankruptcy. 
 So when 4,700 workers closed the company's eight plants in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, the action might reasonably have been expected to command some attention, especially since labor historians say it was only the eighth or ninth major job action in the industry since 1946.
But from the outset, there was a startling lack of interest. That alone suggests the far-reaching changes in the steel industry, which had $60 billion in revenue in 1965 and only $40 billion last year, after accounting for inflation.
 
Shrinking of Industry
 Once a monolithic giant, the industry began shriveling in the early 1980's as a result of global competition and technological improvements, slashing jobs, wages and benefits and closing scores of mills as it consolidated.
Even today, profitable companies are rare. Wheeling-Pittsburgh, for example, posted a $7 million loss on $1 billion in revenue last year. Company officials say they have no estimate of how the strike and its settlement will affect this year's revenues.
The power of the steel union has followed the fortunes of the mills. The industrywide labor contract, which gave the union power to close down the entire industry every time it was renegotiated, disappeared in the mid-1980's when survival superseded all other issues. It was replaced by company contracts, usually packed with worker concessions, that were individually negotiated. The industry has subsequently become a model of worker-management cooperation. Workers' representatives even hold seats on the major company boards.
Against this backdrop, labor experts say, the Wheeling-Pittsburgh strike was just a bump in contract negotiations between a union willing to compromise and a steel company that had pioneered worker participation in management. "Strikes are a thing of the past, and this strike is just a glitch," said Ben Fischer, a professor of labor studies at the John Heinz School of Public Policy at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
"We're in a new era, a period of unprecedented cooperation in decision making and planning at every stage," Mr. Fischer said.
That may explain why this strike seemed half-hearted: a dozen strikers took shelter from Wednesday's sleet and snow in a heated trailer equipped with a coffee maker, television set and refrigerator. Outside, a single placard, declaring "No Contract, No Work," leaned against the trailer.
John Saunders, president of Local 1238 here, said the intransigence of the company on some aspects of the contract, and the need for the union to take action, surprised everybody.
The strike began on the first day in office of a new president of the United Steelworkers of America, George Becker. "We didn't plan that," Mr. Becker, a 65-year-old former safety inspector, said of the walkout at a news conference in Pittsburgh.
 
Talks Break Down
 Union officials said talks broke off at 3:30 A.M. Tuesday, and by 6 A.M. the strike was on.
Despite the walkout, union officials leavened complaints about the company with compliments. "It's a progressive steel company, no question about it," Mr. Saunders, the local union leader, said on Wednesday. "We probably had the best union-management relationship in the industry prior to the work stoppage Tuesday."
Although workers said they were doing more work for pay that has not yet exceeded 1982 levels, many pointed proudly to their income, which these workers said ranged from $30,000 to $40,000 last year.
Today, union and company officials said they were pleased with the settlement. "It's one of the best contracts in the industry," said Carmen DeStefano, a union negotiator. "Our people are ecstatic, and they're glad to be going back to work today."
Mr. DeStefano said the company had addressed, if not fully satisfied, all union demands regarding wages, benefits, job security and other workplace issues. He would not release details of the settlement until after the workers voted on it next week. But there seems to be little question that they will approve it, since all workers are returning to the mills today.
Mr. Saunders said the new contract would improve hourly wages and benefits, although it would not fully repay workers for the concessions they made in 1986, when Wheeling-Pittsburgh was being restructured under the protection of bankruptcy laws. The average worker, union leaders say, now earns $12 to $16 an hour, down about 20 percent from the hourly pay levels of the mid-1980's; the company says average compensation, including benefits, is closer to $28 an hour.
Gregg Warren, a spokesman for Wheeling-Pittsburgh, which is based in Wheeling, W. Va., and owned by the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation, a holding company, said management was satisfied with the contract. While Mr. Warren also declined to discuss the contract's details, he said it would run two and a half years, instead of the usual five years, to give the company flexibility in future negotiations.
 
Not Like Old Days
 "It's not like it used to be," said Don Dellget, a 63-year-old welder, as he sat inside the strikers' trailer on Wednesday. "In the old days, we had power and the union held the upper hand."
In the 1950's, this plant alone employed 1,400 steelworkers; today it has only 425. The union had 1.3 million members in 1979; today it has 600,000, and the number is falling as new technology replaces workers by the hundreds. The most telling industry statistic, however, is that it took 12.8 manhours to produce a ton of steel in 1965, but only 4.7 manhours in 1993 as a result of technological improvements.
In these circumstances, pensions have become a crucial bargaining issue, partly because the steelworkers tend to be older and partly because the bankrupt company was forced to sharply reduce pension payments in 1986.
Carl D. Yoho, a 60-year-old truck driver who earned $40,000 last year, said that if he had been able to retire in 1985 he would have received about $1,200 a month in pension benefits. But if he were eligible to retire now, Mr. Yoho said, he would receive only about $550 a month, minus $100 a month for health insurance. "I've got to stay on the job as long as my health stays good," he said.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
G.O.P. on Health Care: Seeking a Second Opinion

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
The health care issue should be rich with opportunity for the Republicans these days, with President Clinton's plan sagging in the polls and the Democrats still struggling for consensus in the relevant committees on Capitol Hill.
After all their campaign promises and all their photo opportunities on "health care that's always there," the Democrats are in an embarrassing stall, divided among several health care plans and ideological camps. They have created a perfect moment for an opposition party to step boldly into the void with an alternative. But the Republicans have deep and abiding problems of their own. 
 They are divided philosophically over just how much the health care system needs to be overhauled, and they are divided just as starkly over the means by which any such restructuring should take place.
In the Senate there are clear tensions between conservatives like Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who argues that the public is rejecting the idea that any overhaul of the system is necessary, and centrists like Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, who has offered a plan of his own aimed at providing universal coverage. Indeed, Administration strategists consider Senator Chafee an important potential ally in any ultimate grand compromise.
Away from Capitol Hill there is similar friction, as befits a party still struggling to redefine itself after losing the White House in 1992. Among the theoreticians focused on returning the party to Presidential power, a debate has played out over whether Republicans should even agree that there is a "crisis" in health care.
 
A Pragmatic Outlook
 Meanwhile, party strategists with clients in the midterm elections take a more pragmatic outlook, trying to protect them from being perceived as obstructionists who are insensitive to the nation's health care problems.
Democratic strategists, after all, have already signaled their willingness to reprise the campaign they ran in 1992, asserting that a party that refused to see the recession now refuses to see the crisis in health care -- a strategic box the Republicans have no desire to enter.
As Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, declared in an interview: "It is important that people know three things about the Republicans and health care: No. 1, we're for health care reform; the issue is not whether but how. No. 2, we can't afford a government-run health care system financed by a massive payroll tax that will end up hurting the quality of care. And No. 3, we don't have to have a government-run health care program to do health care reform."
The problem is how to get beyond those broad points. As Mr. Barbour suggests, it is fairly clear what most Republicans are against in the Clinton plan: a new government requirement that employers pay for insurance for their workers; a new quasi-governmental structure of regional insurance purchasing alliances that most Americans would be required to join, and a new system of price controls for insurance premiums.
 
Conference in Annapolis
 But what are the Republicans for?
This is the question hovering over the two-day gathering of Republican senators that began in Annapolis, Md., this afternoon. It is the third such retreat devoted to health care issues for Senate Republicans in the past few years, but it comes at a particularly sensitive moment. Underscoring the stakes for the party on the health care issue, the organizers have called in several House Republican leaders, a few Republican governors, Mr. Barbour and assorted strategists.
At a news conference today before the Republicans left town, there was bold talk of stepping in where the Clinton Administration had faltered. "What I'm seeing from the polls is that the American people want a second opinion," asserted Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate minority leader.
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, said expansively, "Clinton has now failed, and you see on the House side, at least, no Democratic structure that can clearly command a majority." Given that, he added, "It becomes imperative for us to go to Annapolis and try to begin to sort out how we can put together a bipartisan effort that we would feel very comfortable with."
Still, Mr. Chafee, who heads the Senate Republicans' task force on health and organized this retreat, was just as busily trying to play down expectations. "I just hope nobody writes up on Friday night, 'Annapolis conference failure; Republicans fail to reach agreement,' " he said. "That's not the purpose of this; you can write that right now."
Presenting the session as largely the beginning of a process of reaching consensus and an exercise in education, he added, "I'm a realist."
 
Two2 Senators Poles Apart
 Senate Republicans, by virtue of Senate rules and the power they give to the minority, will play a critical role in any health care restructuring, and are thus more closely watched than their counterparts in the House. The poles of the debate among them are represented most visibly by Senator Chafee and Senator Gramm.
Mr. Gramm, who has 10 co-sponsors, backs a modest measure that does not promise universal coverage but tries to expand access to health insurance through such measures as tax credits for the working poor and the creation of tax-free savings accounts for medical expenses. There are no major new governmental structures created, along the lines of the health alliance, and there are no requirements that individuals buy insurance or that employers pay for it.
"I believe that we have won the intellectual debate," the Texas Senator said in an interview this week. "People have rejected the idea of the Government remaking the health care system; they've rejected alliances and the collectivization of health care purchasing, and they've rejected the employer mandate."
Mr. Chafee's bill, which has 19 co-sponsors in the Senate, does seek to guarantee universal coverage, hoping to require all individuals to obtain health insurance by the year 2005. Low-income people would receive government vouchers to help them purchase it. It also includes a version of the health insurance purchasing cooperative, although not as large and powerful as the Clinton plan's.
In a sense, the argument among Republicans is one of the very oldest for their party: Just what is the role of government on issues like health?
 
Chafee Bill Criticized
 William Kristol, the conservative strategist who advanced the "no-crisis" argument last fall, faults the Chafee bill. "Its premise is that government has to step in and fundamentally reorganize the health care system of the United States," he said. This, he argues, is in opposition to the Republican philosophy that the role of government should be a carefully limited one.
The man who must deal with all these tensions in the coming weeks is Senator Dole. And the irony is that, despite all the problems of the Clinton plan, the President is poised to get credit for whatever passes, many analysts argue. Voters, they say, simply give Democrats the advantage in dealing with health care, as they gave the Republicans the advantage on military issues throughout the 1980's.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
In Proposal, Vincent Memoir Airs Criticisms

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
In a proposal for a memoir about his three years as baseball commissioner, Fay Vincent snipes at high-profile owners such as George M. Steinbrenner 3d, Peter O'Malley, Jerry Reinsdorf and Bud Selig, describes Bart Giamatti's unhappiness as National League president before becoming commissioner and says unequivocally that Pete Rose gambled on baseball.
The 40-page proposal is for a book called "And The Horse They Rode In On: My Tumultuous Years as Baseball Commissioner," which would be written with David Kaplan of Newsweek. The title refers to a favorite phrase of Giamatti's. 
According to the proposal, circulated among publishing houses by the William Morris Agency, bidding will start at $300,000 in a coming auction.
Proposals are come-ons to publishers, part of the process of selling the rights to a book, the hard sell to get the most money for an author. It is in the author's best interest to present as many of the best, juiciest and perhaps hyperbolic opinions in the proposal to gain maximum attention. Sometimes, elements contained in a proposal don't survive publication.
The proposal consists of Vincent's snapshot impressions of his stormy tenure in baseball, which began in September 1989 after the death of Giamatti, and a long narrative about the Rose case. Vincent resigned in September 1992, under pressure from owners who often bitterly disagreed with him over such issues as labor relations, divisional realignment and division of expansion fees. Major league baseball has not yet elected his successor.
Reached yesterday at his Greenwich, Conn., home, Vincent said he had approved the proposal, but distanced himself from its glib, often unpleasant tenor.
"I wouldn't put much stock in the tone," he said. "It's not my style. We have a lot of work to do before we write the book. I'm sure the book will be different." He added: "It's not my intention to be revengeful."
But upon learning that excerpts from the proposal would be made public, he abruptly said that he would not pursue writing the book.
 
Candid Assessments
 "Just say I'm not writing it," he said. "You did not get the proposal legitimately. I'm upset that you would do this and I don't want to be part of it. This tells me the publishing industry is filled with bad people."
Even if he does not write the book, the proposal provides the most candid assessments of baseball's hierarchy from Vincent ever to become public.
According to the proposal, Vincent writes that Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago White Sox, is "dangerous" and blames him more for "the poor state of baseball than anyone else."
Reinsdorf refuted the characterizations and said: "Fay is apparently bitter. I don't harbor any personal animosity to him. My problem with him was job performance. If he chooses to write a book, I don't think it will enhance his reputation. He'd be better off putting it all behind him."
The proposal has Vincent calling Bud Selig, the owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and the interim commissioner, a "small-town schlepper" who, along with Reinsdorf, is "the emblem of baseball's decline."
"I have no comment other than that I find all this very sad," Selig said from Chandler, Ariz., where the Brewers are training.
 
Steinbrenner Mentioned
 In describing the principal owner of the Yankees, the proposal quotes Vincent as calling Steinbrenner "the most hated man in baseball."
"How bad can a Williams graduate be?" Vincent asks rhetorically about his fellow college alumnus. "Are you kidding?"
During negotiations that led to Vincent banning Steinbrenner from baseball in 1990, Steinbrenner was asked if he was being "Machiavellian." He responded, Vincent says in the proposal, by saying: "Who's he--a famous ballplayer?"
A spokesman for Steinbrenner said he could not be reached for comment.
The proposal has Vincent lashing out at O'Malley, the Los Angeles Dodgers owner, as a "nitwit" and a "bigot."
Through a spokesman, O'Malley declined to comment on Vincent's remarks.
During the 1989 earthquake in San Francisco that interrupted the World Series, the proposal says Vincent's suggestion that each team contribute $50,000 to disaster relief was met with anger by O'Malley.
According to the proposal, Vincent says that Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnati Reds, was the owner who "does the dumbest things," and that Jackie Autry, executive vice president of the California Angels and the wife of Gene Autry, the Angels owner, is "mean-spirited and not bright."
The proposal has Vincent taking aim at Bill White, the just-retired National League president, by saying in the proposal that White "is a good man" but "incompetent."
"I don't want to get into it," White said when reached at his home in New York. "I suggest you talk to people where he's worked before, if you want to talk about incompetent."
According to the proposal, Giamatti, who succeeded Peter V. Ueberroth as commissioner in April 1989, had been frustrated in his previous position as National League president and tried to leave within weeks of taking over in 1987.
Several weeks into Giamatti's tenure, the proposal says, Giamatti called Vincent, shouting about how he hated the job and that he was bored. Giamatti applied to be head of the Rockefeller Foundation, the proposal says, but lost the bid and then grew to enjoy the National League presidency because of his dealings with umpires.
According to the proposal, Vincent says most owners believe they must destroy the players union as the "final salvation" of baseball's economic future.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Fine Line

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico, March 3

 BODY:
As peasant rebels roamed the highlands outside this city in early January, bombs exploded in the capital and investors began to sell off their Mexican stocks, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari shelved plans for a crackdown on rebel supporters, dismissed his hard-line Interior Minister and declared a unilateral cease-fire.
What did not work, Mr. Salinas said, had to be changed. 
 In the tentative peace agreement presented to the rebels here on Wednesday, the Government essentially offered more change of the same sort. To Latin America's first guerrilla movement of the post-cold-war age, an insurgency that has won wide sympathy with demands for reform rather than revolution, Mr. Salinas proposed a strikingly post-cold-war response: he agreed to many of the reforms.
By their tacit admission of profound social and political ills, the accords mark a sobering retreat for a Government that was celebrating Mexico's formal rise toward the developed world with the North American Free Trade Agreement just as the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army rose up against it.
 
'Deep Changes' Proposed
 Yet by moving quickly to meet many rebel demands, Mr. Salinas also came within reach of a settlement that would compromise neither his program of market-oriented economic transformation nor his party's place in the political system it has dominated for six decades.
"Deep changes have been proposed to make the yearnings of Indian communities for justice and dignity compatible with the modernization of the country," said Manuel Camacho Solis, Mr. Salinas's commissioner for peace in the southeastern state of Chiapas.
There are still reasons to question whether the proposals are enough.
In the highlands where the rebel movement has been strong, official promises of a better life have gone mostly unfulfilled since the 1910 Mexican revolution. And the Zapatistas say they will lay down their arms only when the conditions they rebelled against begin to change.
To the north, thousands of urban Mexicans have rallied in support of the insurgents. Thousands more -- peasant farmers, out-of-work laborers and others -- have turned to the Government demanding the same considerations given the Mayan Indians of Chiapas.
 
'Extraordinary' Achievement
 But Mr. Salinas's return to the political offensive, at least momentarily, also suggests that the rebels may be more vulnerable than they initially appeared to the pragmatism for which he and his Institutional Revolutionary Party are known.
"A guerrilla war in 1994, after the fall of the Berlin wall and everything else that has happened in the world, is such an extremely difficult proposition that what they have achieved already is extraordinary," Enrique Krause, a Mexican historian, said in a telephone interview today. "There is a difference between the agreement and their demands, but it is also an entirely reasonable difference."
In effect, the Government has bet that the Mexicans' fascination with the insurgency and their sense of shame at the poverty and political violence that have become almost synonymous with Chiapas do not necessarily mean full support for the Zapatista platform.
The rebels' complaints of discrimination, for example, have echoed powerfully in a society that pays ritual tribute to its pre-Hispanic past but little heed to its contemporary Indians. Rather than cede Indians the political autonomy sought by the insurgents, however, the Government offered measures that could affect local practices and national attitudes without sacrificing state authority.
New laws would outlaw discrimination against Indians for the first time, establish a special prosecutor's office to deal with such cases and formally recognize Indian customs for dealing with family relations, commerce, land use and minor crimes. Sensitivity to indigenous cultures would be taught in the schools and bilingual education programs would be expanded.
 
An Exceptional Case
 Similarly, Mr. Salinas refused to restore the Constitution's longstanding and often unfulfilled promise of land for all peasants who work it.
But without backing away from the land-tenure reforms that have been a pillar of his economic policy, the draft accords would recognize Chiapas as an exceptional case in order to restore lands taken from peasants and allow for the expropriation of private lands to break up large holdings "in cases of public utility."
If the agreement is put into effect, its promise of new roads, schools, housing and health clinics could at least raise Chiapas within a relatively short time from the bottom rank of Mexican states in some categories.
If the commitment in such areas appears large, though, it also fits clearly within the scheme Mr. Salinas has used to ease the impact of steps like the elimination of subsidies and the privatization of state industries. And while the accords make no mention of the National Solidarity Program, the President's huge antipoverty initiative, they constantly emphasize the responsibility of Government institutions to solve Chiapas's problems.
The Salinas administration's line against radical changes under the proposed settlement may be weakest on the issue of democratic reforms.
The accords include no binding commitment on the issue except at the state level. In Mr. Camacho's name, they express confidence that reforms will be approved by the Congress. But they speak only of the "inclusion" and "participation" of nonpartisan citizens in supervision of elections; the rebels and some opposition parties have demanded the Government cede control over electoral agencies entirely.
"Whatever they say, the Government is going to have to do many things quickly in order to make the elections credible," said Mr. Krause, the historian. "We are not going to achieve real democracy in minutes. But we have passed the point of no return."

HEADLINE: U.S. Ready to Help Ukraine and Georgia, if They Help Themselves

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
With Ukraine having tentatively agreed to destroy its nuclear weapons, Administration officials said today that President Clinton would double aid to Ukraine, to about $700 million a year.
The announcement is to be made when Mr. Clinton meets here Friday with Ukraine's President, Leonid M. Kravchuk. Administration officials said they were seeking to reward Mr. Kravchuk for agreeing to eliminate Ukraine's nuclear arms and encourage him to press for economic reforms. 
 The Administration hopes Mr. Kravchuk's visit, and a visit Monday by President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia, will help rebuff criticisms that its policy toward the former Soviet Union favors Russia over the other 14 republics.
Mr. Shevardnadze, whose nation is ravaged by civil war, is to urge Mr. Clinton to back international peacekeepers in Georgia, a proposal the Administration is ambivalent about.
The new aid total for Ukraine is to include economic aid of $350 million and $350 million to help disassemble the atomic weapons. Each figure is about double previous commitments.
 
More Pressure on Ukraine
 Administration officials said that to further help reform Ukraine's teetering economy, President Clinton would urge the International Monetary Fund to withhold $1.1 billion in loans for Ukraine unless it takes bolder steps to privatize industry and lower inflation, which is about 90 percent a month.
The White House is disappointed that Mr. Kravchuk will not be delivering Ukraine's formal accession to the accord to eliminate nuclear arms. Despite repeated efforts, he has failed to persuade Parliament to ratify the agreement he signed in January to eliminate 176 long-range missiles and more than 1,600 nuclear warheads.
Administration officials voiced confidence that Parliament would soon agree, though some officials fear that Mr. Kravchuk's declaration that he would not seek another term may complicate matters.
This raises the prospect that the Administration might have identified itself too closely with Mr. Kravchuk, just as many critics have asserted it has done with Russia's embattled President, Boris N. Yeltsin.
 
Position Seems Shaky
 But, as one White House official said, "Kravchuk is the President of Ukraine and therefore he's the one we deal with."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher told a Congressional committee on Tuesday that he was not convinced that Mr. Kravchuk was a lame duck.
Bowing to demands made by striking miners, Mr. Kravchuk has agreed to hold elections this June; they were originally scheduled for 1996. But Mr. Kravchuk has suggested that he might cancel the elections on the ground that it was wrong to yield to such coercion.
Before leaving Kiev, Mr. Kravchuk told journalists that his message would be that helping create an economically strong Ukraine is critical. In seeking billions in aid, he said, "I'm convinced that if a democratic and independent Ukraine exists and is given the necessary support, then imperial policies of any European country, not only Russia, will fail."
 
Looking Toward Georgia, Too
 Mr. Kravchuk, 60, was once the chief ideologist of the Ukrainian Communist Party. He resigned from the Politburo only after the failed Moscow coup in August 1991, and became a national hero soon after when he brokered a deal with Ukraine's nationalists to pursue independence from Moscow while keeping Ukraine's Communist establishment in power.
Administration officials said countries other than Russia would receive more than half the $2.5 billion in aid authorized last fall for former Soviet republics.
Over the past two years, Washington has committed $233 million to Georgia, most of it to help victims of the civil war. United States officials expect to contribute at least $100 million this year.
Washington sympathizes with Mr. Shevardnadze's request for peacekeepers. Concerned that Russia is flexing its muscles in Georgia, United States officials say they would rather see peacekeepers there than Russian troops. But Washington hesitates to back such a plan because of the cost, and fears that such a commitment would be open-ended, officials said.
One subject Mr. Kravchuk and Mr. Clinton are certain to discuss is the Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula that is part of Ukraine but dominated by ethnic Russians. On Jan. 30, the Crimeans chose a regional president who supports seceding and joining Russia.
Administration officials said they back Mr. Kravchuk's position that Crimea should remain part of Ukraine -- a stance vigorously opposed by Russia's restive nationalists.
"Crimea could blow up into a major problem," said one official.

HEADLINE: An Ancient Ritual and a Mother's Asylum Plea

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore.

 BODY:
In trying to deport Lydia Oluloro, the Federal Government has presented a simple case. A native of a tiny Nigerian village, Mrs. Oluloro came to Oregon in 1986 and lied when she said she would stay no longer than her one-year tourist visa allowed.
Mrs. Oluloro, who works as a janitor for $6.25 an hour and says she loves the Oregon rain, concedes the Government its basic point. But she has raised a defense that seizes on a growing international human rights issue and, if successful, could set a precedent for other asylum seekers. 
 A mother of two American-born girls, ages 5 and 6, Mrs. Oluloro says they face the certainty of genital mutilation by her relatives in Nigeria if she is deported.
The ancient ritual, frequently referred to as female circumcision and widely practiced in many African countries and parts of the Middle East, has been condemned by human rights advocates and health professionals in the West as barbaric and unsafe. It entails cutting away some part of a girl's genitalia before the onset of puberty to thwart sexual appetite and so maintain her virginity and enhance her appeal as a marital partner.
 
'These Are American Girls'
 Federal immigration officials say this is the first time that the prospect of genital mutilation has been raised as a ground for asylum, which by law is generally granted only if the applicant can prove "a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social club."
"I don't want them to get cut," Mrs. Oluloro said of her daughters, Shade, 6, and Lara, 5, "because these girls are American girls. They are not like African girls. It would be a horrible thing for them."
Mrs. Oluloro's unusual argument in support of her bid for asylum has been advanced against a backdrop of an ever increasing number of asylum requests -- 150,000 in the last year alone. There is now a backlog of 330,000 people trying to win American asylum, and advocates of a tight immigration policy in particular fear that creating precedents like the one sought by Mrs. Oluloro would add many thousands to the list.
 
Lifetime of Pain
 Mrs. Oluloro, who is now 32 and lives in Portland, says she herself was required by her relatives in Ilobu, the little Nigerian village where she lived as a girl, to submit to the ritual when she was about 4 years old. The result, she says, has been a lifetime of intermittent pain, particularly during birth of her two daughters.
She says her relatives in Nigeria have already told her that if her girls are to avoid being shunned, they too must undergo the ritual, which in most cases entails removal of the clitoris and the labia minora with a knife or a razor blade, generally without anesthetic. The procedure is often performed by female elders, who in the most extreme cases also stitch together the external labia, leaving only a tiny opening for urination and menstrual discharge. Before a woman's wedding night, the stitching is removed.
Many women who endure the procedure later experience not only an absence of sexual sensation but also infections, recurring pain, particularly during intercouse, and painful, dangerous childbirth.
 
Report by State Department
 Nigerian Government officials, who have expressed opposition to the practice, say their country's culture is not such that Mrs. Oluloro should fear her daughters' being required to submit to the ritual if she returns with them. A report issued last month by the State Department, however, suggests otherwise.
The report, on human rights abuses against women around the world, said that in predominantly Christian southern Nigeria, Mrs. Oluloro's native region, virtually all young girls were still subjected to genital mutilation, as were about half the girls in the Muslim-majority north. In all, the report estimated, there are now as many as 110 million women in the world whose genitalia have been mutilated.
Mrs. Oluloro has won support from feminists and human rights advocates across the the United States, but none from her former husband, Emanuel Oluloro. They divorced last year.
Mrs. Oluloro arrived from Nigeria eight years ago to join him here. But Mr. Oluloro, in the United States on an extended work visa, or green card, never completed the paperwork that would have made her residency legal.
In court papers filed before their divorce, she said her life with him in Portland had been torment, accusing him of spousal rape and of frequently abusing her in other ways. She has been awarded custody of the children, although he has said he would still like to have them.
Mr. Oluloro did not respond to requests for an interview. But he has denied abusing his wife. And during a hearing in February before the immigration judge who is considering the deportation case against her, he said that she had previously supported ritualized mutilation and that her change of heart had coincided with the Government's move to deport her. She denies that.
 
Excruciating Alternatives
 By Mrs. Oluloro's account, a deportation order would pose an anguishing choice: either take her children with her to Nigeria, where she says they face mutiliation, or leave them with her former husband, who she says is abusive.
"I will take my kids if I am forced to go," she said. "They are my life, my best friends."
But it is clearly a prospect she would not relish even if her daughters did not face the danger that she says she fears. "Here in Oregon, I am an independent woman," she said. "If I go back to Nigeria, I am not independent. No job. No husband. I would be returned to my father's house. And I would have no say."
The immigration judge, Kendall Warren, has said he will announce his decision on March 23. Mrs. Oluloro's lawyer, Tilman Hasche, says the odds are against her gaining asylum, given the narrow criteria of the law. Further, the fear of mutilation that Mrs. Oluloro cites is not for herself but for her daughters, who as American citizens are free to remain.
But the judge could simply dismiss the deportation case and allow Mrs. Oluloro to stay in the country on an extended work visa. For him to do so,she must meet three tests, the first of which she has already passed, having been in America at least seven years. The two others: that she would experience hardship if forced to leave, and that she has shown good moral character.
Paul Stultz, an immigration lawyer who is handling the Government's case against Mrs. Oluloru, declined to comment on the matter, citing rules of the Immigration and Naturalization Service that bar public discussion of unresolved cases.
 
Retort to the Criticism
 No matter which way the judge rules, his decision is certain to bring added attention to genital mutilation as an issue. Already African immigrants' use of the ritual has led to a bill, introduced by Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, that would prohibit administering it on anyone in this country under the age of 18.
Genital mutilation has also received heightened attention of late because it is the subject of condemnation in a widely recognized book, "Warrior Marks." A co-author was the novelist Alice Walker, who has also produced a film of the same title.
Denunciation of the ritual has not been free of criticism in kind. Quite apart from the accusation that Western critics are cultural imperialists meddling in a custom of foreign lands where they have no business, there is the argument that those efforts could have a backlash effect, hurting attempts under way in those countries to end the practice.
"Superior Western attitudes do not enhance dialogue or the equal exchange of ideas," Seble Dawit, a human rights lawyer, and Salem Mekuria, a film maker, wrote in a recent article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times. The two women, Africans living in the United States who oppose genital mutilation, say American critics, including Ms. Walker, take too blunt an approach. The practice should be viewed not in isolation, they say, but in the context of broader efforts to lift the poor educational, economic and social status of women throughout much of Africa.
Mr. Hasche, the lawyer for Mrs. Oluloro, has heard all the arguments. "Frankly," he said, "I don't give a damn if opposing this is a violation of someone's culture. To me, female genital mutilation is a violation of the physical and spiritual integrity of a person."
In any case, he said, the Oluloro children "are American girls" and as such "have more in common with all the other kids in Portland than they do with anyone in Africa."

Proffitt's Department Stores To Buy McRae's Retail Chain

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Proffitt's Inc., a regional department store chain based in Knoxville, Tenn., announced yesterday that it was purchasing privately held McRae's Inc. with a combination of $337 million in cash, debt and equity.
The combined companies operate 53 stores in small and midsized towns in the Southeast and are expected to have sales exceeding $700 million this year. 
 The story is a familiar one in the consolidating department store business, where survival, particularly for small regional chains, depends on gaining operating efficiencies and buying power. The same pressures pushing Federated Department Stores, with more than $7 billion in sales, to seek a merger with $6 billion R. H. Macy & Company are driving the alliance between Proffitt's and McRae's, whose combined sales will be roughly one-tenth of Federated's.
"The combined business will be of a size to enjoy substantial benefits associated with increased economies of scale," R. Brad Martin, chairman and chief executive of Proffitt's, said in a statement.
 
Eliminating Redundant Costs
 The companies will eliminate redundant costs by merging functions like accounting, distribution and other operational aspects of their business. Analysts expect Proffitt's, which struggled last year to open 11 new stores, to benefit from McRae's strong operational skills and inventory management systems. Conversely, McRae's, which is based in Jackson, Miss., should gain from Proffitt's merchandising expertise.
But Mr. Martin said that the merger would add to Proffitt's earnings, although he did not specify by how much.
McRae's will become a subsidiary of Proffitt's. Mr. Martin will retain his position in the combined company, and Richard D. McRae, scion of McRae's founder, will become president and chief operating officer.
But contrary to other retail mergers, this was a case of a little fish swallowing a bigger one. With 25 stores, Proffitt's had sales of $201 million in the year that ended Jan. 29, while the 28 McRae's stores had sales of $419 million in the same period.
For the fiscal year that ended Jan. 29, McRae's profits were $19.6 million, compared with $14.8 million in the 1992 fiscal year. Proffitt's earnings increased 2.8 percent, to $6.9 million, in the same period.
 
A Well-Capitalized Company
 The combination of $180 million in cash, $30 million in subordinated debt and $127 million in equity is about 7.8 times McRae's earnings before interest and taxes, a common measure of cash flow. The price is somewhat high for a retailer, but McRae's financial statement portrays a well-capitalized company that has managed to achieve a strong return on its assets despite the weak retail environment.
The McRae's stores will retain their name and operate as a separate subsidiary. Mr. Branham said McRae's has a strong home-related business, while Proffitt's strongest sales come from women's apparel.
Shares of Proffitt's, which have been depressed by the company's weak showing during the critical holiday season, jumped $1.75 yesterday, to $19.75 in Nasdaq trading, although the merger was not announced until after the market closed.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 5, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about the merger of Proffitt's Inc. and McRae's Inc. omitted the full name and title of the person who discussed the strengths of the two retailing companies and misspelled his last name. He is Jeff Branman, a managing director of Financo Inc., which advised McRae's.

Ways for investors to hitch their stars to suppliers for electric cars.

BYLINE: By Andrea Adelson 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
SHOULD investors grab a ride aboard the embryonic electric vehicle industry?
There are already half a dozen publicly traded companies that are developing components, like Valence Technology Inc.'s rechargeable lithium battery, Electrosource Inc.'s lead-acid battery, and Unique Mobility's electric motors, which could be used in emission-free cars.
These tiny, cash-hungry companies are attempting a breakthrough that American auto makers say is impossible: design the components of an electric car that would have the range, speed, refueling convenience and cost of a gasoline-powered rival. 
 The nascent industry got a kick-start last month when 11 Eastern states and the District of Columbia asked the Federal Government to impose California's stringent anti-smog rules on them. Among the states' demands is that zero-emission vehicles, presumably electric vehicles, be offered in 1998.
Despite the market's considerable new size, industry analysts raise caution flags for many reasons.
"It's hard to convince someone to buy on market projections for '98 in '94," said Martin A. Sankey, an electrical equipment analyst at CS First Boston, who follows Johnson Controls, a battery maker.
As with most emerging industries, investors often make bets on companies with no profits, unproved technology and untried production capability. There is also the threat that lobbying could undermine the Federal mandate and delay by several years the demand for electric vehicles, known as E.V.'s.
"Any investor who believes there is going to be a landslide transition in the next five years to E.V. ought to have their head examined," said Erik N. Jansen, a semiconductor analyst for Alex. Brown & Sons. Even so, he recommends shares in Valence, of San Jose, Calif., but says the growth potential for electric vehicles is a side issue. He sees opportunities for Valence's battery -- which may be capable of providing considerable energy from a battery smaller than conventional versions -- in cellular phones, camcorders and portable computers.
The company, which went public in May 1992, had a loss of $5.1 million in its third fiscal quarter, which ended on Dec. 31. It is not expected to be profitable until its 1995 fiscal year. Its stock closed yesterday at $17.50, unchanged, on Nasdaq.
A battery considered suitable for electric cars is a nickel-hydride version made by Energy Conversion Devices Inc. that is said to recharge quickly, use environmentally safe materials and have a long life. Yet Arthur P. Thomas, a broker for A. G. Edwards & Company in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., who follows the industry, does not recommend Energy Conversion as an investment. Nasdaq has delisted its shares because the company has fallen below the trading system's minimum financial standards.
"Their wealth is in the patents," Mr. Thomas said. "Their balance sheet looks like they'll be bankrupt in 90 days."
Mr. Thomas said the scientist who is the company's founding chief executive, Stanford R. Ovshinsky, is reluctant to share control. But the addition of a new director, Robert C. Stempel, the former chairman of General Motors, may presage a change. "He knows how to run a business," Mr. Thomas said, arguing that Mr. Stempel's track record at General Motors was better than generally thought.
Lawrence C. Oakley, editor of Conservative Speculator, an investment newsletter, recommends Unique Mobility Inc., based in Golden, Colo.
He likes Unique's strategy of accelerating development and commercialization of its electric motor by forming alliances with companies like Alcan Aluminum and BMW. "They are one of the better companies I've ever looked at," Mr. Oakley said, predicting that Unique, which closed at $7 yesterday, down 12.5 cents, could hit $100 in 10 years.
Environmentally conscious investors should not let their convictions be their only guide. A complication is whether these companies' technologies will actually cut pollution or just displace it from urban highways to the electric generating plants in less populated areas that will have to supply power to charge the batteries, said Alice Tepper Marlin, executive director of the Council on Economic Priorities, a nonprofit research group.

HEADLINE: President Condemns Beijing; Christopher Visit Questioned

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
President Clinton condemned the detention by China of Wei Jingsheng, its most prominent dissident, and several others, and Administration officials said the detentions could change Secretary of State Warren Christopher's plans to visit China next week.
[An associate of Mr. Wei reported early Saturday that he had been released. Some other dissidents who had been detained by the Government were also freed, but the status of others was uncertain.] 
 Reacting to the arrests today, Mr. Clinton said at a news conference that the United States had "sent a very stern statement" to Beijing and added, "We strongly disapprove of what was done, and it obviously is not helpful to our relations."
State Department officials said that at least for now, Mr. Christopher was not canceling his visit because of the arrests, but they said it would also be wrong to assume that the visit would occur.
Mr. Christopher left this afternoon on a 10-day trip in which he is scheduled to visit Australia, Japan, China and Russia.
 
Christopher Deplores Arrests
 Speaking to reporters en route to Honolulu, Mr. Christopher said, "We deplore the detentions," adding that the United States believed it was essential that those arrested be released.
But he said the Chinese actions only served to underscore the importance of raising the issue of China's human rights record at the highest levels and making human rights "a major focus" of his trip.
State Department officials said the purpose of his three-day visit to China, scheduled to begin next Friday, was to caution Beijing that the United States wanted to see more progress on human rights if it was to renew China's favorable trading status.
"We view the situation with utmost gravity," Joan Spero, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, said to reporters in commenting about the arrests. "I would simply state that it certainly will cast a pall over the planned visit."
The arrests came on the very day that John Shattuck, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, left Beijing after talking with Chinese officials about the hundreds of dissidents in jail, violations of religious freedom and other human rights matters.
At a White House news conference with President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine, Mr. Clinton said, "I have done what I could to make it clear that the United States does not seek to isolate China economically or politically and that we want a constructive and strong relationship with them, but that the observance of basic human rights is an important thing to us, along with nonproliferation, along with fair trade rules, and that was certainly not a helpful action."
Several American officials said the arrest would hurt China's chances of persuading President Clinton to extend China's low-tariff trading status, which comes up for renewal in June.
Ms. Spero said the arrests set back the human rights progress that Mr. Clinton had repeatedly said was required for most-favored-nation trading status and set back "our interest in putting U.S.-China relations on a much healthier and longer-term footing."
She also suggested that the arrests would make it harder for the Administration to have the needed Congressional support to renew the favorable trading status.
One State Department official said that during his 11-hour flight to Hawaii, Mr. Christopher would no doubt ask his team of Asia experts about the pros and cons of canceling the China trip.
Christine Shelly, a State Department spokeswoman, said Secretary Christopher was keeping abreast of the developments in China and would certainly be interested in hearing the response that the American Ambassador in Beijing received about the arrests.
On Thursday, Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, warned China that it had not done enough to warrant renewal of its preferred trading status. "It's very important we make more progress," he told reporters.
Mr. Lord said, for instance, that it was a positive sign that China had agreed to let the Red Cross visit Chinese prisoners, but said Beijing still had to do more in this regard.
Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group, called on Mr. Christopher to postpone his trip to China. It criticized Beijing, saying that the dissidents had been "arbitrarily detained, apparently in an effort either to silence them in the week before Christopher's arrival or to punish them for comments made earlier."

HEADLINE: Clinton Vows to Improve Relations With Ukraine

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
President Clinton pledged a new era of warm relations with Ukraine today and told its President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, that the United States would double its aid to Ukraine to $700 million this year.
Mr. Clinton made clear that the key to the improved relations was Ukraine's making good on its promise to eliminate its 176 long-range missiles and 1,800 nuclear warheads, most of which are aimed at the United States. 
 At a joint news conference at the White House, Mr. Clinton also said he wanted vastly improved economic ties with Ukraine, which American officials say could someday become an economic powerhouse, with its 52 million people and a wealth of natural resources.
"The United States believes that the potential of Ukraine is enormous, and that we have to have a long-term view of our partnership," he said.
 
Concern Over Inflation
 American officials are eager to help stabilize Ukraine's desperate economic situation, concerned that it could create political chaos and fuel ethnic tensions. Ukraine's inflation rate is running at 90 percent a month, and its industrial output has fallen by more than 40 percent over the last two years.
One of Mr. Clinton's messages to Mr. Kravchuk was that Ukraine should move vigorously in slashing its inflation rate and privatizing industry.
In return, Mr. Clinton said, Washington would increase its economic aid to Kiev to $350 million next year, from the $155 million announced in January. In addition, the United States signed an investment treaty with Ukraine, announced plans to lower tariffs on some Ukrainian goods, and set up a joint trade and investment commission. The United States will also double to $350 million its aid to help Ukraine dismantle its missiles and warheads.
"The United States recognizes that it is very important to be supportive as Ukraine tries to reform and get through this period of economic transition," Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Kravchuk told American officials that a strong and stable Ukraine could an be an important buffer against any expansionist tendencies in Russia. "Ukraine can play a great stabilizing role in the future," he said.
At times today, Mr. Kravchuk was outshone by a 16-year-old girl whom he asked to accompany him to Washington: Oksana Baiul, the ebullient Ukrainian orphan who bested Nancy Kerrigan to win the Olympic gold medal in women's figure skating.
"I think it's kind of neat that he asked her to come," Mr. Clinton said.
White House officials acknowledged that it was a bit awkward for the President to meet with the skater before he meets with the American Olympic team.
According to American officials, Mr. Clinton urged Mr. Kravchuk to redouble his efforts to persuade the Ukrainian Parliament to approve accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
Under that treaty, as well as other agreements, Ukraine has committed itself to becoming a non-nuclear state. Its Parliament may not vote on the treaty until after elections scheduled for March 27, and some American officials fear that the new Parliament may be less inclined to approve it, especially since Mr. Kravchuk appears to be a lame duck. He has indicated that he does not plan to run for re-election in June.
Nonetheless, Mr. Clinton voiced confidence that Mr. Kravchuk would win approval for the treaty.
 
Agreement With Russia
 To pave the way for Ukraine's denuclearization, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kravchuk signed a three-way agreement in January with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia in which Washington and Moscow provided some security assurances to Ukraine and pledged to reimburse it for the highly enriched uranium in its warheads.
Mr. Clinton showed his gratitude for Mr. Kravchuk's denuclearization pledge in several ways, including the aid increase for dismantling the weapons. In addition, in a demonstration of the way he often personalizes diplomacy, Mr. Clinton hailed the Ukrainian leader for his "statesmanship and leadership."
American officials also said they would work with Ukraine to deal with Russia's decision to cut off natural gas shipments as a result of Ukraine's failure to pay more than $1 billion it owes Russia.

The Economy
The U.S. unemployment rate dipped an unexpected two-tenths of a percentage point, to 6.5 percent, in February. Unusually severe winter weather and statistical quirks again muddied the results, which also included the greatest shrinkage in the workweek in 10 years, a second consecutive drop of 20,000 jobs in the construction industry and a reduction of 10 percent in the ranks of the partly unemployed.

HEADLINE: Croatian Leader Backs Pact by Bosnia's Muslims and Croats

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, March 4

 BODY:
Breaking with the hard-line nationalists who have backed him in the past, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia has endorsed a peace accord signed this week by Bosnia's Muslims and Croats and asserted that only people who hold "narrow-minded" or "extreme" views could oppose them.
In a nationally televised address Thursday evening, Mr. Tudjman formally approved the pacts, under which Croats and Muslims in Bosnia are to form a federated state that will then join in a loose union with Croatia, and said they had "a far-reaching and even crucial historical meaning" that would protect the interests of Croats whether they were in Bosnia or in Croatia. 
 Mr. Tudjman said the accords "can be opposed only by those who uphold narrow-minded nationalist and extreme fundamentalist views."
"Croats should realize that this solution is historically necessary in order to maintain the Croatian presence in Bosnia and to protect the strategic interests of the Croatian state," Mr. Tudjman said.
"We are nearing the end of the war and the beginning of a new period in the development of the sovereign and democratic Croatian state," he said. "In these circumstances, we will be able to devote all of our strength to the economic revival and cultural development of our homeland."
Mr. Tudjman said that in exchange for signing the Washington accords, Croatia had been "explicitly promised" help in regaining Croatian control over Serbian-occupied regions, as well as reconstruction aid, renewed access to international loans, and membership in NATO's new "Partnership for Peace" program for former Communist nations in East Europe.
President Tudjman's endorsement of the Washington accords represented a sharp reversal in his Government's policy of recent months. Until recently, allies of Mr. Tudjman had been portraying Bosnia's Muslims as fanatics dedicated to establishing a fundamentalist Islamic state.
 
Hard-Liners May Go
 Some Croats expect that as part of his new policy, Mr. Tudjman will dismiss hard-liners in his Government, among them Defense Minister Gojko Susak. But a senior foreign diplomat here said that while the Croatian President may reduce the power of nationalists like Mr. Susak, he will probably not remove them.
"Tudjman knows that if he fires these people, they are likely to become leaders of some radical opposition to the new policy," the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "He'll prefer to keep them inside the regime, where he can watch them and control them."
Mr. Susak has made no public statements since the accords were signed, but a Bosnian branch of Croatia's governing party issued a statement questioning the accords.
"The Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina are willing to accept only a state which will insure Croat sovereignty in their territory," the statement said.
Before the Muslim-Croatian talks in Washington began last week, Mr. Tudjman forced the ouster of Mate Boban as leader of the militant Bosnian Croats. He was replaced by Kresimir Zubak, an ally of Mr. Tudjman's who signed the Washington accords on behalf of the Bosnian Croats.
The chief weakness of the Croatian-Bosnian Muslim accords is that they do not include the Bosnian Serbs, who hold most of the territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"I deem it necessary to emphasize that the Croat-Muslim alliance is not directed against the Serbs, nor is it intended to prolong the war," Mr. Tudjman said. "It is focused on the immediate achievement of peace."
Diplomats and other analysts in Zagreb said it would probably be difficult to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to join the new federation, but expressed hope that Russia would help push them in that direction.
Arriving in Belgrade after high-level meetings in Moscow, the political leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, did not rule out accepting the Washington accords. He suggested that Croatia's Foreign Minister, Mate Granic, travel to Belgrade for talks.
Mr. Granic has no immediate plans to visit Belgrade but is scheduled to fly to Moscow next week for meetings with Russian officials. Arriving today in Trieste, Italy, Mr. Granic said talks would begin soon aimed at bringing Bosnian Serbs into the new federation "on the terms that were accepted by the two other parties."
The accords call for Bosnia's division into semi-autonomous cantons that would have broad authority over local affairs.

HEADLINE: Airlines Rediscover Short Trips

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
Air fare wars come and go these days as predictably as a flight delay out of Chicago on a Friday evening. And with such a steady stream of cut-rate deals -- two rounds of cuts were announced this week alone -- many travelers refuse to buy anything but a sharply discounted ticket.
But for short flights between dozens of cities in the Eastern United States, some large airlines like Continental and USAir have in recent weeks responded to growing competitive pressures by offering lower fares that the carriers say are permanent. And while few things remain the same for long in the volatile airline industry, there are many indications that these changes will be a lasting boon to millions of travelers. 
 Delta Air Lines executives said they would announce their plan for a new low-fare service in the East and possibly elsewhere in coming months. United Airlines, the nation's largest airline, has also said that it wants to start a high-frequency service to compete more effectively against Southwest Airlines and other carriers on short flights.
In what could prove to be the most far-reaching attempt to revamp the airline business since the failed effort by American Airlines two years ago to introduce its simplified "value pricing" fare structure, Continental and USAir have lowered fares on many short flights to double-digit levels, eliminated many restrictions and put additional nonstop flights on routes that previously had mostly connecting flights.
 
Many More Flights
 "Six months ago, we would either be in a fare war or out of a fare war, but now fares are staying down," said Bob Wood, a manager at Garris Travel in Norfolk, Va. In Norfolk, Continental has increased the number of nonstop flights to other East Coast cities to 28 beginning next Wednesday, from 5 in September, and has cut its unrestricted one-way fare to Newark, for example, from $229 to $69.
"It is opening up a whole new world for our customers," Mr. Wood said.
Travelers elsewhere are seeing even greater increases in service. In Greensboro, N.C., passengers were offered only three nonstop flights a day on Continental last fall. Next week, the airline plans to start offering 57 nonstop flights a day. Unrestricted one-way fares from Greensboro that used to range from $220 to $341 have been cut to $69 to $139.
"It is not a fare exercise," Don Valentine, Continental's senior vice president of marketing and sales, said. "It is a new way of doing business."
That new way is spreading in the industry, with many airlines unabashedly modeling themselves after Southwest Airlines, the nation's eighth-largest airline and the only consistently profitable major carrier over the last 20 years.
Southwest's strategy is deceptively simple. The carrier has shown time and again that by offering low fares and providing frequent service, it can draw people that otherwise might not fly.
More frequent service, however, does not come easily. Continental and USAir, following Southwest's lead, have had to cut the time their planes are on the ground between flights to 20 minutes, from 45.
To do that, USAir has speeded check-in procedures, reduced the number of crew changes during the day and loaded its planes with enough food and drinks for several trips, rather than restocking at every stop. USAir said the quick turnaround of 22 planes that serve 18 cities enabled it to free 3,500 more seats simply by using its planes and employees more productively.
Other major airlines are expected to follow suit because they are feeling pressure from not only an expanding Southwest and from Continental's spreading "Peanuts Fares" service, but also from fledgling airlines like Private Jet, Valujet, and Kiwi International Air Lines. Although these carriers lack the marketing heft of more established airlines, travelers are rewarding their low-fare policies by flocking to their planes.
So, even though the new fare structure represents only roughly 5 to 10 percent of the flying that is done on the East Coast, industry analysts said the new type of short-route service might quickly sweep the country. This trend, with new point-to-point flying between many cities, also underscores how airlines are rethinking the hub-and-spoke system they developed during the 1980's.
"It's like the Olympic skating," said Robert Harrell, vice president of American Express's air fare management division. "We're all on the edge of our seats to see how this comes out."
Travelers who appreciate the new low fares are undoubtedly cheering on this trend. After all, air fares on short routes -- especially in Eastern states -- have long seemed to bear little relation to the distance traveled.
That is because airlines have used short trips to subsidize long trips, where fares have fallen the most quickly since deregulation because of the development of the hub-and-spoke networks. The hub system allowed many airlines to offer competing service between far-flung cities, although often with out-of-the-way connections through hub airports.
As fares rose on short flights, particularly in cities served by few competing airlines, more and more travelers decided not to fly. Many companies also cut travel spending during the recession and imposed tightfisted policies that they vow are not going to change. These factors have affected all but the most popular business flights, like the shuttle operations that link Boston, New York and Washington.
"There's this attitude of conservatism, where spending is not as good a thing as it was in the 80's," said Ralph Brown, a travel management consultant in Hoffman Estates, Ill., whose clients include large companies like Nike, Texas Instruments and Intel. "It will never go back to the way it was."
Whether these latest changes will last depends largely on whether airlines with lower costs continue to prosper and set low prices that competitors have no choice but to match.
But airline executives, who have too often seen their industry turned on its wing tip in a short period, shy away from making predictions on such matters.
"When you talk about permanency in the pricing world," said Gary Harig, assistant vice president of pricing at USAir, "it's pretty dangerous ground."

HEADLINE: 'Manhood Training' at the Mosque: Hope, Discipline, Defiance

SERIES: Ministry of Hope, Message of Hate: Last of three articles on the Nation of Islam.

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT 

 BODY:
More than two dozen black men, many dressed in work boots and baggy slacks and a few in business suits with briefcases at their sides, recently climbed the steep concrete stairs to Muhammad's Mosque No. 7 in Harlem in search of two things the Nation of Islam promised they could find inside: brotherhood and proper direction.
The men dutifully trudged through a fresh coat of snow to the unadorned blond-brick building that houses the mosque as well as a supermarket, a combination barber shop and beauty salon, a boxing gym and a black theater company, all stacked in three stories near the northeast corner of 125th Street and Fifth Avenue. 
 There are no onion domes or gilded Islamic iconography here -- only a modest, hand-lettered sign outside a third-floor window indicates that this is a place of Islamic work and worship, the latest incarnation of a flagship Nation of Islam mosque that was largely built by Malcolm X and has been led for more than a decade by Louis Farrakhan.
Yet, while much of Harlem stirred to a sluggish start on this Saturday, the men, many of them non-Muslims and some visiting the mosque for the first time, had little difficulty finding their way to the building and to their seats for what mosque officials are describing as "manhood training."
 
Old-Fashioned Values
 The Nation of Islam has built its mostly urban black membership in large part by retrofitting generations of men with values of old-fashioned manners and behavior. Mixed in with heavy doses of religious mysticism, separatist ideology and hate-charged rhetoric aimed at anyone -- white, Jewish or black -- thought to impede black progress, are equally heavy doses of self-respect, self-love and self-reliance.
Although sermons, the group's newspaper and books promoted by the organization are often laced with the stinging language of bigotry, there was no evidence of such views at the three-hour training session.
Manhood training, a pilot program aimed at nonmembers, was started a month ago to answer the often-heard criticism that Mr. Farrakhan's brand of Islam was little more than a movement of oratory, not deeds. In Manhattan, Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn and in Westchester County and Long Island, the once-a-week course is offered free, Conrad Muhammad, leader of the Harlem mosque, said in an interview.
"In order to be a well-rounded man, you have to know things like how to manage a household economy, how to write a check and balance a checkbook," he said. "And these are things that many of our men come to this training without."
Mr. Muhammad said that a typical session attracted 200 men and that the program enabled the mosque to reach people who were not already believers, people in the broader black and Hispanic community, "to help our people in these communities to organize themselves."
He noted that America took centuries to build and said Mr. Farrakhan's group would not be built overnight. But he added that "we should be credited" for what the group had done so far, "because if a man is paralyzed, if you get him to move a finger, that's a cause for celebration."
The training program is one reason that in expanding black circles the Harlem mosque -- the nerve center of Nation of Islam activities in New York -- is becoming a landmark of hope and defiance. Many blacks in Harlem and throughout the New York metropolitan region say they see it as a factory in which men and women, whether troubled by drugs or criminality or simply uncertainty, can be retooled into community assets.
A young woman who said she is not a Muslim suggested how influential that view was, saying there was a growing chic in which clean-shaven young men with close-cropped hair in suits and bow ties were now regarded in her circle as cute.
Certainly there are many black voices in Harlem and elsewhere that speak of worry and concern whenever Mr. Farrakhan's name arises. One longtime neighborhood resident, Albert Murray, the writer, said the popularity of the Nation of Islam was a troubling indication of the extent of confusion racking much of black America.
"It's a bunch of ignorance," he said. "What concerns me most is that this promotion or stimulation of a feeling of alienation, separatism and hostility, would put down legitimate ambitions of American citizens that the civil rights movement made realizable."
But it is just as easy to find supporters, people like Tekima Berlack, a Harlem hat store owner, a non-Muslim who stood outside the 369th Armory in Harlem, where Mr. Farrakhan spoke recently, shouting encouragement to the blocks-long columns of men inching past on the way to hear him. "Glad to see you, brother!" Ms. Berlack and several other middle-aged cheerleaders shouted. "Good to see you come out tonight!"
And in more than a month of frequent visits to Muhammad's Mosque No. 7, with its narrow hallways, exposed wiring and closed window blinds radiating a scrubbed-bare austerity, it was not unusual to see people enter with wide-eyed expectations and a touch of awe.
"Today, most black people accept the Nation of Islam the same way they accept any other church," said C. Eric Lincoln, professor emeritus of religion at Duke University and author of "The Black Muslims in America." "The Nation of Islam is not exotic anymore."
 
The Training
Part Therapy, Part Preaching
 On this recent snowy Saturday, the glass door at the foot of the mosque's stairs was flung open to black men, any black men, who cared to participate in manhood training. It is part lecture, part paramilitary drilling and part group therapy and catharsis for inner-city blues.
It is also a seamless dissemination of the basic tenets of Nation of Islam philosophy, including handouts detailing the 26 "restricted laws of Islam," which was underscored by a lecture on the perils of pork, gambling, lying and adultery. There was also a guide given to each man on proper diet, and a glossary of terms that included the words "reliance" and "adversity."
A tall, honey-voiced man later introduced as Brother Kenneth 6X glanced at his watch and decided that the first lesson of the day would be about punctuality.
"Be on time, brothers," he said, admonishing nearly half the men who took their seats 15 minutes after the scheduled 10 A.M. start. "Don't think that because the weather is bad that we are not going to start on time; we are going to begin on time."
The men, whose ages appeared to range from the mid-20's to the mid-50's, sat shoulder to shoulder in straight-backed plastic chairs and nodded their agreement.
Like most free events sponsored by the Nation of Islam, people were encouraged to make donations. Few left the manhood class without dropping some cash in a plastic tub on a table at the back of the room. The Muslims also asked participants to fill out detailed background forms, a request reminiscent of Mr. Farrakhan's speech at the armory when he asked his audience of more than 10,000 men to fill out index cards with their names, addresses and Social Security numbers.
Many of the men attending the manhood training classes, like other blacks attracted to the teachings of the Nation of Islam, say they carefully pick and choose from the group's smorgasbord of race remedies and try not to get swept up in the sheer power of Muslim persuasion.
"I'm not interested in being a Muslim," said a 33-year-old publishing executive who works in midtown Manhattan and has attended several manhood training sessions at the Harlem mosque. "I'm a thinking individual who takes and uses anything I want from anyone who offers a good idea."
The executive, a Harlem homeowner, asked that his name not be used because he feared that his white and Jewish co-workers might misunderstand his relationship with the Muslims. "I like their commitment to empowerment and to doing for self," he said. "I want to stand with them for that. I don't hate anyone."
Nonetheless, Jews and whites are frequent targets of much of the Muslim leadership's superheated oratory. And such speech seldom fails to whip the 400 or so people who regularly attend Sunday afternoon services at the Harlem mosque into a frenzy of approving shouts of "um-huh!" and "yes!"
 
Emphasis on Cooperation
 For the most part, however, the manhood class concentrated on what black men could do to improve themselves and their neighborhoods. Much of the time, Brother Kenneth lectured about the importance of "economic unity" and "pooling resources."
"To build a nation, you can't do it individually," he told the men, who nodded in agreement. "We have to work cooperatively."
Almost as if to demonstrate his point, the class was turned over to another man, a stout former marine with a rumbling voice and seemingly infinite patience. For almost 30 minutes he taught the men the basics of military marching -- Nation of Islam style.
For example, as the men marched in place -- arms swinging and knees pumping -- and yelled in cadence -- "One! Two! Three! Four! -- he would help keep time by shouting out the names of Islamic holy men. "This is not like in the white man's army," he told the marchers. "We want you to think."
 
The Origins
From Malcolm X To Farrakhan
 Malcolm X, who became a Muslim while serving a prison sentence, was an early minister of the Nation of Islam's mosque in New York. Alex Haley's 1964 book, "The Autobiography of Malcolm X," says that in the summer of 1954 the temple was hardly more than a "little storefront."
But by raiding the congregations of some of the city's black churches, Malcolm X began to build a large following in Harlem. A few months after he left the Nation in 1964 for a more orthodox brand of Islam and was assassinated by Nation of Islam followers, Louis Farrakhan was named minister.
In 1975 Elijah Muhammad, the longtime leader of the Nation of Islam, died, and was succeeded by his son, Warith Deen Mohammad, who changed his spelling of his last name. He recalled Mr. Farrakhan to Chicago, but a short time later the two split, with Mr. Mohammad establishing a new branch of more orthodox Islam and Mr. Farrakhan leading the Nation of Islam.
The mosque led by Malcolm X, on the southwest corner of 116 Street and what is now Malcolm X Boulevard, is the site of the Malcolm Shabazz Masjid and Sister Clara Muhammad Elementary and Secondary School. It belongs to Mr. Mohammad's more orthodox Islamic order.
The Nation of Islam moved its mosque many times, settling on the present site in 1986. Conrad Muhammad, 29, became the minister there in 1991.
 
Clashes With the Police
 With the exception of occasional clashes with the police over the years -- one resulting in the death of a police officer in 1972, when he was shot in a scuffle with mosque members while investigating a false 911 call to the mosque -- the Nation of Islam in Harlem has had few problems with the city authorities.
But on Jan. 9, the Fruit of Islam, the organization's security force, "rolled out," as one mosque member put it, eight New York police officers when they entered the building during a Sunday service to investigate what turned out to be a false report that someone was robbing the mosque.
The incident, in which the officers suffered minor injuries, led to the arrest of a 29-year-old mosque member. The confrontation, coupled with the shooting two days later of a black, unarmed 17-year-old orthodox Muslim in what the police said was an East New York crack house, touched off a wave of tension between blacks and the newly installed Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The tensions also raised the profile of black Muslims in New York City, particularly those in the Harlem mosque. An increased fascination, mosque members say, has already translated into new support for Mr. Farrahkan and his teachings.
"I think what happens is that a lot of people decide to forgive him for this negative side of him because they see the 'positive side' as being somewhat redemptive," said Ellis Cose, the author of a 1993 book, "The Rage of a Privileged Class." Ultimately, Mr. Cose said, such moral reductions are a trap. "If you take part of it," he said of the Muslim world view, "you take all of it."
 
The Critics
Anger Directed At Wrong Targets
 Albert Murray, the Harlem writer, was referring to this melting pot of contrasting views when he said that at its root Mr. Farrakhan's movement was anti-intellectual. He lamented that while Mr. Farrakhan could draw thousands of blacks to Harlem, fewer than a couple of hundred would probably appear to hear another prominent black man, Ronald H. Brown, the Secretary of Commerce.
Representative Major R. Owens, a Brooklyn Democrat who is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, has been outspoken about his concerns that elected black officials may become too closely allied with Mr. Farrakhan. But, he said in a recent interview, he understands why the Muslim minister attracts a great deal of attention in black communities.
"People respond to any strong leader who is clear about what he stands for and has a following of people with a great deal of fervor," Mr. Owens asserted.
"There are a lot of frustrated, angry, bitter people who are looking for a leader," he said later. "In some cases they are looking for something to hate."
The tragedy of the Farrakhan phenomenon is that it directs black anger and frustration at the wrong targets, Mr. Owens said, adding that the political alliance between blacks and Jews "is vital to our survival."
Besides, he asked, what has the Nation if Islam really accomplished? "The Nation has not produced any jobs yet," Mr. Owens said. "It has not solved the crime problem."
 
The Supporters
Nods of Assent For Muslim Power
 Tekima Berlack is one of many who see things differently. "Minister Farrakhan represents power in the community," she said recently as she sat in her hat store on 125th Street.
The shop is one of many small businesses that operate in the shopping center Mart 125. Mart 125, one of many crossroads where the people of Harlem gather and discuss the events of the day, has been full of debate about Mr. Farrakhan and the tremors of racial politics surrounding him and his former spokesman, Khallid Abdul Muhammad.
Many in Harlem speak glowingly of Mr. Farrakhan and the Muslims he commands. His likeness is frequently found in shops and at vendors' stands in posters and velvet paintings alongside those of Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Recordings of Mr. Farrakhan's speeches are hawked on Harlem streets with almost the same urgency as the latest releases of popular hip hop and R&B artists.
And while many are quick to dismiss the anti-Semitism that surges through some of Mr. Farrakhan's oratory as simply a "white media" exaggeration of his message, the mere question of whether the Muslim minister and his followers are promoting hate is most often met in Harlem with questioning looks and incredulous expressions.
 
Gaining Status Through Demotion
 Even Mr. Farrakhan's recent demotion of Khallid Muhammad, for his racist and anti-Semitic remarks to a group of students at Kean College in Union City, N.J., seems to have only bolstered Mr. Farrakhan's standing in Harlem.
"I believe in the words of Elijah Muhammad that the white men are devils," said 18-year-old Nathaniel (Duce) Powell.
Other supporters were more reticent. For example, the owner of a black art gallery said he feared "an audit or worse" if he identified himself as someone who attended the Farrakhan speech with his son in Harlem last month.
But for thousands of others, including Tekima Berlack, a tall woman who favors blunt talk and a regal carriage, Mr. Farrakhan remains a heroic spokesman.
"I'm tired," she said, thinking back about her life, which she contended had been dogged at almost every turn by white racism. "I wasn't able to save my children from it, but I'm hoping to save my grandchildren."
Even as a Christian, Ms. Berlack confessed, she is still trying to persuade her son to embrace the Muslims, or at least their example.
Why?
"Because I have to leave my son where he's going to get protection," she replied. "Before I close my eyes in this world, he's going to be Farrakhan's."
 
THURSDAY Louis Farrakhan, man of contrasts, preaches love but says there is no shame in hatred.
 
YESTERDAY Security companies affiliated with the Nation are taking in $1 million a year from public agencies.

Mars Gains In Its Plans For Russia

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 4

 BODY:
Master Foods Russia, a subsidiary of Mars Inc., has received preliminary approval from Moscow's regional administration to build three food-product factories for the Russian market.
The company expects to make Mars and Snickers bars, Uncle Ben's sauces and converted rice, and Whiskas and Pedigree Pal pet foods. 
 Master Foods said in a news release Thursday that the three factories, which it hopes to complete by the end of 1995, could employ up to 1,000 people in food production. A company executive said total employment, including jobs in warehousing, distribution and other support services, could reach 5,000.
The company's investment in the factories would exceed $50 million, the executive said.
The factories would be built in Stupino, an industrial city of 125,000 about 60 miles southeast of Moscow. It used to be closed to foreigners because military components were produced there. Like other towns long dependent on the military, Stupino has had rising unemployment.
 
Approvals Needed
 Moscow's municipal and regional governments must approve a feasibility study by Master Foods before construction can begin. A team of Western engineers visited Stupino this week to begin the study.
The project is one of the most significant foreign investment proposals to be put forward in Russia since the strong showing of nationalists and Communists in the December parliamentary elections. Western investors have grown skittish here since the Government announced it would pursue a more moderate reform course and a less-stringent monetary policy.
Master Foods products, among the most popular Western imports, are widely available and heavily advertised. In addition to its candy bars, introduced in 1991, Master Foods has pioneered the marketing of pet foods, which were virtually nonexistent during the Soviet era and have become status symbols among Russians.
Unlike other Western companies, which have raised the ruble price of their products rapidly as the nation's currency has devalued and prices have increased, Master Foods has tried to keep the cost of its candy bars more stable. A Snickers bar costs about 600 rubles (about 35 cents).
 
51 Plants in 30 Countries
 Given the popularity in Russia of its products, which are now imported from the United States, Western Europe and Australia, the company executive said building the factories was a logical step. Mars currently has 51 plants in 30 countries.
A second phase, to produce Mars ice cream products, should be finished by 1998. The Moscow regional government has agreed to supply land on terms of a 49-year lease.
Anatoly C. Tyazhlov, chief administrator of the Moscow region, signed a decree on Jan. 27 accepting the initial Master Foods proposal to build the factories. The plants would "assure a more expedient use of labor resources freed from military industrial plants," the decree said.
The factories would have the capacity to produce 150,000 tons of food products a year.

HEADLINE: Weather Lifts Joblessness In New York and New Jersey

BYLINE: By ASHLEY DUNN 

 BODY:
Dampened by winter storms, the overall unemployment rate for New York and New Jersey took a turn for the worse last month, while the rate for New York City improved, reflecting the growing strength of the city's economy.
In New York State, the unemployment rate, adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations, increased to 7.8 percent last month from 7.1 percent in January, according to figures released yesterday by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. It was the first big increase since October. 
 The change represented a loss of about 58,000 jobs in the state, which has 672,000 people out of work.
New Jersey's unemployment rate also edged up last month, to 7.3 percent from 6.8 percent in January. The increase represented about 17,000 people who lost jobs, bringing the total number of unemployed in New Jersey to 295,000.
 
The Weather Factor
 The United States Department of Labor does not provide monthly unemployment figures for Connecticut.
The higher unemployment rates in New York and New Jersey ran counter to a decline in the national rate, which dropped to 6.5 percent last month from 6.7 percent in January. The drop, described by economists as a heartening sign of the continuing recovery, represented the addition of 217,000 new jobs.
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the mid-Atlantic regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is part of the Labor Department, said a main reason for the higher unemployment rate in New York and New Jersey was the severity of storms this winter. A series of 15 storms has shut down construction and made job hunting difficult, he said.
Mr. Ehrenhalt said the bureau's monthly unemployment survey was taken during a particularly stormy week, which probably further increased the figure.
"Over all, these figures don't show some new deterioration in the regional economy," he said. "Fundamentally, the regional economy is showing some strength. On the whole, we came through the month pretty well."
 
 
New York City Rate Is 10%
 A bright spot in the regional economy was New York City, where the unemployment rate dropped to 10 percent last month from 10.8 percent in January.
A total of 320,000 people were out of work in the city, while 2.9 million people had jobs, the bureau said.
Mr. Ehrenhalt said the improvement in the city's unemployment figures, which are not adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations, stemmed from additional hiring in the service and financial sectors, which include hotels, restaurants, hospitals, advertising and securities companies.
"We're not in a boom, but we are seeing a slow improvement in the economy," he said. "Given that the number could have gone up because of the storms, it really shows the strength in the economy."
Mr. Ehrenhalt said the encouraging drop in the city's unemployment rate was also helped by stability in the construction, manufacturing and trade sectors, which had been particularly hard hit through the recession.
"If we can get March to go out like a lamb, we can look forward to an economic spring," he said.

Electronics District Hits Hard Times

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 4

 BODY:
In a nation where it is considered impolite to call attention to oneself, the Akihabara district stands out, with its neon lights, its signs painted hot pink and emerald green and its hundreds of garish discount stores and back-alley stalls bursting with gadgetry, from televisions the size of postage stamps to remote-control toilets that provide a spray of water in lieu of paper. 
 "If you can't find something you like here, you can't find it anywhere," boasted Tsuyoshi Sato, president of the district merchants' association.
 
Japanese Pay More
 But if Akihabara is a showcase of Japan's ingenuity, it is now also a symbol of its troubles. Sales here have slumped in Japan's stubborn recession. And Sony, Matsushita and the other electronics giants have been unable to devise new products to follow such blockbuster items as the videocassette recorder, the Walkman, the compact disk, the camcorder, the microwave oven, the compact camera, the fax, the cordless phone, the calculator and the digital watch.
At the same time, retailing in Japan is undergoing a major change, with discount shops springing up everywhere. "In the past people came to Akihabara for a good price," said Bunzo Miyazawa, manager of a tiny store called Yamaichi Denki, or Yamaichi Electric. "Now people can find good prices in the suburbs too."
The rise of the yen has made Japanese products more expensive for foreigners, driving away some of the tourists from the district's shops. Japanese products are often cheaper in New York and Hong Kong than in Tokyo anyway because of the inefficient distribution system here.
All these factors have combined to produce what some merchants call the hardest times in memory. Two leading retailers went out of business last fall. One of them, Hirose Musen, closed abruptly, leaving its stunned employees to picket outside the shuttered store, demanding their jobs back.
The vast electronics bazaar got its start after World War II, when the area was home to a diverse and thriving black market. Soldiers would steal vacuum tubes, wires and other components from military bases and bring them to students at a nearby technical college, who would fashion the parts into radios and sell them.
 
Ever-Changing Prices
 Today, in an area that covers only a few blocks, 207 companies operate 348 shops, with total annual sales of about $3.8 billion, according to an analysis by Weekly Diamond, a business magazine. An estimated 5 percent of the electronic appliances sold in Japan pass through Akihabara.
Competition is intense. "It's quite often that the price in the afternoon is different from the price in the morning," said Akiko Inoue, a manager at Tsukumo Denki, a computer store. "One shop cuts prices and the others follow." As if to confirm her words, workers nearby were painting a sign listing newly lowered prices.
Mrs. Inoue, a rarity in Akihabara's predominantly male culture, won a contest as the best salesperson in the entire ward a couple of years ago, once selling 30 computers in a day.
Akihabara has three subcultures. The best-known is that of the appliance stores, with their television sets, vacuum cleaners and refrigerators spilling out onto the sidewalks.
Unlike sprawling superstores in the United States, shops here are narrow and vertical, with signs painted on the fronts of the steps to direct customers to the right floor. Many companies operate several stores within a block or two of one another.
 
Catering to 'Maniacs'
 The second segment of Akihabara society is made up of parts suppliers, who occupy tiny stalls in alleys and basements. They cater to small electronics manufacturers and to avid hobbyists, known here as "maniacs."
Suzuki Denki, one such supplier, has a counter crammed with diodes, clips, wires, chips, fuses, switches and integrated circuit extractors. Standing on the counter, at eye level, is another loaded shelf, making it virtually impossible for the clerk and customer to see each other.
"I just do business by voice," said Tetsuyuki Komami, the salesman there. Customers hand their money and receive their merchandise through the space between the counter and the shelf.
The third group is the computer, video game and software stores. Teen-agers play video games on the street and line up outside the stores when a hot new program goes on sale.
 
Evolution of Electronics
 This segment is growing. Computer hardware and software stores are opening one after another, often in locations vacated by consumer electronics stores. Some merchants say that far from being in decline, Akihabara is merely evolving from home appliances to computers.
There are other positive signs as well. Recently, there have been some signs of an upturn in sales of consumer electronics products. And efforts are under way to install nicer pavement and street lights. A new railroad line will connect Akihabara to Tsukuba, a scientific research center.
There are also grandiose plans, now highly uncertain because of the real estate slump, for an office and retail complex. It would include restaurants and parking lots that would make Akihabara more attractive for family outings.
"We want to renew the image of Akihabara," said Mr. Sato of the merchants' association.
But not everyone is hopeful about the district's future. "I can't see the end of the recession," said Mr. Komami, 61, who has been a salesman for 40 years at the Suzuki Denki parts shop. "I just want to hang on."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises on Broad Front After Report on Job Growth

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most leading currencies yesterday after the Government reported that employment increased solidly in February. It picked up additional strength against the Japanese yen after the Bank of Japan bought dollars in Tokyo.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that the economy had added 217,000 jobs in February. Few traders had expected such a strong employment report, with several analysts having predicted a rise of 140,000 jobs. 
 The dollar failed to rise more because January's gain of 62,000 jobs was revised to show a loss of 2,000 jobs.
"It was a good number, except for the revision," said Lynn Tierney, vice president at Shawmut Bank of Boston.
Investors often buy dollars after positive economic reports, betting that stronger growth will give the Federal Reserve the incentive to raise rates. Higher rates make dollar-denominated deposits more attractive.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.65 yen, up sharply from 103.88 on Thursday. It also rose to 1.7186 German marks, from 1.7110.
The monthly employment report is considered one of the broadest assessments of the economy's strength. Without strong growth in employment, the Fed is considered less likely to raise interest rates to control inflation.
"I don't think they will tighten rates after this report," said Albert Soria, foreign-exchange manager at Kansallis Osake Pankki, a Finnish bank in New York.
The dollar rallied on Feb. 4, after the Fed pushed up the Federal funds rate to 3.25 percent from 3 percent. The rate is what banks charge one another on overnight loans.
Traders said the Bank of Japan had aggressively bought dollars to keep the yen from surging after the Clinton Administration threatened to impose trade sanctions. On Thursday, President Clinton signed an executive order reinstating a lapsed section of the 1988 Trade Act known as Super 301, giving him the authority to impose trade sanctions quickly against Japan if it fails to open its markets.
With trade relations worsening, many currency traders expect the Administration to resume calls for a strong yen, which would make Japan's exports to the United States more expensive.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Hits 8-Month High On Stronger Economic Data

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Copper prices rallied to eight-month highs yesterday as new signs of a resurgent economy pointed to increased demand for the metal. There were also signs of a potential supply shortage in copper .
May copper rose 2 cents, to 89.55 cents a pound, at the Commodity Exchange in New York, the highest closing price since July 8 and a 21 percent gain from a low of 73 cents in late October. 
 "A recent string of positive economic releases helped engineer a strong price rise, as U.S. industrial demand continues to expand," Jim Steel, an analyst at Refco Inc., said. "The market seems poised to go over 90 cents."
The copper market picked up considerable support from yesterday's report by the Labor Department on February employment, which showed the economy added 217,000 nonfarm jobs last month.
And the Commerce Department said the index of leading economic indicators rose three-tenths of 1 percent in January, the sixth consecutive month of gains in the forecasting gauge.
Copper is heavily used by many industries from manufacturers to telecommunications companies.
Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential Securities said a drop in copper inventories at London Metal Exchange warehouses might point to a potential supply shortage, which is reflected in the slim price spread between copper futures contracts.
"There's a bit of tightness in the spreads, suggesting potential supply tightness," Ms. Raptopoulos said.
Platinum also showed strength yesterday, with the April futures contract gaining $2.50, to $395.30 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
But there was little movement in gold and silver. On the Comex, April gold gained 30 cents, to $378.80 an ounce, while May silver slipped 0.2 cent, to $5.27 an ounce.
On other commodity markets, oil prices closed slightly lower in light trading as traders continued to mark time before today's meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, April crude declined 18 cents, to $14.57 a barrel, unchanged from its close on the previous Friday and still in a $14-to-$15 range. Traders expect that range to hold until Saudi Arabia makes its opinion known on an OPEC output cut.
"It's unclear where the market is going until we know what OPEC will do," said Shannon Burchett, vice president at Chase Manhattan. "There is nothing for people to hang their hats on."

HEADLINE: U.S. Jobless Rate Eased Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
The job market improved further in February as payrolls expanded and the unemployment rate eased to 6.5 percent, the Government reported today.
Unusually severe winter weather and statistical quirks again muddied the results, which also included the greatest shrinkage in the workweek in 10 years, a second consecutive drop of 20,000 jobs in the construction industry and a reduction of 10 percent in the ranks of the "partially unemployed." 
 But emerging rather clearly was a broad pattern of moderate improvement in employment and at the same time some settling down of an economy that had raced ahead at an unsustainable pace of 7.5 percent in the last three months of 1993.
 
 
Message to Federal Reserve
 "We now have a good, strong, steady economy," said the President's top economic adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson. Mindful of the Federal Reserve's watchfulness about upward pressure on prices, she added that the improved labor market conditions should not be seen "as signs that the economy is booming, or as a threat of impending inflation."
In a separate report, the Commerce Department index that forecasts business conditions climbed three-tenths of a percent in January. It was the sixth consecutive increase in the index of leading economic indicators, but it was less than half the jump of seven-tenths of 1 percent in December.
The employment report, the first comprehensive data on the performance of the economy in February, showed a gain of 217,000 jobs. The increase was somewhat more than most analysts had expected but it was less robust than it appeared because the gain initially reported for January, 62,000 jobs, was revised into a loss of 2,000 jobs. At the same time, an extra 40,000 jobs were added to the total for December.
 
 
Crucial Differences
 While job growth so far this year has been only half as fast as in the last four months of 1993, the February gain reassured analysts that the economy's vigor in the fourth quarter did not dissolve in the new year, as had occurred in early 1993.
"We're avoiding a replay of last year's riches-to-rags slowdown," said Robert D. Barr, deputy chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce.
Factory jobs were up a modest 12,000 last month, but the gain was the fifth consecutive increase, totaling 78,000, since September. But bad weather cut heavily into the factory workweek, which shrank by 42 minutes from exceptionally high recent levels.
Employment in the retail trade sector rebounded by 58,000 jobs after a small loss in January. Gains in general merchandise and food stores combined with gains at automobile dealerships and service stations to more than offset a weather-related drop of 30,000 jobs at restaurants and bars. The finance industry added another 14,000 jobs, bringing the total gain to about 130,000 for the last 18 months.
The Labor Department's survey of households, on which the unemployment rate is based, showed a gain in jobs of 287,000, more than twice the growth in the size of the labor force. That pushed the jobless rate down two-tenths of a point from the January rate of 6.7 percent. But the Labor Department said that even this minimally significant change might have been exaggerated, because seasonal adjustment factors based on its old survey had to be used with the newly overhauled survey introduced in January, helping to push the jobless rate down a half-point since December.
Under the old method, the jobless rate actually ticked up a tenth of a point in February, to 6.4 percent, the same rate as in December.
The report today also showed that the number of the partly unemployed -- people who wanted more work than they had -- dropped by 524,000. This was another result of applying old seasonal formulas to new data, Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
Still another aberration was a drop of 775,000, or 23 percent, in the number of people listed as out of work for five weeks or less. Ms. Abraham said this was a one-time adjustment resulting from refined questioning in the new survey that shifted many of the jobless people into the 5-to-14-weeks category. The average and median duration of jobless spells also rose.
 
 
Geographic Disparity
 While adult women seemed to have had more success than men in finding jobs -- the women's unemployment rate eased three-tenths of a point, to 5.7 percent, while the men's rate edged up to 6 percent -- there were no particularly large changes last month among the big demographic groups.
But the new survey showed considerable geographic disparity, with jobless rates up by 1.2 points in North Carolina, 0.9 point in Texas and 0.7 point in New York. The rate dropped by 1.8 points in Florida, 1.1 points in California, 0.9 point in Pennsylvania and Ohio and 0.8 point in Massachusetts.
These were sizable changes, even allowing for the fact that the rates for individual states swing by much larger amounts than the national figures, because of the smaller samples.
Regionally, the changes were less pronounced. The jobless rates were unchanged in the Northeast and South, at 6.7 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively, while the rate in the Midwest fell to 5.5 percent, from 6 percent, and the rate in the West fell to 7.6 percent, from 8 percent.

HEADLINE: New U.S. Pressure on Trade Doesn't Seem to Spur Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 4

 BODY:
With the Clinton Administration turning up the heat against Japan, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa conceded today that he had not yet begun to enact the sweeping economic reforms his country needs but vowed "to insure that the Japanese market is open to the rest of the world."
Nonetheless, there was little evidence that President Clinton's strategy -- to threaten action by the United States against a broad range of Japanese products unless progress is made -- was spurring Mr. Hosokawa's Government to make concessions or even generate new ideas about how to close the $59.3 billion trade gap. 
 In fact, senior Japanese and American officials say they think that whatever momentum Mr. Hosokawa once had to push through new market openings is quickly fading. Today, the Tokyo stock market Nikkei index even rose 360.14 points, or 1.84 percent, to 19,966, as investors concluded that Mr. Clinton's trade declaration sounded tougher than it really was. Some seemed confident that the declaration actually worked to Japan's interest, because it could defuse far worse proposals on Capitol Hill.
It now appears highly unlikely, Japanese officials say, that Mr. Hosokawa will be ready with any new proposals on improving access to Japanese markets by the time Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrives here next Wednesday. Mr. Christopher's visit will mark the first high-level talks since President Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa deadlocked on trade issues last month in Washington.
"If anything, I'm afraid we are slipping backwards," a senior American official here said today. "However we frame the message in Washington, it still does not look like it is getting through."
Indeed the most striking aspect of Mr. Hosokawa's hourlong policy speech to Parliament today, a Japanese equivalent of the State of the Union address, is how little he had to say about the specifics of handling the new tension with Japan's biggest ally. He never once mentioned Mr. Clinton's action to revive the section of the 1988 Trade Act, called Super 301, which empowers the Administration to act quickly in drawing up a hit list of countries that erect barriers to American exports. He said that "the thing that the people most ardently desire now is an escape from this grim recession."
Rather than address market openings, Mr. Hosokawa returned to one of his favorite themes: deregulating an economy choking on bureaucracy and restrictive rules.
"We intend to move toward making nonregulation the norm and regulation the exception," he said, urging broader choices for consumers and sharp reductions in "the disparity between Japanese and overseas prices." He talked of the need for "comprehensive consumer protection." But he described no specifics.
"Japan is currently running a massive current account surplus," Mr. Hosokawa told the Parliament today, "and there are still insistent voices claiming that the Japanese market is closed. While some of this criticism stems from misunderstanding, I would rather see this as evidence of the high hopes people have for Japan and I believe we should take the initiative in implementing necessary reforms in our own interest."
Picking his wording carefully from the text of the "framework accord" on trade signed last summer, he committed himself only to "to achieve a highly significant reduction in our current account surplus over the medium term." However, just hours before Mr. Hosokowa spoke, the Finance Ministry reported that Japan's current account surplus with the world rose 30.9 percent in January to $6.83 billion, a record high for the month.
With his coalition Government veering from crisis to crisis, Mr. Hosokawa seems in a weaker position than ever to execute his goals. This week he was unable to gather enough support within his fragile coalition to dismiss his chief Cabinet secretary, Masayoshi Takemura, who has differed with him on a number of economic policy issues. He was left with the worst of all alternatives: He angered many members of his Government in a paralyzing debate about ousting Mr. Takemura, but in the end was left with the same team in place.
Indeed, the trade issue has become simply another of the many issues being manipulated by politicians jockeying for position around Mr. Hosokawa. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party, which was ousted from power last summer after dominating the country's politics for 38 years, is using the dispute with the United States to portray Mr. Hosokawa as an incompetent caretaker of the American relationship.
 
Criticism From Rivals
 The Prime Minister "is trying to make the trade dispute with the United States seem insignificant," Yohei Kono, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said today. Meanwhile, members of Mr. Hosokawa's own coalition have attempted to slow some of the reforms that threaten economic interests in their own districts.
Mr. Hosokawa's supporters were clearly intent on playing down the Super 301 trade issue today, shrugging it off when the topic came up. "Some say Japan has been targeted, but I don't think so," Tsutomu Hata, the Foreign Minister, said tonight on the state-run television network, NHK. "Any country can be subject to it."
Mr. Hata, like other prominent Japanese officials, spoke at length today about the need to make sure that the trade dispute did not "infect" other elements of the relationship between the two countries. "I believe both sides can come to a compromise," he said. "There have been issues like this before."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Credit Card Goodies, With Lower Interest

BYLINE: By Saul Hansell 

 BODY:
MANY credit cards now offer goodies, from frequent-flier miles to discounts on cars and candy bars. Tempting as they may be, these cards are not always great deals.
That's because the cards with the perks often carry higher interest rates than those without. Some people, of course, pay their bills every month and lap up the bonuses. But most people -- even those who say they pay their bills -- occasionally borrow money on their cards. 
 For them, the Chase Manhattan Bank is offering an alternative. A card holder can charge all he wants on his favorite card, earning miles or points or whatever. Then if he doesn't have the cash to pay the entire balance, he writes a check from Chase's Reward Consolidator account, a credit line with a variable interest rate, now at 10.9 percent.
Since Chase's credit line carries no fee, and the rate is significantly less than the 15 to 17 percent on most cards with giveaways, the product could be a real money saver.
"This is a way for someone to have their cake and eat it too," said Robert McKinley, president of RAM research, a Frederick, Md., newsletter publisher. "If you are a consumer who has the commitment to charge groceries, gas, taxis and pizza to your airline card or General Motors card and pay it off using a credit line like Chase's, you will get the benefits without paying through the nose."
Moreover, by paying the card bill in full each month, the card holder won't pay any interest until the check clears at Chase. This means an average of 45 days without interest. While most credit cards offer a grace period if the bill is paid in full, they charge interest from the date of purchase for a partial payment.
By having two accounts, one for spending and one for borrowing, consumers may get a better view of their finances. The down side is that juggling two accounts will be more complex. And for borrowers who lack financial discipline, more credit could be a temptation to get too deeply in debt.
Of course, the two-account strategy does not have to include Chase. Many banks offer credit lines with access by checks, and many credit card accounts offer checks. (Watch out for fees here: Some credit cards charge fees of up to 2 percent on these checks, while others waive the fee for transferring balances from other cards.)
One credit card without a fee for check use is the Bank of New York Mastercard for members of unions in the A.F.L.-C.I.O. The interest is the prime rate, now 6 percent, plus five percentage points, and there is no annual fee. (This account is less useful as a credit card because it does not have a grace period on purchases before interest begins accruing.)
Another option is the Preferred Credit Line offered by the Republic National Bank of New York, with access by checks at no fee and has an interest rate of prime plus 7.9 percentage points, or 13.9 percent.
Shopping for the best borrowing deal is easier than finding the best reward program. After the early success of the General Motors credit card, virtually every large retailer and manufacturer is at least considering a credit card program with a bank.
The ground rule is to pick a card affiliated with something you plan to use. It doesn't help to get a discount on a General Motors car if you buy a BMW. But for people who want their cars, General Motors and Ford probably have the best credit card deals around, offering auto rebates of 5 percent on card purchases.
The cards linked with the airline frequent-flier programs are also a good deal, if you spend more than $5,000 or so on your card each year. An airline mile is probably worth about 2 cents, so the airline programs offer roughly a 2 percent rebate. Pick the program of the airline you fly most.
For more moderate spenders, the Shell Oil card from Chemical Bank offers a 2 percent rebate on all purchases and 3 percent on Shell gas. Another choice would be the GE Rewards card, which offers a 2 percent rebate good at several stores, including Kmart and Toys "R" Us.
Even the corner store is getting into the credit card game. Harvest Foods, based in Little Rock, Ark., offers a card with rebates of up to 2 percent on purchases at its 54 grocery stores. So for the modern coupon clipper, a wallet full of cards from different merchants may make sense. Just be sure to shop for the best loan deal separately.

HEADLINE: Risking a Trade War

 BODY:
President Clinton's decision to invoke a trade law provision that would enable him to impose tough sanctions against Japan if the Japanese fail to open their markets to American goods is unnecessary, dangerous and misguided.
The political logic behind the President's move is understandable. Polls show that a significant majority of Americans favor a tough stance toward the Japanese, and protectionists in Congress are pushing hard for retaliation against Tokyo. But any crackdown by the U.S. could undermine the elaborately constructed international apparatus for resolving trade disputes. 
 The provision invoked by Mr. Clinton, known as Super 301, triggers a timetable for the U.S. to decide unilaterally whether Japan (or any other country) is violating fair trade rules and, if so, what sanctions to impose. The key word is unilateral: under Super 301, the U.S. belittles its commitment to resolve disputes in multilateral settings.
The provision is unnecessary because U.S. law already permits the Government to retaliate unilaterally against unfair trade practices. That's risky enough, but Super 301 hastens the process.
Super 301 is dangerous because the added threat moves the U.S. one step closer to a trade war with an important ally and could undermine the fragile coalition of Prime Minister Hosokawa, who is pushing a deregulatory agenda that would eventually break down protectionist barriers around Japanese markets.
And the provision is misguided because it belies a profound misunderstanding about the economic impact of trade deficits. Even if the U.S. were to compel Japan to buy more U.S. autos and computers, the overall U.S. trade deficit would not fall. Trade deficits are caused by Americans buying more goods and services than they produce. The extra goods must come from trade partners -- if not from Japan, then somewhere else.
The Administration portrays the $60 billion trade deficit with Japan as an assault on U.S. jobs. But U.S. employment would not rise if Japan were to buy more goods from the U.S. Chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board recently announced that the Fed would raise interest rates to ward off inflation. In other words, the economy was picking up enough speed that the Fed decided to dampen domestic spending. If the Japanese would spend more for American goods, Mr. Greenspan would tighten further. The important point is that U.S. employment rates are set by decisions in the U.S., not Japan, and Mr. Clinton's alarms are false.
True, specific U.S. industries -- some of which are highly profitable, like computer software, insurance and medical equipment -- are hurt by Japanese barriers. But opening up every Japanese market in sight would not add much to the $6 trillion U.S. economy.
If invoking a strategy that could trigger tit-for-tat sanctions pushes the Japanese to make further concessions or heads off even worse legislation in Congress, the strategy could be judged a political success. But if Mr. Clinton actually triggers a trade war or destabilizes the Hosokawa Government, the price could turn out to be very steep indeed.

HEADLINE: Russia's Far East: Rainbown and Bears

BYLINE: By Celestine Bohlen; Celestine Bohlen is chief of the Moscow bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
WE NEVER DID SEE A bear in the wilds of central Kamchatka, although Zhenya Vlasov did his best to find us one.
During a bright spell in the brief, sub-Arctic fall on Russia's easternmost peninsula, as the birch trees were turning yellow and the blueberry bushes a burnished red, Zhenya, a small, bowlegged hunter and guide at our wilderness hunting camp, took us down to the river where bears come in the evenings to fish for salmon and showed us where they had trampled the brush underfoot. The weather was mild and sunny, not unusual for September, which is considered Kamchatka's best month since the air is free of the summer's mosquitoes and the winter's frosts. Taking the lead with a walking stick that was almost as big as he was, Zhenya marched us briskly -- as briskly as thigh-high rubber boots would allow -- through a field of man-sized grasses, poking at bear footprints and droppings, and pointing out their paw marks on several giant anthills. 
 He even told us what to do if a 10-foot bear should happen to rise up before us. "Never look a bear in the eyes," said Zhenya, who wears glasses. "And don't move. Just yell Russian swearwords at it."
In the far northeast region of Russia, between the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea, Kamchatka was for many decades closed to foreigners because of its strategic position as a border region and its secret military installations. But after it was opened up in 1991, foreigners arrived in droves -- hunters, fishermen, trekkers and adventure-seekers -- to discover a vast region of volcanoes, geysers and unpopulated wilderness, roughly the size of Colorado and with a population of about half a million people. Scores of small businesses opened, offering guides and helicopters to take visitors to the remote fishing and hunting camps scattered around the peninsula, from the treeless tundra of the far north to the more bucolic forests of the area around Milkovo, a town and a regional center about 125 miles northwest of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the peninsula's main city. Our camp was about 93 miles -- 45 minutes by helicopter -- out of Milkovo, beneath the snow-capped Tumroki volcano, but we, two peaceful interlopers who were there just to look, saw neither bear, nor mountain sheep, nor moose -- although the region was obviously teeming with them. Our fellow campers, a German father and son, had better luck: after a week of hunting, they had bagged three bears, two snow rams and two moose -- a phenomenal catch by both local and world standards.
"I have been hunting for 30 years, all over the world -- Africa, Alaska, Europe," said Fredy Lemke, who owns a trucking firm in Ottersberg, Germany, outside Bremen, during an emotional toast over a dinner table laden with local fare -- smoked salmon, pickled ferns, fresh salmon roe, blueberry jam and moose patties, "but this year, this Kamchatka, this is the best."
FOR THE adventurous few who come as tourists rather than as sportsmen, Kamchatka offers different attractions. At the hunting camp near the Tumroki camp, we went berry picking, filling a large bucket with local blueberries and a variety known as zhimalost -- similar to blueberries and, as every Kamchatka native will tell you, so jampacked with vitamins that jars were regularly shipped to Soviet cosmonauts to keep them going in outer space.
With luck, hikers -- traveling by foot, by horse and, in the winter, by dog sled or skis -- can catch a glimpse of Kamchatka's wildlife, particularly in the Kronotsky Nature Reserve, a 2.5-million-acre expanse northeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a region of craters and volcanoes that was first protected from encroachment by humans in 1802, when it was declared off limits to sable hunters. During spawning season, salmon of several varieties can be seen clearly in its rivers, twisting ever more slowly as they die a slow death by decomposition.
The centerpiece of the Kronotsky Reserve is the Valley of the Geysers, a bubbling, burbling cauldron of hot springs that, in terms of world-class geysers, ranks second only to Yellowstone Park. The valley is particularly beautiful in the fall, when the trees on the hillside are turning colors and the geysers merrily spout steam and jets of water into the crisp air, each one following its own secret rhythm.
These geysers, along with Kamchatka's formidable array of volcanoes -- many of them still active -- are what anchor this peninsula at the end of the Pacific Ocean's Ring of Fire and cast a silent and somehow primordial threat over its vast, empty spaces.
Mindful of the damage caused by eager backpacking tourists tromping across the valley's delicate growth of moss, grasses and ferns (not to mention the danger of scorching by boiling water), the managers at Kronotsky recently had wooden walkways and stairs built. A few benches have been positioned in key places, but otherwise the site remains much as it was when it was first discovered in 1941, free of the kind of commercialization that Russian conservationists abhor.
Still, tourism to the Valley of the Geysers has increased in the last two years, now that both foreigners and Russians are free to travel there. Last summer, there were about 2,000 visitors. Most of them came by helicopter, leaving from the Kronotsky Reserve's heliport at Yelizovo, outside of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.
The six-hour trip includes an aerial tour of neighboring volcanoes and water-filled craters, and lunch in a hunters' cabin by a river. The cost of the helicopter trip for a group of 20 people is between $2,000 and $2,500.
Not that all the wrinkles of Kamchatka's infant tourist industry have been ironed out. Far from it. The biggest problem remains getting there -- a journey that, except for charter flights from Alaska, is dependent on Aeroflot, the old Soviet airline that becomes increasingly less reliable and more uncomfortable. The direct nine-hour flight from Moscow (roughly the equivalent of a Moscow-New York flight), with a nine-hour time difference, means you arrive at the same time you leave. But when fuel supplies run low, or bad weather kicks in, flights can back up for days on end, creating havoc with finely tuned schedules.
Given its selection of poor hotels and indifferent restaurants, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky has little to offer the passer-through besides one sorry street of prerevolutionary wooden houses and a view of the Koriaksky and Avachinsky volcanoes (11,338 and 9,025 feet high, respectively) that loom like guardians at the city's back. There is also a view over the bay -- taking in a steep hill to the left and a row of trees along the waterfront -- that hints at a scene from a Chinese scroll painting. In the distance, off in another direction, are the Three Brothers rocks that have become the city's symbol. But the square facing the water is dominated by a giant statue of Lenin, with ugly modern office buildings behind him.
In these conditions, any little glimmer of originality goes a long way. By the side of the new road leading out of the city to the airport, there is an open-air restaurant run by a family from the southern Caucasian republic of Azerbaijan. Fresh fruits and vegetables, chicken pieces roasted on a spit, cold beer served at tables next to a running brook -- for the traveler grown weary of dark restaurants reverberating to the sounds of bad rock-and-roll, this is more than relief, it is a victory.
Getting around Kamchatka is also difficult. The few roads are generally terrible, ground up by heavy trucks and a grueling climate. Helicopters, small airplanes and, along the sparsely populated coast, boats are the main means of transportation; at $500 an hour, helicopter travel has virtually reached world prices -- a factor that has dampened the travel business here somewhat. Rented cars are also available through local firms; it cost us $200 to get a driver to take us from Petropavlovsk to Milkovo, an exorbitant rate by local standards, but it beat spending extra hours at the local airport waiting for helicopters that are trying to do several jobs -- ferry fish, cart food and taxi local residents -- at once.
As always in Russia, logistics here are a problem, made worse by the fact that fuel and other supplies have to be shipped to the peninsula either by sea or by air (there are no road or rail links to the mainland). We met a German hunter, stranded at the Milkovo airport, who had been taken on a 22-mile trek from one hunting camp to another for reasons he never did understand since he and his guide had no common language. "In Alaska, all this would have worked perfectly," he said, putting a brave face on his predicament. "But then it would not have been so adventurous."
Still, visitors keep coming, even as local residents -- many of whom were first lured here by the high wages and generous benefits offered by the Soviet regime -- leave, driven from this distant outpost by a formidable climate and a foundering economy. But for true patriots, the loss is not great. "Less people, more oxygen," was the cheery analysis of Olya, the cook at the Tumroki hunting camp and a descendant of a local hunting dynasty.
The camp and the area around it belong to the Milkovo Gospromkhoz, a Soviet-era state company that manages a 104,200-square-mile swath of territory in central Kamchatka and all that takes place on it, from berry picking to sable trapping, from hunting and fishing to wildlife management. Hunting season comes twice a year, in the spring from mid-April through May (bears only) and in the fall, from the end of August to the end of October. The hunting is controlled, although there are different rules and prices for locals and for foreigners. Generally, the going rate is between $4,000 and $6,000 for a large trophy (bear, moose or mountain sheep), which covers all expenses, including the helicopter, guide, license, room and board. Tatiana N. Girenko, the Gospromkhoz's fierce, old-style Communist manager, said that last year hunters were issued licenses to kill 40 bears on the Milkovo Gospromkhoz territory, of which only six went to foreigners.
With a local bear population of about 350, these figures are considered well within reason, but they do not reflect the rise in poaching, brought about by the hard economic times and general lawlessness that are principal features of post-Communist Russia -- and certainly the main subjects of conversation. Mrs. Girenko said that 10 bear carcasses were found on the Milkovo territory last year, the work of poachers who kill bears not only for their skins but also for their gall bladders, which sell for $3 a gram in markets in China and Korea where they are highly valued for their medicinal properties. Local fishermen describe how poachers move in on spawning salmon at night, with flashlights, and scoop up fresh roe -- or red caviar -- by the bucketful. Visitors interested in fishing now have to go deep into the wilderness since the rivers around Petropavlovsk have been heavily depleted. According to local guides, a fisherman can catch about 30 salmon a day, or 15 to 20 rainbow: the size of king salmon averages 22 to 44 pounds, although one local fisherman described seeing one that weighed 132 pounds.
Most of Kamchatka's residents are hunters, full time or part time. In the winter -- a season that everyone admits lasts almost eight months a year -- there is little else to do in places like Milkovo, a small town of 16,000 people first settled by Russians 250 years ago. Zhenya Vlasov is a member of one of Milkovo's most notable families, descendants of a Massachusetts fur trader who came there in the late 19th century. Yet for all his local connections, he is still waiting for a coveted "ugodyia," a six-square-mile lot on which he would have exclusive hunting and trapping rights.
For several years now, Zhenya's extended family, together with the Milkovo Gospromkhoz, has been trying to make a go of the cooperatively held hunting camp, on the site of a famous hot springs beneath Tumroki, a perfect triangle of a volcano that by mid-fall already has a band of snow at its neck. On a windy days, the snow drifts into a fine, feathery mist.
A few years ago, before the economic changes that brought inflation to Russia, the hot springs were a popular attraction for local residents who came to cure a whole list of ailments, starting with aching bones and ending with eczema. But today, with the cost of helicopter flights skyrocketing, local cure-seekers have been displaced by rich tourists, mostly foreigners who come for the hunting, not for their health. "Foreign tourists don't have ailments," Zhenya noted dryly.
WITH ITS half-dozen, two-story wood cabins fitted out with fireplaces and bunk beds, its outhouses and a full-fledged kitchen, the camp at Tumroki was dubbed the Hilton of Kamchatka by Fredy Lemke's son, Manfred, who, on earlier trips to the area, had weathered far more primitive facilities.
But the hot springs provide the camp's most luxurious touch, with three pools set into the hillside offering water temperatures that range from warm to too hot to bear for more than five minutes at a time. In the bathing hut, weary trekkers and hunters can hang up their clothes, and, in the morning, sit and watch a thick mist of steam roll off the trickling stream into the surrounding forest.
There is a kind of traveler who will go around the world to find spots like this, and Charlotte Mitchell, a 50-year-old Hong Kong resident, is one. To the delight of her numerous Russian hosts, she made her way across eastern Siberia to Kamchatka, traveling by foot, train, ferry and boat through regions that most people consider impassable.
Having reached the Tumroki camp after a long hike through the fields and valleys of Kamchatka's wilderness, she sat in the hot springs to give her feet a well-deserved treat. "This," she said, beaming through the steam, "is excellent."
 
EXPLORING A WILDERNESS
Two companies, based in the United States, that offer both customized and group tours of the Kamchatka Peninsula are:
EAST-WEST DISCOVERY, Post Office Box 69P, Volcano, Hawaii 96785 (800-985-8552), specializes in travel to the Russian Far East. Organized tours include a two-week Kamchatka Adventure Expedition, with hiking, rafting, berry gathering, volcano exploration, wildlife observation and fishing for salmon and trout in some of the least visited regions of the peninsula (more than 600 miles are covered by helicopter). Sites visited include Petropavlovsk and the Kronotsky Nature Reserve, with about 10 days in field camps in wilderness areas. Groups are limited to 12 people; the cost is $2,795 a person and includes local transportation, meals, guides and lodging. Among the scheduled departure dates are July 19 and July 27, with other dates to be announced. The company can arrange discounted air transportation between North America and Kamchatka via Anchorage.
East-West Discovery also offers a two-week birding trip, led by American and Russian ornithologists, that visits the Othotsk coastal region, the Kamchatka River Valley and the island of Starichkov. Most nights will be spent camping in large expedition tents. The group size is limited to 10; the cost is $4,995 a person, and includes all land expenses and local transportation. The scheduled departure date is May 24, with a second date to be arranged.
KAMCHATKA FISHING ADVENTURES, 2825 90th Street Southeast, Everett, Wash. 98208 (206-337-0326), has more than a dozen nine-day fishing trips scheduled for this spring, summer and fall. Groups, which average about 15 people, are housed in the Cedar Lodge on the Zhupanova River, north of Petropavlovsk; all rooms have private bathrooms with flush toilets and showers. The price, $5,000 a person, includes meals, lodging and local transportation. The company can help arrange trans-Pacific fares.
Kamchatka Fishing Adventures also arranges hunting packages in the spring and fall. The groups -- usually four to eight people -- are based in the lodge on the Zhupanova and taken by helicopter to field camps near the hunt sites. These trips can be combined with the fishing packages; the price varies with number of people and length of trip.

Cold War Spending

 BODY:
When the cold war was in full swing, it made Americans spend as though there were no tomorrow -- precisely because they believed there wouldn't be one.
At least that's the theory of Joel Slemrod, an economics professor at the University of Michigan who has been following the relationship between Americans' fears of nuclear war and the saving rate. Slemrod compared private savings to the "Doomsday Clock" in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a measure of the editors' sense of the likelihood of nuclear war. 
 His comparison suggests that the greater the fear, the lower the savings. Moreover, throughout the cold war, Slemrod says, polls showed that more than half of Americans believed that nuclear conflict was likely within 10 years. "How could it not affect their planning?" Slemrod asks. In the same period, only about a quarter of Japanese thought nuclear war was likely in the next 10 years. Their saving rate was (and is) far higher.
Savings have not quite boomed since the end of the cold war, however. The rate bottomed at 4 percent in 1989 and inched up to 4.8 percent in 1992. But these were recessionary years, when savings usually decline. Proof is yet to come.
If Slemrod is right, the Reagan economic revolution -- cutting taxes so that the rich would have more to save and (theoretically) invest -- was irrelevant. Instead, according to this reasoning, Reagan's military build-up and Evil Empire rhetoric worked against his economic program by discouraging saving. Star Wars, meanwhile, by lessening the perceived danger of nuclear holocaust, acted as a clever ploy -- not to save Americans but to get Americans to save.

Denver's New Airport: A Boon or a Bane?

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
WHATEVER else can be said of the behind-schedule, over-budget, far-flung new Denver International Airport, it will surely make life easier for some travelers: those coming to Colorado to inspect cattle on the scrubgrass Plains, for example. For travelers headed west to the ski slopes, on the other hand, the $3.2 billion airport will not be so convenient.
DIA, the first major airport to be built from scratch in the United States since Dallas-Fort Worth 20 years ago, is set to open May 15, eight months late and more than $1 billion over initial cost estimates.
The new facility is situated 23 miles northeast of downtown Denver, about 20 miles farther northeast of the city than Stapleton Airport. It will mean perhaps an extra 30 to 40 minutes for the drive to Vail and Aspen. The cab fare to downtown Denver will more than double, to at least $30. 
 But officials here say the 53-square-mile airport, about six times bigger than Stapleton, will sharply reduce delays. The new airport can safely handle three simultaneous landings, or 99 arrivals an hour, in bad weather, compared with a maximum of 25 an hour at Stapleton. And a high-tech luggage conveyor is said to be able to get bags to the claim area before passengers get there.
The main terminal is topped by white Fiberglas spires, meant to look like snow-capped Rocky Mountain peaks. Its interior is adorned with $7.5 million in art work. And its vast windows permit so much natural light that architects say artificial lighting will be unnecessary during the day. There are 15,000 covered parking spots for vehicles and computer-operated subway trains that deliver passengers near the gates.
The project was approved in 1987 under the leadership of Federico F. Pena, who was then the Mayor of Denver and is now the United States Secretary of Transportation. The cost overruns have been ascribed to inflation and demands by the two airline hubs, United and Continental.
Mr. Pena and other backers of the airport say the gleaming facility will promote business and tourism in Colorado. But some travel experts, like Bill Siegel, the president of a tourism research organization based in Toronto, have expressed doubts. Among factors that motivate travelers to choose a destination, he said, "I've never heard of airport facilities even being mentioned." Mr. Siegel said that nearly 20 million tourists came to Colorado in 1992, and about 37 percent were air travelers, "an extraordinarily high percentage."
He said he expected the new airport's greater distance from the slopes to provoke some grumbling. "Skiers are paying a lot of money for one thing -- to get up to the mountains as fast as they can."
Shuttle services to ski resorts recently increased prices to reflect the longer distances. A ride to Vail now costs $44, compared with $35. And the shuttle, which departed from Stapleton every half-hour, now leaves every hour.
City officials say Stapleton, hemmed in by residential development, had no room to expand. The 64-year-old facility, which is up for sale or rent, will not function as an airport.
The most recent delay in the opening of the airport, announced Feb. 28, was required to fix the high-tech baggage system, security doors and TV screens showing flight information.

Short Films Have Their (Brief) Moment in the Sun

BYLINE: By ANN HORNADAY 

 BODY:
THOSE WHO participate in office Oscar pools will find themselves stumped once again when it comes to the short categories. Let's see, for best short feature will it be "Black Rider," about an elderly Jewish woman and a young black man on a bus in Berlin? Or maybe "Down on the Waterfront," a send-up of "On the Waterfront," with Ed Asner. And for best short documentary, how about "Chicks in White Satin," about a lesbian wedding? Or maybe "Defending Our Lives," about battered women who kill their attackers.
But for the first time this year, Oscar kibitzers will have a chance to improve their odds by actually seeing some of the short films. A two-week series called "Oscar Shorts 1993," which includes most of this year's nominees for short live-action movies and documentary films, opened on Friday at Cinema Village. Short films can range in length from 3 to 30 minutes and cost as little as $1,500 to make. 
 Although animated shorts, another Academy Award category, already have a dedicated following, live-action shorts have had trouble finding audiences, who tend to think of them as intimidating -- or worse, boring -- technical exercises. In fact, they can be as sophisticated and satisfying as their feature-length siblings, though their demanding and economical form makes them comparable to haiku. Often they provide first glimpses of promising talent.
"Short films are how people learn to make movies," says the critic Roger Ebert, who will be the host of a program of short films on the Bravo cable channel. "It was Martin Scorsese's first film" -- a short called "Who's That Knocking at My Door?" -- "that announced unmistakably that he was a director."
"Oscar Shorts 1993," with six films, may be part of what many are calling a rejuvenation of interest in the form. Shorts were recently given a boost when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voted to reinstate the embattled category, which it had announced in 1992 it would eliminate. After the original announcement, letters poured in from Mr. Scorsese, George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg and other important directors who got their starts making short films.
There are other signs of a renewal. This year, the Sundance Film Festival gave its first special recognition award for a short film. The movie, "Family Remains," directed by Tamara Jenkins, will be shown at the New Directors/New Films series in New York on April 1 and 2 along with 12 other short films. This spring for the first time Andalusian Pictures is negotiating to bring a festival of 20 short films to New York.
Miramax has bought theatrical distribution rights to "The Perfect Woman," a nine-minute parody of male-female relations by the actress Illeana Douglas, and will pair it with "Camilla," a feature film with Bridget Fonda to be released this summer. Indeed, actors who want to make their first foray into directing (and which actors do not?) increasingly turn to short films. Recent converts include Daryl Hannah, Rob Morrow, Ethan Hawke, Matthew Modine and Peter Weller.
On Oscar night, March 21, the Bravo cable network will have commentary by Mr. Ebert during the ceremony's commercial breaks and in between will air 15 shorts, including "The Perfect Woman" and works by the English directors Mike Leigh and Kenneth Branagh, Mr. Morrow and the actor Steve Buscemi.
THE SHOWING OF SHORT films in movie theaters has been in slow decline since the late 1940's, when theaters became interested in a faster turnover of audiences. Although short films are still sometimes shown at art houses, most begin and end their lives on the small screen. Cable networks have been particularly fond of short movies. Showtime uses them on its "Directed By" and "30 Minute Movie" series, and "Saturday Night Live" often uses short films.
While such visibility is a blessing for film makers, it is also a curse. "Exhibitors are resistant to short films because they've been on TV already," says Bingham Ray, the co-executive manager of October Films, which released a package of three short films called "Two Mikes Don't Make a Wright." "The result is that they're only seen as calling cards at studios, or at festivals."
Some purists at the motion picture academy think that short films' dalliance with television places them outside Oscar contention. "In the days when I was an assistant director at MGM, the academy was the academy," says Howard Koch, who was the organization's president for three years and has produced eight Oscar telecasts. In the past, Mr. Koch advocated the elimination of shorts. "The people who made short subjects were the studios; they were part of us. They were some of the greatest directors-to-be. We worked together, we talked together, we had lunch together."
Of the new short-subject film makers, Mr. Koch says: "We don't know them. We never saw them before. We never see them after. They just make long speeches on the Academy Awards."
But Mr. Koch joined the unanimous vote by the academy's board of governors in January to restore the awards for short films. "I guess as time went on I was brainwashed more and more," he explains. "When the vote came, I was reluctant. But I figured: what the heck. If a lot of the members felt it was important to give these people life, even though they're strangers, I must have been wrong."
The controversy suggests that the stakes are high for Oscar winners in the short-form category. A quick glance at past winners fails to reveal many famous directors' names. But even if being nominated doesn't guarantee fame, Dean Parisot, a winner in 1988 for "The Appointments of Dennis Jennings," says the Oscar "throws you into a temporary limelight, and makes you meet of the week." Mr. Parisot has since worked primarily in television, most recently directing episodes of "Northern Exposure."
Jana Sue Memel, whose production company, Chanticleer Films, produces short films for Showtime, has won two Oscars (for "Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall" and "Session Man"). Chanticleer also produced one of this year's nominees, "Partners," directed by Mr. Weller. (The other nominees for live-action short -- in addition to "Black Rider" and "Down on the Waterfront" -- are Susan Seidelman's "Dutch Master" and a French film called, in English, "The Screw." Short documentary nominations -- there are only three -- include "Blood Ties: The Life and Work of Sally Mann.")
"It's still Christmas," Ms. Memel says of the recognition a nomination gives. "It allows us to secure future funding for short films, which is next to impossible."
According to a report commissioned by the academy, short films reach a significant audience at giant-screen IMAX theaters, theme parks and other venues. "They account for literally hundreds of millions of dollars for thousands of film makers, production companies and distributors," says Saul Bass, an academy governor who won an Oscar in 1968 for his short documentary "Why Man Creates." "The budgets on some of these IMAX films are up to $7 million or $8 million or more, so we're not dealing with penny-ante stuff."
Most makers of short films, however, are not in it for the money. Usually, short films are intended as calling cards to drop at major studios. Andrew Fleming had three short student films under his belt when he graduated from New York University's film school in 1985. It turned out that the cheapest one, the three-minute "Prisoner," got the most attention.
"It was the most visually dynamic," says the director, whose second feature-length film, "Threesome," will be released next month. "And it was short. It's a truism, but people in this business have short attention spans. They don't want to sit through a 25-minute, serious, dramatic film."
When Gale Anne Hurd, who produced "Aliens" and "The Terminator," saw "Prisoner," Mr. Fleming says, "she said, 'Let's do a film.' Less than a year later I was shooting a horror film called 'Bad Dreams' for Fox."
Relegating short films to the status of springboard rankles those directors who are dedicated to the form for its artistic and technical demands. "There's a whole world of film makers who are living out their lives in the short film area out of choice, not necessity," says Mr. Bass. "They love the form, they're challenged by it, and they're content to wrestle with it for the rest of their lives."
Now, if only there were an audience for them.

Summer Glories Passed Quickly, But Oh, the Fall

BYLINE: By WILL CRUTCHFIELD 

 BODY:
TO HEAR HER IS TO LOVE her: if anyone feels otherwise about Victoria de los Angeles, I don't want to know. It has to be counted among life's startling and unexpected consolations that each of the last 20 or so years, which might have done so, has not brought the retirement of this most inexhaustibly illustrative of singers. Now she is back again to celebrate her 70th birthday (it took place on Nov. 1) and the 50th anniversary of her professional debut. Neither is a milestone customarily celebrated in public by vocalists, least of all sopranos.
The debut was in Barcelona as Mozart's Countess. At the end of the 1940's, the operatic world -- discovering in two or three seasons a decade's worth of great singers queued up during the war years -- responded rapidly to this generous voice of cream and port, and Miss de los Angeles had debuts in rapid succession at the Metropolitan, Covent Garden, La Scala, Rome, Vienna. Even then she had the confidence to insist that she first be presented in recital in each city; this guaranteed a friendly core audience in the opera house, because the recitals were at such a level of expertise, novelty, spontaneous communication and indefinable stylistic savoir-faire that the singer could initiate a houseful of devoted admirers at each one. 
 In fact the glory days of the Spanish soprano's operatic career were rather short: the strong high notes did not last, and by 1960 she was having uncomfortable moments in many scores. She continued as a beloved concert artist, with ever more economical use of reduced vocal means. For a while it seemed that her last great New York evenings might have been the Hunter College recitals with Alicia de Larrocha in 1973.
But early in the 80's a kind of Indian summer began. And went on. The valedictory feel of her Spanish program at Avery Fisher Hall in 1985 allowed most in the delirious audience to assume it was her farewell. A couple of seasons later, however, she was back at the 92d Street Y with her beloved Schubert and Faure, and a couple of years later still she visited the old City Center for an improbable weeklong stint in a song-and-dance zarzuela revue. Two years after that she gave a song recital at the Manhattan School of Music that was practically the highlight of the New York season, and now she is still manifestly going strong. Reviews of her 70th-birthday tour to date -- from Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Chicago -- speak of enchanting expression, delightful timbre, ovations and flowers.
One might as well ask the obvious question: If her voice faltered so long ago (and to tell the truth, hints of difficulty could be heard even earlier), what is she doing making tours and new records and garnering accolades?
This voice, like the artist, is a special case. It bears the relation to its youthful self of an expertly pressed flower to a dewy bloom. If her tone was a juicy orange (it always had a citron tang to it), it is now an exquisitely aromatic confection of the preserved rind. Or if it was a bold Goya full of contrasts and rich textures, it is now the precise and economical sketch that shows intent, drama, direction, essence. If it was marjoram, now it's pepper.
A friend of one of her accompanists watched her rehearse a few years ago and described the way she conserved her voice. Only before the public did she let it out at all; the pianist was guided in preparation by the click and sibilance of her consonants -- the percussion section, so to speak. If the voice used to be a lush Romantic symphony orchestra, perhaps now it is the crackling ensemble of Stravinsky's "Histoire du Soldat": tangy winds, percussion, a single wiry violin, rhythmic speech.
What it is not is a failed effort to be something else. She does not essay the soaring phrases of her old Puccini heroines; does not struggle with herself or subject us to agonies of disappointment or grim insistence as so many singers have done. If certain notes -- or many notes -- falter or run dry, they never throw her off her expressive course. And if it isn't going to bother her, why should it bother us?
Let me not give the wrong impression: if I have a vivid impression myself of Miss de los Angeles's early triumphs, it is not because I was around to hear them. The world's most venerable and judicious record company -- its name became EMI at around this time -- saw her worth from the start and documented her progress lavishly.
Miss de los Angeles's recording career falls into three periods, with a delicious series of 78-r.p.m. songs and arias in the late 40's as a prelude. The 50's were dominated by opera: Gounod's Marguerite, Rossini's Rosina and Puccini's Cio-Cio-San twice each; roles of Falla, Debussy, Verdi, Massenet and Bizet; a luxurious recital of Italian arias.
The recital is a knockout, with full-throated, spirited renditions of "Ernani, involami," "Ebben, ne andro lontana" and the final rondo of Cenerentola among others. But in the complete operas, often enough a little phrase from here or there will stand out in memory just as prominently as the great solos. When Mimi sings about Rodolfo's having bought her the little bonnet, and a moment later (to the same music) says that being in love is sweeter than honey, Miss de los Angeles tastes the honey, as Mimi does, in the ordinary exchanges that love makes so sweet. Or when Antonia asks Hoffmann to come with her to the piano -- "Viens-la, comme autrefois" -- the two lines say everything about nostalgia, loss, poignant unawareness of loss, music as lovers' language.
New roles were added in the next decade (Antonia, Charlotte, Suor Angelica, Lauretta), but the great legacy of the 60's and early 70's was a series of 14 solo albums for EMI/Angel, covering the heart of Miss de los Angeles's concert repertory in French, Spanish and German, with excursions to early music, zarzuela arias and Canteloube's "Songs of the Auvergne."
It is faintly maddening that EMI has just reissued so many of these scrambled and remixed into a four-CD set, "The Fabulous Victoria de los Angeles" -- not because there is anything unsatisfying about it but because so many items from the original albums are now on the cutting-room floor. Eventually we'll need a deluxe de los Angeles "Edition" that gives them all in their original sequences. But the new set, along with the two "Great Recordings of the Century" CD's of her early records and a sampling of her late ones, will give the collector a rounded portrait.
THE "INDIAN SUMMER" period has found Miss de los Angeles a free agent after a quarter-century with EMI. There was an LP of songs, over-reverberantly recorded but containing some beauties, on CBS, then another on Polydor. Hunt for this in the second-hand shops: it has a Japanese song like a tart cherry, enchanting folk songs from Portugal and Italy, and a haunting, uninhibitedly Hispanic rendition of "Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child."
On CD there have been Catalan folk songs on Collins and two kaleidoscopic live recitals: an evening at London's Wigmore Hall from 1990 on Collins and a Tokyo concert from 1986 on Camerata. In Tokyo she sang Schumann's late song cycle on Mary Stuart with piercing directness and simplicity, followed by Chopin songs in Polish with all the verve and stomp of the mazurka. At Wigmore there were brilliantly pointed, neat limnings of old Italian airs one has heard a thousand times since last listening, as Miss de los Angeles makes one do.
And perhaps best of all is the 1989 jubilee recital in Barcelona on Video Arts International, for adding visual presence to the succession of grace, gravity, flirtatiousness, sorrow, reflection, enigma and abandon that make up a de los Angeles evening. The gradual realization as one song follows another -- as one world of mood is created, inhabited and bid farewell -- is that in its present unusual form, this voice may well last as long as the singer has health and energy. That is a real consolation: not just that we can celebrate her 50th anniversary, but that we can reasonably suppose it might not be a farewell.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Does 'Germinal' Speak Across a Century?

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
IT WAS A MEASURE OF EMILE Zola's political influence that coal miners from northern France joined his funeral procession in Paris on Oct. 5, 1902, shouting "Germinal! Germinal!" in tribute to his support for their fight against exploitation. They didn't seem to mind that in his novel "Germinal" the miners went down to defeat when their strike was crushed by gendarmes. What mattered was that Zola sympathized with their struggle. For the France of the day, that alone was an act of subversion.
Almost a century later, the director Claude Berri has brought his movie version of Zola's classic to a very different France. All but a handful of coal mines are now closed, factories are automated, a welfare state is in place and the labor movement, having come full circle, is again weak. In fact, when the movie was released in France last fall, the cries of "Germinal! Germinal!" came from businessmen in Lille, complaining that Mr. Berri had muddied the image of the "new" high-tech northern France of today. 
 The 59-year-old director refused to apologize. He insisted that the film, which opens in New York on Friday after achieving great popularity in France, was not intended as a political statement. But he said he hoped it would at least give cause for reflection, not only about the grim working conditions that still exist in much of the third world but also about the social crisis that has brought a surge of unemployment, homelessness and strikes to France today.
"I set out to make a film about a great work of literature," Mr. Berri explained, "but when I now see French fishermen protesting angrily, they are like the movement in 'Germinal.' "
His reasons for making the film, though, were far more personal. Looking for a new subject after completing his last movie, "Uranus," in 1990, he picked up "Germinal" almost by accident. "Like many people, I thought I had read it, but I had not," he recalled in an interview in his production office here.
"I found it was the book I was waiting for at this stage of my life. The story touched my childhood, my roots, because I am the son of a worker who voted Communist and was fully conscious of the injustices that he suffered." He dedicated the movie not to the workers of the world but to his late father.
In adapting the 1885 novel to the screen, Mr. Berri and his sister, Arlette Langmann, have remained faithful to Zola. "If Zola were alive today, he would be a great screenplay writer," Mr. Berri said. So, like the author, the director traveled to northern France to make his "Germinal." And while Zola witnessed a strike at the Anzin mine in 1884, Mr. Berri shot his film in old mining villages in the same area, adding authenticity by using retired coal miners among his 500 extras. The director even aped the novel's epic dimension -- the movie took seven months to shoot, it runs 2 hours 38 minutes and, costing $30 million, it is the most expensive film ever made in France.
The story tells of an outsider, Etienne Lantier (played by the French protest singer Renaud), who arrives in the mining town of Montsou in the 1860's. Hired to replace a miner who has died, Lantier is given a bed in the overcrowded cottage of Maheu (Gerard Depardieu) and his wife, Maheude (Miou-Miou). Soon indignant over the poverty of the miners, the dangers of the pit face and the good life of the mine owners, Lantier begins stirring the protest movement that eventually leads to the strike. Simultaneously, Lantier tries to win over Maheu's daughter, Catherine (Judith Henry), who "belongs" to another miner. Eventually, the two plots come together in tragedy.
FOR ALL THE HUNGER, CHILD labor, accidents and violence documented in the film, however, Mr. Berri said he was eager to show the dignity of the miners. And while he had his furrier father in mind, several cast members were similarly motivated: Renaud comes from a family of miners, Mr. Depardieu sought the role of Maheu because his father was a metalworker, and Miou-Miou's mother sold vegetables in a market. "We all had reasons that went back to our childhood," the director said. "I identify with Etienne Lantier," he said. "I could have been a revolutionary, but my life decided otherwise."
Best known abroad for his 1986 films, "Jean de Florette" and "Manon of the Spring," Mr. Berri has lived, by his own admission, in "a world of money and success." He is not only an established film director and producer, he is also the owner of an impressive modern art collection. Did his "Germinal" make him feel guilty that he was not poor, not a worker? "Perhaps," he said softly. "Perhaps I would have preferred the life of my father. He had an awareness of injustice that I understand but have not lived."
His nostalgic evocation of a true working class, though, was not uniformly appreciated in France. Released at the same time as Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park," Mr. Berri's film was promptly nicknamed "Germinal Park" by Le Figaro's movie critic, Claude Baigneres, who said Zola's work could only appeal to "intellectuals of the Jurassic era." Le Monde's Jacques Siclier was kinder, calling the film "topical, courageous and necessary." But Gerard Lefort of Liberation said Mr. Berri's screenplay "would not have gone beyond the desk of a secretary at Warner Brothers."
The director shrugged off his critics, noting that, with about six million tickets sold so far in France, "Germinal" is already among the top 10 box-office hits in French movie history. "For these critics, if a film draws the public, it's commercial, but if it interests no one, it's a work of art," he said dismissively. "They're stuck in the 1960's. For them, anyone who makes a first film or a boring film is the heir to Truffaut or Godard."

BYLINE: By DAN SHAW 

 BODY:
THOUGH the tickets cost $1,000 and the invitation read "black tie," many men at the awards dinner of the Council of Fashion Designers of America at Lincoln Center last month interpreted the dress code liberally, not literally. Tommy Hilfiger wore a cashmere turtleneck under his tuxedo; James Truman, the editor in chief of Details, wore an iridescent shirt without a tie; Stephan Weiss wore a band-collared shirt by his wife, Donna Karan; Andre Balazs, the hotelier, wore a mandarin-collared jacket buttoned up to the neck. James Simpson, the theater director and husband of the actress Sigourney Weaver, wore a vest and open-collared shirt with his dinner jacket.
Calvin Klein didn't wear a tie -- or a shirt. He wore an insouciant white silk scarf under his tuxedo, showing off a lot of skin. 
 Black tie used to mean a dinner jacket and a tie, but no more. These days, ties don't invariably connote sophistication or seriousness, and suits don't necessarily require ties.
Designers like Ms. Karan, Mr. Klein, Giorgio Armani and Dolce & Gabbana are experimenting with four-, five- and six-button suits, which often look more elegant and sophisticated without a tie. The suits are shown on the runway and in stores with band- or mandarin-collar shirts, high-button vests, knitted Henleys and cashmere polos and turtlenecks.
Many fashion-conscious men are choosing these alternatives. "Our tie business has dwindled," said Jon Weiser, the president of the five Charivari boutiques in Manhattan. "We're selling 50 percent fewer ties than three years ago. I guess we are making progress. It's not an oddity to wear a band-collared shirt. With men's wear, there were so many limitations for so long."
Some men are suffering from necktie en nui. "There aren't any ties that interest me now," Mr. Balazs said. "More and more, I'm wearing ties less."
Indeed, the Suit and Tie paradigm is coming into question as corporations restructure and downsize, as the information superhighway alters the concept of the workplace and as men of a younger, more fashion-conscious generation insist on working in comfortable clothes that allow them to express their individuality.
"In a society where a tie is a sign of work, taking off a tie signals that one has control over one's life," said Dr. Stuart Ewen, a sociologist and author of "All Consuming Images: The Politics of Style in Contemporary Culture" (Basic Books, 1988). "What was once a symbol of being a gentleman has become a symbol of being a drone. The term 'suit' has become a euphemism for being boring and noncreative and stuck in a 9-to-5 life."
Nevertheless, the Neckwear Association of America, a trade group based in Manhattan, reports that 132 million ties were sold in this country in 1992, a 10 percent increase from 1991. The association said women buy 65 percent of the ties sold in America, which is one of the reasons Joe Silverberg, co-chairman of the Knot Shop Stores, a 35-store chain, isn't worried about his business. "Women don't send men flowers, and fragrance can be tricky," he said. "A tie is a good gift."
Tie sales are up 22 percent in the last year at Paul Stuart, the Madison Avenue haberdashery. "Men are paying more attention to accessories," said Julie Oddy, the store's spokeswoman. "They are more conservative in the number of suits they buy, so accessories are a way to update their wardrobe."
The Neckwear Association estimates that 20 to 25 percent of the ties bought are "conversational," or novelty, ties, featuring comic-strip characters, pop-culture iconography, scenes from famous paintings. These ties are frequently more vibrant and interesting than the men wearing them. They are often worn on "dress-down days" at major corporations, one day a week, usually Friday, on which employees are permitted to wear casual clothes. These are ties that look better with chambray shirts than with pin stripes.
Marshall Blonsky, who teaches semiotics at New York University and is the author of "American Mythologies" (Oxford University Press, 1992), believes that the deconstruction of the classic postwar business uniform reflects a changing global economy based on telecommunications. "When you start tampering with the suit, it says the whole world is up for grabs and the old ways of doing business are in question," Dr. Blonsky said.
Businessmen are now being offered the same fashion options that the women they work with have. "It's not about wearing ties or not wearing ties," said Ms. Karan, whose first men's collection, in 1991, included a banded-collar tuxedo shirt that was designed not to accommodate a bowtie. "It's all about giving men alternatives."
Some men don't want to make choices about what to wear to the office. Steven Yee, director of development for Children's Television Workshop, contemplated not wearing a tie to work and thought better of it. "I'd have to construct a whole new look, and I don't have the right shirts," he said. "All my shirts go with ties. It's easier for me to wear a traditional shirt and tie. Besides, it's the code here. It's the line of demarcation between the business and creative people."
Tampering with the concept of black tie doesn't interest Alan Levenstein, vice chairman of Bozell Worldwide, the advertising agency. "I think a tuxedo is formal wear and it requires a necktie," he said. "I don't understand why someone wouldn't wear one."
But even a traditionalist like the designer Alan Flusser, who has a custom-order shop at Saks Fifth Avenue, is expanding his notion of appropriateness. The way you can tell "whether a suit has legs," he said, "is if you can wear a T-shirt under it."
Though Mr. Flusser says he doesn't think his Wall Street clients, who pay $1,200 to $2,200 for a bespoke suit, will abandon neckties at the office, he recently made a black silk, fly-front, band-collared tuxedo shirt that is popular with them. Paul Stuart is also making a mandarin-collar formal shirt that doesn't take a tie.
John Bartlett, the up-and-coming men's wear designer, said men shouldn't wear ties with his suits. "If you have a gorgeous white shirt, there's no reason," he said. "A plain white shirt is more formal in a way."
The type of shirt that is worn with a suit but without a tie is not the classic button-down Oxford. "The shirts are not as structured and the collars are not as hard," said Skip Cuddy, a wardrobe consultant at Louis, Boston, where suits sell for $700 to $2,000. "They accept a necktie during the day and can be worn without one at night."
Traditions, of course, die hard. Men who work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, for instance, are, according to its floor manual, "expected to wear: A Dress Shirt, buttoned at the collar, with a tie knotted at the customary place, i.e., snug to the collar." Exchange members are fined $250 for noncompliance; clerks are suspended for three days.
Michael R. Solomon, a professor of marketing at the Rutgers University School of Business, thinks he understands why many professions and organizations still enforce the wearing of ties. "It's a leash," Dr. Solomon said. "It makes you more rigid, circumspect and aware of your behavior.
Even a modernist like Calvin Klein (who designs ties, too) isn't an abolitionist. "I want my accountant, my lawyer and my banker to wear suits and ties at all my business meetings with them," the designer said. "It makes me feel much more secure."

DANCING THE BAROQUE
 Some of the dances once performed in the courts of Louis XIV and Louis XV will be recreated in the more modest precincts of the United Church-on-the-Green in New Haven on Friday at 8 P.M.
In a presentation by Old Post Road Historic Concerts, Edith Lalonger, a Baroque specialist from France, is the solitary dancer, dressed in the panniered gowns and satin slippers of the period, accompanied by Suzanne Stumpf, playing the traverso; Stephen Marvin on violin; Daniel Ryan on the harpsichord, and David Sinclair on the viola da gamba. 
 Ms. Lalonger will dance a passacaglia to Lully's "Armide," and other courtly dances to the music of Couperin, Hotteterre and Rebel.
The company, formed in 1987, takes its name from the venues in which it usually performs, along Route 1 from New York to Boston. Its programs are always based on historical themes.
Tickets are available at the door for $12, or $6 for students and the elderly. For more information, 617-648-4824.
 
AMERICAN MORES
 The differences between the good old days and the present will be highlighted in a series of discussions about three seminal, turn-of-the-century American literary works, to be presented at the Howard Whittemore Memorial Library in Naugatuck as a Library Centennial Program.
Charlotte Scully, an independent scholar with a special interest in the perceived decline in American moral values, has chosen the three books as a basis for comparing mores at the beginning of the 20th century to those at the end of it.
Today at 2 P.M. the series will open with Edith Wharton's novel "Ethan Frome," exploring the options available then and now to the poverty-stricken, the sick, the dependent and women on their own. That discussion will conclude next Sunday at the same time, and a study of Thornton Wilder's play, "Our Town" will begin, carrying the saga of Grover's Corners, N.H., into the third session on March 20. The final discussion on March 27 at 2 P.M. will be based on a selection of poems from Edgar Lee Masters's "Spoon River" anthology.
The library is located at 243 Church Street and admission is free. For more information, 729-4591.
 
GUIDE TO GARDENING
 The annual Garden Symposium held by the Bartlett Arboretum, a unit of the University of Connecticut in Stamford, is set for Saturday from 9:15 to 3:45 at the university's branch on Scofieldtown Road. Admission is $55 and lunch will be available for $7.
Designed to show home gardeners how to create a garden with its own distinctive style, the day will be filled with workshops led by Elsa Bakalar, David Smith, Maggie Daly and Mary Jo Palmer, experts on assembling complementary plant combinations, putting unusual plants together successfully, garden ornaments and propogating plants for fun and economy. They will demonstrate why herbaceous or woody perennials are best in certain locations, what combinations of plants may be impractical, and offer guidelines on where to place what garden ornaments for maximum effect.
Subsequent programs include a three-session series on redoing a garden with landscaping problems, scheduled for March 16, 23 and 30 from 10 A.M. to noon, at a cost of $50. On March 25 from 10 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. the subject will be French intensive raised-bed vegetable gardening at $20. To register, or for information, 322-6971.
 
WOMEN'S CHOICES
 "Eighteenth Century Women: Wives, Midwives & Spinsters" is the title of a two-part lecture and slide program taking place on Monday at the Fairfield and New Canaan Historical Societies. It focuses on the limited choices open to most women at that time.
Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, an assistant professor of history at the University of New Hampshire, will deliver the lecture from 9:30 to 11:30 A.M. at the Fairfield Society's headquarters, 636 Post Road. Her talk is based on diaries, letters, court records and poetry of women who lived more than 200 years ago.
Dr. Ulrich won a Pulitzer Prize for her 1991 book "A Midwife's Tale," and she received a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, which is awarded to creative people who enhance the human condition.
From 1:15 to 2:15 P.M. the second portion of the program will be held at the New Canaan Historical Society, 13 Oenoke Ridge Road, titled "The Age of Homespun." Slides of the fabrics and domestic items produced by women demonstrate not only their utility but the fact that they provided one of the few outlets for creativity and artistry.
Tours of the Ogden House and Hanford Silliman House in New Canaan on Wednesday and Thursday from 2 to 4 P.M. are included in the fee of $25. A box lunch is available for an extra $10. For reservations and information, 259-1598.
 
KINSOLVING READING
 William Kinsolving will read from some of his books at the Oliver Wolcott Library in Litchfield on Wednesday at 7:30 P.M. Among the selections are excerpts from "The Diplomat's Daughter," published by Doubleday in 1993, and a new novel that is described as a sequel to "Mutiny on the Bounty."
Mr. Kinsolving has acted and directed in the legitimate theater on and off Broadway and served a playwright for the Stratford, Ontario, Shakespeare Company. His other novels include "Born With the Century' and "Bred to Win," both Literary Guild main selections. He has also written a number of television scripts, among them were a four-hour mini-series called "The Brownsville Raid" and "The Gentle Tasaday," a three-hour special.
Admission to the reading is free. The library address is 160 South Street. For more information, 567-8030.
 
ON ARTHUR MILLER'S CONTEXT
 Long Wharf Theater in New Haven has arranged three discussion programs under the heading "Arthur Miller in Context: American Jewish Culture in the 1930's," to be held today and next Sunday following the matinees, and on Friday after the evening performance.
The programs are being presented as an adjunct to the current run through April 3 of Mr. Miller's new play, "Broken Glass," which examines the reactions of a Jewish couple in Brooklyn to the Holocaust unfolding in Germany in 1938.
Today's speaker is Leon Botstein, president of Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, music director of the American Symphony Orchestra at Avery Fisher Hall, a commentator on National Public Radio and author of "Jews and Modernity," to be pubished soon.
Friday's program will be conducted by Joyce Antler, professor of American Studies at Brandeis University and author of several books on Judaism and women. The final program will unite Ms. Antler, Tom F. Driver and Gerald Weales in a public forum.
Mr. Driver is a professor of theology at Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan, and the author of "Romantic Quest & Modern Query: A History of Modern Theater." Mr. Weales, a professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania, has written several essays and critical tracts on American theater and Arthur Miller. The forum will be moderated by Cyrus Hamlin, professor of comparative literature at Yale.
Long Wharf is located just off I-95 at Exit 46. For information, 787-4282. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Rudin Magic;
Doing Big Business With a 'Mom-and-Pop' Warmth

BYLINE: CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
DAN GRONICH had long known that his Irish Government clients planned to consolidate, and he looked forward to finding them the space they needed. Still, he hadn't guessed how restricted the space search would be.
"The Consul General of Ireland insisted on being in a Rudin building," said Mr. Gronich, the new head of Grubb & Ellis New York. He put the agencies into Rudin Management's 345 Park Avenue, at 52d Street. 
 Robert L. Freedman had more leeway when he was looking for space for Publicis, an advertising agency. In fact, he found them some pretty good bargains. Publicis eschewed them all and moved to Rudin's 1675 Broadway, also on 52d Street. "They paid nearly 8 percent more to be in a Rudin building," said Mr. Freedman, a vice chairman of Williams Real Estate.
What is it about the Rudins?
In a city where brokers, tenants and landlords routinely castigate one another not a soul says a word -- even an off-the-record one -- against Lew, Jack or Bill Rudin. Yes, their 14 office buildings -- and, for that matter, their 22 apartment buildings -- are well-maintained and well-serviced. But so are myriad first-class buildings. Yet getting a tenant to leave a Rudin building is a Herculean task.
William C. Rudin, Lew's son who, at age 38 was just named the company's president, takes this stab at an explanation: "We treat a 1,500-foot tenant the same as we treat a 50,000-foot tenant." Mr. Freedman offers a different size-irrelevancy explanation: "They run Rudin Management like a mom-and-pop business, and that is their genius."
They're clearly doing something smart. Rudin Management's 7.5 million square feet of Manhattan office space is consistently occupied. RElocate, which tracks building vacancies, says that Rudin's eight midtown buildings are about 5 percent vacant; most brokers peg the percentage of empty midtown space at three times that amount.
Even the 35-story 1675 Broadway, which was completed in 1989 -- just in time for the real estate crash -- is almost fully occupied. Apparently, the Rudins were able to lease much of the building before it was half built.
"We wrote a 20-year lease for 200,000 square feet for a building that wasn't built yet," said David W. Levinson, executive managing director at the Edward S. Gordon Company brokerage, who put the law firm Lord Day & Lord in the building. "I could not have made the deal with anyone but the Rudins. They were tough, but they are credible."
The Rudins have not come through the recession unscathed. They have held onto their buildings -- indeed, the family prides itself on never selling anything it builds -- but the value of those buildings and their revenue streams has dropped precipitously.
In October 1990, Forbes Magazine placed the Rudin family wealth at more than $1.5 billion. Two years later, the estimate was $500 million. Last year the Rudins didn't even make it onto the magazine's annual list of the country's 400 richest folks.
MANY Rudin buildings, particularly downtown, are sopping up cash. Rudin Management recently redid the lobby at One Whitehall Street -- and, in fact, just landed The Topps Company, a children's entertainment company, as a tenant in the newly-refurbished building -- and plans a similar overhaul at 110 Wall Street. And 55 Broad Street, the empty 30-story building that lost its anchor tenant when Drexel Burnham Lambert filed for bankruptcy, will probably need millions before it's rentable.
But while occupancy is no more synonymous with profit for the Rudins than for other landlords, they hold onto tenants like pit bulls. Last year, the Discovery Channel, which had outgrown its space at 415 Madison Avenue, a Rudin building on 48th Street, seemed on the verge of moving to 300 Park Avenue, a non-Rudin building on 50th Street.
"The landlord was sure we had reached a deal, but I wasn't," said Mr. Freedman, who negotiated for 300 Park Avenue. "With the Rudins, it's not over till it's over." Indeed, the Rudins came through with a better deal at 641 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street.
But the Rudins, brokers say, don't always immediately benefit from their deals.
"They keep their buildings full, even if it means they won't make money in the first three years or so of the lease," said Joseph G. Genovesi, managing director of the brokerage D.G. Hart, who just put Emmerling Post Advertising into 415 Madison.
John G. Martinez, head of New York State's newly merged housing finance and mortgage agencies, recently negotiated for 100,000 square feet at 641 Lexington Avenue.
"They understood that a public benefit corporation is motivated by the need to save money," said Mr. Martinez, who says he got a fairly low rent and a fairly high landlord contribution to building the space.
The Rudins have also had to contend with their share of deals gone sour. Numerous Rudin tenants -- Lord Day, for one -- have hit recessionary troubles. And the Rudins rarely hold troubled tenants' feet to the fire.
"If they can live with $24 a foot a year, they won't insist on $26," said Steven Spinola, head of the Real Estate Board of New York.
Some say it's compassion; others say it's long-term thinking. Today's troubled tenant can be tomorrow's high flyer.
Twenty years ago Kenneth G. Langone was president of R. W. Pressprich, a financial firm with five years left on a five-floor lease at 80 Pine Street, the Rudin building near Water Street. The firm was in trouble and needed only half its space.
"I expected Lew to say, 'Go bankrupt if you have to, but pay your rent,' " Mr. Langone said. "Instead he said, 'clean up space you don't need, and just pay for what you keep.' " Today Mr. Langone is a major stockholder in Home Depot and several other companies. "If any of my companies need space, I'll just ask Lew what he's got," he said.
That need had best be in New York for Mr. Rudin to help. Rudin Management has never ventured beyond city borders. Nor is it in ancillary businesses like hotels. Indeed, the last time the Rudins ventured onto unfamiliar professional turf was in 1953 when Jack and Lewis's father, Samuel, who'd been exclusively in housing, bought 415 Madison Avenue, which he tore down and replaced two years later.
"His brothers thought he was crazy, his partners wanted out, but the Tishmans and the Urises had office buildings, and he wanted them too," Lew Rudin recalled.
The company hired a leasing agent to rent that first building. Since then, Rudin Management has handled its own leasing.
TO hear Lew Rudin tell it, his philosophy -- do a few things, but do them well -- is not a lot different from Samuel's.
"My father always said, 'Shoemaker, stick to your last,' and, 'You are a favorite in your hometown,' " Lew Rudin said. "Well, what we know is how to build and manage buildings, and New York City is our hometown."
They have done well by that home. Jack Rudin was a prime mover behind the New York Marathon. Lew Rudin founded the Association for a Better New York.
"There's always a standing offer from the Rudins to City Hall to help, no matter who the mayor is," said Mr. Spinola.
Bill Rudin, although also a New York activist, is more of a national presence, serving as chairman of the Washington-based National Realty Committee's tax group.
"Other developers send delegates, but the Rudins get involved themselves," said Steven A. Wechsler, the committee's president.
Still, neither knowledge nor political activism has kept the Rudins from making mistakes. In the early 1980's they bought 310 Madison Avenue, at 42d Street, with the idea of demolishing the building and redeveloping the site. But someone else had space on the site that the Rudins couldn't get.
"We had no choice but to sell the entire site," Bill Rudin recalled.
They also felt compelled to turn 2 Fifth Avenue, a rental building they owned at Eighth Street, into a co-op when tenants sued them over rents and conditions. Later they co-oped 65 Central Park West, near 66th Street, and would have co-oped more buildings, had the co-op market not fallen apart.
"Office buildings are easier," Bill Rudin said. "You are dealing with a corporate mentality, and with 24 tenants, not 240."
Indeed, the Rudins seem to be steering more and more toward the office market, if not as builders, as consultants. Rudin Management served as a for-fee consultant to J. P. Morgan, which is developing 23 Wall Street. "It is my civic duty to keep them in New York," Lew insists. Bill is more candid about the business implications.
"Consulting is a good way to use our expertise without risking capital," he said.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Staying the Course in Europe

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
IT would be easy to conclude, based on the behavior of investors in European stocks and bonds over the past several weeks, that Europe is in for increasing inflation and higher interest rates and that the markets are headed for a downward spiral.
The markets have been extremely volatile, and on several days have endured sharp selloffs as pessimism about inflation and interest rates in the United States infected investors in Europe. The situation was not helped by the Bundesbank's announcement last week that the German money supply, a predictor of inflation, had increased at a far higher level than expected, although the central bank explained the jump away as a result of one-time technical factors. 
 But economists are nearly unanimous in their assessment that rates will continue to decline in Germany, Europe's biggest and most influential economy, and eventually throughout the major western European nations. Inflation, they said, remains quiescent. In other words, the same economic assumptions that underpinned a strong rally in most markets over the previous several months remain in place.
The most immediate question facing investors seems to be how quickly the European markets will shrug off what is happening in the United States, where stronger-than-expected growth and signs of incipient inflation are almost certain to bring further interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve.
Investors, particularly in the European bond markets, appear to have been operating in recent weeks as if the rising rates in the United States would inevitably bring the same in Europe, and as if falling share prices in New York would mean the onset of a bear market on this side of the Atlantic. The selloff was reportedly exacerbated by heavy selling among large hedge funds seeking to cover losses both on bond and currency trading. After enduring some violent swings during the week, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares closed on Friday in London at 3,278, down just 3.2 points on the week. In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index ended the week down 14.83 points, at 2,060.09. The CAC-40 index in Paris closed down 20.23 points on the week, at 2,178.69.
"We maintain our view that the real economies of Europe and the United States are on very different cycles," said Joe Rooney, the European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in London.
"The question is whether, when things settle down, the European bond markets will be able to decouple themselves from those in the U.S.," Mr. Rooney said. "We're increasingly of the belief that that will be the case."
Mr. Rooney said Lehman Brothers had studied the 11 periods since the 1950's when rising short-term rates led to a sharp fall in American stock markets. The study then looked at the extent to which the market declines in the United States were accompanied by falls in European markets, and concluded that there was not necessarily a direct relationship between the two.
The average market decline in the 11 corrections in the United States was 13.8 percent, excluding the 1987 market crash, Mr. Rooney said. Yet in Germany, for example, the market rose or was unchanged during 8 of those 11 periods.
Some analysts said the selloffs in Europe over the past several weeks were actually positive for the markets by ending an almost mindless rush into both stocks and bonds.
"In general we view the falling markets over the past couple of weeks as healthy signs," said Kenneth Anderson, the investment manager for Scottish Widows, a large pension fund in Edinburgh. "The liquidity flow into equities was indiscriminate and valuations had been pushed up too high."
There is some danger that rising rates in the United States will dry up or even reverse the heavy flow of funds from American investors into the European markets, analysts said. That flow has driven much of the upward surge in prices in the markets, especially in smaller markets like Madrid.
Richard Davidson, the European investment strategist at Morgan Stanley in London, said that the liquidity-driven phase of the European bull market is more or less over. Although European equities have generally held up better over recent weeks than European bonds, he said, economic fundamentals and market valuations suggest the opposite should be true. As a result, Morgan Stanley is advising a very cautious approach to picking European stocks, he said.
"We really can't say that the European equity markets deserve to be on the valuations they're on," Mr. Davidson said.
He said the best opportunities are in three categories: consumer stocks such as Nestle, Sandoz and Unilever that are likely to deliver solid earnings growth and are still priced relatively cheaply; restructuring and recovery stocks such as Philips, the Dutch electronics company, which showed a strong earnings turnaround last week; and stocks that benefit from high levels of dollar earnings, like Hanson, the British-American conglomerate.
Mr. Anderson of Scottish Widows said the markets, having put historically high valuations on so many companies, would harshly punish those stocks that failed to live up to expectations. "There's no scope for any earnings disappointment," he said.
But he said careful investors can still find good buys.
"Stock selection is going to be much more important than last year, when you could buy anything and everything," Mr. Anderson said.

HEADLINE: The Humbling of the Harvard Man

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
WHEN Erich Segal wrote "The Class," a 1983 novel based on the lives of his Harvard classmates from their school days until their 25th reunion, the people he portrayed had experienced many of the problems common to his generation. They had endured divorces, loneliness, alienated children, thwarted ambition. Several had committed suicide. But nowhere in the 592 pages of "The Class" is anyone out of work, or pressed for cash. A Harvard degree seemed an immunization against unemployment.
Mr. Segal saw the 25th reunion of the class of 1958 as a gathering of the privileged. "It was not merely that you were going to make your way, but as a Harvard man the way was prepared for you," Mr. Segal said last week. "This is not arrogance. Unemployment was not part of our emotional baggage, not part of the range of things that we thought we would ever have to face."
How times have changed. In the nearly 11 years since that reunion in June 1983, at least 10 percent of the 1,040 surviving members of the all-male class, and perhaps as many as 20 percent, have lost jobs, according to those in the class who organize the reunions and track their mates. 
 Some, like Richard V. Wing, a manager at Honeywell, were laid off and, after looking unsuccessfully for new jobs, took premature retirement. Others, like A. Donald Slotkin and Thomas O. Bernheim, lost their jobs and became consultants while they looked for new work, sometimes successfully and sometimes not. Others forced from their careers, like Edward Gray, have retrained themselves and are now self-employed, often at a far lower income than before. And a few, like Thomas A. Stalker, who lost the family business, are surviving with welfare payments and food stamps.
Food stamps are a dizzying turn of events for people who came out of Harvard expecting an inside track to the most interesting and lucrative careers, and to a comfortable retirement. The class of 1958, whose members are 56 or 57 years old today, was far more homogeneous than the class of 1994. Almost all the 1,174 men who earned bachelor's degrees in 1958 were white and upper-middle or upper class. Many had prepared at top-notch secondary schools or private academies.
The class of 1958 included John D. Rockefeller 4th, now a Democratic Senator from West Virginia, along with other sons of wealthy families. Some in the class were talented scholars, like William French Anderson, who went on to pioneer in gene transfers. And there were those who were not so studious, earning, with minimum grades, their privileged lives as Harvard graduates.
Some from the class of 1958 became prominent business leaders, like James R. Houghton, now chairman of Corning Inc. Academia, medicine, finance and law drew many class members, and most have had successful careers. Their incomes reflect it; the average annual income of the 402 class members who responded to a questionnaire last year was $170,000.
 
An Unexpected Intruder
 But job troubles are increasingly intruding on this cheerful picture. "The members of the class of 1958 are either reaching the senior level of their career paths or they have been tumbled out into doing their own thing," said William F. Manley, who compiled the autobiographical sketches published for the 25th reunion in 1983 and the 35th reunion last June. "I would say that about 25 percent have been tumbled out."
The Harvard class of 1958 is not alone in this experience. Alumni groups at other Ivy League schools and at colleges and universities outside the Ivy League report that their members, in growing numbers, are suffering from the upheavals in Corporate America. That is particularly the case for men who received their bachelor's degrees in the 1950's and 1960's and are now over 45.
If there is a lesson in all this, it is that a degree from a college like Harvard is no longer the lifetime guarantee of success in careers that it once seemed to be. "The layoffs of managers and skilled technical people at I.B.M. or Xerox or A.T.& T. do not discriminate between graduates of Harvard" and of some lesser school, Senator Rockefeller said. "And when they come we are not prepared for this nonsuccess. We don't know how to deal with it, economically or psychologically."
In fact, fewer than 10 members of the class of 1958 owned up to their troubles in the autobiographical updates submitted for the 35th reunion report. One was Michael J. Stone, of Orinda, Calif. He left his job in 1991 as a vice president of Dolby Laboratories. He joined a new company formed to recycle waste wood, but it failed, and he was out of the work world. "I am now in a position of calling myself either unemployed, retired or a job-seeker," Mr. Stone wrote. "I haven't yet decided which." Last month, he finally got a job, doing the accounting for a real estate investment operation, at a salary of $100,000, which is less than his Dolby income.
Lynn D. Sprankle, angry and eloquent, has not found work. He lost his job as a corporate vice president, then hunted incessantly for another job, sending out 13,000 resumes, some to his classmates. "The response from these people was also zero -- no phone calls, no leads, no interviews and of course no offers," he wrote for the 35th reunion report. "So much for the 'camaraderie of the 10,000 men of Harvard.' "
Inevitably, Mr. Sprankle, who is 57, questions the value of a Harvard education. "I no longer look upon it with the pride I once did, and I have come to view my graduate degree" -- an M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania -- "the same way," he wrote. "In fact, they may even have been detrimental -- in that they caused me to set higher personal expectation levels than I was ever able to attain."
Mr. Segal, who is most famous for his first novel, "Love Story," and is teaching this year at Oxford, was struck by how much things have changed for many classmates. In contrast with the autobiographical sketches compiled for the 25th anniversary, those written for the 35th "did not radiate with expressions of success and optimism," he said. "Quite the contrary, they seemed like a litany of loss and disillusion."
Responding to such frustrations, the class of 1958 has emerged as the first among Harvard's alumni groups to publicly recognize the jobs problem. Just before the 35th reunion, Thomas Stalker, who was out of work, mailed a letter to his classmates announcing the formation of a network to help the unemployed find jobs. The letter invited people to a breakfast during the reunion at which people without work could meet classmates who might help.
One hundred people showed up, among them Robert Waggoner, owner of Burrelle's Information Services, a successful press-clipping and data-processing service, that has his classmates on the payroll. "There was a feeling at that breakfast that some of these cases were very sad, and it was the tip of the iceberg and there must be more out there," Mr. Waggoner said. "And these people had courage and came forward."
The Harvard administration is only now acknowledging publicly that unemployment is an issue among the alumni. "There are a lot of capable people out there, who are Harvard graduates, who are losing their jobs through no fault of their own," Jack Reardon, an associate vice president at Harvard who heads the alumni association, said last week.
The solution? Mr. Reardon said that several regional alumni clubs would compile lists of members who had agreed to offer advice to other members seeking jobs. Harvard, he said, might try to measure statistically the extent of the unemployment among alumni holding Harvard bachelor's degrees, but has not considered setting up an employment office. "I am not so sure that Harvard would be particularly good at getting people jobs," Mr. Reardon said.
 
Thomas Stalker
From Corner Suite To Food Stamps
 Perhaps no one in the class of 1958 has fallen farther in the job world than Thomas Stalker, a 57-year-old Bostonian who once owned his own business. He is reduced today to selling powdered diet formula to friends and acquaintances. Yet he spends as much time on the phone helping classmates, as the self-appointed chief of the job network, as he does selling diet formula.
The hardwood-flooring business that Mr. Stalker owned went under in 1989. Five years later, he has still not adjusted to the shock and to the loss of the stature that he enjoyed as a well-to-do businessman. But the job network he has set up to help classmates, and himself, has lifted his spirits. At the 35th reunion, he says, "I was sought out by classmates, many of whom I did not know, all giving encouragement, advice and thanks."
He came to the reunion with food stamps in his pocket. His church has given him money. He gets a $339 welfare check each month. He is behind on the rent for the room he lives in. And when he needs medical treatment, he goes to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he is treated under a state law that provides free health care for people with incomes below the poverty level.
Like many in the class of 1958, Mr. Stalker had entered a prosperous family business right out of college -- in his case a lumber supply company. Through his own ingenuity, he concentrated the company's marketing effort on selling hardwood flooring, while eliminating other, low-margin products. A newly developed adhesive had made hardwood flooring easier to lay, popular and profitable.
"Dad paid me the highest business compliment he could when he came into my office one day, closed the door and said, 'Son, I never thought I would see the day when we would be making so much money,' " Mr. Stalker said. "Fortunately for him, he died several years later and was not around for the Gotterdammerung."
The Gotterdammerung came in the form of a much bigger, out-of-state competitor that pushed into the Boston area with low prices, winning away Mr. Stalker's customers, who were wholesale distributors of hardwood flooring. That blow, along with a weak New England economy and the distractions of a costly divorce, forced Mr. Stalker into bankruptcy.
In the search for work that followed, Mr. Stalker found that a Harvard B.A. sometimes worked against him. He was viewed as overqualified. So once, when he sought a job selling magazine subscriptions by phone for $6.20 an hour, he suppressed Harvard. "I put down on the application the University of Massachusetts at Amherst," he said. "I got the job."
 
Thomas Bernheim
Once on the Inside, Now an Outsider
 Thomas O. Bernheim also returned from Harvard to the family business, in his case a leather business in Hoboken, N.J. His father had sent him to Exeter, and Exeter regularly sent half its graduating classes to Harvard, Yale or Princeton. At Harvard, Mr. Bernheim majored in history and became interested in teaching, a goal that made him restless in his business. So in 1971, at 35, he left and prepared for a form of teaching -- training people to be managers.
By 1979, Mr. Bernheim had joined Wang Laboratories, the big computer company near Boston, and he rose to senior member of a 20-person training department. "It was a beautiful time," Mr. Bernheim said. "Wang was booming, and we hired a lot of people. They were engineers, and they had to learn management quickly, and we taught them."
By 1989, however, Wang was on the skids and Mr. Bernheim's department was abolished. He switched to teaching marketing people. "I put in a new course on how to use power and influence, and how to be assertive," Mr. Bernheim said. "I taught people how to get things through the company and how to build a common ground with others, and a common vision. It was an exciting time, and I enjoyed this work all the way up to 1991, when I got laid off."
He had been making $55,000 a year, and he got half that as severance. "We knew we were living under the ax," he said, "and we had already started sending out resumes."
Mr. Bernheim is still sending out resumes, and answering ads. He is working out of a basement office now, getting by on consulting fees. (His wife does not work, and his three children are on their own.) Mostly, he says, he is concentrating "on finding that wonderful, full-time job and wondering, 'Why can't I get one.' "
Mr. Bernheim, who is 57, has concluded that his main obstacle is age. His Harvard degree also sometimes works against him. "I am asked, how come I wasn't making more money, and how come I wasn't a vice president," Mr. Bernheim said. "How come? Because I chose to be a coach and contributor, to help others. I chose to do what I enjoyed doing."
 
Edward Gray
A Company Man Left on His Own
 Edward Gray, who is 56, sat in on the job network breakfast at the 35th reunion. "There was talk that a lot of people would have traveled to Cambridge for the reunion if they could have afforded to do so," he said.
Mr. Gray, who lives near Los Angeles, could afford the trip, but from savings, not from his current income as a self-employed patent expert without enough clients. He is not in this business by choice. After Harvard, Mr. Gray went on to earn a doctorate in physics, and for 23 years, until 1990, he worked in the military industry, on rockets and aircraft, for big contractors like TRW.
The cuts in military spending, and the job shedding they generated, finally forced him out of the industry in 1989. He has never regained the $75,000 salary he earned at the end, not to mention the generous expense accounts. To survive, Mr. Gray took an 18-week course in patent law, passed a Federal exam and went to work in 1991 for a law firm as a patent agent. His task was to prepare detailed patent applications for inventors.
But the law firm abolished Mr. Gray's job, in late 1992. So he set up his own one-man shop. "It has been extremely hard," Mr. Gray said. "Basically, I am constantly marketing. And if I am working on a case" -- each one takes up to 50 hours and pays $4,000 to $5,000 -- "then I am aware that this job will finish and I have to find clients."
If he could get a job, "something useful and productive, that would make a contribution to the national security, I would think about it," Mr. Gray says. He has submitted his resume to the job network, circling the category "underemployed." (His annual income is $40,000, but his wife has an income as a freelance writer, and his children are on their own.) At least, he says, "what I am doing is intellectually honest and rewarding."
 
Richard Wing
Going to School Instead of Work
 In many ways, Richard Wing of Newton, Mass., finds his early retirement more rewarding than the job he lost. Even before Honeywell Inc. laid him off more than three years ago, he had begun to study for a master's degree in classical civilization at the Harvard Extension School. And now that he is retired, he spends his days at a Harvard museum, cataloging ancient Greek coins -- the subject of his master's thesis.
Mr. Wing's entry in the 35th reunion book reflects this satisfaction in retirement. But it stands in contrast to what he wrote for the 25th book.
Then, he had presented himself as a successful engineer and manager for Honeywell, the computer company whose Boston office he had joined right out of Harvard. "I've had the satisfaction of having some of my designs manufactured," he wrote in 1983, "and I was the first person to transmit computer data by use of a space satellite."
The layoffs came after Honeywell was acquired by a French company. The new organization cut back on computer design operations that involved Mr. Wing, and the department of two dozen people that he once headed. "I saw this coming because I had responsibility for laying off people myself," he said. "I laid off two or three, and I found that very difficult. And when my boss called me in, I realized what was happening and tried to make it easy for him. I walked out with $10,000, and they paid my salary for almost a year. And I have health insurance from them."
Mr. Wing, who is 57 now, searched for more than a year for another computer industry job, finally concluding that he would have to leave Massachusetts to get one that matched the Honeywell job, which paid $63,000. "My wife works as a teacher here, and I would have had to give up school, and I did not want to do that. So when I turned 55 and became eligible for a Honeywell pension, I gave up looking for a job," Mr. Wing said. "We live now on my pension ($25,000) and my wife's salary ($44,000)."
 
Donald Slotkin
Between Jobs? Try Consulting
 Each time he has lost a job, Donald Slotkin has fallen back on self-employment, mainly consulting, as his avenue to the next job. "Harvard always opens doors," he says. "It does not mean that you will get a job, but having a Harvard degree opens doors, particularly when I am doing consulting work."
Mr. Slotkin, who lives in Detroit, is in meatpacking. Coming out of Harvard, he joined the family firm, Hygrade Food Products, remaining there until it was sold in the late 1960's. That was when he first tried consulting. "It was a good vehicle to stay in touch with the meat business," he said.
Consulting put Mr. Slotkin in touch with the Crown Packing Company in Yonkers, which hired him as president, a job he held for six years. In 1977, after another stint in consulting, he became president of John Morell & Company, a meatpacker based in Detroit, where he lasted 10 years. Morell fell into the hands of Carl Lindner, a corporate raider, and Mr. Lindner put his son in charge. "I basically had to work for a man half my age, who did not know the business," Mr. Slotkin said.
There was a parting, without a golden parachute but with "fair severance," and Mr. Slotkin spent a year writing a musical, drawing on a skill he had cultivated earlier in life. It wasn't produced, and Mr. Slotkin returned to consulting in 1988, for his longest stint. Consulting finally led last May to his third presidency, at Monfort Pork in Greeley, Colo.
Mr. Slotkin, who is 57, says that his income is in six figures and that consulting has never paid as well as the presidencies. He commutes from Detroit to the Colorado job. "I won't go to 65 doing this," he said, anticipating the early retirement that has overtaken so many of his classmates.
 
 
 
THE NORM IS STILL SUCCESS
 FOR every member of the class of 1958 who lost a job or retired unwillingly, there are two or three or more who are still enjoying successful careers or have gone happily into retirement. One is Edward L. Peirson, who retired as senior vice president of Corning Lab Services, a subsidiary of Corning Inc.
"I am having fun, smelling roses," he says. He has homes on Marco Island in Florida and on Cape Cod, and a "fairly large boat" he sails in the Caribbean. And he has enough money.
Mr. Peirson's career resembled those of executives in his father's generation. After a stint as an officer in the Marines, he joined Corning in 1961, where his father had also worked. He moved up through a series of jobs, reaching senior vice president of the Corning Lab division, with a salary and bonuses above $300,000 a year.
Corning gives full retirement pensions at 55, with 30 years of service, but Mr. Peirson, who is 57 now, was held over a year to complete some unfinished business. "There is a lot of emphasis at Corning on succession planning, and if you are successful at this, you are not needed," he said. "I will bet that in the last few years, there were not any officers who worked to 65. On the other hand, very few were told they had to leave."
Mr. Peirson had gone to Harvard because his father, who had also gone to Harvard, said he would not pay to send his son anywhere else. And like his father, Mr. Peirson retired from Corning as soon as he was eligible. For the father, who was director of public relations, that was age 62, since lowered to 55.
Mr. Peirson said that most of the people he dealt with at the 35th reunion did not have a job problem. "But I suspect," he said, "that there was more concern about jobs at the 35th reunion than the 25th."

THE ECONOMY
 
The Nation's Unemployment Rate Falls Two More Notches
Slowly and steadily, America keeps going back to work. The unemployment rate fell to 6.5 percent in February from 6.7 percent in January -- which was the first month of the Government's new tallying method -- and payrolls expanded by a solid 217,000. And if a price for these gains is a brush with inflation, there are at least 217,000 people who don't mind a bit. Things slowed down somewhat on the factory floor, though: the average workweek had hit exceptionally high levels recently, but with much of the nation battling ice and snow, it fell by 42 minutes, the biggest shrinkage in 10 years. There was a hopeful note, too, in a 10 percent reduction -- a drop of 524,000 -- in the ranks of the "partially unemployed," those who want more work than they have. But this may be less than it seems: the Labor Department said January's statistical gear-switching skewed this figure. 

Ending '93 on a Mighty Note
Last year's fourth quarter takes on ever-more-mythic proportions. Everyone knew it was strong, but last week it became clear just how strong: the economy grew at a 7.5 percent annual rate, the mightiest in a decade. So, do the numbers add up to renewed inflation? Other data last week gave a mixed picture. A purchasing managers' index showed fast-rising prices, a bad sign, and retail sales took a big jump. But home sales and construction were off (blame the weather), and January's leading indicators showed an 0.3 percent rise, signaling slow, steady growth.
 
COMPANIES
 
Interactive TV: Not Just Yet
To hear some people tell it, we're bounding toward a dazzling video future -- movies on demand, vast libraries at our electronic whim. But occasionally there's a reminder that technology can't leap as fast as the human mind. Just recently Bell Atlantic and T.C.I. abandoned their dream of interfacing in that high-tech sunrise. And last week Time Warner Cable delayed until later this year -- it had been set for April 1 -- a field trial of its interactive television system in Orlando, Fla. "It's simply a matter of wanting to take more time," a Time Warner spokesman said. But there are skeptics. "They're trying to put a round peg in a square hole," one analyst said. . . . But wait: Now T.C.I. and Microsoft are teaming up to test interactive cable systems.
 
Coke Kicks Up Its Heels
Giant Coca-Cola is clearly miffed when its customers start drinking odd concoctions like Snapple or Clearly Canadian -- drinks neither fish nor fowl, sort of soda, sort of juice, and a downright random attitude to carbonation. Colas are losing some hold on the market, though, while such "new age" drinks are exploding. So last week, unable to lick 'em, Coke joined 'em -- with a vengeance. It pulled out all the new-age stops in introducing a line of non-fizzy drinks called Fruitopia, complete with flowery labels and names like Strawberry Passion Awareness. Remember when a bit of tinkering with the Coke recipe was front-page news?
 
At the New Paramount: No Jaffe
Now that Viacom has won the epic battle for Paramount, one uncertainty has been resolved. Stanley Jaffe, Paramount's president, will have no place in the final cut, Viacom executives said last week. The reason is simple: many movies made on his watch were flops. And not only do the new owners want better films, they want more. Mr. Jaffe promised 25 a year, but did not come close; Viacom wants up to 40. And Mr. Jaffe? He's said recently that he might want to buy the New York Rangers hockey team, and with perhaps $60 million in a Paramount nest egg, he can afford a spending spree.
 
Chrysler Gears Up
America's automotive rebound took on an even more solid shape last week when Chrysler, jubilant that its cars and trucks are so popular, said it will spend $1.8 billion to increase its manufacturing capacity. As a starter, it canceled plans to shut a plant near St. Louis. The changes could create as many as 6,000 jobs. "We have to strike while the iron is hot," the chairman, Robert Eaton, said. Irons don't stay hot forever, as Detroit would be wise to remember this time around. But now things are definitely jumping: auto sales soared by 20 percent in February.
 
A.T. & T., Beyond the Telegraph
Imagine if operators had to say, "Thank you for using the American Telephone and Telegraph Company." That mouthful of a name is clearly out of place in this 90's world of sleek, lean and quick. So last week the company said it would slim down to fit the age, and it came up with a short, catchy new name. But it's not one the public will have much trouble getting used to: it's "AT & T." Anyone listening over at the International . . . Business . . . Machines (take a breath here) . . . Corporation?
 
Newton: Apple Tries Again
Is a hand-held computer, one that can do parlor tricks like turning handwriting into print, what this troubled world really needs? Several years ago, Apple Computer decided it was -- and the company put a lot of effort into creating the Newton Messagepad. John Sculley, the chairman, promised great things for the Newton, but it fell far short of his dreams -- its flaws even became the butt of jokes -- and he has since departed, not exactly in triumph. But last week Apple tried again, introducing an updated Newton -- and hopes it's on the right track. It's cheaper ($599 vs. $799), slimmer, can do more tricks, and has more software. It's what Apple "should have introduced to begin with," one consultant said. But, still, the world will be a less spicy place if epic deals are not scrawled on napkins.
 
Balanced Budgets: Catchy Idea
A balanced budget: it's something Americans understand. Those idiots in Washington, they reason, shouldn't spend money they don't have. Lawmakers, of course, know it's a lot more complicated. George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, said many lawmakers in both parties told him that a balanced-budget amendment was a bad idea and they backed it only to get re-elected. On a secret ballot, he said, backers of such "political posturing" wouldn't even get a majority. Last week, the amendment fell short of the necessary two-thirds Senate vote -- 63 to 37 -- and Mr. Mitchell pronounced it dead for this year. Bob Dole still vowed, "It's going to happen." But wasn't it his party's Presidents who ran up a lot of those bills in the first place?
 
Keeping a Campaign Promise
It's a time-honored rule of politics: Promise them a tax cut; do the math later. Christine Todd Whitman made such a promise her rallying cry, and voters believed her. Last week New Jersey's new Governor started to make good on that pledge, as the state Senate approved her plan to cut the income tax 5 percent. The cut sends a "powerful message," Mrs. Whitman said. It's half a message, though, until she decides how she'll pay the bills. And it's a decidedly muted message: for those who make less than $40,000, the windfall is about $24 a year. They can replace those well-used snow shovels.
 
In Denver, Waiting for Baggage
Airport luggage. Even in the best of times, it can make grown travelers cry. But imagine the uproar if a snazzy, high-tech system were to go haywire at a huge airport, leaving thousands without toothbrushes and teddy bears. That kind of nightmare the new Denver International Airport does not need, so after its computerized baggage system misfired in a test, officials delayed the opening until May 15. The airport, the nation's largest, had been due to open this week. But it was also supposed to open in October. And in December.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Waving a Fist at Japan
President Clinton has this thing about Japan. Even with the domestic economy humming along, he's not going to rest till that stubborn nation welcomes American goods with open arms. Last week he really rattled his saber, signing an order reviving the dreaded "Super 301," giving him power to slap 100 percent tariffs on Japanese goods on a moment's notice. Never mind that the head of a world trade group called the move "misguided and dangerous." Never mind that he's raised the specter of a trade war. Mr. Clinton seems willing to risk a lot.
 
U.S. Gives Europe the Jitters
When the United States rubs its temples, the whole world starts popping Tylenol. With the recent whiffs of American inflation, European stock markets have proven very jittery, for any rise in interest rates will make stocks less attractive, especially in riskier markets. So at the latest inflation alert last week the markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt were hit hard, continuing a recent slide.
 
The Lighter Side of Mercedes
A "Swatchmobile"? Built by Mercedes? It's true: Mercedes and the trendy Swiss watchmaker announced an odd alliance last week to build a tiny, cheap two-seater. A sort of dinghy on wheels to sit by the serious machines.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Selling Is Hard When There Are No Buyers

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
THE world's economies are hardly in synch, and government economic policies vary widely. But you wouldn't know that from looking at the markets around the world. They have been sinking in remarkable unison for a month.
The slide has caused more pain in bonds than in stocks, and has been worst in the so-called emerging markets -- already being dubbed "submerging markets" by Wall Street wags. It has been deeper in Europe than in America, so you might say that this nation has been the winner. You would have lost less with your money here than almost anywhere except Japan. There, now, don't you feel better already? 
 What all these markets have in common are not valuation levels, or inflation outlooks, or monetary policy changes, or any of the other things that analysts tend to point to when trying to explain why markets went up and down. Increasingly, the common element is players, many of them American firms.
It is not clear what set off the slide, which began after markets around the world peaked in the first week of February. But after it got going, one firm after another decided that perhaps it was wise to get a little more conservative. Hedge funds, most of which had great years last year, had bet heavily on lower interest rates in most major countries. They had borrowed heavily to buy bonds, and when prices began to fall they rushed to sell. The market makers, many of them American banks and brokerage houses, soon had bought all they wanted. As they tried to sell, they found no buyers. Liquidity dried up and prices fell.
The worst may be over. Certainly the dramatic reversal in the American stock market Wednesday looked like a bottom. With luck, there will have been no fatalities, only a lot of bruised egos stemming from the discovery that markets, which had mysteriously created wealth for players the world over, can withdraw it just as rapidly.
It will probably be some time before liquidity returns to smaller and newer markets, and even now it is not clear whether some player or other still has big, unrecognized losses, perhaps from some imperfect hedge that went awry.
There is a search on in Europe for the villain that caused the sudden rise in interest rates. The central banks seem to be out to nail the hedge funds, notwithstanding their large losses, as the culprit. In 1992 and 1993, the hedge funds got rich selling overvalued currencies to the central banks, which had to buy to support a foolish European exchange rate mechanism. That fact may have something to do with their current vilification.
The real villain is overconfidence. All the money that banks made in proprietary trading the last couple of years left them expecting to earn 100 percent or more on the capital invested in the business. So they invested more capital, and had bigger positions to lose when markets turned. Japan was one country where relatively little American capital had been bet on a bull market, and that is probably one reason why it fell the least.

HEADLINE: Profile;
In Quest for Electric Cars, He Adds the Power of Faith

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Mass.

 BODY:
James Worden built his first electric car in the seventh grade -- if you don't count his earlier attempts, made with Legos, an Erector set or whatever was handy. This had a sturdy wooden frame, "something you could ride on, that wouldn't fall apart under you," he said.
By the 10th grade, Mr. Worden had built several cars "that only went in the road for short periods, between when police cars passed by." Eventually he built one he could take on the streets legally. It absorbed enough energy through solar cells on its roof and hood to take him to high school and back, in Arlington, Mass. 
 Not that the point was to get to school. "School was my distraction," he said. "This is my work."
Now he's 26, and electric cars are his life. He is chief executive of a company called Solectria, which has sold about 70 electric cars since late 1991, and has orders for 50 more.
Solectria's strong points include 18 employees with a variety of mechanical and electronic skills and a back room where an engineer is planning an electric car from scratch. But its main strength is simply a belief that electric cars are not a possibility for the future, but a reality now.
They are not perfect, but they run cleanly and in many cases with considerable pep. And wherever they go, they attract curious crowds. Mr. Worden calls them "magic."
The giants of the auto industry say electric cars don't go far enough, or fast enough, and are too expensive to build. But the growth of Mr. Worden's company seems to tell a different story. It is privately held and does not disclose precise numbers, but grossed about $2 million last year, double the figure from the year before, and hopes to do $4 million in business this year. And it has already outgrown the 20,000-square-foot shop and office suite here in Wilmington that it moved into just two years ago, and is looking for someplace three or four times as large.
True, his company is small, but it is one of the few car companies in North America that are hiring. There were 10 employees last fall; soon, the number will hit 20.
On a recent drive through this outer suburb of Boston, Mr. Worden drove a Force, a converted Geo Metro that is soon to be part of a demonstration project run by Massachusetts to lease electric cars by the month to commuters.
As he drove, Mr. Worden reeled off some objections to electric cars -- and answered them.
Batteries perform badly when cold, so electric cars won't run in cold weather, skeptics say. But the Force draws current from a wall outlet overnight, keeping the batteries at optimum temperature.
They may work in California, critics say, but in New England passengers will freeze. But the Force's heat keeps the passenger compartment toasty, and the heat comes on immediately, while in a conventional car there is no heat until the engine warms up. True, turning on the heat cuts down the driving range, but Mr. Worden says the penalty is small and will not affect a typical commute.
The car can't keep up in traffic or accelerate down a highway on-ramp, they say. But the Force performs fine in suburban driving and on Boston-area highways, where the speed limit, by local tradition, is as close to Mach 1 as the driver can manage without colliding with the fool ahead.
AND then there is price; a car that can be outperformed by a Geo Metro but costs twice as much can be a hard sell. But that, too, can be overcome, Mr. Worden says, when various manufacturing horrors are eliminated.
One of these is buying Geo Metros whole, then stripping out useless, but costly, parts -- like the transmission, fuel tank and muffler. But the cars, when converted, run quite well for 60 or 70 miles between charges.
When Mr. Worden graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1989, he founded Solectria with Anita V. Rajan, who was still an undergraduate. She is now president of the company, which is largely staffed with M.I.T. graduates.
The company is probably not the largest producer, especially now that U.S. Electricar, of Sebastopol, Calif., has acquired some smaller makers. But it has a strong reputation in a close-knit industry, and a table in the lobby is jammed with trophies for endurance and speed.
At the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium, a Boston-based organization largely financed by the Federal Government to promote electric cars, Sheila Lynch, the executive director, said that when engineers enter a race, their goal is usually to break one of Mr. Worden's records.
Mr. Worden tries to keep visitors from getting a glimpse of his office, because every surface, including the floor, is strewn with electrical components. His hands sometimes look out of place unless they are tinkering with the guts of an electric car.
"He's the one who has the real faith," said Gill A. Pratt, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at M.I.T. and a consultant at Solectria.
Lots of companies in the past have had faith and a great deal of optimism, hardly ever justified. But now electric cars are at a critical moment. The Clean Air Act of 1990 requires companies that operate fleets of vehicles to buy some that run on alternative fuels, and puts the stiffest requirements on energy companies.
Many of those will use compressed natural gas, but the electric utilities will not -- if they can help it. So they are buying electric cars, and many are turning to Solectria.
Companies that make batteries and related equipment, eager for a test bed for their products, are also buying either cars or drivetrains, which Solectria also sells. Various large corporations that are quietly pursuing electric vehicle research have also bought cars or drivetrains for testing, Solectria says.
So far, hardly any buyers have bought the cars for personal use, although there are many inquiries. "We don't not sell to the general public," said Mark A. Kopec, vice president for marketing and sales. But Solectria prefers buyers who run fleets over predictable routes, he said, and have some in-house engineering support. And the price -- $26,050 for the basic model -- is hardly attractive except for field testing.
But California has approved a program of ever-tightening regulations on car emissions, and beginning with the 1998 model year, 2 percent of each car maker's sales must be electric vehicles. Massachusetts and New York have adopted the same rules.
Because of heavy lobbying by oil companies and domestic car makers, there is some doubt, even at Solectria, that California will hold to this requirement. But if it does, a leading car company might buy Solectria's technology, or ask Solectria to produce cars for sale under the larger company's nameplate.
Or, said Mr. Kopec, one big manufacturer might enter the market directly, with or without the California rules. If that happens, the optimistic prediction is that Solectria, far more nimble than larger companies, would be able to find a new niche, perhaps a specific kind of electric car. The less optimistic view is that it would resemble a scene from the film "Godzilla Meets Bambi," with Solectria getting second billing.
Solectria is not waiting for the regulations to take effect, though, and does not expect any magic bullets that will suddenly make its product indispensable.
Indeed, some factors are making electric cars look less attractive. Mr. Worden recently returned from Atlanta, where a Chevy pickup he converted to electric power set a record for most miles traveled in 24 hours. But on the trip he was dismayed to see gasoline selling for 89.9 cents a gallon -- less, he said, than he used to pay for a gallon of distilled water to top off lead-acid batteries. New batteries are sealed, with no water inside, but it will take more improvements than that to make electric cars competitive strictly on price.
INSTEAD, the company is designing a car from the ground up. The project, in a back room that visitors are allowed only to glimpse, has a $1.13 million budget, provided by the Pentagon and Boston Edison.
The idea is to build something designed for electricity. The Geo Metro, for example, is fairly lightweight, but, for lack of space, batteries must be mounted in two different locations, requiring cabling between them.
And in a gasoline car, heat is a waste product, so heating passengers is a trivial task. In an electric car, heat is precious. So the new design will have a well-insulated passenger compartment, which engineers say is not too hard to build in as long as they are rethinking the whole car.
All that is needed to see the electric car as practical is an independent mind, say engineers here.
"If I can sell you a gasoline car or an electric car," Dr. Pratt said, "it will bias my thinking on the question 'Is there anybody out there who will buy a battery-powered car?' " Companies that make conventional cars, he said, play a "zero-sum game," because selling one electric car means selling one less gasoline car. There is no change in total sales.
Solectria, meanwhile, badly needs a sales increase to achieve economies of scale that will bring down the price. Its parts would be cheap, Dr. Pratt said, if they could be mass-produced, but every part that must be built by hand can add hundreds of dollars to the car's cost.
Solectria wants to get away from that as a company, but Mr. Worden still likes to get his hands in the cars. Trying to get a company running, he now limits himself to two races a year, but at the annual Tour de Sol, a multiday road rally for solar and electric cars, he is often found working night after night on his own cars. He also works on those of his rivals, because he has sold components to most of them and he wants to see everyone make it across the finish line -- behind him, of course.
Racing, he said, could easily take up more time than it should. But "it's in my blood," he said.
 
 
 
A GEO, PLEASE (HOLD THE ENGINE)
 PRODUCING specialized parts by hand is hard, but Solectria has also done the opposite, turning some highly sophisticated parts into cheap commodities, notably engines from Geo Metros. Because Solectria has to buy the whole car, it must remove parts worth thousands of dollars. Mechanics drain the fluids and carefully box each set; stacked five high, they reach nearly to the shop ceiling.
There is not much secondary market, Solectria says, because the engines on Geo Metros don't often require replacement. The company has sold a few to dealers for parts.
But the biggest disposal method is to give them away with purchases, as if they were trading stamps or Ginsu knives. Schools and colleges that buy a Force or buy a drivetrain, intending to convert a car on their own, get an engine free, for teaching purposes.
Such are the hurdles of producing a product the Big Three say cannot be reasonably built. But Solectria is now in negotiations to buy the cars without engines; it hopes to have a deal with G.M. by June.

Gauging Workfare's Employability

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE verdict is in: welfare doesn't work. Officials from President Clinton on down are vowing to create programs that require welfare recipients to work. In the argot of the movement, "only work works."
But moving from work promises to work programs is harder than it sounds. A record 15 million people now receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal program. Ten million are children. Of the five million adults, 95 percent are single women. Few have the kind of skills or experience attractive to private employers.
President Clinton has vowed to send Congress his work bill this spring. He has said it will expand training programs for welfare recipients and require those unemployed after two years to join a work program. But what kind of work? How long will the jobs last? What will happen, at the program's end, to those that have found no private jobs? What, without welfare, will sustain them? 
 "Work gives purpose and structure to our lives," said President Clinton in a Christmas Day address.
But as his work program takes shape, there are three questions that have attracted little attention:
<HBWhat about the children?
 Work proposals used to collide with the argument that young children need their mothers in the home. Day care was considered an unreliable, potentially harmful option. But the Administration plans to enroll mothers of 1-year-olds.
One reason for the changed attitude is that most middle-class mothers now hold jobs. If they have to work, the argument goes, then poorer mothers ought to work too.
There is also a sense that many welfare mothers, themselves young and uneducated, don't do a good job in the home. Work, the theory holds, will set a positive example.
But with a family values movement now pushing all parents to spend more time with their children, some advocates say poor women are also needed in the home. That is especially the case when home is surrounded by drugs, crime, gangs and other lethal lures. "There's such a double standard here," said David S. Liederman, director of the Child Welfare League of America.
Much depends upon the type of day care available. Noting the high costs involved, skeptics worry that poor women will be forced to choose between unreliable relatives and large, underfinanced public centers.
Pat Ruggles, an economist with the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, worries that bad day care will impede poor children, both intellectually and emotionally. "They're not going to develop into the kinds of people who can go out and get jobs," she said.
 
Where will the jobs come from?
 No one knows how many jobs a work program will need. A preliminary Administration estimate suggested the number could grow as high as 2.3 million.
But officials at the Department of Health and Human Services sharply dispute that figure. They argue that with improved training, expanded tax credits and universal health care most welfare recipients will find jobs on their own.
Perhaps, but the record is discouraging. The most successful training program yet studied, in Riverside, Calif., only reduced the welfare rolls by about 10 percent.
The Administration now argues that between 500,000 and a million people will hit the two-year limit. But even a work program of that size is an enormous undertaking.
Unions loathe such programs: why pay a unionized janitor $10 an hour, if a welfare recipient will work for the minimum wage? And politicians fear a big Government jobs program will prove costly and inefficient.
Supporters recall the Works Progress Administration: it built highways, airports, and bridges during the Great Depression.
Others are haunted by a more contemporary example, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act. It created 750,000 jobs during the late 1970's, but many were considered boondoggles.
A confidential report for the Department of Health and Human Services sounded a note of caution. After surveying local officials, it concluded that creating 500,000 jobs was possible, but beyond that "the merely 'daunting' became the positively 'dubious.' "
"Expanding the program to 1 million slots was viewed as highly problematic," the report concluded, describing local officials as "tinged with trepidation."
 
Will real jobs soon follow?
 The theory is that a year's stint in a work program will build character, add skills and flesh out a resume. But the evidence gives reason to pause.
There were three well-known work programs for welfare recipients in the mid-1980's, in San Diego, West Virginia, and Cook County, Ill. Only the San Diego program led people to earn more money on their own. And the difference was modest.
In the 15 months after leaving the program, participants earned an average of only $3,802. That was 23 percent higher than people who had not joined the program. But it is nowhere near enough to support a family.
The author Mickey Kaus, an advocate of a large Government jobs program, argued that the studies posed the wrong question. The greater value of work programs, he said, is their ability to deter future generations from having children they cannot support.
"If people have to work for their welfare checks, maybe fewer people will go on welfare in the first place," he said.

Trade War Isn't So Swell Either

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE only people ever killed in a trade war were the ones who died of boredom. But you would never know it from the language Japanese and American officials use today. The entire lexicon of the trade conflict between Washington and Tokyo comes straight out of the Marine Corps field handbook. It is a crazy mix of Clausewitz and the current account; Adam Smith does arms control. One almost expects United States trade negotiators and their Japanese counterparts to show up at the table in camouflage fatigues and shout: "Ready! Aim! Sanction!"
I thought my days covering wars ended when I stopped reporting from Beirut. But then I became a trade reporter. These bureaucrats are dangerous. Sure, being a trade war correspondent is a lot less lethal than the military version. But if words could kill, the battlefields between Japan and the United States would be littered with negotiators in pinstripe uniforms, bludgeoned to death by briefcases. Just pick out any of the business headlines from the last few weeks: There is talk of "fortress Japan," "tactical retreats," and the Japanese bureaucrats as "the real enemy." One top American trade negotiator, Charlene Barshefsky, is actually known to colleagues as "Stonewall Barshefsky," for her ability to say no to her Japanese interlocutors. 
 Last week the Clinton Administration unsheathed its latest trade weapon, the Super 301, which sounds ominously like a long-range gun, but is actually a trade law that empowers the President to draw up a hit list of countries, like Japan, that block American imports and to quickly sanction them with tariffs if they don't stop. The Administration's communique on Super 301 said the law contains an "early warning system" to notify countries that they are about to go on the hit list. Early warning system? What is this, NATO? I almost expected some announcer to say on the radio: "This is a test of the Trade Early Warning System. For the next 30 seconds you will hear a siren. In the event of a real onslaught of excessive Japanese imports, walk, don't run, to your nearest department store and buy only American-made goods. This is a test."
During the arms control talks, the motto of American negotiators dealing with the Soviets was "Trust but verify." In the trade wars their motto has become "Trust but quantify." At arms control summits reporters asked: "Who blinked?" At trade war summits reporters ask: "Who paid?"
Covering a real war, any bulletproof vest will do. Covering a trade war, reporters don't care much about the vest, but they sure are interested in the label -- to know where it was made, what the tariff rate was on the kevlar and whether American vests have the same shelf space in the Mitsukoshi department store as the Japanese models do in Sears.
During trade tensions in 1987 the Sankei Shimbun, a conservative Japanese daily, wrote: "In a few months the yen soared from 245 to the dollar to 200. This was the equivalent of Japan's loss of four aircraft carriers at Midway. Washington's final objective is probably an exchange rate of 100 yen to the dollar. That represents Japan's total defeat and Gen. Douglas MacArthur's triumphant entry into Tokyo. We must not lose the Pacific war twice."
James Fallows, author of several works on Japan, notes that the Japanese have viewed economic matters as having strategic importance since the 1850's, when they saw what happened to China -- how a great civilization could be colonized, divided and debauched by foreigners. The lesson the Japanese drew, said Mr. Fallows, was "not that the Westerners were better, but that they had better machinery. The Japanese came to believe that the crucial element for Japanese independence was that they must industrialize. Ever since then it has been natural for them to perceive economic development as central to their national security."
With the end of the cold war, the United States too has come to see economic power as a much more integral part of national security. Mr. Clinton is particularly fond of quoting Lester Thurow's book "Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan, Europe and America." While Mr. Clinton has acted tentatively in the role of commander-in-chief in places like Bosnia, he has behaved with energy and a real sense of purpose in the role of salesman-in-chief. A French airline industry official, still chafing over the $6 billion order Saudi Arabia placed for American commercial jets after intense lobbying by Mr. Clinton, was quoted by Reuters as saying that "the way the Saudi order was obtained shocked people in Europe," and that the Europeans won't accept "defeat" quietly.
One problem with this martial language is that it can be very misleading. In the 1980's people wrote about Japanese financial institutions buying up property in the United States like an army "seizing" territory. But the stories overlooked the underlying mismanagement in Japanese banks, which were grossly overpaying for those properties and are now suffering as a result. Another problem with these fighting words is that they obscure a major difference between trade wars and real wars. In trade wars almost every sword is double-edged. That is, because of the degree to which the Japanese and American economies are intertwined -- $155 billion a year in merchandise trade between the two -- it is very hard for the United States to hit Japan with sanctions without hurting American consumers, retailers or manufacturers, who depend on Japanese products, and vice versa. That is why Paul R. Krugman, professor of economics at M.I.T., likes to say: "A trade war is a conflict in which each side uses most of its ammunition to shoot itself in the foot."
That is also why many journalists are now asking: What if they gave a trade war and nobody came? For all the talk about punitive tariffs being slapped on Japan by Mr. Clinton, both Tokyo and Washington seem to be adopting a cautious, go-slow approach, because they understand that even wars that start small can get out of control once nationalist sentiments are inflamed.
But then some would say that all this talk about avoiding a trade war assumes that the United States and Japan have not been in one up to now. The fact is, says Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a trade economist, "We've been in a trade war with Japan for 20 years, and losing. It's been mostly low-intensity conflict. The Japanese side has understood that element of conflict from the beginning and organized itself accordingly. We've been playing touch football and they have been playing hockey. What's new is that we are finally all playing by the same rules."

When in the Course of Events It Is Time to Pillory Someone

 BODY:
THOMAS PAINE exhorted American revolutionaries with his little pamphlets. Thomas Nast skewered politicians with his caricatures. Now there is a computer-age hybrid of these distinct traditions of American free speech, thanks in many cases to the economies of desktop publishing. A flock of small, colorful new political journals -- some often strident or tasteless but others frequently funny, thoughtful or probing -- have taken their place outside the big-media mainstream, and on both sides of the political spectrum.
Following the model of the now-defunct Quayle Quarterly, many focus on political personalities. They include the image-deflating Perot Periodical, based in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, the sympathetic but frequently whimsical Hillary Clinton Quarterly of Concord, N.H., The Flush Rush Quarterly of San Diego and the scabrous lampoon Slick Times of Valley Center, Calif. 
 Here is a sampling of excerpts.
 
Perot's Motive
 From an article by Robert Fitch in The Perot Periodical, Fall 1993:
When Ross Perot first began running for the Presidency, The Wall Street Journal suggested some possible movie models for the campaign. One was the simple-minded gardener in "Being There" who becomes a Presidential contender by uttering platitudes that sound deep but say nothing. Another was Jimmy Stewart in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," the pure idealist who triumphs over corrupt insiders. Or perhaps, given his penchant for finding anti-Perot plotters everywhere, Captain Queeg in "The Caine Mutiny."
But after Clinton's first 200 days, with Perot still in continuous campaign mode, the aptest cinematic model of all appears to be "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre." Perot's wealth has been recently estimated at anywhere from $2.4 to $3.5 billion. The most common figure cited is $3.2 billion. However many billions Ross really owns, he has made a staggering amount of money -- probably more than $250 million -- as a giant dividend from his campaigning. And that's just the amount he's earned since the November election.
How does Perot turn the straw of political rhetoric into the gold of financial net worth? . . .
Last fall, many Perot detractors saw the $65 million he spent on his campaign as a colossal vanity, a billionaire's self indulgence. Now, along with the grass roots United We Stand America movement, it turns out to have been a kind of prudent portfolio insurance -- one that's paid off wildly.
To figure out Perot's game, though, you have to understand what chips he's playing with. Bonds. Most probably, Ross Perot owns more than any individual in America. Simply put, his politics are about preserving and augmenting the value of his billions in bonds.
In May of 1992, Perot filed history's hugest financial disclosure report to the Federal Election Commission -- 123 pages, more appropriate to a mutual fund than a man. What surprised some, beyond the sheer size of Perot's assets, was their makeup: the prophet of American industrial revival was betting heavily it would never happen.
According to Citizens for Tax Justice's Robert McIntyre, only about 8 percent of Perot's holdings were held in any U.S. common stocks at all. Over three-quarters were invested in bonds, mostly tax-free municipals. Surprised commentators for The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times questioned Perot's top-heavy emphasis on bonds, especially tax-exempts. But as Howard Stein, chairman of Dreyfus Corporation, said at the time, "If you had a couple of billion dollars, you'd do the same thing -- a lot of tax-free income, rest and relax."
Two worries, however, keep giant bond-holders from relaxing completely: economic growth and budget deficits. Both create a demand for credit. More borrowing sends interest rates up and bond prices down.
Clinton's commitment during the Presidential campaign to a big economic stimulus program must have scared Ross. By creating a new, well-defined swing vote constituency for a Herbert Hoover-style deficit reduction program, Perot's faux populist campaign helped turn the Clinton Administration away from its early economic growth agenda . . . The $20 billion stimulus package proposed by Clinton in February kept shrinking until it had been transformed into a $500 billion deficit reduction program.
The bond markets, as Clinton kept telling us, were ecstatic with the change in direction. As yields dropped, bond prices reached all-time highs. According to Fidelity Fund's Virginia Marans, municipal bonds have grown in value at an annual rate of 13 percent. Perot holds about $2 billion worth. If you take the appreciation in their value since November, when bonds began to rally, he's made 12 percent, or $240 million alone. Add the gains from Ross's approximately $360 million in taxable bonds -- about 11 percent of his $3.2 billion portfolio. The Lehman Brothers Treasury Index has gone up more than 20 percent since the election, so that would add another $70 million to Ross's pot. His approximately quarter-billion dollars' worth of stocks would have appreciated about 14 percent -- tack on another $40 million. Which leaves the 11 percent of his portfolio invested in real estate. Real estate is down -- let's say he's lost exactly what he has gained from his investments in everything but municipal bonds. Ross would still be about a quarter billion ahead.
Of course, it's conceivable that Perot has drastically changed his investment strategy, liquidating his two billion in tax-exempt municipal bonds and pouring the money into industrial America. But if he has done this there is no evidence for it. When asked for clarification, Sharon Holman, Perot's spokeswoman, said, "I have no knowledge of Mr. Perot's finances."

 
Once More, With Feeling

A ditty from "The Hillary Clinton Songbook" in the Fall 1993 issue of The Hillary Clinton Quarterly (to the tune of "Yankee Doodle"):
Hillary and Bill rode into town,
Along with Al and Tipper,
And swore they'd clean the messes
Left by Georgie and the Gipper.
(Chorus)
Beltway gridlock blocked the way,
Congress thinks it's dandy,
Cause vested interests feed their PACs
They keep excuses handy.
(Verse)
The next big battle's looming up
And Hillary's the fall guy,
For health care funding is an issue
Everyone's appalled by.
(Chorus)
Hillary is going to say:
"Together we're all in it,"
So coverage can cover all,
Your treatment must have limits."
(Verse)
You're taking heat but we all know,
Your master plan is evident,
When voters see your guts they'll know
A woman can be President.
(Chorus)
Hillary don't give it up,
We all know your plan's wise,
Yankee Doodle had a hat,
But you will have a franchise.

 
Good for the Gander

 From The Flush Rush Quarterly, Summer 1993:
Rush Limbaugh says banning his humor is "political cleansing" and should not be tolerated. Rush sees nothing wrong with comparing the President's daughter to George Bush's dog Millie. He has no problem mocking Secretary of Labor Robert Reich because of his height . . . He can question the gender of Janet Reno without hesitation. Rush has proven he can dish it out. But can he take it?
Jay Leno, during his "Tonight" show monologue, told a joke about "Dan's Bake Sale," a publicity stunt set up by Limbaugh and the E.I.B. [Excellence in Broadcasting] gang. In referring to the 20,000 people who showed up, Leno said, "The last time this many conservatives gathered in one place was Berlin in 1935."
Great stuff, Jay!
The next day, Rush whimpered that he wasn't really a Nazi and that he was hurt that Leno would imply he was. . . . Rush "Femi-Nazi" Limbaugh was deeply offended.
More shocking than Rush Limbaugh's intolerance for satire was an announcement by Rush that Leno had called him to apologize! Isn't such a thing unprecedented in the history of comedy/ satire? We called the "Tonight" show and they did confirm that Jay called Rush, but they wouldn't disclose what was said.
Could Jay have apologized as Limbaugh claims? You make the call.

How Does the World Look Through the Eyes Of Aspiring Terrorists?

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
IN preparation for the first anniversary of the World Trade Center bombing late last month, the New York Police Department sent bomb-sniffing dogs to survey landmarks like the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty and other likely targets of terrorism. The dogs hunted inside but made a special survey of the perimeters, partly as a show, said John F. Timoney, the chief of police. "It was to let them know, whoever 'they' are, that we haven't forgotten," he said.
Although the World Trade Center explosion has not been followed by similar acts of terror -- the police broke up a cell that was planning additional bombings around the 4th of July, at the Hudson River tunnels, the Federal Building in lower Manhattan, and other targets -- Chief Timoney said that he suspected the terrorists might still "be looking to make their mark." 
 On Friday, a Federal jury delivered verdicts of guilty against four men accused in the World Trade Center case. But larger issues -- like how a society can protect itself from terrorists -- remain unresolved.
As the United States, the only surviving superpower, tries to create peace in the Middle East and Bosnia, some experts think the potential for terrorism is rising. When a gunman opened fire last week on a van of Hasidic students driving across the Brooklyn Bridge, the first word in many people's minds was "terrorism," though so far there is no evidence of a plot.
The World Trade Center explosion, frequently described as the worst act of terrorism on American soil, was a warning that the United States is more vulnerable than many experts had assumed. But what should officials be doing?
A year after the bombing, surprisingly few security changes are evident. But there has been some rethinking, an attempt to get into the minds of terrorists and try to anticipate what constitutes an attractive target, and what does not.
The blast has shattered several assumptions, some stated and some nearly subliminal. There was a sense among law-enforcement and security experts that it would be impossible to assemble and deliver a bomb weighing three-quarters of a ton without doing something that would attract suspicion; that is gone now.
There was also the idea that bombing big buildings like the World Trade Center would not move public opinion in a way that would help the bomber's cause. But the public in this country may not be the audience. In the World Trade Center case, New York may have found itself in the unaccustomed position of being the stage for someone else's drama. Thomas G. Weiss, associate director of the Thomas J. Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University, said the explosion was aimed as much at Egyptian dissidents as at the American public.
Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at the Rand Corp., said the message read like this: "Four 'amateurs' with readily available, commercially produced materials, can build a bomb for under $400 that kills six people, causes untold millions of dollars in losses and generates endless publicity." Hitting a high-profile target shows, he said, "that to a large extent, anybody can be a terrorist."
The Trade Center bomb was the equivalent of a black eye or a bloody nose, meant for all to see, not a blow to the solar plexus, meant to knock an opponent down. For the country as a whole, the solar plexus would include electricity dispatch centers, oil pipelines or nuclear plants -- targets not designed to withstand serious attack.
At one electric utility control center, the official in charge said that since the bombing, he had added cameras and motion detectors, but mostly to protect against burglaries. "At any industrial plant, somebody can bring a delivery truck up to your loading dock and you don't know what's in it," he said. A bombing is a "low-probability, high-impact event, certainly, but very difficult to do anything with," he said. "The idea is not to call attention to yourself."
What might be called the "obscurity defense" is in full swing at the Colonial Pipeline, which runs from Houston to the New York area and supplies about half the refined oil products used in the Northeast. With branches, it totals 5,300 miles, making it essentially unguardable, although it can be surveyed by air and by electronic means. The World Trade Center case was "not really perceived by us as a threat to the system," said Noel L. Griese, a spokesman.
But terrorism need not involve bombs or even violence. An opponent bent on widespread disruption, rather than symbolism, might try computer sabotage. Recalling a computer glitch at a New York bank last month that debited depositors' accounts twice for each withdrawal they made, Mr. Weiss suggested, a terrorist could find a smart computer programmer and "wreak havoc." As recent history shows, the system is not safe from domestic hackers, let alone trained agents of a foreign power.
Nuclear plants have relied on a kind of obscurity defense, too. But the Trade Center case may force some rethinking. Police believe one man convicted in the bombing wrote a letter sent to The New York Times last year threatening a variety of structures, including "nuclear targets." In an unrelated incident, a former mental patient drove his station wagon through the gate at Three Mile Island a few days before the Trade Center attack, crashed through a fence and a roll-up door, and drove 60 feet into the building that leads to the control room.
Now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is not sure what rules to impose. Going against the common wisdom, the Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington-based non-proliferation group, argues that terrorists are likely to pick "soft targets," that is, lightly defended ones, a category that includes reactors.
One positive lesson learned in the year after the bombing is that the best strategy is a forward defense. The July 4th bombings were pre-empted by lawmen who burst into a bomb factory. Last April four Palestinians were indicted in Washington for plotting to blow up the Israeli embassy.
Chief Timoney meets with corporate security chiefs about once every three weeks. He has no trouble holding their attention, but vigilance in society at large is tougher. Everyone was worried in the period leading up to the American attack on Iraq in 1991, he said, but once the attack began, people seemed to lose interest.
"We do continuously have liaison with all the different Federal, state and local authorities," said Nestor Michnyak, a spokesman for the F.B.I. "Do we have any different, modified response? No, is the bottom line."
"We respond -- that's the problem," he said. "We can offer advice on what we're finding, based on experience and what history is showing, but everybody is responsible for themselves."

HEADLINE: THE WHITEWATER INQUIRY: White House Memo;
Inquiry Is Putting First Lady At Center of Ethics Questions

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
Subpoenas and suspicions are flying. Everybody in Washington and Arkansas suddenly seems to be investigating and blaming everybody else. The President is having troubles, again, and the First Lady is not just a supportive spouse, standing by her man with a glazed smile. Hillary Rodham Clinton, herself, is smack at the heart of the matter.
Bernard W. Nussbaum, the First Lady's old friend and mentor, was pushed off the sled of state today, following President Clinton's admission that the White House counsel had made improper contacts to review the status of a confidential Federal investigation into an Arkansas savings and loan related to the Whitewater affair. 
 But if Mr. Nussbaum sinned, some contend, it was only in being too loyal to his prince and princess.
"There's no evidence he's done anything contrary to the Clintons' direction," said William Kristol, the director of the Project for the Republican Future. "The Clintons have an extraordinary inability to distinguish public from private, official from personal."
 
Using Classic Defense
 Today, senior Clinton aides tried to invoke a Washington version of the classic Becket defense, saying that while the Clintons may have wanted to be rid of their meddlesome problems, they did not want the rules broken. Mr. Nussbaum, who has been quoted as saying that he felt he had two clients -- Bill and Hillary Clinton -- "sometimes went the extra mile as a way of ingratiating himself with Hillary, even though that was not always what she wanted," said a Clinton aide.
Problems are piling up for the First Lady. Mrs. Clinton and the three lawyers she brought to top jobs in the Administration -- Mr. Nussbaum; Vincent W. Foster Jr., his deputy who committed suicide last summer, and Associate Attorney General Webster L. Hubbell -- are enmeshed in embarrassing ethical questions.
The Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark., where Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Foster and Mr. Hubbell were partners, is being investigated by the special prosecutor for Whitewater about document shredding and Government contracts in savings and loan cases. And, making matters even stickier, the firm has begun its own inquiry into whether Mr. Hubbell overbilled clients and misused money.
On top of all that, the health care plan that the First Lady developed and shepherded is losing public support because many Americans see it as too complicated and intrusive. And her younger brother, Hugh Rodham, is trading on her name in a stumbling bid for the United States Senate in Florida.
Mrs. Clinton's mood is not likely to be lightened by the agonizing over the departure of Mr. Nussbaum. The counsel's friends said that the First Lady had talked to him with concern in the last few days about face-saving ways he could leave the White House.
At times in the last 14 months, Mrs. Clinton has dazzled Washington as she tried to drag a dinosaur role into modern times. She has worked hard to please everyone and satisfy herself, creating an awkward hybrid of comforting old First Lady rituals and unsettling new co-Presidential power structures. But Clinton strategists have always felt there was a risk inherent in the ambiguity of Mrs. Clinton's position: She is exercising power without an official title. She is the first Presidential spouse with her own power base in the White House and her own set of top officials throughout the Government who owe their jobs, and loyalty, to her as much as to her husband.
 
Tangled Lines of Authority
 Even those close to the Clintons complain that this has created confusion, especially in a White House that has a quotidian struggle with tangled lines of authority and the tendency to trip on them.
"It's hard to run a White House with nobody in charge," said an influential Democratic friend of the Clintons. "It's especially hard to run a White House with nobody in charge and two Presidents."
Everyone in the Administration knows that power is centralized at the White House in the hands of Bill and Hillary Clinton. David R. Gergen, hired as the White House troubleshooter, seems too worried lately about his own future to help in this time of trouble. And the weak chief of staff, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, has announced each time the White House was guilty of misusing Federal agencies that he knew nothing about it.
As Senator Bob Dole mocked this week: "Mack McLarty, the chief of staff, has issued a memo: 'You cannot do this anymore because they have caught us.' "
 
Fears of First Lady
 Marlin Fitzwater, the press secretary for President George Bush and spokesman for President Ronald Reagan, said that the blind spots that always exist with regard to a First Lady are intensified when the spouse has such unprecedented power. "The senior staff always fears crossing a First Lady," he said. "Partly, it's the respect for the office of First Lady. Partly, it's a man-woman thing. You're afraid that when she's home with the President, she'll repeat the charges against you every night for the rest of your life."
Many high-ranking Clinton officials confess that on matters from the First Family to health care to Whitewater, they are afraid to challenge Mrs. Clinton, or even to give her honest advice about things they fear are being handled wrong.
"No one wants to tell Bill, or especially Hillary, that they can't do things the way they're used to doing them," explained a top Administration official. "And so many of these people around them are old friends, that you can't just break into the circle."
Even Mr. Fitzwater, far from the reach of the White House, pleaded humorously: "Don't say I said anything bad about Hillary. I'm as scared of her as everyone else."
 
'A Dangerous Pattern'
 The Republicans, who recognize an abuse of executive branch power when they see it and who are desperate to deflate a President buoyed by a strong economy, are yelping.
"A dangerous pattern seems to be emerging," Mr. Dole said on the Senate floor, adding, "No doubt about it, you are asking for big, big trouble and showing some stunningly bad judgment when you start mixing politics with law enforcement."
Mr. Dole took the opportunity to remind everybody of the travel office fiasco last spring, in which Mr. Nussbaum and other White House aides violated the rules and pressured the Federal Bureau of Investigation to attend a strategy meeting and put out a press release helping to justify the White House's peremptory dismissal of travel office staff members.
The self-critical White House report on that debacle disclosed that Mrs. Clinton had strongly supported the original investigation into the travel office, spurred by her Hollywood pal, the producer Harry Thomason, who was upset that his associates in the airline industry were cut out of White House business. The First Lady was informed about the planned dismissals of seven employees two days before the President.
Two months later, law-enforcement officials accused Mr. Nussbaum of impeding their investigation of Mr. Foster's death: He kept from investigators a file on the Clintons' involvement in Whitewater. The night of Mr. Foster's death, Margaret Williams, Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff, was with Mr. Nussbaum as he searched his deputy's office, before police investigators did so.
 
Memories of Watergate
 Several White House officials portrayed Mrs. Clinton, who appears to be more of a central figure than her husband on Whitewater, as the one who held out against the appointment of a special counsel.
Whenever the White House has been accused of bending the rules, officials have pleaded inexperience or protested that they had done nothing wrong, as Mr. Clinton did when the news hit this week that Mr. Nussbaum and Treasury officials had spoken about an investigation concerning the Clintons.
People immediately began commenting on the inherent irony: Hillary Rodham first met Mr. Nussbaum when he was the associate Watergate special prosecutor and he hired her to work on the House Judiciary panel drawing up impeachment charges. So, people wonder, wouldn't two crusading Democratic lawyers who began by watching Richard M. Nixon wither away be especially vigilant about the importance of not abusing the integrity of Federal investigative agencies?
Some Republicans and Administration officials suggest that the Clintons and their inner circle believe that they are the "good guys" who want to help the country, not Republican "bad guys," so their motives should not be questioned so much.
Paul Costello, who worked as a press secretary for Rosalynn Carter when she was First Lady and for Kitty Dukakis during the 1988 campaign, said he believed that Mrs. Clinton was being unfairly targeted because she is the first First Lady "who doesn't apologize for having power and playing the game."
"The price for that in Washington is immolation," Mr. Costello said.
Her friends see her plight as poignant. As one Administration official who is close to the First Lady put it: "She is finally where she wanted to be all her life. And she's not enjoying it. Her father died. Vince Foster died. And she feels her credibility has been badly hurt by the focus on her role in Whitewater."

HEADLINE: New York Exports Its Talent As Demographic Tide Turns

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
New York City has never been a stronger magnet for immigrants from abroad, but the city's pull on other Americans diminished markedly in the late 1980's.
Between 1985 and 1990, nearly twice as many people left the city for other places in the United States as flocked to New York from distant towns, farms and college campuses. 
 New York, like Paris and London, has long thrived on fresh talent from the provinces. The net outflow of this talent is but one of several unexpected findings from a computer analysis of fresh detail from the 1990 Census.
The analysis, conducted for The New York Times by Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge, a Queens College sociologist, fleshed out skeletal detail about the millions of people who moved to, from or within metropolitan New York in the previous five years. Though the Census was conducted in 1990, the trends it brought to light have largely been corroborated by more recent studies, Dr. Beveridge said.
In the second half of the 1980's 860,000 New Yorkers left the city, and half a million of them left the region altogether. Many were pushed by an economic slump that was harsher in metropolitan New York than nationally. That exodus was much greater than in the latter half of the 1970's, when about 350,000 New Yorkers moved away. In the late 1960's, though, at the peak of what was termed white flight from the city, the outflow was larger still.
 
Incubator of Talent
 More than ever, New York City is serving as an incubator of talent for other regions. If captains of industry are not among the city's exports, the second lieutenants of industry clearly are. Talented young people are cutting their teeth in fields as diverse as neurosurgery, advertising and museum management, then leaving to live out their careers elsewhere.
"Young people leave because they get the skills in New York, but you get an opportunity in other markets to blossom," said Christine Barney, who moved to Florida from New York seven years ago. She is now a partner in Bruce Rubin Associates, a public relations firm in Coral Gables. "I'm only 30 years old and I have a private life here that I thought I wouldn't be able to have until I retired."
For most of this century, it has been second nature to many New Yorkers that marriage, maturity and business success are steps on the stairway to the suburbs. Yet the majority of those who left the city in the late 80's bypassed the region altogether to settle elsewhere, often in the South. More moved to Florida than to Long Island. Twice as many chose California as New Jersey and Connecticut combined.
Job prospects, not retirement to warmer havens, were the strongest lure. As always, Florida was heavily favored by retirees from New York City -- one in three settled there. But the vast majority of New Yorkers who moved to Florida -- about three in four -- were younger job-seekers.
And, like waves of whites, more American-born blacks and more Puerto Ricans left the city than arrived, abandoning New York, a traditional haven, for better jobs or more satisfying living elsewhere. Among blacks moving to the South, nearly two-thirds were 35 or younger.
Consider Terry Burton, who was born in New York of parents from Alabama. After graduating from New York University, Mr. Burton was an intern at radio stations in this area before landing a job as a disk jockey in Greenville, S.C., and then another in Atlanta, where he just put down $3,000 to buy a town house.
"Every summer I used to come down South as a kid, and as an adult making it in New York was a big struggle" Mr. Burton said. "I needed somewhere I could breathe.
"I have a New York mentality," he continued. "If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere, so I wasn't afraid of Atlanta. I found another promised land."
 
Arrivals
Making Room For Immigrants
 "There is a striking difference among those who move to New York City, those who stay in New York City, and those who leave," Dr. Beveridge said.
The most notable difference is nationality. The numbers of foreign immigrants to New York have only gone up -- even after 1987, when the recession began and the city lost allure for so many Americans.
"The native-born population is moving out, and the foreign-born population is moving in," Dr. Joseph Salvo, director of the City Planning Department's Population Division, said. "Relative to their country of origin, New York City still offers far more opportunity."
The 860,000 people who left New York City for the rest of the United States, including Puerto Rico, between 1985 and 1990 were replaced by about 815,000 people, more than half of them from abroad: 115,000 of the newcomers came from elsewhere in the region, 270,000 from other places in the 50 states and 428,000 from other countries, mostly in the Caribbean and Asia. (The figures do not distinguish between legal and illegal immigration.)
Because of this influx, the city's net loss from migration during the late 1980's (about 45,000 people) was much smaller than the loss experienced in the final five years of the 1970's (about 350,000), when 620,000 New Yorkers left town. In the entire 1980's the city gained population. Births exceeded deaths and immigrants from overseas replaced many of the people who moved out.
Between 1990 and 1992, though, every borough except Manhattan and Staten Island registered small population losses, the Census Bureau recently estimated. Overall, the New York region grew despite sharp declines in New Haven and Hartford, which lost the equivalent of 1 in 20 people during the two years, and a dip of one-tenth of one percentage point in New York City.
The city still draws young people, of course, including many who grew up within 100 miles of Times Square. More people, including some empty-nesters, moved from Long Island to Manhattan than went the other way. And for all those young people who followed John Babsone Lane Soule's adage (as quoted by Horace Greeley) and went west, nearly 27,000 from California alone relocated in New York City.
"New York City has been a magnet for people who are looking to experience occupational mobility," said Dr. Salvo, the city planner, "and that continues unabated. In the 1980's, New York City did better than other cities in the country, and it was more favorable to the types of jobs that might attract young people."
Annette Mathieu, a 31-year-old sales manager for Liz Claiborne, said she found what she was looking for in New York (including her husband, an architect who was raised in Ohio).
"I moved to New York from Portland, Ore., with two suitcases when I was 22 and just graduated from college, slept on a fold-out bed in a studio apartment and started out at the bottom in sales for a manufacturer," she said. "I love it. I take advantage of it. I'm always energized by it."
Still, among people who moved to the city, nearly one in six came from the surrounding region. Dr. Salvo said newcomers from the suburbs were mainly young people in their 20's or 30's, frequently the children of people who had left the city years earlier.
But increasingly those young people are seeing New York as a way station, not necessarily the pinnacle of success.
 
Departures
Residents Look Beyond Suburbia
 New Yorkers who did leave for the suburbs were more likely to leapfrog the familiar destinations and head instead for semirural spaces on the fringes of metropolitan New York. As many city people moved to Orange County in the Hudson Valley as to Rockland, one county closer to the city. About as many chose Monmouth or Middlesex County in central New Jersey as Bergen County, right across the Hudson.
Among those who moved beyond the region, more New Yorkers relocated to the South Atlantic states than to anyplace else (except those from Manhattan, who tended to migrate to the West). The newcomers to the city from elsewhere in the United States tended to favor the Upper East Side, Murray Hill and Brooklyn Heights. Foreigners generally settled elsewhere, mainly in nonwhite neighborhoods.
"Where do successful Puerto Ricans move?" Dr. Salvo asked rhetorically. "To Queens, to the East Bronx, in a form of suburbanization.
"Real suburbanization still occurs more among whites and Asians," he continued, "because the money is there and the alternatives are not there. Puerto Ricans can go back to Puerto Rico, and for the black population, there is a connection to the South."
The census also found former New Yorkers of Hispanic heritage scattering beyond the suburbs to small but expanding enclaves in neighboring states.
Dr. Beveridge and others have shown that except for isolated pockets, the city and surrounding region remain racially segregated -- the result of a combination of housing discrimination, cost differential and individual preference.
 
The Shuttle
Two-Way Traffic For Puerto Ricans
 That more Puerto Ricans are leaving New York than arriving from the island is a relatively recent trend, although the "air bridge" between Puerto Rico and the mainland has always been well-traveled.
Samuel Quinones, a journalist, said the flow varied with the economy. "When things are bad here and they are good over there, the migration is to New York," said Mr. Quinones, who returned to Puerto Rico most recently two years ago after living on and off in New York. "When things are equal, the migration sort of balances out. And when things are bad in both places, as is the case now, the migration is to the south."
Angelo Falcon, president of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy in New York, agreed. "It's a circular migration and, basically, the reasons are economic," he said. "There's always a tendency when unemployment gets worse that people just leave, and it's almost a tragic return to an island that can't sustain many more people."
Some go home to retire, fueling the "mailbox economy" where they settle with pension and Social Security income. And others, like Wilda Rodriguez, a 47-year-old Puerto Rican-born media consultant who moved back to the island after 11 years in Manhattan, have been untethered by technology.
"This is my country, honey, I'm Puerto Rican," she said by phone from her beachfront house in the Condado resort area. "In New York, to do the things that I like to do, you have to have a lot of money. And you have to set a whole set of rules, precautions and logistics for yourself."
 
Challenges
Migrants Strain City Services
 The churning of more than 300,000 people a year has altered the demand for municipal services. New York City's population is becoming more dependent. Families that left the city reported higher incomes than those who came or stayed. By 1990, the city was home to more young children, more elderly people and more foreigners than when the decade began. That shift further challenges already strained providers of health, transportation, social services and education. Last week the city's public school system reported that enrollment had exceeded one million for the first time in 15 years, largely because of the surge in immigrants.
"A growing cohort of adolescent teen-agers is going to create some unique problems," said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society, a research and advocacy group.
Two of three who left New York City were white, while only half the new arrivals were white (and many of those were Hispanic people). Nearly as many Asians as blacks moved to the city. Among whites, those 18 to 35 years old were the only age group in which more were moving into the city than leaving.
Those who moved to the suburbs from the city were mainly white, 74 percent, compared with 14 percent black and 7 percent Asian.
But the impulse to go farther afield seemed to affect all New Yorkers in like proportions: of the people who remained in the city, 56 percent were white, 28 percent were black and 5 percent were Asian. Those who left the region altogether showed a nearly identical profile: 59 percent were white, 28 percent black, and 6 percent Asian.
In the late 1980's, about 1.4 million people moved into the region, including New York City; about 1.5 million moved out.
 
An Analysis Based On '90 Census Data
 The computer analysis underlying this article was conducted for The Times by Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge, who directs the Program of Applied Social Research at Queens College of the City University of New York. The figures given are projections based on newly released results from questionnaires completed by 1 household in 20 during the 1990 Census.
The analysis examined where people moved to and from and how their differences in income, education, age, race and ethnicity have changed the region. In addition to the five boroughs, metropolitan New York includes portions of three states: Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Putnam, Nassau and Suffolk Counties in New York; much of Fairfield County in Connecticut, and most of Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Passaic, Middlesex, Somerset, Hunterdon and Monmouth Counties in New Jersey.

GRAPHIC: Maps/Graphs: "Leaving New York City from 1985 to 1990" shows number of people moving from the five boroughs to different regions in the United States from 1984 to 1990. Each region's relative height reflects migrants to that area, Manhattanites tended to move to Western states more than people from other boroughs. Those leaving the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island tended to move to the South and Florida in particular. About 10 percent of people over 65 moved out of New York city and largely account for the numbers moving to Florida and the central states. Figures do not include an estimated 55,000 migrant to Puerto Rico. All figures are projections based on a 5 percent sample of the 1990 Census. (Data source: Dr. Andrew Beveridge, Sociology Department, Queens College) (pg. 36)
 
"And Moving Into the Metropolitan Area"
 A total of 1.4 million people moved into the New York City metroplitan area from 1985 to 1990, the Census Bureau estimates, while 1.5 million left the region. Each dot below represents 100 people who moved to the region from other parts of the United States or from abroad. Migration from the suburbs to the city in the 1980's, while 350,000 moved from the city to the suburbs. Each dot is placed within a census boundary that contains roughly 75,000 people. The dots are not meant to locate each group of migrants precisely, but to provide a general locator of residence.

HEADLINE: Georgian Defends Renewed Ties to Ex-Soviet Bloc

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia, March 3

 BODY:
As Eduard A. Shevardnadze prepared for his first visit to Washington as Georgia's President, he said his Government needed to re-establish ties with the other former Soviet republics so it could better respond to the effects of civil war and economic distress.
"We have managed to end our political isolation," he said in an interview, adding that 70 to 80 percent of the Georgian population favored membership in the Commonwealth of Independent States, the association that succeeded the Soviet Union. "It is now time to end our economic isolation by renewing traditional economic ties to the other states of the former U.S.S.R." 
 Mr. Shevardnadze, the former Foreign Minister for the Soviet Union who was elected to lead Georgia in October 1992, is scheduled to meet with President Clinton and Congressional leaders on a visit that starts on Monday.
In addition to soliciting American aid and political support, advisers say, Mr. Shevardnadze wants to reassure the Clinton Administration that his country is still independent despite joining the commonwealth and allowing the presence of Russian troops in Georgia.
 
Seeks U.N. Troops
 He is also scheduled to address the United Nations Security Council to request the deployment of United Nations peacekeeping troops in the breakaway western region of Abkhazia, which effectively seceded last fall after bitter fighting. For financial support and investment, Mr. Shevardnadze is to meet with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as well as with representatives of American businesses.
"It is an exhausting schedule," Mr. Shevardnadze said during an interview in his parliamentary office in downtown Tbilisi. "But after my meeting with the President, the most important aspect of the visit is to engage the United Nations in Georgia. If I fail, all my efforts at establishing a new world order will have been in vain."
But attracting peacekeeping forces and investors may be a difficult task. Once celebrated as one of the wealthiest and most pleasant republics of the former Soviet Union, Georgia has been reduced to a land where power shortages, bread lines and random violence are a part of daily life.
"Georgia and Armenia seem to be competing to see who can hit the bottom of the barrel first," a senior Western diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "In a nation that is not used to consensus-building, he has to show more stick and less carrot," the diplomat added, referring to Mr. Shevardnadze.
 
Faced 2 Rebellions
 Since Mr. Shevardnadze's return to Tbilisi in March 1992 to lead the Government, minority groups in two regions -- Ossetia in the north and Abkhazia in the west -- have broken away from the central Government. Hundreds of thousands of refugees from those conflicts are now camped in and around Tbilisi, a formerly quiet capital that now rings with the sound of gunfire every night.
Mr. Shevardnadze's decision on closer ties with Moscow has provoked denunciations from even former allies who accuse him of trying to undermine Georgian independence.
"You return from Moscow as part of an agenda to bring our nation into the C.I.S. by any means," Nodar Natadze, once a close supporter of Mr. Shevardnadze, said in the Parliamentary debate on the ratification of Georgia's joining the Commonwealth of Independent States earlier this week. "We have been utterly duped by this old Communist and stooge of Moscow."
Rejecting the accusation, Mr. Shevardnadze replied: "It is an obscenity to suggest that I was sent here from Moscow. Such ideas are part of the rhetoric of those who indulge in provincial fascism. I do not use that word lightly. It is the people who promote such notions who have destroyed Georgia by bringing the intelligence of the streets to government. You can see the results. It will take years to repair the damage."
 
Intervention by Russian Troops
 His immediate political troubles are partly the result of efforts by Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia last September to regain power after being deposed as Georgia's President two years ago and replaced by Mr. Shevardnadze. Mr. Gamsakhurdia's insurgency failed after Russian soldiers intervened to save the Shevardnadze Government in exchange for Georgia's joining the commonwealth.
"Although they did not participate in the fighting, I cannot deny that the presence of the Russian soldiers gave us a great psychological boost," Mr. Shevardnadze said.
Mr. Gamsakhurdia died in obscure circumstances in late December and was buried in the garden of his residence-in-exile in the breakaway Chechnya Republic, in the Russian Caucasus, in February.
Alluding to the Russian military presence in Georgia, Mr. Shevardnadze said: "There is no agreement signed, and we must start negotiations in good faith. But the reality is that there is no way that Georgia can resist Russia. If the West does not like Russia's return to its former colonies, let the West suggest an alternative."

HEADLINE: Owl Issue Tests Reliance on Consensus in Environmentalism

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
As it seeks court approval for a plan sharply curtailing logging in forests where the threatened spotted owl nests, the Clinton Administration faces the toughest test of its approach to reconciling conservation and economic development.
What started as a search for consensus could end in the traditional fashion, with deeply divided partisans seeking outright victory in court -- casting doubt on whether the Administration's consensus-building approach to managing natural resources can succeed. 
 As in several other environmental disputes around the country, the antagonists in the spotted owl dispute remain loyal to their long-held convictions, bolstered by unyielding scientific and economic arguments.
Last April, when President Clinton convened an extraordinary public meeting in Portland, Ore., to consider the fate of the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest, he sounded a conciliatory theme that the Administration had echoed many times.
 
A Pledge From Clinton
 'We will try to end the gridlock within the Federal Government, and we will insist on collaboration, not confrontation," Mr. Clinton said in Oregon.
But almost a year later, neither side in the dispute has accepted the Administration's forest proposal. Timber companies have already gone to court saying that the plan was developed in violation of open meeting laws, and they have also asked Congress to overturn the plan on economic grounds. Environmental groups believe that the plan is neither scientifically sound nor legally adequate to protect the owl and other species.
The same pattern is occurring as the Administration prepares new regulations, to be published this month, for controlling how much environmental damage ranchers can inflict on the public lands where their sheep and cattle graze. Both sides are deeply skeptical of the Administration's plan, which will call for local ranchers and environmentalists to reach a consensus on how to manage grazing.
 
Controls in Florida
 And in Florida, despite yearlong efforts to reach an out-of-court settlement with sugar and vegetable growers to control water pollution, the Administration is now asking the state legislature to impose water-quality controls. If that tactic fails, the Administration will be back in court next month against farmers who have not yet agreed to pay for vast filtration marshes to clean fertilizer residue from the water that drains from their fields.
Katie McGinty, director of the White House environmental policy office, said that despite the difficulties of reaching consensus, the Administration's approach was better than "the 12 years of environmental vandalism and economic lunacy" that she said characterized the Reagan and Bush Administrations, when the antagonism between environmentalists and industry was accepted as practically a law of nature.
Other officials involved in conservation debates also acknowledged the difficulties.
 
Consensus Is Difficult
 "It is very difficult to manage natural resources by consensus," said Jim Lyons, Assistant Secretary of the Agriculture Department for Natural Resources, heading the National Forest Service. Too often, he said, reaching consensus meant a search for partial solutions, which delayed final reckoning.
Part of the problem is that natural science is not a search for middle ground, said scientists who have studied the spotted owl and its habitat.
"Political compromise and scientific uncertainties should not be used to justify overexploitation for short-term economic and political gain at the cost of future sustainability," three biologists from regional universities said in a recent paper. They contended that the Administration's approach to the forest "cannot be justified scientifically."
But the forest debate is not really over just the spotted owl, but about the preservation of the entire forest ecosystem where the owl is threatened as its habitat disappears. Federal law prohibits any action, like logging on public land, that would drive a species to extinction; the owl shares its territory with 40 other species that are also listed as threatened or endangered.
Top Administration officials said they had little room for bargaining in the forest debate because a Federal judge must find that their proposed solution is scientifically sound.
 
Logging Halted
 Three years ago, at the request of environmentalists, Judge William L. Dwyer of the Federal District Court in Seattle, halted logging on 24 million acres of Federal forests in the Pacific Northwest, saying it violated the law protecting endangered species.
Last summer, a few months after the Portland conference, the Administration presented a variety of forest management options and endorsed one of them, known as Option 9. On Feb. 23, the Administration published an environmental impact statement affirming Option 9 as the final blueprint for timber cutting in the Pacific Northwest, and the plan will be presented to Judge Dwyer at the end of this month.
In December, about four dozen scientists met in Colorado for 12 days to analyze owl population data collected since 1985. A report on the conference, written by Government biologists, provided strong evidence that the owl population is declining and that the trend is accelerating.
 
Getting Better Data
 Of particular concern, the scientists said, the survival rate of adult females was found to have declined 1 percent per year from 1985 to 1993, a time when capturing and banding of individual owls provided more reliable data.
In a report written in February, three university biologists said that the new data "suggest that the Northwest's old-growth forest ecosystem may already be approaching the extinction threshold for the northern spotted owl, and they cast serious doubt on whether the population can survive any additional habitat loss."
That report was by Russell Lande of the University of Oregon, Gordon H. Orians of the University of Washington and John Wiens of Colorado State University.
"Option 9 will not prevent extinction of the northern spotted owl," the three said.
 
Thesis Is Rejected
 Although the Administration's environmental impact statement considered the latest population studies, it rejected the thesis that the data show the owl reaching a threshold beyond which it would not survive, and it said there was no evidence that the population decline would continue to accelerate as more trees were cut.
The question for Judge Dwyer is whether the Administration's plan represents a scientific consensus or a politically convenient compromise.
Administration officials, sensitive to this question, steer clear of the word "compromise" as they discuss their overall environmental strategy.
"The search for consensus cannot degenerate into compromise," said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. "You cannot ground consensus on inadequate science. Consensus and compromise are two very different concepts."

HEADLINE: Chinese Take Journalists on Guided Tour of Prison

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LINGYUAN, China, March 5

 BODY:
As China comes under growing pressure over its treatment of prisoners, five American journalists were taken on a tour of a nearly deserted penal colony in a Government attempt to demonstrate greater openness about human rights at such places.
The focus of the visit on Friday, to the Lingyuan No. 2 labor reform camp in the mountains 200 miles northeast of Beijing, was Liu Gang, a 33-year-old democracy campaigner who helped organize the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and who has accused the prison authorities of torture. 
 But instead of being allowed to investigate the accusation, the journalists were treated to a choreographed tour. They walked through empty dormitories, through empty mess halls, through empty classrooms, through an auditorium, where an inmate dance troupe was performing to the song "Bad" by Michael Jackson, and through a noisy truck factory. Model prisoners talked about being reformed through their labor while some guards listened and other guards recorded their remarks on videotape.
In the prison visiting room, where families get one hour a month to see imprisoned relatives, Dong Zheyun was there to see her husband, who was serving time for theft. When reporters entered the doorway, she said, "Every time I come, the first thing he says to me is that the cadres are so good to him they are like parents."
 
'You Got That Backwards'
 When her husband tried to express a few lines of praise for the prison authorities, a guard interrupted him to say, "You got that backwards."
Then his wife interjected on her husband's behalf: "Oh he's so stupid. He doesn't have any education at all."
By then the reporters were being asked to hurry to the next stop on the tour.
Mr. Liu is among several political prisoners in China whose medical condition has drawn international expressions of concern, including most recently a letter to President Jiang Zemin from 54 United States senators.
As a physics student and democracy advocate, Mr. Liu was drawn into the orbit of Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, two physicists who took refuge in the United States Embassy in Beijing in 1989 and now live in exile. Through their speeches and writing, the couple helped energize a new intellectual movement in the 1980's, promoting democratic reform to coincide with the economic opening begun by Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader.
 
Sentenced to Six Years
 After the military crackdown in June 1989, Mr. Liu, who had helped organize student demonstrations, was No. 3 on the list of 21 student leaders most wanted by the authorities. After his arrest, he was sentenced on Feb. 12, 1991, to six years in prison for "conspiracy to subvert the Government."
The warden, Xin Tingquan, refused to allow the visiting journalists to interview Mr. Liu, saying it was a violation of regulations. He acknowledged that the Ministry of Justice made one exception to this rule last year so a Communist Party magazine reporter could interview Mr. Liu and pronounce him a "malcontent convict" in the state-controlled press.
"We're not afraid of letting you see him," Mr. Xin said, "but Liu Gang distorts the truth. That's why we don't let him meet with anyone."
Prison officials offered to take reporters to where Mr. Liu was being held and make "exclusive" photographs that would "prove" Mr. Liu was in good health and had not been tortured.
 
A Glimpse of Liu
 For the prison authorities, the high point of the day came when the warden suddenly interrupted his briefing on how prisoners are reformed through "love and nurturing care." If the reporters would care to step to the window of the conference room, he said, they might catch a glimpse of Mr. Liu walking by.
There, through the smoked glass window overlooking the prison yard, the reporters saw a self-conscious Mr. Liu wearing a padded prison uniform and being escorted along a sidewalk by a prison officer. In a few seconds, he was gone. The warden returned to a video presentation showing Mr. Liu in various animated activities.
"Among so many criminals, we chose to let you see clips from Liu Gang's life in order that you could see his healthy condition," the warden said "If he had been abused, would he be this healthy today?"
Before President Clinton decides this year whether China is making "overall significant progress" on human rights to permit extension of favored trade status, this prison excursion seemed an empty propaganda show.
If the prison authorities are hiding a record of torture, which they insist they are not, they are not likely to open their doors any further. But reforms building in other parts of the Government may soon bring a greater level of accountability, including inspections by independent authorities.
 
Reform Attempts Seen

Some American officials believe that China is taking steps to reform its judicial and penal system with more supervision and the rule of law. And it has invited the International Committee of the Red Cross to discuss how China could open its prisons to Red Cross inspection as a way to prevent abuse and torture of prisoners.
But progress is slow.
Mr. Liu's jailers said no one in the prison administration or from the Ministry of Justice or any other judicial or prosecutorial body in China had ever investigated Mr. Liu's accusations of torture -- because, they said, he has never filed a complaint.
They also acknowledged that all the videotapes they have released of Mr. Liu playing pool, volley ball and cutting his birthday cake were made months after the reported torture and beatings.
In his only interview in prison with a state-run magazine, Mr. Liu asserted he had been "inhumanely treated" and "cruelly tortured." The magazine said the medical records of the prison showed that Mr. Liu had seen doctors 15 times for headaches, palpitation and diarrhea.
Asked what he would do at the end of his term, Mr. Liu was blunt in the presence of his jailers. "Liu said the first thing he is going to do after his discharge is to sue the officials and prisoners who attacked him physically."
 
Letters Produced
 Trying to discredit Mr. Liu, one of his jailers, Qi Guoxing, read two signed statements from him. The first letter, written in July 1991, praises the prison administration as "strict" but "civilized." It is signed, "The counter-revolutionary criminal, Liu Gang."
The date of this letter indicates that it was signed immediately after a period of what Mr. Liu described as torture in a letter smuggled out of the prison two years later.
The prison guard produced a second letter, dated August 1991, that is a political attack on Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader. But perhaps with a flourish that Mr. Liu knew his friends would recognize, he ended the letter with this postscript:
"Long live undefeatable Marxism-Leninism; long live Mao Zedong thought and the October revolution; long live the Communist Party and the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Socialist cause will ultimately be victorious in the world."
For democracy campaigners in China, this parody of dogmatic allegiance to Chinese Communism was the giveaway that Mr. Liu was still resisting.

HEADLINE: Endangered Species: Original Golden Arches

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DOWNEY, Calif., March 5

 BODY:
Just about every town has a McDonald's. But Downey has the oldest, original still-standing McDonald's, built way back in 1953, the year Southern California gave birth to the fast-food chain that conquered the globe.
It is one totally awesome relic. There isn't a faux mansard roof shingle or earth-tone brick in sight. This is the eye-popping original, with the bright yellow parabolic arches piercing a raked roof, a gleaming facade of red and white tile, flashing neon trim, walk-up windows, lots of chrome, no inside seating. 
 Just looking at it brings back memories of sharing 15-cent burgers and 10-cent fries with a date, while the Dynatone mufflers rumble and Bill Haley and his Comets are rocking out of the little speaker in the dash.
Give me a quarter-pounder with . . .
Sorry. Closed. See you later, alligator.
The building was mildly damaged in the earthquake in January. A few cracks were found, and McDonald's shut it down. For good, the company says.
 
Appeal to Clinton
 But preservationists are fighting to save it with "McDemonstrations" and even an appeal to the nation's No. 1 junk-food consumer, President Clinton.
They say the issue here is much bigger than burgers and nostalgia. It is nothing less than the rescue of an architectural icon whose impact has been felt beyond Downey, a sunny middle-class suburb of workers in the aerospace and military industries that lies a 30-minute freeway ride south of downtown Los Angeles.
Architectural icon?
"Junk food can be history," said Christopher Nichols, a member of the Los Angeles Conservancy, a nonprofit group dedicated to preserving historic Southern California landmarks.
 
No Repairs Without Change
 In the Angeleno mind-construct, that does not stop with saving old Spanish adobe.
Thus far, the McDonald's Corporation, which has phased out the golden arches for the mansard look, has refused to reconsider. It says the restaurant was cracked a little by the quake, is outdated and cannot be brought up to current McDonald's standards without destroying the very structural details the preservationists want to save.
"We have closed the restaurant and we will not reopen it," said Kevin Mazzu, McDonald's marketing manager for the Los Angeles region. "We plan to build a new restaurant elsewhere in the city in which we'll incorporate important parts of the old building, something we've done in other places."
Mr. Nichols said it would be architectural heresy to move a single nail of the 41-year-old structure in the heart of Downey, at the busy intersection of Florence Avenue and Lakewood Boulevard.
 
Piece of History
 He noted that because the 1953 Downey McDonald's was the oldest surviving restaurant in the worldwide chain and, equally important, had never been moved or architecturally modified because of a quirk in its franchise arrangement with the parent corporation, the National Register of Historical Places had ruled that it could be placed on the register, providing the building's owner requested a listing.
That has yet to happen. Nor is it likely, since the parent corporation took over the franchise in 1990.
Mr. Nichols and other members of the Conservancy see the final disposition of the Downey McDonald's as a major test of a major corporation's sense of civic responsibility.
They argue that McDonald's should join other big companies around the country that are beginning to preserve important, historic corporate memorabilia. They make the point that General Motors has put together an archive of its company papers and records, that Procter & Gamble has carefully preserved a collection of Hollywood makeup it acquired when it took over Max Factor and that Woolworth and First Citizens Bank of Raleigh, N.C., are helping to establish a museum in Greensboro, N. C., for the whites-only Woolworth lunch counter that was the stage for the 1960 civil rights sit-in.
 
Preservation Examples
 "McDonald's should take a lesson from those kinds of companies," said Pete Moruzzi, another member of the Conservancy, which has helped save the 1939 Spanish-style Union Station in downtown Los Angeles, the city's 1928 art deco Bullock department store on Wilshire Boulevard and many of its rambling, turn-of-the century bungalows.
Mr. Moruzzi, who has organized at least one McDemonstration in front of the restaurant, contends that the January earthquake did no significant damage to the structure, certainly not enough to merit its closing.
"They were just looking for an excuse to shut it," he said. "They've been talking about closing it for a long time, saying it's tired and outdated. They think they can make more money out of one of those new places. Worse, there isn't a law on the books that we can invoke to stop the destruction of the restaurant if it comes to that. All we can do is appeal to their sense of civic duty."
McDonald's answers that while it is a profit-driven enterprise -- it will not release its books on the Downey McDonald's -- it has a proven record of corporate civic responsibility.
Company officials point out that the corporation long ago set up a McDonald's museum in Des Plaines, Ill., in a reconstructed 1955 McDonald's.
 
Striking a Balance
 As for the Downey dispute, the officials say they have to balance preservation with economics. They profess to be unimpressed by a letter campaign and McDemonstrations and unconcerned that at least one preservationist has written the White House. "Your work to preserve this landmark is admirable," a Clinton aide wrote back.
Why not spruce up the old building and advertise it as one of the attractions of the town where the singer Karen Carpenter grew up, the surfing novelty song "Wipe Out!" was recorded and the Apollo moon capsule was built?
"It has no inside seating, no drive-through, things like that," Mr. Mazzu replied. "Without them, and putting them in would change things, we feel we can't offer our patrons the kind of service they've come to expect."
The Downey restaurant was the third in the initial batch of a dozen or so McDonald's outlets to go up, with each outlet built using the same set of plans. The first two restaurants were closed and replaced years ago, but the restaurant here, because of the way the franchise was worded, did not come under full corporate control until 1990.
 
The Way Americans Eat
 According to preservationists, it was at the Downey restaurant that Ray Kroc, a milkshake-machine salesman, became fascinated by the innovative fast-food assembly line created by two brothers named McDonald, an assembly line that eventually changed the way Americans eat. He was so impressed that he went into business with them and eventually bought them out.
The preservationists argue that another important reason the Downey restaurant should be saved is that the gaudy, exuberant design of the first McDonald's outlets set the style and tone for an architectural revolution in the 1950's and 1960's. As the preservationists see it, that revolution, for better or for worse, radically altered the previously mundane look of commercial America.
This was particularly true, they say, for the commercial highway strips and shopping centers that sprang up in the postwar years to service a nation suddenly having a torrid love affair with the automobile and suburban living.
"It was architecture that caught the spirit of a country coming off a great depression and a great war, and the Golden Arches were in the vanguard," said Alan Hess, a prominent California architectural critic who has written extensively on roadside strips and McDonald's.
 
Roadside Culture
 "McDonald's was specifically conceived to be part of the new roadside culture," he continued. "The soaring, bright arches were meant to get a driver's attention. And they did, because besides being big and bright they also were bold, modern, forward-looking, high-tech, energetic, exuberant, optimistic -- all the things we were back then."
Though the old Downey McDonald's is closed and the fight goes on to get it reopened, for those who can't wait, relief from a Big Mac attack is just down the road a bit, where stands one of those mansard McDonald's.
"I go there sometimes but it's just not the same," said Jerry Mull, a 47-year-old engineer who spent a good part of his youth hanging at the old place in his DelRay Club Coupe.
"The food tastes the same but it's not the same," he lamented. "It's not my kind of place. It's their kind of place.

A.& P. Factory Near Ithaca Is Sold to Group of Investors
After lying dormant for 12 years, a giant food-processing plant 30 miles southwest of Ithaca, N.Y., may soon be filled with workers again after its recent sale to a group of New York City investors.
The plant -- a three-story building that covers 1.5 million square feet, roughly the same size as the Pentagon -- was sold by the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company on Feb. 25 to Megacenter Partners, a limited partnership formed to buy the building. Although officials involved in the sale would not comment on the terms of the agreement, G. Thomas Tranter Jr., the Chemung County Executive, said the price was around $8.5 million. 
 The building, which is valued for tax purposes at $17.3 million, had attracted several other prospective buyers in recent years, but A.& P. had rejected their offers. In 1985 it was considered as a site for a maximum-security state prison.
Opened in 1965 midway between Corning and Elmira, the plant once employed as many as 2,600 people. But A.& P. closed it in 1982 when the company began to suffer financial problems, and the plant, sprawling along Route 17, became a potent symbol of the economic decline of the region.
One of the businessmen who bought the plant, Newby Toms, a Manhattan lawyer, is also a partner in a venture that owns the Industrial Center at Horseheads, a large warehouse and manufacturing site near the food plant, Mr. Tranter said. Mr. Toms could not be reached for comment about the sale.
As an incentive, county and city officials agreed to reduce property tax for the new owners from $402,000 a year to $197,000 a year, Mr. Tranter said.
"We're hopeful this sale will be a new beginning for our area," he said.
Michael Rourke, a senior vice president of A.& P., said the sale was expected to be made final in mid-April.
 
Man to Have New Arson Trial On Withheld-Evidence Ruling
 A man who spent almost a decade in prison, convicted of setting a 1978 fire that left six firefighters dead, will be retried after a Court of Appeals decision in mid-February upheld lower court rulings that the withholding of a piece of evidence during his trial affected the verdict.
The man, Eric Jackson, who also goes by the name Erick Jackson or Eric Knight, was convicted in 1980 of setting the blaze at a Waldbaum's supermarket in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn.
After serving less than half of a 25-year-to-life sentence, Mr. Jackson was released in 1988 when the trial judge, Justice Joseph Slavin of State Supreme Court, threw out the conviction after he found that the prosecution had withheld a memorandum about the blaze from the defense.
The case served as part of the basis for a Court of Appeals decision in late 1991 that broke new legal ground, stating that a defendant is not automatically entitled to a new trial when evidence is withheld, but must show that the withholding of the evidence contributed materially to the original guilty verdict.
In Mr. Jackson's case, the excluded memo bore information from a fire marshal that called into question whether the fire was in fact the work of an arsonist. Justice Slavin ruled in 1992 that the withholding of the memo did contribute to the verdict.
The Brooklyn District Attorney's office appealed that decision to the Supreme Court's Appellate Division for the Second Department, which upheld Justice Slavin's decision in November 1993. Last month the Court of Appeals refused to hear the case, letting the lower court's decision stand.
Patrick Clark, a spokesman for the District Attorney, said Mr. Jackson, who is now being held on Rikers Island for breaking into cars, is scheduled to be released at the end of April. Mr. Clark said prosecutors would move to retry him on the arson charges as soon as possible.
 
New ZIP Code Helps a Town Part Company With Queens
 Residents of the small Nassau County town of Inwood, who have spent years fighting the mistaken impression that they are a part of Queens, have won a major battle in their identity war: a new ZIP code.
The United States Postal Service agreed last month to change the town's ZIP code from 11696, which shares the same first three digits of parts of Queens, to 11096, which has the same prefix as parts of Nassau.
"The new ZIP gives us our identity," said Jack Rose, a former president of the Inwood Civic Association who began working for a new ZIP code almost 30 years ago. "Inwood has been sort of left out, and this gives us acknowledgment, at least from the Postal Service, that we're a separate place."
For decades Inwood has suffered the distinction of being the only community in Nassau with a Queens prefix. Because of those three numbers, outsiders commonly mistook Inwood as a part of Queens.
This misconception resulted in some very concrete problems. New York City tried to collect taxes from some residents, and officials at Nassau Community College refused to let some register. But more importantly, it just plain irked people in this proud blue-collar community of about 7,000 to be lumped together with a city many of them had worked hard to escape.
The new ZIP code will take effect at the end of this month.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
The Great One's Greatest Goal Is Getting Close

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOSTON, March 4

 BODY:
His favorite goal always used to be the next one. But the prospect of his 802d goal, whether it emanates from a feathery deflection or a seismic slap shot, has become his immediate, and increasingly nerve-racking, obsession. Nobody in National Hockey League history has ever scored 802 goals. That's why it's a natural for Wayne Gretzky, whose supernatural skills seem perpetually undaunted by the unprecedented.
The actual record-breaker is still four goals into the future, but the hockey world persists in holding its breath and applying more pressure to the slender shoulders of the unlikely superstar, a willowy wraith in macho uniform, who has broken every barrier, be it statistical, economic or esthetic, of his sport. 
 "Wake me up when it's over," a bedraggled Los Angeles Kings captain said Thursday after enduring another anticlimactic evening on ice, this time against the Bruins. "I'm not blase about this one; if anything, I'm getting too nervous."
Gretzky, daring for the 61st time to shatter yet another record, is about to overtake Gordie Howe as the N.H.L.'s career leading goal scorer.
The trouble is, this quest for the final four goals is threatening to go on too long for the 33-year-old Gretzky, who has grown increasingly uncomfortable while what was supposed to be the thrill of the chase has turned into a vigil. Gretzky, who needed just 780 games to break the assist record that took Howe 26 seasons, 1,767 games and 1,850 points to build, is not accustomed to quixotic tasks.
Built like a greyhound in a business dominated by players with Howe's bulldog build, Gretzky can't imagine allowing Howe's record to survive much beyond this week's home-and-home series against Chicago.
Tempers, including his, are tightening. And Gretzky's equilibrium was further rattled by the news that John Candy, a friend and business partner, had died suddenly of a heart attack on a movie set in Mexico at age 43.
"About a month ago I was sitting around thinking about what I do when I stop playing, and I realized that it's just like Glen Sather told me when I was 22 or so, that your fun has to come from the rewards of working hard now because you never know what the future's going to bring," Gretzky said. "It didn't hit home then but it does now."
So now he is working on this record as the world waits.
The tractor-trailers carrying the equipment for several networks have lumbered along after him to every game for the past week; microphones and cameras are poised, opposing goalies' hackles are raised. Gretzky's father and mentor, Walter, called him on Monday to crab about his letting this particular pursuit of excellence drag on too long and turn into a distraction. At least that piece of pressure was welcome pressure.
It was the first time in two years that his father, still mending slowly from a stroke that nearly killed him in 1991, was agitated enough to pick up the phone and initiate a call to the son he once counseled daily. On Monday, he issued the same type of constructive critique that has kept Gretzky on the edge of his skate blades ever since his hockey genius first announced itself in a 372-goal peewee season for the Brantford Steelers in Ontario back when he was a scrawny 11-year-old.
 
Reliving Dad's Dream
 "My dad's dream was to play hockey, and he never really made it, so he lived his life kind of through me," said Gretzky. "But he always let me know I was no better or bigger than anybody else, and he would've cracked me me over the head if I'd acted like I was."
Tied to teams his entire life, Gretzky always made it point to be "just one of the guys." It was something he needed more than the goals, so he didn't act like a celebrity even if his talent anointed him one.
"Very few people who achieve the greatness he has have remained as respectful as he has to everyone around him," said Mark Messier, his comrade from Edmonton's dynasty years. "That's why he's truly an icon: nobody thought he'd be big enough, strong enough, fast enough or smart enough to survive in a big game like the N.H.L., but he kind of proved everybody wrong. As many ways as you can think of, he scored."
But history -- such a friend to Gretzky over the course of a nonpareil 15-year career in which he has won four Stanley Cups, collected 60 records and is leading the scoring race for the 10th season -- is in danger, at least briefly, of turning from enabler to albatross here.
 
Always Had Pressure
 "I don't ever remember not having pressure on me somehow from somewhere," Gretzky said. "I've had it both ways: externally from everybody's expectations and internally from wanting to prove anybody who doubted me wrong, to show people that, yes, I can do this job. The pressure is a fact of life now. As you get older, when the records stop being of the moment and start becoming longevity records, I think you get even more excited about them. At least, that's what this one's doing to me. Maybe I'm too excited about it."
Lately the Great One -- who earned that momentous moniker at 10 -- has almost gotten too antsy to remember how to score. He is acutely aware of what happened the last time he experienced a scoring block.
"The great turned to good for a while last year when I went 16 games without scoring a goal; I was just the Good One then," said Gretzky, who missed the first 39 games of that season because of a career-threatening herniated disk but made amends by picking up a league-leading 40 playoff points in steering the Kings to their first-ever Stanley Cup final.
Right now the world's greatest hockey player, a little worse for wear-and-tear after not scoring in a 6-4 loss to Boston, has drawn the curtains on the glare from a white winter afternoon, confronted a pot of coffee and collapsed on a sofa in his hotel suite. He's inked his jersey number, 99, onto the Band-Aid that protects the bunion on his right toe; he has signed his name, just for practice, neatly along the leg of his sweat pants.
 
Signature Gets Neater
 His jitters are turning him into an even worse doodler than ever; the bright side, he said, is that his signature is getting neater and neater. Whether a slap shot or a signature, practice makes prefect in the Gertzky household.
"My dad always told me that when people want your autograph, they don't deserve to get chicken scratch," he said. "Signing autographs is the easy part of all this; scoring goals is harder than people think, and to me, the biggest compliment is when somebody tells me I worked hard."
Gretzky is used to being in the glare of expectation, used to working hard for his laurels. Seven-hour shifts of pond hockey split only by a midday hot chocolate break on below-zero weekends will do that to a kid, particularly one who knows his mother had to settle for a sheet in lieu of living room drapes in order to pay for his $25 skates.
 
Record vs. Team
 But this record is starting to worry him because maybe, just maybe, it's getting in the way of his struggling team's scramble with the Sharks and Ducks -- those same franchises his high profile in Los Angeles helped put on the map -- for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.
Gretzky knows he will break Howe's record and, just as he has done every other time such an honor has come his way, he will accept it with equal parts humility and hubris. When he claimed Howe's once unassailable assist record in 1989, he turned down the inevitable request to perform the ubiquitous "I'm going to Disneyland" promotion because he didn't want to commercialize a record both he and Howe, one of his idols, worked so hard to achieve.
More important to Gretzky than breaking the goal-scoring record is the grim foreknowledge that it will break his heart if his team, which this season signed him to a three-year $25.5 million deal that constitutes yet another Gretzky-made hockey milestone, doesn't make the playoffs.
"It will kill me," he said. "We just can't miss the playoffs; one record I'm probably the most proud of is that I've never missed the playoffs. To do that now, especially in the year that I'm breaking the scoring record, well, that would be bad. Devastating. My obligation to the Kings, and to this salary, which is astronomical and a little out of hand, was to make hockey go in California. But my priority is winning the championship."
To that end, Gretzky is tackling the tail end of this season, and the record, using a familiar four-letter word for motivation: fear. No in-your-face theatrics for this player, the one Howe referred to, with admiration, as a veritable wet noodle on skates.
"I always played in fear of making myself look bad, and with respect for my opponent's ability to make me look bad, and to this day I still play with the same attitude as I did when I was 12," said Gretzky.
 
From 1 Goal to 372
 The attitude was spawned when he was a 6-year-old on a team of older boys and it took him all year to score a single goal. Five years later, he had 372 in a single season, and the ensuing hoopla forced him to move away from home in search of anonymity at 14.
"It was so silly that I was 14 and had to leave my house and family just because I excelled as an athlete," said Gretzky, who drew the wrath of other players' parents and was a marked man in school -- where he did not excel.
Gretzky's first and last brush with high-level N.H.L. intimidation came in 1979 in his first game against Bobby Clarke's Flyers at the Spectrum.
"I was 18, and when I went out for the face-off my hands were shaking, and all of a sudden Bobby Clarke took his stick, cracked it over my head, got me in the stomach, spit all over the place, and he had no teeth.
"I thought, 'Wow, what am I getting myself into here,' " he said of the man he also recalled as his mother's favorite player.
"I went back to the bench and told Mark Messier, 'I'm going to be flying because there's no way I'm going to get hit tonight.' That's the fastest I ever skated in my whole career; the people there must have thought, 'Wow, is he quick.' "
There have been nights when he wished he could conjure up some Charles Barkley-esque trash talk backed up with some Barkley-esque brawn, but he has made up for his lack of bulk with a combination of skills unique to him.
 
Playing for 'Sweet Spot'
 According to his former coach, the Oilers' Glen Sather, no player is smarter than Gretzky: "It's like a golfer or a baseball player who hits the ball in the sweet spot every time. Wayne plays in the sweet spot."
According to Kings goalie Kelly Hrudey, no player is as generous as Gretzky, who learned long ago in Brantford that all those solo end-to-end scoring rushes made him the loneliest guy on the team.
"The most striking thing about Wayne, besides his will to win, is that he's the most unselfish player I've ever see," Hrudey said. "Before I knew him, I always thought of him as goal-oriented, but he's truly disappointed if he plays great but we still lose. He's accomplished everything a human being can accomplish, but nothing makes him happier than winning as a team."
Gretzky, who calls Howe, Maurice Richard, Phil Esposito and Mike Bossy "purer goal scorers" than him, will have this record, and others, before he's through. He would like another Stanley Cup, but if he believes that triple-digit scoring seasons are beyond him, he won't stick around to do a slow fade. And he definitely won't challenge Howe's record of being the N.H.L.'s only goal-scoring grandfather.
"I've kind of had my day in the sun, so to speak," he said, "but I think I'll always work. It's not like, when I retire from hockey, that'll be it for my life."
But first there is a goal, or four, to get, a playoff berth to secure and history-in-the-making forever looking him in the eye in the mirror.

Three Decades In Free Fall: The Sad Saga Of 140th Street

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Ray Wilkerson has been running his shop on West 140th Street since 1948, and feels a quiet pride in becoming, he thinks, Harlem's longest-serving dry cleaner. His walls are decorated with photos of generations of smiling children from the street, dressed in graduation caps and gowns.
But the pride goes only so far. Mr. Wilkerson has been trying to sell his business, but there have been no takers. This block, between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Frederick Douglass Boulevards, has sunk, then sunk some more. 
 Once the sidewalks teemed with people, children cavorted on the stoop and the lobbies of buildings were attended by doormen and decorated with nice furniture. Now, nearly half the 36 tenement buildings are vacant or abandoned, and the others are only partially occupied and in glaring need of repair. Drugs and crime are rampant. Last week, the New York Urban League dubbed West 140th Street "the worst block in Harlem."
Of course, no one can say which block is the worst. But the Urban League is concerned enough to make West 140th Street a showpiece for a new strategy: focusing resources and attention on a small area to get the maximum impact. Last week it opened a satellite office in a decrepit city-owned building at No. 222. There, with a two-year budget of $250,000, it promises to work to organize residents and lobby for better services. If successful there, the effort may be expanded.
"I kept asking people what's the worst block in Harlem," said Dennis M. Walcott, president of the New York Urban League. "Person after person said 140th Street between Seventh and Eighth."
The street indisputably stands out because of better-looking, busier areas surrounding it. Just to the south is Striver's Row, two well-appointed streets of handsome brownstones. To the north is the Drew Hamilton development, now considered a well-staffed and well-maintained public housing complex, and the massive Bradhurst housing rehabilitation effort. Several other projects are under way to revitalize the area.
Just how did this once-thriving block get so bad? It began, old timers say, with an influx of transient renters. They could not pay enough rent to keep up properties, and services lapsed. By the mid-1960's, the old timers say, landlords began abandoning buildings, as they did elsewhere in the city. This accelerated in the 1970's, and has never stopped.
"There was almost total disinvestment by the private sector," said Frank Braconi, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council.
Today, most buildings on the block are city-owned and operated. Some are boarded up and occupied by squatters and drug dealers. Others struggle to provide the barest of services, such as heat. "Those who are left can't afford to move," Mr. Wilkerson said.
And residents insist the deterioration has accelerated in the last decade.
"When I moved here in 1985, this was a nice block," said Daisy Durant, who lives in No. 227. "People lived like families."
Now, people say, garbage is thrown out windows, then picked up only sporadically by the city. Many front doors no longer have functioning locks. The block association is just a memory. Rats are common. Children, as much as maternally possible, are kept forever inside.
Capt. William McGuinness, executive officer of the 32d Precinct, said the block is indeed bad. On Thursday, 480 vials of crack were found in an abandoned apartment. Few people call to complain about the ubiquitous drug-dealing.
"The bad guys stick together on that block," Captain McGuinness said.
The voices of 140th Street tell the story.
"It's like we live in a twilight zone," said Bernice Woody, who lives with six grandchildren at No. 274. "There's no sense of community, no sense of nothing."
Ed Brown, superintendant of the city-owned building at No. 222, where the Urban League office will be, said a complaint about a radiator or roof leak generally wouldn't be answered for two months. "They don't fix up the buildings around here," he said.
Beth Reed moved to the street seven years ago to write a book about Harlem; she began a small program helping drug addicts.
"I at first thought of the block as a war zone, but then decided it was a burning house from which some can maybe be saved," she said. "In a war zone, you have a chance to win the war." DOUGLAS MARTIN

HEADLINE: LISTEN UP!

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
THERE was a time in New York when radio stations played a kind of music called rock-and-roll. It was the height of the reign of the WMCA Good Guys and Cousin Brucie at WABC, when Alison Steele was the Night Bird of WNEW-FM, when the image of a station was determined as much by the D.J.'s who picked the music as by the music itself.
 But that was long ago, before the Age of Narrowcasting, when market research and changing economics split the pop-music dial into a veritable asteroid belt of specialized rock formats: hard rock, soft rock, classic rock, modern rock, pure rock, adult rock, album rock and on and on. 
 And it was before other forms of music enjoyed by smaller segments of the listening public - classical, blues, traditional folk music - found themselves being crowded off the dial, too, casualties of a medium growing ever more vigilant about the bottom line.
 "The range of music focuses much more on the mainstream than it had in the past," said Barbara Malmet, an assistant professor of radio at New York University. "There was a time on the radio, when there was more tinkering, more experimental stuff going on."
 If anything, these changes have drawn more New Yorkers to the radio than ever before. Still, to some, the decline of classical music, the proliferation of shock jocks on talk radio and the growing number of stations specializing in every conceivable category or rock - are signs of a deterioration in quality and creativity, a turning away from the sophisticated music and talk that once was a staple of manyof the city's 70 or so radio stations.
 "Radio has been dumbed down, and what one used to get as fairly regular fare 30, 40 years ago is now confined solely to public radio," said Jules Feiffer, the writer and cartoonist, who says he spends much of hos workday drawing and listening to the radio. "The education listener seems to be told there is no room for him or her on the airwaves."
 The most recent example of radio's dumbing down, as far as classical-music lovers were concerned, was the sudden format change at WNCN-FM, which had been an outlet for classical music for many years. In December, the station's owner, the GAF Broadcasting Company, changed WNCN's call letters to WAXQ and its format to what it described as "pure rock," and in the process left New York with only one commercial classical station, WQXR-FM, which is owned by the City of New York, also offers classical music programming.
"I think there is a general cheapening going on, not just in radio, but in television, too, and it just carries over," said Leigh Harris, chairman of the Listeners' Guild, a group that was organized in the early 1970's to try to stop WNCN from abandoning classical music and now lobbies in behalf of listeners on a variety of broadcasting issues. Having lost the battle over WNCN, Mr. Harris says members of his group worry that classical music is in danger of fading from the commercial airwaves completely.
The current debate over a Giuliani administration proposal to sell WNYC as a revenue-producing measure has only intensified the general anxiety.
Lynn McVeigh, an associate professor and faculty adviser to WNYU-FM, the student-run station at New York University, said that commercial radio stations in New York were under increasing pressure from their corporate parents to turn a quick profit, and that types of music that do not draw large audiences or targeted listeners from certain demographic groups were more vulnerable.
"It is an era that is much more devoted to business than to broadcasters," Ms. McVeigh said. "A station is being purchased according to how much money it can make as quickly as possible. In doing that, you're getting a certain amount of homogenization on the air."
Still, even in this era of "narrowcasting" and "dumbing down" -- not to mention an ear- and mind-bending array of high-tech media options -- radio, old-fashioned radio, in New York can still be many-faceted and eclectic, a marketplace where fans of all kinds of music, jazz or Caribbean, big-band or Baroque, can find a parking spot on the dial.
"What you are finding with a real narrowing of the formats is that you've got a little bit of everything." said Ken Mueller, manager of the radio department at the Museum of Television and Radio in Manhattan.
But since much of this variety exists beyond the commercial mainstream, you have to know where to turn. To help the radio-dazed city dweller, The City asked several music critics for The New York Times to prowl the dial in search of the best bits in their areas of expertise. Here are their findings.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: GREENWICH VILLAGE;
New Gig for the Old Gate?

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
For most of its 36 years, the Village Gate was a jazz landmark. Hundreds of musicians headlined there, from Duke Ellington, Aretha Franklin and Dizzy Gillespie to Stan Kenton, B. B. King and Sarah Vaughan.
Last month, when the Gate closed amid bankruptcy and eviction proceedings, its founder was already deep into a new dream: trying to find his musicians a permanent gig at their old stand. 
 Art D'Lugoff's idea is a National Living Jazz Museum and Hall of Fame. He envisions a performance space, museum, library, cafe and gift shop, along with lectures and programs for budding musicians. He has drummed up a City Council endorsement as well as name-brand support.
His advisory board includes Dave Brubeck, Stanley Crouch, Jules Feiffer, Betty Friedan, Lionel Hampton, Wynton Marsalis and Alvin Toffler. Stephen A. Briganti, president of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, and Ralph Appelbaum, whose consulting firm is developing the Motown Museum in Detroit, have agreed to act as consultants.
Now comes parlaying such support into grants for feasibility studies. Mr. D'Lugoff said he had not calculated the cost, but Borough President Ruth W. Messinger wrote in a letter to him: "I expect to be able to offer some money from our discretionary funds to serve as seed money for this highly worthwhile project."
Nonetheless, the proposal faces big hurdles. In the 1970's, the New York Jazz Museum struggled in three midtown sites before folding. Some in the music business question Mr. D'Lugoff's ability to organize such a museum, considering the Gate's troubles. Still, Dan Morgenstern, director of the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University, said: "Art has nine lives and has always bounced back, full of ideas. Certainly the Gate would be an ideal location."
Mr. D'Lugoff does hold out hope of resuscitating the club, at 160 Bleecker Street, at Thompson Street. Its "temporary" closing came after years of declining bookings and attendance, soured investments and mounting debts, including back taxes. Compounding those problems, a new landlord is trying to raise the rent from $2,000 a month to $15,000 and has gone to court to break the remaining 12 years of the lease.
The Gate suffered from many factors, Mr. D'Lugoff said, including the recession and a reduced pool of jazz stars, as big names graduated to concert halls or retired. While some clubs have been hurt, others, like the Blue Note, say they are thriving.
"It's not an easy business," said Lorraine Gordon, who runs the city's oldest club, the 59-year-old Village Vanguard. "It could happen to anyone." As for the museum, she said: "It's a great idea. Just do it."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CHELSEA/CLINTON;
A Tradeoff: Trucks for Housing

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE 

 BODY:
It has taken decades -- not to mention a lot of political maneuvering and indirect, though fiscally powerful, Federal intervention -- but another piece in the Clinton urban-renewal project is about to fall into place.
Fran Reiter, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Community Relations, announced last week that the city had agreed to rehabilitate six buildings in the renewal area, from 50th to 56th Streets between 10th and 11th Avenues, and to meet several other requests made by Chelsea-Clinton leaders. 
 The agreement is a tradeoff with Community Board 4, which covers the area, for temporarily housing 60 sanitation trucks in the old bus depot at 30th Street and 12th Avenue. The city had faced losing $95 million in Federal funds for reconstructing the Williamsburg Bridge if it did not find a site for at least half the 120 trucks parked under it by Jan. 14. Most neighborhoods strongly opposed housing the trucks, but Board 4 agreed conditionally.
In exchange, the city acceded to the renovations and to three other requests: to help cut red tape for the Women's Interart Center, a local arts group that has been trying to expand its studio space; to remove a Sanitation Department parking location with 109 vehicles from Pier 59 by the end of the year, and to hasten the board's move to more spacious quarters.
"We're still pushing for our main demands: a commitment to consider the Clinton plan as a whole and to specify how long the trucks will be parked at the 30th Street site," said Ross Graham, who heads Board 4, which is to move into its new space on the 26th floor of 330 West 42d Street at the end of the month.
The Clinton plan, a community-sponsored initiative, calls for new low- or moderate-income housing while retaining a commercial-residential mix.
From the beginning the city and community have disagreed on how to develop the area, which was designated for renewal in 1969. Early on, dozens of buildings were razed and seven apartment buildings constructed with Federal funds before money ran out; many people moved out of the condemned area. The Koch administration then tried to encourage luxury residential development but was blocked by community opposition. In 1984, local leaders came up with the current plan, but the city dismissed it as impractical and too costly.
Under the new agreement, the six deteriorated apartment buildings, on 11th Avenue and on 52d Street, would be renovated with city funds once tenant approval is obtained. The cost has not been determined, but the renovation would proceed under the auspices of the Tenant Interim Lease program, which leads to tenant ownership, said Valerie Jo Bradley, spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
The city has also agreed to begin the public-review process for the expansion of Interart and two other groups, Ensemble Studio Theater and Soundscape, which have created an artistic hub at 549 West 52d Street. The groups have a month-to-month lease because the city slated the entire area for demolition in 1969. Margot Lewitin, artistic director of Interart, said they have tried for 12 years to get a permit to build an eight-story rehearsal complex next door.
"It's a wonderful beginning," said John Glynn, executive director of the Clinton Preservation Local Development Corporation, sponsors of the renewal plan. "But it's too bad it has taken such a long time for the city to readjust to the thinking that neighborhoods do not have to be destroyed to be rebuilt." MARVINE HOWE
 
How the Deal Was Made
 The Department of Sanitation had to find a new home for 60 trucks parked under the Williamsburg Bridge or miss a Federal deadline, losing funds to repair the bridge. The quest, and the deals cut along the way, give a glimpse of how things get done in the city.
PUB-DATE: April 30, 1993:
Oct. 15, 1993: The State Court of Appeals upholds the ruling.
Dec. 30, 1993: City agencies, including the departments of General Services, Sanitation and Transportation, meet with Community Board 3 to discuss Seward Park on the Lower East Side. Board 3 rejects the idea.
Jan. 4: City agencies meet with six community boards to discuss Piers 40, 92 and 94 on the West Side, the M.T.A. bus depot at West 30th Street, Bridgemarket near the 59th Street Bridge, the Penn Rail Yards on the Upper West Side, and a site at Donald Trump's Riverside South project. Mr. Trump, it is decided, will charge too much. Bridgemarket is the initial favorite, but Councilman Charles Millard knocks out that suggestion. Officials turn to Pier 94 as the next-best site.
Jan. 14: Councilman Thomas K. Duane, who represents Chelsea-Clinton, says no to Pier 94, which he envisions as a park and passenger ship terminal. The Federal deadline is extended, for the first of several times.
Jan. 18: Officials tour Board 4 sites, minus Pier 94. Ross Graham, the board chairwoman; the Borough President's director of land uses, Richard Bass, and Mr. Duane select the M.T.A. bus depot as "the least objectionable site," in Mr. Duane's words.
Jan. 22: Ms. Graham and Mr. Duane present a wish list to Fran Reiter, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Community Relations. She agrees to several points, including that the city renovate six buildings in Clinton's renewal area and that the garage be temporary; she gives no date for removing the trucks.
March 2: Ms. Graham announces that the Sanitation Department, in another concession to the community, will move 109 city vehicles from Pier 59 by Dec. 31, and that the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has confirmed in writing it will renovate the six buildings. M.H.

 BODY:

Big Yellow Letters
Q. What are those codes, in big yellow letters and numbers, that are stenciled on many city streets? The one I see most often is E-1. 
 A. Whenever a utility is planning to dig into the ground, all the other utilities are alerted; they, in turn, protect their pipes, cables and the like by placing marks on the streets showing where they are. E stands for electric, G for gas; you get the idea. The numbers have internal meanings within each company and indicate, for example, what type of cable is buried there.
 
Big Yellow Envelopes
 Q. Why does it usually take a large Manila envelope longer to be delivered in New York than a business envelope?
A. Postal technology has come a long way, but not to the point where large envelopes cannot stymie the system.
A standard personal envelope and the No. 10 business variety are both easily sorted by automated machinery, which, with its optical character-reading device, whips through unsorted mail and processes it efficiently and economically. Larger envelopes do not fit into the machine and therefore must go through a manual sorting device. Very large or odd-shaped envelopes, known in postal argot as "slugs," must go through the slowest form of sorter: humans who stick each piece individually into this or that slot.
 
Zoo Story
 Q. Why has the Children's Zoo in Central Park been closed for so long, with no outward signs of progress? Won't my child be in college by the time it reopens?
A. It may depend on how old your child is now. The Wildlife Conservation Society, which operates the zoo for the Parks Department, closed it in February 1992 because of "inhumane conditions for the animals, and because it was unsafe for people," said Alison Power, a spokeswoman for the society. "The buildings were dilapidated, the areas where animals were kept were too small, it was just not a good scene," she said.
The Children's Zoo had long been slated for restoration, and Ms. Power says that restoration will come to pass. "We are confident that there will be another children's zoo there in one form or another again," she said. But for now, she added, there simply isn't any money.
 
Midtown Why?
Q. Why is the 14th Street YMHA called the midtown Y?
A. This YMHA, on 14th Street at First Avenue, was started on the Lower East Side in 1903 by the Emanu-el Brotherhood and moved up to 14th Street in 1965. The origin of its name is simple: it was meant to serve the area from 14th to 59th Street. To have called it the downtown Y, members of the Y's board assumed at the time, would have suggested that the area it served ran from SoHo to the Lower East Side, said Fred Plant, a former president and member of the board.
 
Cab Riders' Rights
 Q. Recently I got into a cab with two friends and asked the driver to make three stops along the Upper West Side. His reply: "This isn't a bus." My cousin had a similar experience outside Madison Square Garden the other night, when she requested that a driver make two stops and he flat-out refused. Is this legal?
A. No. The Taxi and Limousine Commission rulebook says that all drivers must make as many stops as a passenger requests. To refuse to do so is as serious a violation as declining to pick up a passenger or to go to a certain neighborhood, said Bruce Schaller, director of policy development at the taxi commission.
The fines range from $200 to $500 to license suspension (after a third offense). Why do drivers refuse to do this? Mr. Schaller said he did not know -- "It's like asking why you had a hamburger instead of a tuna sandwich" -- but added, "The perception may be that a person will make more money if they don't have to stop and start."
But that's not your problem. If this happens again, you should take the medallian number and license number, both found in the credential holder, and call the commission's complaint line, (212) 221-TAXI. JENNIFER STEINHAUER

Bed and Bronzes

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER 

 BODY:
"I HAVE a great big sculpture here at 47th and Madison," said James Knowles, referring to the 136-room mass of stone called the Roger Smith, a Depression-era hotel that he and his wife, Suzanne, have transformed into one of the more eccentric hostelries in New York. "I like to call it a hotel with an art bias."
Art is omnipresent at the Roger Smith, which recently emerged from a five-year, $8-million renovation. Hallways are adorned with changing exhibits; walls in the bar and restaurant, Lily's, are splashed with winsome murals; Mr. Knowles's abstract bronze panels, life-size busts and bold oil paintings fill the lobby. An antique farm table in the dining room is designated "the artists' table," for artists' get-togethers, and even the menu features "New American Art Cuisine." 
 New American Art Cuisine? "It has a lot to do with the presentation," the chef, Robert Giordano, explained.
Mr. Knowles, 50, painter, sculptor, classical guitarist, former rugby player and free-ranging philosopher, came into the hotel business late and reluctantly. In the 1980's, he was happily forging giant bronze figures at his foundry in Connecticut. Then in 1987 his father-in-law, Oscar de Lima, died, leaving behind the tired, threadworn Roger Smith.
Mrs. Knowles knew how to administer a hotel (there are 17 in the Roger Smith Winthrop chain, though the Manhattan hotel is the only one under family control). Mr. Knowles knew nothing about hotels. But he knows about art. They decided to revive the Roger Smith, but as a forum for art and artistic discussion.
Five years later, they appear close to their goal, both artistically and economically. The Roger Smith now falls into the category of specialty boutique hotel -- small, hip -- like the Royalton, Paramount and Chelsea. In 1987 its occupancy rate was about 65 percent; today, despite the recession, it is 74 percent, slightly above the local average.
"They have to work their niche to survive as a small hotel in New York City, which has so many giant hotels," said Neil Ostergren, vice president of marketing for Hospitality Sales and Marketing Association International, a hotel industry trade group. The art bias differentiates them from the other small hotels and makes them known to certain types of people as a place to go."
The Roger Smith's eccentricities attract mostly actors and musicians, among them the singers Nanci Griffith, Juliana Hatfield and Lyle Lovett and members of the bands Los Lobos, Midnight Oil and Soul Asylum.
Not many artists stay at the hotel, though they're offered discounts of $99 a room, opposed to the usual $125 to $160 (breakfast included). "That's because most live in New York," said James Fox, director of sales, adding that they do attend events at the hotel.
For instance, among recent participants at the hotel's bimonthly "brown-bag art lunches," at which artists, critics and gallery owners discuss their work, were Ivan Karp, a SoHo gallery owner; Barbara Toll, an art dealer, and the artists Philip Pearlstein, Mark Kostabi and Joseph DiGiorgio. In fact, the Roger Smith may be the only hotel with a curator on staff. Molly Barnes, who owns a Los Angeles gallery under her name and spends half her time in New York, organizes the lunches, oversees the hotel's exhibits and runs a newly opened art gallery, the Corner, in the former gift shop.
 Mr. Knowles, who has degrees from Yale and the University of Pennsylvania in painting and sculpture, sees art as a metaphor, a motivational tool, to encourage creative thought among his 90 employees. "I am not a hotelier, I am an agent of change," he said. "There is art throughout this hotel, the art of people expressing their creativity through their work. When you set out to make a portrait in bronze you have to first ask the mud what it will do, not tell it what to do." Mr. Knowles tends to talk like that.
At 6 feet 1 and 220 pounds, he resembles a rugby player more than a hotelier. An inveterate creator, he seems incapable of speaking without illustrating his thoughts at the same time -- on scrap paper, checks, bank statements, even the palm of his hand.
"This is a beautiful piece of sculpture!" he enthused about the refitted boiler room. "Look at those pipes!" The next stop was the laundry room. "See these people," he bellowed over tumbling dryers. "They are artists. Artists in laundry!" The artists nodded.
This is hardly your typical hotel pitch: "More than anything I want this hotel to be a place where good ideas can occur," Mr. Knowles said, drawing a circle with an arrow to emphasize his point. "New York City has a tremendous energy for ideas, and I want to create a warm and friendly atmosphere where those things can happen."
In the words of Willie MacInnes, a tour manager who stays regularly at the Roger Smith, "The hotel is really neat, no beyond neat." Last year he spent five weeks there with Midnight Oil. "It has a bit of a European warmth," Mr. MacInnes said, adding that the art lends a noninstitutional air.
The hotel's contemporary American decor -- with countrified touches like four-poster pine beds and early-American prints -- befits the vision of Mr. de Lima, who had named it for Roger Sherman, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and John Smith, a colonizer of Virginia.
 The musical tradition at the Roger Smith actually predates the renovation. The hotel was once the haunt of Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie and Jim Croce. Perhaps the most legendary guest was R. Buckminster Fuller, who in the 1930's apparently found himself with no money and no place to stay. He was given free accommodations, sans bed, in the 18th-floor reception room. Tossing and turning, legend has it, he gazed up at the room's cove ceiling, covered with little triangles. And so, Ms. Barnes, the curator, insists, "That started him thinking about a geodesic dome made like that."
Visitors these days notice something different: four life-size Knowles bronze sculptures framing the hotel's entrance. "They give you a focus when you arrive," Mr. Knowles said. One New Yorker certainly focused on them last year; he was caught rolling one of the 400-pound pieces down the street on a hand cart.
Mr. Knowles's latest addition is the gallery at the hotel's Lexington Avenue corner, which specializes in younger artists who might not find space in traditional galleries.
"I would love to make this corner an art hub of Manhattan," Mr. Knowles said, dreaming, as usual, in exclamation points. "Wouldn't it be great to have sculpture on all four corners! It would make this such a special spot in the city!"

HEADLINE: Con Edison At Odds With Agency Over Power

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Setting the stage for a collision between two longtime partners, executives of the Consolidated Edison Company insist they will continue to seek a new power purchase contract with Hydro-Quebec, and the head of the New York Power Authority, which transports the power, called the utility's strategy "weird."
Con Edison, which serves 8.3 million people in New York City and Westchester County, gets power every summer from Hydro-Quebec, which has a surplus then. The two utilities have been negotiating to extend their 20-year deal beyond its current expiration date, at the end of 1998. 
 The Power Authority acts as a middleman, carrying the energy over its lines from the Canadian border to the metropolitan area. But now the authority, with an environmentally minded chief executive who took office on March 1, is discouraging an extension.
 
Low Demand Spurs Talks
 Con Edison, Hydro-Quebec and the Power Authority agreed in 1989 on an extension and expansion of the contract, but in the last few months, with demand for power pushed down by recession and with fuel prices low, all three agreed that re-negotiation was needed.
On Wednesday, S. David Freeman, the new president and chief executive of the authority, testified before a legislative hearing in Albany that New York State had more than enough power and did not need a new contract with Hydro-Quebec. The state's utilities might sensibly buy power on the spot market, on an hour-to-hour or day-to-day basis, he said.
He also said his agency should not be the middleman, although, he said, in accordance with Federal law it would continue to provide access to its transmission lines for Hydro-Quebec and Con Edison. The authority appears to be trying to create a political environment that is hostile to the contract, and it could also seek to hinder the deal by asking a high price for access to its lines.
 
Lower-Priced Power Possible
 On Friday executives of Con Edison, seeking to rebut the testimony, said they would continue to negotiate with Hydro-Quebec. Even though Con Edison has surplus generating capacity, said William A. Harkins, vice president for planning and inter-utility affairs, the utility might be able to buy power from Hydro-Quebec at a cost lower than making it here.
"We only have an interest in a contract we think we can write with Hydro-Quebec that's going to produce savings to our consumers," said Mr. Harkins. "If it doesn't, we ain't going to do it."
The 1989 deal all parties say is now obsolete would have been for about $5 billion. No price has been negotiated on the new agreement, but the price would be much lower, because it would involve about half as much power at a smaller cost per unit of electricity.
The revised contract would guarantee Con Edison 780 megawatts of capacity, the equivalent of a middle-sized power plant. Prices are still under negotiation, but Con Ed executives said that because Hydro-Quebec has such a large surplus of capacity in the summer, when its internal demand is low, Con Ed can rent it at very low cost, below the cost of maintaining Con Ed's own power plants.
Executives made their arguments in a conference call on Friday that they initiated.
 
'Environmental Concerns'
 Mr. Freeman, in a separate telephone interview, said of Con Edison, "It's obvious they have no sensitivity to the environmental concerns."
A fundamental principle of environmentalism, he said, was "to evaluate first and build later." But any deal that guaranteed Con Ed capacity, he said, would encourage Hydro-Quebec to continue a program of building new dams, and the environmental soundness of those dams is still under review. Consumers in New York State, he said, should not help finance construction in Canada before studies are complete on the effect of the dams on the environment around them, near Hudson's Bay in the far north of Quebec.
Some aboriginal people and environmentalists on both sides of the border are trying to stop the construction program, but the utility, which is owned by the province, has been pushing ahead, in part because of the economic stimulus that construction provides.
 
No New Dams May8 Be Built
 Con Ed and Hydro-Quebec insist that the more environmentally sound course is the contract they are negotiating, which, they say, would not require any new dams to be built. Hydro-Quebec says it will build enough dams to meet provincial demand with average rainfall, and that if rainfall is above average -- as it is half the time -- the surplus would be sold to New York. Hydro-Quebec has said the New York contract will not have any impact on its extensive construction plans.
If rainfall is below average, Con Ed would have the option each winter of sending electricity to Hydro-Quebec so that Hydro-Quebec would not have to draw down its reservoirs, in effect creating a surplus. Con Ed would get the electricity by burning oil or gas in its own plants, or by buying the power from other sources.
Using surplus water would reduce pollution in the New York City area, because Con Ed would burn less fuel, easing air pollution.
But Mr. Freeman said he opposed a long-term contract because New York State is "awash in power for the foreseeable future," which keeps prices low on the spot market. There is also a continuing surplus of natural gas, which in summer is a prime fuel for electric generation, he pointed out. "It's a bit weird to be talking about 20 years into the future," he said.
Con Edison, on the other hand, said the Power Authority might be growing reluctant to play middleman because environmentalists, including some elected officials, oppose new dams. Mr. Harkins said that the Power Authority derives no benefit from the existing contract, and its rationale for not getting involved might be, "Why should we get our teeth kicked in on this one."
But if an analysis shows a contract is good for consumers in New York City and Westchester, he said, the answer is, "because that's your job, fellas."
In addition, he said, Hydro-Quebec was certain to have surpluses, and it would surely sell them, rather than dumping water over the spillways of its dams without making any power. "All we're trying to do here is to have first dibs on that surplus energy when it's available," he said.
But Mr. Freeman said that for another reason it is much too soon for Con Ed to strike a deal. "They're free to pursue whatever they want, but the true value of the transmission in 1999 is something yet to be determined," he said. Summer is the peak period on the authority's transmission lines, he said, "and the rate we charge for that is yet to be determined." As a result, he said, Con Ed and Hydro-Quebec are facing "a big item in their equation that's a question mark."

HEADLINE: The View From: Union;
A School District That Has to Work at Spending Money

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
WITH fewer than 65 children enrolled in nine grades, the Union Elementary School lavishes plenty of individual attention on its students. The school is nestled in a wooded area off a dead-end road in the rural northern Connecticut community. There are no houses or businesses nearby, and almost no traffic. Graduating students test well and integrate smoothly at Stafford High School.
"The kids are sheltered from a lot of what goes on in society today," said Cathryn A. Escalona, the teacher of the fifth and sixth grade at Union Elementary. "There's no violence here, no gangs here. The only thing you have to do here is teach." 
 But this year the state came in and ordered the school to increase its budget by 5 percent, or face fines and other penalties. The problem? The town was $26,000 below its state-mandated $634,000 minimum expenditure requirement. While that amounted to only about a half-mill in the local tax rate, it left some people more than a little annoyed.
 
'Why Did We Need Extra Money?
 "The feeling was, if we could run our schools and pay our bills and keep the doors open for 180 days, why did we need extra money?" the superintendent of schools, Richard M. Butler, said. "We do a lot better on some of the standardized tests than a lot of towns with a lot more money."
The town's First Selectman, Roy S. Bradrick Jr., who is also a lawyer, added: "Some people felt they didn't care if the state took us to court, it was ridiculous to spend it just because the state is ordering us to spend it."
As the chief of the bureau of grants processing at the Education Department, Robert Brewer, explained it, "The M.E.R. was intended to be a guarantee that schools would spend at least a certain amount. But it's now becoming a budget target in many towns."
Every year the state Education Department sends out letters to any school that is within 5 percent of its minimum expenditure requirement. A few years ago, that meant 10 or 12 letters; this year, it was an unprecedented 42, said an Education Department spokesman, Thomas W. Murphy.
Mr. Brewer said the problem was growing worse because the state has not increased education grants at the pace once promised, and because town tax collections have been hurt by the real estate downturn. In addition, many schools are seeing increases in enrollment, and the minimum expenditure requirement is based on enrollment.
"Four years ago, on average, school districts were spending 29 to 30 percent over their minimum expenditure requirement," Mr. Brewer said. "For 1993-94, we expect the margin will have narrowed to less than 15 percent. Many schools are a lot closer than that."
In many towns, in fact, the officials have grown to consider the minimum expenditure requirement as the standard for the school budget, and the school board must fight for anything above it. That, Mr. Brewer said, was never meant to be.
 
'Union Is an Exception'
 Should towns have to spend a certain minimum if they can prove they can provide a quality education for less? "We hear that argument sometimes," Mr. Brewer said. "But there aren't that many towns spending at or below the M.E.R. where student performance is good. Union is an exception."
Union is an exception in many ways. It's the smallest town in Connecticut, with 612 residents. While it's not a wealthy town -- per capita income is $16,667 versus $21,321 statewide, according to the Census Bureau -- it was ranked 129th out of 169 towns in a report titled "Indicators of Need" compiled by the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities. All the children come from families that speak English at home; very few students come from families receiving welfare.
Perhaps most important is the student-teacher ratio. Even with combined grades, the largest class (first and second grades) has 21 students, and the school hired a teacher's aide for that class this year. (The kindergarten has eight students.)
The school itself is a white building with aluminum siding that looks more like a large house than a hall of learning. There is an access ramp, but even in this winter's snows it was never shoveled -- no one needed it. The fifth- and sixth-grade classroom doubles as a town hall for meetings and other official functions.
"What we try to do is plan a class trip for the days when they need it for an election," Mr. Butler said. "Either that, or we move the class upstairs for the day, and double up."
Union Elementary is so small it does not even have a principal. Mr. Butler, the superintendent for nearby Ashford as well, comes in one day a week. He is part of an administrative council that includes two teachers and a secretary who oversee the day-to-day operations of the school.
It's a pitch-in-and-do-your-share kind of place. When Mr. Butler heard Greenwich was closing one of its elementary schools a few years ago and its books would be given to other schools, he and a teacher rented a U-Haul van, drove to Greenwich and cleaned out the library.
For many of the teachers, Union was their first job out of college and no one seems anxious to move on.
Ms. Escalona, who has been at Union Elementary nine years, said she likes the personal contact with the community. She stays in touch with the parents of her 18 students, through weekly progress reports and regular meetings, and the families are very supportive.
The only problem she had noticed was that with a combined class, a regular school day seemed too short. "You're teaching two maths and two spellings and two reading groups," she said, "and it's very challenging to get it all done in one day. But when we pointed that out they lengthened the school day by a half hour, which helped."
The librarian, Dorothy G. Davis, knows each student not only by name but also by reading preference. As students file in, she calls a couple aside to tell them of books she has that she knows they will like; without exception, they trust her judgment.
With so much personal attention it's not surprising that the children do well and that some people would be concerned about the school being ordered to spend more.
"The town has always funded us adequately. You'd always like a little more, of course, but we always get enough," Mr. Butler said. "You tell people we're $26,000 behind, and they ask why the state is bothering us. But it's an issue -- if they let Union get away with it, next it'll be New Haven."
 
Some Political Realities
 Mr. Bradrick said that in a meeting with a state education official, the first thing he was told was that Bridgeport was behind 5 percent on its minimum expenditure requirement, which amounted to millions of dollars, and for political reasons they could not let Union slide if it was similarly low.
"This is not negotiable," Mr. Bradrick said. "They tell you what you have to spend and you spend it. If you don't you'll be in Superior Court in a very short time. It would have been stupid to push the issue -- the case law is on the state's side, and the resources are on the state's side. So we cut the check."
But Mr. Bradrick said the problem would continue to plague Union as the minimum expenditure requirement keeps pace with inflation, probably going up faster than the town's tax collections will grow, unless there is a tax increase.
And towns cannot count the cost of transportation or special education towards the requirement. In a large city, the special education costs don't vary much from year to year, but in a small town like Union special education can cripple the school budget, Mr. Bradrick said. "You have one kid move in with special needs, take a $40,000 hit in special education, and it blows us right off the spreadsheet," he said.
 
Going on to High School
 Mr. Butler said another problem was that Union does not operate its own high school. The 35 students in grades 9 to 12 go to Stafford, where the town pays $6,000 a student a year, compared with $7,500 a year or more that other towns pay for high school students at other schools.
"If we were to pay $1,000 more for the 25 kids we sent to Stafford, it would have brought us up to the M.E.R.," Mr. Butler said. "We get a great deal from Stafford. It's kind of hard to brag about that, because you don't want Stafford to turn around and up the price."
The school ended up spending the $26,000 by hiring the teacher's aide for the first and second grades as well as buying books and new computers.
Mr. Bradrick said what bothered him was that no one checked to see what the towns were spending the money on. "Whether they spend it on a teacher's aide and books or on pizza doesn't make any difference. The state only cares that they spend it," he said.

TRUE CRIME
ABOVE SUSPICION
By Joe Sharkey.
Simon & Schuster, $23. 
 If Mark Putnam wasn't the all-American boy, he was close. Handsome, athletic, intelligent, married to a beautiful woman and the father of two children, he was also fulfilling a childhood dream when he became an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. So what if his first assignment was in Pikeville, Ky., an economically depressed area in the Appalachians? The opportunity to shine was there, and Mr. Putnam, a straight-arrow go-getter from Connecticut, set out to impress his superiors. Early on, he met Susan Smith, a high school dropout and divorced mother of two, whose social set included drug dealers and bank robbers. Soon she settled into the role of F.B.I. informant. In "Above Suspicion," Mr. Sharkey tells how her unlikely relationship with Mr. Putnam resulted in adultery, then murder. However, the crime itself is not really the point for Mr. Sharkey, who previously wrote "Deadly Greed" and "Death Sentence." Rather, through his extensive interviews with Mr. Putnam and his wife, Kathy, the author gives us a close examination of the mind of an ordinary man driven to an extraordinary act. The book is sympathetic to Mr. Putnam, who is serving a 16-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to manslaughter, and he emerges not as admirable but certainly as understandable.

HEADLINE: Alliances for Progress

SERIES: HEALTH CARE: SECOND OPINIONS -- An Occasional Series

BYLINE: By Paul Starr; Paul Starr, professor of sociology at Princeton University, worked on the development of the Clinton plan and is author, most recently, of "The Logic of Health Care Reform."

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
The obituaries are already being prepared for the regional purchasing alliances that are central to President Clinton's plan for health reform and Representative Jim Cooper's alternative.
But before the final verdict, the public has a right to know whether the critics have any real answers to the problems the alliances would address. 
 Today, insurers compete to avoid sick people, marketing selectively to the healthy and screening out those at high risk of illness through a variety of practices both crude and subtle. As a result, Americans' access to coverage and the price they pay for it depend on their personal characteristics, especially their job and health.
As health costs soar, people in the smallest firms, the self-employed and those outside the work force face the greatest barriers to coverage. Staggering administrative costs accentuate the problem: these Americans typically get only 60 cents in health-care benefits for every dollar they or their employers pay for premiums.
Rising health costs have also prompted many large employers to cut benefits or introduce a single health plan that restricts choice of physician. The employer's power to choose an insurer mattered little when virtually all companies offered a traditional fee-for-service plan. But with the rise of managed care, employers now choose which doctors and hospitals their workers and families use. This is an extraordinary usurpation: no one would tolerate an employer's dictating its employees' choice of schools or housing.
The alliances would shift the choice of a health plan from employers to individuals; they would not be insurers themselves but rather new gateways to the array of plans available in a community. They would use the economies of joint purchasing to cut the high administrative costs that plague the insurance market for small groups. And they would change the ground rules for insurance; any insurer wanting to do business would have to accept all comers, healthy or sick.
Under the Cooper and Clinton plans, the alliances would have to offer all qualifying plans -- with a few key differences. Mr. Cooper's alliances would serve only small businesses, Medicaid beneficiaries and those otherwise uninsured. The President's plan would extend choice to all consumers: more than 80 percent of those under 65 would participate in regional alliances offering a much broader array of health plans than individual employers can provide. Only the largest private companies (those with more than 5,000 employees) could run alliances of their own, and they would also have to provide a choice of at least three plans.
Also unlike the Cooper plan, the Administration's would require alliances to offer a fee-for-service option, in which people could continue to choose their own doctors, and would give the regional alliances and states the rate-setting authority to keep fee-for-service plans affordable.
Critics suggest that the President's aims can be achieved without the alliances, by such reforms of the insurance market as requiring insurers to charge the same premiums for all consumers regardless of health, employment or other personal characteristics. But the alliances are needed precisely to carry out those reforms.
If insurers can sign up individuals directly, they will seek out the healthy and shun the sick as surely as water rolls downhill. So it is critical that an independent body -- the alliance -- conduct the enrollment and prevent "cherry-picking."
If alliances are purely voluntary, as some Senate Republicans propose, employers with relatively affluent and healthy workers will stay out to avoid sharing in the costs of the unemployed and the poor. The secession of the healthy would sharply increase premiums, administrative costs (the alliances would need to market their services) and Government subsidies to make coverage affordable.
Critics object that the alliances represent a "new layer of bureaucracy." But the alliances would subtract more bureaucracy than they would add, eliminating costs associated with brokers and underwriters.
At the annual open enrollment, consumers would choose a plan -- and for most, that would be their only contact with the alliance all year. For the first time, benefits would come in easily compared, standard packages with uniform definitions and claim forms. If employees changed jobs while remaining in the same region, their coverage would generally be unaffected. This is simpler than today.
The idea of purchasing alliances is hardly new or untried. The Federal employees' health plan and the California Public Employee Retirement System have been buying health care for large groups of employees for years. They are easy to use, and their administrative costs are low. To be sure, alliances would have additional functions; for example, under the Clinton plan the alliances would determine the Government subsidies for low-income people. But that function must be lodged somewhere, even by the conservative proposals.
The great irony of the charge that the alliances would be too bureaucratic is that the moderate and conservative plans generally leave the current bureaucratic thicket unpruned and just add more complexity to it.
Lobbying on the issue has been lopsidedly against alliances for the simple reason that the groups that now dominate the health care industry do not want to confront the organized purchasing power of broad-based alliances. But if Congress doesn't create soundly structured alliances, it will have to find another way to provide coverage at an affordable cost.
That might involve opening Medicare to people under 65, as some members of Congress are now discussing. Medicare could compete with private carriers, operating an insurance plan that would be available to employers or individuals. But insurers would be likely to "cherry-pick," leaving Medicare with the most costly enrollees; that risk could be minimized by requiring insurers to offer any plan through alliances that they offered to employers, at no less favorable rates. This may not be what the industry wants, but guaranteed access to Medicare and private plans would be a powerful assurance to the public that choice will be preserved.

HEADLINE: Let the Market Decide About Milk Hormone

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Farmers Eager to Test Drug to Get More Milk" (news article, Feb. 5), about bovine growth hormone, was very fair. I agree with and support "The Milk Brouhaha" (editorial, Feb. 10). But I must raise strong objection to "Make Them Label It" (letter, Feb. 21) by Michael K. Hansen and Jean M. Halloran of Consumers Union's Consumer Policy Institute. They are using misinformation to create a food scare. 
 Bovine growth hormone is simply the advancement of food technology. Its early ancestors are the tractor, pesticides and hybrid corn. Is this hormone bad for consumers? No. The Food and Drug Administration has conclusively proved that. The conjecture that there will be more antibiotics as a result of increased mastitis is a shamelessly false and demagogic attempt at creating a scare for political gain.
Right now if a farmer's milk tests too high for antibiotics -- and every load is tested -- the buyer dumps it and refuses to buy from the farmer until his milk tests clean. Most dairy farmers live a hand-to-mouth life, as it is, so the argument that they would jeopardize their livelihood and their families by using too many antibiotics or hurting their cows is blown-up verbiage thought up in a city office by people who have never met a farmer, let alone been on a dairy farm.
Is it bad for farmers? We're not sure yet. It will either devastate hard-hit small and medium dairy farmers (particularly in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Pennsylvania), or they will adapt and become more competitive. My feeling is devastation will prevail. Unfortunately, small and medium dairy farmers have been unwilling to adjust to modern economic reality. Vermont dairy farms have been reduced to a tourist attraction because of their inability to adapt to subsidy cuts and low market prices.
The Reagan and Bush Administrations responded to the power of the suburban vote and slashed farm subsidies 60 percent to 75 percent since 1983. The dairy program took the hardest hit. I disagreed with the depth of the cuts and the speed of their implementation. As a result, traditional dairy states like Minnesota and Wisconsin lost thousands of farms. Minnesota dropped from the No. 3 dairy state in 1980 to the No. 6 dairy state by 1994.
Small dairy operations of 60 to 100 cows were replaced by thousand-cow herds in California, New Mexico and more recently Idaho and Washington. Why? Market forces and advanced technology. That's what the American suburban voter wants.
There are real food safety problems in this country, especially in inspection of seafood and beef, and practically all imported food. But bovine growth hormone has been under intense scrutiny for 10 years.
Leave it up to the consumer-voter. Congress could have banned bovine growth hormone last summer, and it didn't. Neither would the Wisconsin and Minnesota legislatures.
Consumers want cheap, plentiful food. Market forces gave the incentive to bring bovine growth hormone this far, and only market forces can now reject it.

HEADLINE: U.S. DRUG INDUSTRY FIGHTS REPUTATION FOR PRICE GOUGING

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS with ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
When President Clinton stood before an audience at an Arlington, Va., health clinic last year and characterized the pharmaceutical industry as a bunch of price gougers, executives of the nation's drug companies had what their scientists might call a convulsive reaction.
After the initial shock, the industry sought strong remedies to counter the threat. In the 12 months since that speech, the drug companies have mounted a sophisticated campaign that has included frequent visits to Washington by their top executives, a multimillion-dollar advertising blitz, hefty campaign contributions to members of Congress and intense lobbying of the lawmakers who receive those donations.
 
Counteroffensive Moves
 Lodewijk J. R. de Vink, president of the Warner-Lambert Company, said: "The President's accusations put us immediately on guard, in a very defensive mode. We never anticipated that kind of frontal attack. We decided to mount a counteroffensive." 
 In the first 10 months of 1993, the pharmaceutical industry vastly increased its political donations, according to Citizen Action, a Washington-based research group. The drug industry's giving was up 20 percent compared with the same 10-month period two years ago, the equivalent period in the election cycle.
Steven P. Berchem, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, also said the group spent $7 million on newspaper and magazine advertising to improve the "public perception" of the industry last year. The association stepped up the campaign and added television advertising in January and has budgeted $9 million for its television advertising and $4 million for print advertising this year.
 
Ailing Public Image
 The drug companies are still on the defensive, but appear to be gaining ground, as Congress prepares for the first votes on health care legislation. The situation is a case study of how one industry has been working to thwart an important part of the Clinton health plan, the effort to hold down drug costs.
Adding to the threat from the Clintons' decision to cast them as the villainous "special interests" in the health care debate along with the insurance industry, the drug companies received alarming news from their consultants last fall. The companies, which always portrayed themselves as devoted to saving lives while making profits, were told in a confidential report from McKinsey & Company that in the public mind they ranked as low as the tobacco industry, which threatens lives along with profits.
In response, some of the major drug companies decided that the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association was not nimble enough to counter the Clinton plan. They hired a leading Washington public relations company, Powell Tate, founded by Jody Powell, press secretary for President Jimmy Carter, to try to reshape the debate.
Their principal argument: Drug companies are the main source of new medicines, and limiting their profits would cripple the search for drugs to cure diseases like AIDS, Alzheimer's and cancer.
Dr. Sheldon C. Gilgore, chairman of G. D. Searle & Company, a subsidiary of the Monsanto Company, said the public did not fully understand the industry. "People believe that drugs are discovered by government or academia, and that we just sell them and make lots of money," he said.
After President Clinton's denunciation of drug makers, many people expected him to propose direct Federal regulation of drug prices. Yet such price controls were not included in the bill he sent to Congress in October. The bill did call for restrictions on drug prices for elderly Medicare beneficiaries and Federal review of prices charged for new drugs that offer a significant advance over existing therapies. To drug companies, these proposals were as unacceptable as price controls.
 
Winning Friends And Influence
 A recent Congressional hearing showed how the drug companies might be winning their fight. Several members of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health warned that Federal review of drug prices would damage research to develop new cures. Almost all the lawmakers who criticized this part of the Clinton plan have received sizable donations from the pharmaceutical industry.
For example, Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of Brooklyn, said he was convinced that the Clinton proposal would create a major obstacle to finding new drugs. "We can't count on continued research and development if we have this kind of Government regulation," he said, adding that he had received this message from many doctors.
Mr. Towns did not return telephone calls asking him to identify the doctors and to discuss whether he had, in fact, heard such arguments from drug industry lobbyists. In the last four years, Mr. Towns has received more than $30,000 in campaign contributions from drug companies.
The Administration's effort to curb drug prices comes at a time when radical changes in the market are already squeezing the profits of pharmaceutical manufacturers, long used to being among the most profitable of American companies.
Mariola B. Haggar, a securities analyst who follows the drug industry for Salomon Brothers, said prescription drug sales in the United States total $60 billion a year.
Ms. Haggar said the decline in profit margins for drug companies in each of the last two years was attributable to the huge growth of managed care. Drug companies find that they must offer discounts to get on the formularies of health maintenance organizations and other buyers. Formularies are lists of approved drugs that can be prescribed by doctors.
Drug company executives say that H.M.O.'s and other forms of managed care will soon account for more than half of the industry's sales in this country. "This industry has been extremely profitable, but the profits have been under pressure and we don't expect that pressure to abate soon," Ms. Haggar said.
Senator David Pryor of Arkansas, a close friend of the Clintons and a longtime critic of drug companies, said, "Their prices are unconscionable, and they simply can't justify them."
He added: "This is not like lipstick or perfume. These are drugs that people need to live, and now they're trying to brainwash Congress into believing that if they do not allow them to continue to set their own prices, they will give up trying to find a cure for cancer, for AIDS, for Alzheimer's."
But some members of Congress doubt whether the price restraint will last. At a hearing on drug prices on Feb. 8, Representative Henry A. Waxman, chairman of the health subcommittee, wondered aloud if it was just a ploy by drug companies to help them weather the threat of price controls.
The California Democrat said, "We have no way of knowing whether this change reflects a strategy on the part of the companies to moderate prices during the debate about health care legislation."
 
Fighting for Jobs In New Jersey
 The drug industry has many friends in Congress, but few so reliable as the New Jersey Congressional delegation. New Jersey is to pharmaceuticals as Texas is to oil, Louisiana to gas and Connecticut to insurance.
Pharmaceuticals account for nearly 60,000 jobs in New Jersey, the largest number of any industry. The state's two Senators and 13 House members count on campaign contributions from the state's drug companies. The industry's political action committees have given members of the delegation at least $400,000 in the last five years, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a research group in Washington. That figure does not include donations from drug company officials.
The drug industry first flourished in New Jersey after the turn of the century when George W. Merck, the son of a German chemical manufacturer, bought 120 acres of land in Rahway. German and Swiss companies that dominated the chemical and nostrum industry soon followed. Merck, its headquarters now in Whitehouse Station, N.J., remains an industry leader.
The industry's power was demonstrated in January when the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce held its annual dinner in Washington for the state's Congressional delegation. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, told lawmakers that it was essential for them to oppose any elements of the Clinton health plan that would reduce pharmaceutical company profits.
Such a view is a bipartisan tenet of New Jersey politics. Mrs. Whitman's predecessor, Jim Florio, a Democrat, personally lobbied Mr. Clinton to forgo wide-ranging price controls on drugs.
The industry's entreaties to the Administration are complemented by the efforts of its friends in Congress. Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, is widely viewed as the industry's most effective defender in Congress. In recent years, Senator Bradley led a successful fight against legislation that would have prevented companies from raising prescription drug prices more than the Consumer Price Index and he helped retain much of the valuable drug company tax breaks for manufacturing in Puerto Rico.
Mr. Bradley said in an interview that the health of the drug industry in New Jersey was important to him as he considered such issues. "The reality," he said, "is that it employs the highest number of any industry in the state." He said he opposed price controls on drugs because he is generally opposed to price controls. And while he believes the tax breaks for companies in Puerto Rico are bad tax policy, it should be phased out rather than eliminated suddenly, which he said would provide an economic shock to Puerto Rico and the drug industry.
In his last campaign in 1990, Mr. Bradley received about $59,000 from the prescription drug industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. Mr. Bradley said suggestions that his positions were affected by such donations were ludicrous and it was for that reason he no longer accepts contributions from political action committees.
 
Objecting to Part Of Clinton Proposal
 President Clinton proposes to expand Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, to cover prescription drugs. Most drug companies agree that drugs should be part of the standard package of benefits under any health plan, in part because they can reduce the need for expensive services like surgery.
But drug companies strenuously object to other parts of the Clinton plan, especially the proposal for the Government to review the prices charged for innovative drugs to see if they were "reasonable."
The Government would also demand a discount, or rebate, on drugs dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries. The Secretary of Health and Human Services could deny Medicare coverage for new drugs if the Government could not negotiate "an acceptable rebate amount." For existing drugs, manufacturers would have to give the Government a discount equal to at least 17 percent of the retail price.

HEADLINE: Fishing Fleet Trawling Seas That Yield Many Fewer Fish

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 6

 BODY:
For the volunteers who count fish returning from the sea to fresh water, this has been the loneliest year ever. The surging Pacific salmon and steelhead are gone; what the fish counters at the Puget Sound ship locks see when they stare at the glass wall separating them from the water is nothing but a reflection of their own faces.
Across the country, in Gloucester and New Bedford, Mass., the story is the same. After 350 years, the oldest American fishing area is largely barren of the great swarms of haddock, cod and flounder that sustained more than 10 generations of New Englanders and became millions of fish sticks. 
 The Atlantic fishermen have asked that the Government treat them like earthquake disaster victims. Last week, they honked their boat horns in Boston Harbor to draw attention to their plight. To some, it was a funeral dirge.
 
Echoes of a Sad Song
 From Chesapeake Bay, where oystermen are fading like fog in the afternoon sun, to the Gulf of Mexico, where grouper and red snapper are mostly a memory, people who pull fish from the sea for a living are singing the same sad song.
Government officials say most of the major commercial fishing areas in this country outside Alaska are in trouble; worldwide, 13 of the 17 principal fishing zones are depleted or in steep decline because of overfishing and pollution.
As for salmon in the Pacific Northwest, and three main commercial species in New England, the decline is catastrophic -- threatening to wipe out not only whole industries but also cultures and communities that depend on the catch.
 
A Year Without Salmon
 For the first time, there may be no ocean salmon fishing on the West Coast this year, a situationroughly akin to Georgia not producing any peaches.
Fishing communities in Massachusetts are in such bad shape that Gov. William F. Weld last week requested emergency financial aid from the Federal Government. Thousands of fishermen are in "immediate danger" of losing their homes and boats this spring, Mr. Weld said.
But aside from devotees of the taste of wild fish, consumers may not notice a shortage at the supermarket. In recent years, farm fish raised in pens in Norway or South America have flooded the market, driving down the price of fish.
In some cases, the lowered prices have led fishermen to harvest more ocean fish in compensation. About 40 percent of the nation's important saltwater species have been overfished, meaning more fish have been taken than there are young fish to replace them, according to a recent report by the National Marine Fisheries Service.
Who exactly is at fault in the decline is much debated. Old-time fishermen blame factory trawlers, boats the size of football fields that use sonar and satellite communications to track huge schools of fish in remote areas. The trawler owners blame small-boat operators who do not follow the rules, fishing out of season or using illegal nets. Environmentalists blame industries that have drained wetlands and dumped poisons into shallow bays.
Experts seem to agree on a few points. Pollution has indeed played a role, they say: Pacific salmon have disappeared because the freshwater streams where they spawn have been soiled or are blocked by dams. Restoring the streams in the Northwest may cost more than $2 billion.
But, the experts say, fishermen themselves are also to blame for taking more than the sea could give back in New England, the mid-Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. "You can boil it all down to the fact that there are far too many fishermen and not enough fish," said Dick Schaefer, the conservation director of the national fisheries service.
Technology has made fishing so sophisticated that major marine areas can be cleaned out in a short time.
And the system set up to regulate these public resources is awash with conflicts of interest. Fishing in United States waters is regulated by eight regional councils, which themselves are dominated by the fishing industry. In most cases, the councils have been unable or unwilling to set fishing limits for themselves.
Critics say it is as if the national forests were handed over to the timber industry to decide how many trees to cut every year. The fishermen who defend the present system say the councils are weighted toward their industry because they are the most knowledgeable and have a self-interest in preserving fishermen's livelihood.
As a result, most fishing areas are free-for-alls, as fisherman try to catch as many fish as possible before a rival does. Congressional leaders say the councils will probably be remade this year as legislators consider reauthorizing the nation's fundamental fishing law, the Magnuson Act.
"If I had my druthers, these councils would be run by professional managers rather than political appointees," said Wally Pereyra, a member of one of the panels, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, which covers Alaskan waters. "But as it is, if you removed people who have a stake in the industry, you'd probably have to excuse everyone on the council."
Like many members of these councils, Mr. Pereyra has a financial stake in what he is regulating. A marine biologist, he owns a share in a factory trawler that takes pollock from the Bering Sea.
 
More Demand for Fish
 Worldwide, fish provide more than half of all the animal protein consumed by people. As the global population has exploded, fishing has tried to keep up with the demand, growing by more than 50 percent in one generation's time.
But the oceans, which cover 70 percent of the earth's surface, may have reached the limit of what they can produce. Nine out of the world's 17 major fisheries are in serious decline, and four others are classified as commercially depleted, according to a report last summer by the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Office.
United States officials thought they could avoid becoming part of a global trend of overfishing when they passed the Magnuson Act in 1976. It expanded the coastal economic zone claimed by the United States from 3 miles offshore to 200 miles, effectively chasing away large foreign fishing fleets.
But with foreign fishermen gone, Americans began to build up their fleet, buying huge vessels and equipment with low-interest loans backed by the Government.
For several years, times were good. In the North Pacific, fishermen took in $1.5 billion a year for their Alaskan pollock. In the Gulf of Mexico, the number of shrimpers increased significantly, although this led to a large decline in the species of fish, like groupers and red snappers, that are accidently caught in the small-mesh shrimp nets.
And in New England, many fishermen had record years as they went after the bounty that had been claimed by boats from Russia, Germany and Spain.
 
Too Many Boats
 But now there are too many boats and not enough fish. Representative Gerry E. Studds, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, has proposed that the Government pay fishermen to get out of the business. Here in Seattle, home port for most of the North Pacific trawlers, fishermen spend as much time in bankruptcy court as they do mending nets.
"The problem of foreign overfishing has been replaced by even more serious overfishing by the American fishing industry," said Valerie Christy, a spokeswoman for the Marine Conservation Network, a coalition of major environmental groups.
With boat mortgages and equipment costs to meet, some fishermen are loath to limit their catch as a way of providing for future years, although some of their colleagues criticize that as shortsighted.
"The ocean is a farm," said Harold Lashley, a 78-year-old retired fisherman in Gloucester. "If you take away all the feed and the females, when it comes time to plant, you haven't got any seed. Leave it alone. Seed the ocean and allow the fish to grow."
To protect the fish that are left, the Government has closed a large part of Georges Bank, the continental shelf east of Cape Cod whose stocks of cod, haddock and flounder have been exhausted, and has approved a plan to restrict fishing days, reducing the catch off New England by 50 percent over the next five to seven years.
 
Signs of Life
 The measures were put in place only after the council that is supposed to regulate New England fishing was sued in Federal court. Similarly, on the West Coast, several groups are threatening lawsuits to force the regional council to protect fish species. The council considered a total ban on salmon fishing two years ago but did not proceed, and the region is now seeing the lowest number of fish returning to spawn in memory.
There are several bright spots in American fishing waters, primarily in areas with heavy regulation. New England lobster fishing has remained steady. Striped bass and mackerel have made strong comebacks on the East Coast after conservation measures were put in place. In Alaska, the nation's most productive fishing waters, the salmon catch last year was a record 200 million fish.
Some experts point to Alaska salmon as an example of how to manage fish. In Alaska, fishermen are allowed to go after the catch only after state officials determine that enough fish to sustain future generations have returned to spawning grounds. And there is a limit on the number of fishermen. Most other American fisheries are wide open, with no restrictions on the numbers of fishermen or the size of their catch. .
If present trends hold, not only will major American fishing areas continue to decline, but the culture that revolve around them may also disappear. The Magnuson Act requires fishing managers to consider preserving "a way of life" as they try to conserve fish. But putting that into policy has been difficult.
Mr. Lashley, the Gloucester fisherman, says his family has been in fishing for hundreds of years, but that will change. Mr. Lashley said his grandson, Michael Lashley, 28, "will definitely be the last fishermen in the family."

HEADLINE: Ukrainian Hints Deal on Warheads Is in Danger

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, March 6

 BODY:
As Russia's natural-gas company announced a further deep cut in supplies to Ukraine over the weekend, President Leonid M. Kravchuk suggested that the move could derail the deal to give up his country's large nuclear arsenal.
Speaking to the television of the Commonwealth of Independent States from Washington on Saturday night, Mr. Kravchuk said: "Fulfillment of all agreements, including agreements on nuclear commitments, is possible only if the economy works. If tomorrow factories come to a halt in Ukraine, and this is a reality if there is no gas, what carrying out of commitments can be spoken of?" 
 Mr. Kravchuk spoke after the White House doubled a foreign aid package to Ukraine, worth $700 million, in response to the former Soviet republic's ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty last month and seeming commitment to relinquish its more than 1,600 nuclear warheads and become a nonnuclear nation.
At a meeting in the Oval Office on Friday, Mr. Kravchuk assured President Clinton that "Ukraine will fulfill its commitment" and announced that the first trainload of 60 nuclear warheads was on its way to Russia. Officials told the Itar-Tass news agency that it had arrived today.
 
Playing Its Trump Card
 In Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, Deputy Prime Minister Valery Shmarov tried to soften Mr. Kravchuk's statement, explaining that it would be hard for Ukraine to devote resources to disarmament while facing economic distress, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported.
Although Russian gas supplies were not specifically part of the three-way nuclear agreement signed with Mr. Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin in Moscow in January, Ukraine is now playing its nuclear trump card in hopes of getting Moscow to resume gas deliveries despite Kiev's inability to pay $900 million Russia for previous shipments.
A clause in the agreement protects Ukraine "against economic coercion." But this guarantee -- if it even applies to Russia's request that it be paid world prices for gas -- does not come into effect until the Ukrainian Parliament ratifies the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a treaty that would formally establish Ukraine's nonnuclear status.
Russia's cuts of 1.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas on Thursday and 2.8 billion cubic feet on Saturday have left Ukraine with only about one-fifth of its normal gas supplies from Moscow.
As a result, factories have been ordered to reduce gas consumption by 75 percent so heat can still be provided to Ukraine's 52 million people through the end of winter.
Ukraine's current inability to reduce its debt is attributed to factories that have not paid the state for their energy consumption in months.
 
Western Customers Worried
 A long-term solution to Ukraine's energy problem is not simply financial: inefficient industry here consumes at least two times more energy than industry in developed nations. The dispute between Moscow and Kiev is also intertwined with a political dispute in which Russia has used Ukraine's $3.2 billion overall energy debt as a bargaining chip to gain Ukraine's share of the 350-vessel Black Sea fleet, which is based in Ukraine.
Russia's Western customers, primarily Germany, France and Italy, are worried that they too could be affected by a complete cutoff to Ukraine if the dispute is not resolved. More than 90 percent of Russia's natural-gas exports cross Ukraine, which could easily siphon gas from pipelines to the West.

HEADLINE: Ex-Mayor's Son Wins a Run-Off In New Orleans

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, March 6

 BODY:
Voters here elected State Senator Marc Morial to be their mayor in a run-off election on Saturday, apparently punishing his opponent for what they considered dirty campaigning. But polls suggested that they also had doubts that their new leader would be able to slow the city's economic slide, reduce crime or improve education.
The vote also broke along racial lines, in a city that is 61 percent black and 39 percent white. Mr. Morial, the 36-year-old son of the city's first black Mayor, won 85 percent of the black vote. His opponent, Donald Mintz, a 51-year-old white businessman and lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for mayor four years ago, won 91 percent of the white vote. 
 Final unofficial returns in the race gave Mr. Morial 93,094 votes, or 54 percent, to 77,730, or 46 percent, for Mr. Mintz.
In a primary election last month, Mr. Mintz led a field of candidates that included three whites and seven blacks. But on Saturday, said Edward Renwick, director of the Loyola Institute of Politics here, "There was a surge in the black vote over the first primary, and nearly all of that increase went to Morial."
Mr. Renwick partly credited good campaign work by the Morial forces, but he said another important factor was the persistence of accusations linking Mr. Mintz to anonymous campaign fliers with anti-black and anti-Semitic slogans.
 
Anger About Fliers
 Mr. Mintz acknowledged using the fliers in a national fund-raising effort, although he repeatedly denied creating them. By Election Day, interviews and polls showed that many black voters were angry about the fliers, and even some of Mr. Mintz's supporters said they would vote for him while holding their noses.
"I voted for Morial because he is black and understands the struggle of black people here," said Stacy Andrews, as she left the polls in the predominantly black Seventh Ward. "But I also voted for him because they were trying to discredit him."
In the racially mixed and economically diverse Black Pearl section, Pat Hamilton, a white voter, said she "lost a lot of respect for Mintz for using the fliers" but voted for him anyway. "I was taking a chance," she said.
 
Doubt About Improvements
 On May 2 Mr. Morial will take over the reins of city government from Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, who was barred by the city charter from seeking a third term. Eight years ago Mr. Barthelemy succeeded Mr. Morial's father, the combative and pioneering Ernest (Dutch) Morial, who is now dead.
Just as many voters in this city of 497,000 people reacted against the fliers, they also told pollsters for local news organizations that they doubted whether anyone could make significant improvements in life here.
Many seemed to recognize that forces beyond politics were behind the recent sagging of some of the city's economic pillars. Tim Ryan, an economist at the University of New Orleans, said the region's shipbuilding industry was an example of the bad luck that has struck in the last decade. The industry had a slump in demand for its vessels and off-shore drilling rigs as the oil and gas business declined, only to be hit again as cuts in military shipbuilding began in the 90's.
Through all of this, New Orleans, like other cities, has suffered from a shrinking tax base as businesses and the middle class moved to the suburbs, a 1992 study by the university's National Center for the Revitalization of Central Cities showed. But unlike most other cities it has been limited by state-imposed caps on taxing authority and barriers to the annexation of growing suburbs.
The city's major growth area has been tourism but that sector's continued growth appears to be threatened by increasing crime.
Both candidates said they were worried about the city's decline in economic diversity. Although the city's 6.1 percent unemployment rate is relatively low, most here insist with a religious conviction that far more people have dropped out of the work force and thus out of the statistics, which reflect only those looking for work.
Mr. Ryan said that even the increased employment many people had expected after the approval of a gambling casino in the city last year had not materialized as quickly as some had hoped. Because of delays from lawsuits and lease negotiations, the city is likely to gain only 3,600 new jobs from the casino legalization this year rather than the tens of thousands that had been expected.
In his victory speech on Saturday, Mr. Morial said: "Tomorrow we will start rebuilding the city in the physical sense and the spiritual sense. We don't plan to take a vacation."
Bob Tucker, the chairman of Mr. Morial's campaign, said today that the Mayor-elect had not "basked in victory," but had begun meetings to put together an administration and programs.
 
Last-Minute Swing
 Analyses of the voting showed that Mr. Morial's being the son of the city's first black Mayor cut both ways, because his father was greatly respected by most blacks for his assertiveness but was disdained by many whites who considered him brash and combative.
For some whites, this made the younger Mr. Morial seem to be a product of the old politics in the city, but lacking his father's savvy and experience. For many older blacks, said Prof. Silas Lee, a pollster and political scientist at predominantly black Xavier University here, the younger Mr. Morial could hardly live up to the political legend that his father had become to them.
It was only in the end with the issue of the fliers and a television commercial by Sybil Morial, Marc Morial's mother and a respected figure in the city, that older black voters came rushing to the younger Morial's defense, with one expressing the hope that he would prove to be "a chip off the old block."
"The older black voters were vulnerable for Morial, and they could have gone for Mintz," Professor Lee said. "But in the last month when they started running the ads with his mother speaking for him and having ads showing state legislators talking of his political skills and impressive record in one term in the State Senate, that helped. The timing was perfect, and it was perfectly targeted."

HEADLINE: Burmese General Bars Talks Soon With Arrested Democracy Leader

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: YANGON, Myanmar, March 6

 BODY:
The head of Burmese military intelligence, Lieut. Gen. Khin Nyunt, today ruled out early talks between himself and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the imprisoned democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, describing her attitude as "negative and counterproductive."
In an interview, General Khin Nyunt, who is widely seen as the most powerful member of the junta that runs Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, said he had sent senior military officers in recent weeks to meet with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. 
 Face-to-face talks between him and the democracy leader might be possible eventually, he said, but "this is a matter that is delicate, a matter on which we must ponder deeply."
 
No Timetable for Talks
 He offered no timetable for further talks or for the release of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who is in her fifth year of house arrest. And he repeatedly questioned her legitimacy as a political leader, her popularity among the Burmese public and even her patriotism.
"From what we see, her supporters are only from outside Myanmar," he said. "She has been portrayed as a great leader of the country basically by groups outside of the country."
Despite his harsh words, diplomats said the disclosure by General Khin Nyunt that he had sent representatives to speak with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi after her meetings last month with an American Congressman suggested that the junta was considering some sort of dialogue with her.
But it appears that it could now be months before the military makes a final decision about what to do with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose freedom has become a condition for Myanmar in its bid to restore full diplomatic relations and trade with the United States and other Western countries.
The possibility of direct talks between the general and Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was raised by the Congressman, Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee who last month became the first non-family foreign visitor to see her since 1989.
 
Daughter of National Hero
 Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of the army general who is considered the father of the nation, Aung San, immediately accepted the offer of talks and said that all issues were open for negotiation -- except her departure from the country.
General Khin Nyunt said today that it was impossible for him to consider a dialogue with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi until after full deliberations within the junta, which calls itself the State Law and Order Restoration Council, and within Government agencies overseen by the military.
"This is a very complex matter, and we will have to take many factors into account -- national politics, international relations," he said in his first interview with a Western news organization in two years. "This is not something that I alone can decide."
He said it was also important that the junta not be seen as bowing to the demands of foreign governments.
"It would not be good or appropriate that we do this or that because of external pressure, because the United States says this or that," he said.
But the general emphasized that Myanmar was eager for better relations with Washington, which has led the international community in efforts to isolate the junta over its human rights record. "We wish to go back to a good relationship," he said.
During and after the visit from Mr. Richardson in mid-February, General Khin Nyunt said, he sent "senior officers to meet with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on my behalf."
 
'She Doesn't Think Much of Us'
 "Our impression is that she doesn't think much of us," the general said, "and so I think that she doesn't want to be serious."
He did not discuss details of the conversations between the officers and Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, except to say they had asked her "what it would take to fulfill her needs." Her attitude "on all these occasions was rather negative and counterproductive," he said.
General Khin Nyunt is described by diplomats here as a highly intelligent and calculating commander who is the first among equals in the junta, which assumed complete government power in 1988 in a violent crackdown on followers of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. His title within the junta is Secretary-1, and he is widely known by the Burmese public simply as "S-1."
Representative Richardson said after meeting the general that he was a "pragmatic individual who is sincere about wanting to resolve the divisions in his country."
General Khin Nyunt is considered a protege of Gen. Ne Win, the erratic, xenophobic leader of Burma from 1962 until his formal retirement in 1988, although apart from the loyalty they enjoy among their deputies and the fear they inspire among many Burmese, there seems little to connect the two. Where General Ne Win gathered political advice from soothsayers, General Khin Nyunt is said to seek out Western-educated economists and business leaders. General Ne Win enjoyed his leisure and made frequent holiday visits to Europe, while General Khin Nyunt impresses diplomats with his 18-hour workdays, seven days a week.
Unlike several colleagues, General Khin Nyunt has a reputation unstained by allegations of corruption. But there is grave concern among diplomats about his reputation, as head of military intelligence, for using brute force against opponents of the junta.
General Khin Nyunt speaks English, and he did not require translations of the questions asked today, but he responded in Burmese. His answers were carefully worded, especially when the questions involved a timetable for political change in Myanmar.
"If I say something and then it does not happen, it will not be good for me," he said with one of his occasional wily smiles.
 
Some Conciliatory Language
 At times during the two-hour interview, the 54-year-old general appeared conciliatory toward Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, repeatedly using the Burmese honorific "daw" when describing her.
"We still feel that she is our sister," he said. "We have no animosity or hatred towards her."
Still, most of his comments about the 48-year-old democracy leader and her movement were caustic and dismissive. He describes Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi as a political neophyte who allowed herself to be used as a "front" for Burmese Communists during public uprisings in 1988 and 1989.
"She rose up because of the Burmese Communist Party and its underground cells," he said. "She has no experience of life or work in this country. We deeply respect her father, General Aung San, but can you expect us to respect her only because she is her daughter?"
General Khin Nyunt suggested that even if he agreed to face-to-face talks, there would be little to negotiate.
"We don't see any reason why we should have to talk with her about the country's political future or economic status," he said. "There are 42 million people here, and they are not bothered by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi."
In fact, the general almost certainly knows that millions of Burmese are deeply bothered about her plight and view Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi as the country's best hope for democracy. In national elections in 1990, her political party, the National League for Democracy, won a landslide victory that was later annulled by the Burmese military.
 
Joined Democracy Movement
 Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was educated at Oxford and is married to an Oxford don, Michael Aris, was living in the English university town when she was called home to Yangon in 1988 to tend to her ailing mother. During democracy demonstrations later that year in the capital, then called Rangoon, she was recruited into the movement.
She was placed under house arrest in July 1989 as part of a crackdown on the democracy movement -- which the Government has charged was actually under the control of Burmese Communists. Diplomats say 2,000 to 5,000 of her followers were killed in 1988 at the beginning of the crackdown. In 1991 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to restore democracy to Myanmar.
Sitting in a Defense Ministry reception room beneath a portrait of General Ne Win and a painting of Maha Bandoola, the great 19th-century Burmese general, General Khin Nyunt repeatedly turned to the question of whether Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi had given up her right to take part in Burmese politics by spending most of her life abroad.
"She left the country when she was 14," he said. "And after those years she would come here every year for three or four days, not more than a week, and apart from that she has been living all those years outside the country."
Her father was assassinated in 1947, when she was 2 years old.
Asked if Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was a patriot, the general paused a moment before answering. "Please think this through for yourself," he said. "She is married to Michael Aris, a British citizen; her two sons are British citizens." Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi considers her sons to be citizens of both Myanmar and Britain.
 
'A Good Front,' the General Says
 General Khin Nyunt said that in the late 1980's, members of the Burmese Communist Party, which had once mounted a powerful insurgent army, "started searching for a national leader, and they decided that she would be the most appropriate since she was the daughter of the national hero."
"It would be a good front to use her image for their aim to take over power in the country." She made the situation worse, he said, by criticizing the army publicly.
"She was making exhortations to destroy and disintegrate the armed forces," he said, insisting that the army's 1988 crackdown on her movement had saved the country from disintegration.
"The country was about to be destroyed completely, and we were compelled to come out to save the country," he said.
The army, he insisted, has no "craving for power" and will hand over power to a civilian-led government once a new constitution is drafted.
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's followers say -- and most diplomats here agree -- that the Government's allegations of Communist infiltration of her democracy campaign are baseless, and that it is a spontaneous, legitimate movement intent on ending decades of military rule.
While some of her advisers may have had Marxist leanings, diplomats say, Communists do not dominate her movement.

HEADLINE: 4 High-Rises Torn Down By Newark

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWARK, March 6

 BODY:
Four bleak high-rises that have long symbolized Newark's inability to provide decent shelter for its poor were torn down this morning, opening a new chapter in the city's struggle to rebuild its public housing after decades of neglect.
A rumbling explosion destroyed the four 13-story towers at the Christopher Columbus Homes, which were closed in 1990 after local officials, like many of their counterparts around the nation, decided that tall housing projects were ill-conceived social experiments often plagued by overcrowding, crime, vandalism and poor maintenance. 
 "This is the end of an American dream that failed," Mayor Sharpe James said at a ceremony before 3,800 pounds of explosives were detonated at the 38-year-old project, a pockmarked brick complex that glowers over Route 280 in the city's Central Ward.
The long-awaited demolition, shortly after 9 A.M., was one of the largest in the history of American public housing. It capped a seven-year legal battle in which housing advocacy groups demanded that the Newark Housing Authority build a new home for every one it razed.
 
A Harsh Spotlight
 The groups' Federal lawsuit cast a harsh spotlight on the authority, which for decades was so rife with patronage, corruption and mismanagement that Federal officials called it one of the country's worst. Graffiti-scrawled elevators often broke down, repairs were rarely made and drug dealing was commonplace.
Under a new executive director, Harold Lucas, the authority has made some strides in the last year. Last fall it was removed for the first time from a Federal list of troubled housing authorities.
As part of an agreement brokered by Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise of Federal District Court in Newark, the authority was allowed to tear down four of the eight Columbus towers because it had begun building nearly 1,800 town houses after years of delays. It will be permitted to destroy the other four after it starts a second phase of construction.
"This represents a victory," said Stephen Finn, executive director of the Newark Coalition for Low-Income Housing, which filed the lawsuit. "We are certain that if they had blown up Columbus when they wanted to, there would be no new housing today." But Mr. Finn said the authority still needed to make improvements, pointing out that it has about 3,000 vacant apartments out of nearly 11,000, even though it has about 7,500 families on its waiting list. The vacancies are mostly in high-rise buildings that officials want to tear down but cannot until they build replacements.
Before the lawsuit, Newark had wanted to pursue one of the largest public-housing demolition programs in the country. The city planned to tear down nearly 40 of its 46 towers, many of which had deteriorated so badly that they were considered unlivable. More than 30,000 people live in Newark's housing projects.
 
Similar Programs
 Other cities, including St. Louis, have undertaken similar demolition programs, and Philadelphia is considering one. Instead of tearing down its high-rises, Boston has renovated some of them, sharply reducing the number of tenants by creating bigger apartments and more open spaces.
The demolition in Newark today had an oddly festive air, with hundreds of residents gathering to watch on a crisp, sunny morning and dozens of city, county, state and Federal officials turning out to express their joy and relief that the towers were finally being turned into gnarled rubble.
Some residents applauded after the explosion. But not everyone.
 
'My Home for 20 Years'
 "I felt very sad when I saw them going down," said Annie Twitty, 52, the last president of the Columbus tenants' association. "I lived there, called it my home for 20 years. It shouldn't be something they should glorify. They still have a shortage of housing in Newark."
Columbus was built at a time when officials in many industrial cities thought that high-rise projects would be a safe and inexpensive way to house workers who moved north after World War II. But like the Cabrini-Green public housing development in Chicago and the Raymond Rosen Homes in Philadelphia, Columbus eventually earned a reputation as a depressing and frightening place.
"No human should ever have to live that way, no animal should ever have to live that way," a senior Federal housing official, James E. Baugh, said after he toured the Columbus project in the early 1980's.
The Housing Authority closed two buildings at Columbus in 1972, moving tenants to its other projects as it gradually shut the remaining six.
Gordon Cavanaugh, general counsel at the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, a trade organization, said Newark faced perhaps the most daunting challenge of any major city in recreating its public housing because so many of its units are in towers.
"People in public housing are trying to basically take down buildings that shouldn't have been built in the first place," he said. "They have been impossible to manage properly. They are going to replace them with something that is more humane and more manageable."
 
100 Town Houses Completed
 That is the idea of the new town houses in Newark, which are financed by $200 million in Federal aid and reflect the latest thinking in public housing. They are to be scattered across the city so residents are not packed together, giving them more of a sense of living in their own home and making maintenance easier.
Nearly 150 town houses have been completed. Some are supposed to be built on the site of the Columbus project after it is entirely demolished.
To Brenda Evans and her family, the contrast between the towers and the town houses is stark. Ms. Evans, 31, an aide who works with mentally retarded people, moved from a 13-story project into one of the new town houses with her sisters and a nephew a few months ago.
 
A Small Playground
 The town house, at the corner of Livingston Street and Muhammad Ali Avenue, is in a quiet little complex of 20 homes that seems like a pocket of suburbia. The buildings surround a small playground on a patch of grass.
"These are so much better," she said as her nephew, Skyler Evans, 7, played on the swings outside. "They should blow up all those buildings. It's like you were homeless there -- everyone is cramped on top of each other. Here, my nephew can go out and play and we don't have to worry about guarding him."
A neighbor, Edna Lacewell, a former tenants' leader at the sprawling William P. Hayes Homes, said she was happy in her new town house. But she said the towers were still feasible, maintaining that the Housing Authority was blaming design flaws to cover up for its poor management.
"It's not a bad idea," she said. "It's a bad idea when the Housing Authority doesn't screen the families moving in. Now, anyone who wants to move into the complexes can. It makes a difference. I hope they don't tear all of them down. People need some place to live."

HEADLINE: Tokyo's Magic Kingdom Outshines Its Role Model

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: URAYASU, Japan

 BODY:
The air was bone chilling, but the admiring throngs hardly noticed one afternoon as a blue-eyed Snow White smiled engagingly and the Seven Dwarfs performed their antics, singing the tune every child raised on Disney fare knows: "Hi-ho! Hi-ho! Shinpai nai utai tsuzukeyo!"
If home is where the cash registers ring loudest, it would be hard to imagine Mickey Mouse and his friends ensconced more comfortably anyplace other than this bustling plot of landfill on the shores of Tokyo Bay, at Tokyo Disneyland. 
 With 16 million visitors last year, each spending on average about $85, the park, less than 10 miles from downtown Tokyo, has surpassed the original Magic Kingdoms in the United States in attendance.
Indeed, the way the Dwarfs' song has been translated into Japanese is apt -- "Don't worry about a thing, let's continue singing!"
What a contrast with the financial train wreck outside Paris known as Euro Disneyland, where the only thing park officials are singing these days is the blues.
Euro Disneyland, which opened in the spring of 1992 with soaring expectations, reported a $905 million loss for the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, and it lost $94 million more in the three months after that. Its parent, the Walt Disney Company in California, took a $350 million charge last year as a result.
Back in Japan, a market that Disney entered a decade ago with misgivings, it is a different story entirely.
The Oriental Land Company, the owner of Tokyo Disneyland, enjoyed a pretax profit of $202 million in the fiscal year that ended last March 31. And that was in the middle of the worst recession here since the end of World War II.
 
Translating American Icons
 A look at these two overseas parks offers some harsh lessons in the vexing uncertainty of translating American icons into other cultures, and in how important timing can be for such overseas moves. As much as it has been overshadowed by the European disaster, and as different as Japan is from the West, the 11-year-old Tokyo theme park is an enormous success. Increasingly, it is drawing affluent young people from all over Asia.
No, Cinderella does not wear a kimono here, and Winnie the Pooh has not forsaken his beloved honey for sushi. In fact, except for some subtle but telling changes, Tokyo Disneyland is a near replica of the American original.
Almost all the signs are in English, with occasional lines of Japanese and, now that other Asians are coming here, Chinese. The white-and-red Japanese flag is never flown, but various versions of the Stars and Stripes flutter from atop reproductions of American-style buildings.
It is so sanitized and precise in its depiction of an unthreatening, fantasy America that, in an odd sort of way, the park has become totally Japanese. And that, of course, is just the way the Japanese want it. Indeed, the park is reminiscent of the traditional Japanese garden, which reproduces a tightly confined version of nature that is supposed to be more satisfying and perfect than the real thing.
 
Enjoying the 'Japanese Dream'
 When Japanese come to Tokyo Disneyland, said Masako Notoji, a professor at Tokyo University who has written extensively on the peculiar hold Tokyo Disneyland exercises over people here, "they are enjoying not the American Dream, but their own Japanese Dream."
Some here even suggest that the managers of this park pull off the Disney ideal better than their American mentors.
"This might be the most perfect Disneyland in the world," Sanshiro Kobayashi, a spokesman for the theme park, said. "Because of the Japanese character, our park is probably a little cleaner."
If this contrast between the fortunes of the European and Japanese theme parks seems confusing, you have plenty of company. The Walt Disney Company studied the Japanese and European sites extensively, and yet it still failed to anticipate the enthusiasm here and the difficulties in France. That has cost it dearly.
"I used to say that cultures have no boundaries," said Noboru Kamisawa, executive vice president of Oriental Land. "But look at Euro Disneyland. Now I think that there may be cases where Disney is not accepted so readily."
 
A Hard Sell at First
 In fact, things began here on a shaky note. When Oriental Land first brought the idea of building a Magic Kingdom in Japan to Disney executives two decades ago, it was a hard sell, according to Mr. Kamisawa.
At that time, Oriental Land was a struggling developer, trying to figure out how to make some money from a large tract of landfill it owned just a few miles outside of central Tokyo. The privately held company was formed by the Mitsui Real Estate Development Company and the Keisei Electric Railway Company, who remain its principal owners.
Because of a deal with a local township, Oriental Land was obliged to use the plot for a public leisure activity, but it had failed to come up with any workable plans. Mr. Kamisawa said the company had gone to Disney in California, desperate for help in running a big theme park.
After some persuading, a competition with another site near Mount Fuji and several years of delays, Disney finally decided to go ahead with the project here. But it took a cautious course and rejected a chance to buy an interest in the park. That decision has cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars.
"I think Disney regretted that they refused our offer," Mr. Kamisawa said with more than a touch of understatement. "I think they had this in mind when they decided to take an interest in Euro Disneyland."
Disney has control over many aspects of the Tokyo park's design and operations, but it only collects royalties from the park's intake -- about 10 percent of the revenue from admission and rides, and 5 percent on the sale of food, drinks and souvenirs.
To make things worse, Disney also hurt itself by cashing in early on anticipated future royalties. In 1988, it arranged a complex financial transaction, selling its rights to the park's future royalties. It received $700 million up front for 20 years worth of royalties.
The company refuses to comment on the transaction, but reports at the time said the deal had locked it into an exchange rate of 124 yen to the dollar. The dollar has since declined sharply, below 105 yen recently.
That movement would have sharply increased the dollar-denominated profits Disney would have earned. But because of the transaction, it appears to have forgone such gains.
Oriental Land remains a privately held company, but its principal owners have reportedly agreed to raise fresh capital and list its shares publicly next year to finance a large addition. The company is planning to expand the site by constructing a large marine park, also in cooperation with Disney.
Who would have thought a people whose history is a tapestry of samurai warriors, rice farmers and Buddhism would have taken so quickly to Mark Twain, the Old West and Peter Pan? And who would have thought that Europeans would be so much less enamored of the Disney retinue?
Ms. Notoji explains. "To Japanese, the fakeness of Disneyland is not evident because they only had fantasy images of these things before," she said. "Europeans see the fakeness because they have their own real castles, and many of the Disney characters come from European folk tales."
Even Oriental Land misjudged to some extent. The company built a pavilion here, where it shows a movie on how contact with foreign cultures has influenced Japan over the centuries. The show is nearly deserted much of the time.
 
Superb Timing
 But a few yards away, another Tokyo Disneyland feature is usually packed -- a shop filled with souvenirs from the other Magic Kingdoms, catering to the Japanese traveler's passion for purchasing mementos to give away as gifts at home.
Tokyo Disneyland has also benefited from superb timing -- one of the reasons, analysts say, that Euro Disneyland has done so poorly. While the European Magic Kingdom opened in the midst of a deep recession, the Tokyo park opened in 1983, early in one of the most economically vibrant decades in recent Japanese history.
"The 1980's was a decade of great economic affluence and an era when Japanese society started to feel a part of world culture," Ms. Notoji of Tokyo University said. "Tokyo Disneyland really became a symbol for many people of Japan's entry into world culture."
Mr. Kamisawa of Oriental Land added: "When people looked for a model of an affluent society at that time, they looked to the United States. It was as natural for us to enjoy Disneyland as it was for Japanese to go to McDonald's."
As it happened, McDonald's was establishing itself around the same time as Japan's largest fast-food chain.
"It was like we were buying Disneyland," Ms. Notoji said. "We took the foreignness out of it and digested it. It came out as something with an American character, but for the Japanese it is Japanese."

Euro Disney Debt Talks
 PARIS, March 6 (Reuters) -- Banks that are creditors to Euro Disney said last week that there had been progress in talks aimed at reaching a rescue package for the debt-burdened theme park outside Paris. The park's debt amounts to $3.61 billion.
 A report by the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick found recent business and management measures taken by Euro Disney were on the right track, the banks said.
 Euro Disney recently adopted measures to shore up business, like cutting the entry price to visitors in the off-peak period. It laid off some 950 workers late last year to reduce costs.

HEADLINE: Big Decisions Before Spring Planting

SERIES: A Year on the Farm: First of a series of occasional articles on one family's business.

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BROADLANDS, Ill.

 BODY:
It is more than two months before David Rothermel starts running flat out to plant corn and soybeans on nearly 3,000 acres here in central Illinois, but the tall 39-year-old farmer with the neatly trimmed beard is still pretty busy by most people's standards.
There are hours spent on big decisions, like which strains he will plant, how he will spend close to $100,000 on fertilizer and a similar amount on chemicals, and how he will market his crops. Many more hours are gobbled up by smaller chores, like a trip last week to Paxton, Ill., to get an irrigation engine repaired. 
 Whether it all pays off will not matter much outside the small circle of two full-time employees, investors who own a large part of his farm and, of course, the rest of his family -- his wife, Judith, and their daughters, Christine, 9, and Patricia, 11.
 
 
Willingness to Innovate
 But in the longer term, the world clearly needs smart decisions by American farmers like Mr. Rothermel, who have large operations and a willingness to innovate.
"We have to grow as much food worldwide in the next 40 years as we have in the last 14,000," said Dean Kleckner, head of the Farm Bureau, a group based in Park Ridge, Ill., with more than four million members, including Mr. Rothermel.
The New York Times will be following this year's planning, labor and results on the Rothermel farm in a series of articles running through December. The Rothermel home -- a white tree-sheltered two-story farmhouse, which the family shares with a golden retriever and assorted cats -- was built 50 years ago when Mr. Rothermel's grandfather was farming the rich land here, about 150 miles south of Chicago.
About 98 percent of American farms are still operated by families like the Rothermels, but there are far fewer farmers and far greater differences among them than Mr. Rothermel's grandfather could have imagined.
Indeed, while policy makers in Washington and some farm advocacy groups talk of a mythical "average family farmer," agricultural economists say attempts to draw useful insights from such averaging are doomed by the disparities in size, specialization, and most of all, between those who rely largely on their farms for income and the majority who have substantial nonfarm earnings.
Mr. Rothermel is part of a crucial minority that operates farms big enough to generate annual revenues of more than $500,000. Families like the Rothermels owned slightly more than 2 percent of the nation's farms in 1992, but accounted for more than 35 percent of the output as measured in cash receipts. Farms that are almost as large accounted for another big chunk, so that the top 5 percent, with revenues of $250,000 and more, accounted for more than half the total output.
The larger farms are not only dominating production but are also the quickest to adopt new technology. And they are leading the way toward what some experts call the industrialization of agriculture, a process in which more farmers work directly under contract to food processors.
The trend is farthest along in the poultry and hog segments, but in regions where food processors have set up big purchasing stations, as Frito-Lay has done just north of here, in Sydney, Ill., large grain farmers have also begun to grow much if not all of their crops for the processors.
The size of Mr. Rothermel's operation offers little protection from the swings in income that characterize most forms of farming. In recent years his operating income has ranged from a drought-driven loss of $12,000 to a profit of more than $150,000. Mr. Rothermel's margin for error may be thinner than usual this year. The storms that caused widespread floods in the western reaches of the Corn Belt last year also pelted eastern Illinois, leaving much of his farm wetter than normal.
That is just one of his worries. Fertilizer, seed and pesticide prices have inched up. The contract he was offered for this year's crop by Frito-Lay, the snack food subsidiary of Pepsico Inc. that bought most of his corn last year, left less room than ever for profit. Still, the calm-mannered Mr. Rothermel is quietly upbeat.
"I typically go into the year as an optimist," Mr. Rothermel said. "Most farmers do."
 
 
Better Chance
 Mr. Rothermel stands a better chance than most farmers of seeing his optimism rewarded. Through smart real estate investments after the drought in 1988, financed largely through a partnership with a childhood friend, longstanding relationships with a family in Chicago that owns farmland and access to land owned by his father and father-in-law, Mr. Rothermel owns or rents 2,900 acres in a 100-mile stretch running north from here to Dwight, Ill.
While a few Illinois farms are bigger than 10,000 acres, Mr. Rothermel's total is still about five times larger than the average for the state. That gives him plenty of opportunity to use more efficient equipment and strike better bargains with suppliers than most of his peers. And there are fringe benefits, like a recent vacation to Las Vegas, Nev., paid for by Trisler Seed Farms Inc. Trisler is a Fairmount, Ill.-based seed company from which Mr. Rothermel buys enough seed to qualify as a dealer, even though he rarely sells a single bag to his neighbors.
Mr. Rothermel's track record has helped make him a preferred supplier of corn for Frito-Lay and seed companies. Such contract crops do not yield as much an acre because they require specific seeds to be used, but they are priced at premiums to the market and usually are more profitable.
One hub of winter activity is the Rothermels' home office, where they watch as prices, weather and news bulletins from a farm computer service zip across their computer screens. In recent weeks, Mr. Rothermel has begun selling call options on the Chicago Board of Trade, in essence putting an upper limit on how much he can profit from a part of his crop in return for payments now from those buying the options.
 
 
Vast Knowledge
 "Farmers today spend a lot more time on marketing and financial decisions than in the past," Mitch Morehart, an agricultural economist with the United States Department of Agriculture, said. "The knowledge you have to have to be really successful is vast."
The biggest decision for Mr. Rothermel this winter was probably the one he made in early February to contract with Frito-Lay for 120,000 bushels of corn this year, just a third of the amount the company had offered to buy.
"Frito was paying $1 over the Board of Trade price for white corn when they started here in the 1980's, but now it's down to 30 cents for white corn and just 10 cents for yellow corn," Mr. Rothermel said. While praising Frito-Lay's local managers, he complained that the pricing of the snack food giant, based in Plano, Tex., seemed to be driven by "number crunchers down there who don't know anything about growing corn."
Part of Mr. Rothermel's calculation that Frito-Lay's price had become only marginally beneficial was his belief that he could get substantially higher yields and better tolerance of different weather conditions from newer seed varieties offered by companies like Pioneer Hi-Bred International than from the seeds on Frito-Lay's authorized list. That list is updated each year, but it is built from varieties that have been around long enough to have proven track records of producing corn with the characteristics that Frito-Lay needs to run its processing plants most efficiently.
Another consideration is that Mr. Rothermel had faced a need to spray more pesticides and other chemicals on fields where he had produced corn year after year. By cutting back on his contract with Frito-Lay, he can rotate some of the fields to soybeans, which will wipe out many of the corn-eating insects that have accumulated in his fields. Rotation is especially attractive now because soybean prices are higher than they have been in several years.
Mr. Rothermel said he and other local farmers had talked about collective bargaining with companies like Frito-Lay or forming tighter affiliations with processors. Neither option is an entirely comfortable one given the traditional penchant of farmers for making their own decisions. "It's not in our nature," Mr. Rothermel said of unionizing.
Mr. Rothermel's decision to cut back on his commitment to Frito-Lay encouraged other negotiations like those that led to a seed corn contract with Crow's Hybrid Corn Company, covering more than 400 acres, nearly as much as the total acreage of an average Illinois farm. Each contract creates spinoff tasks. Mr. Rothermel, for example, has already begun calling his neighbors to find out what they will be planting in nearby fields so he can figure out how many breakrows he must plant around the seed corn to make sure it is protected from unwanted pollen.
It does not take many such details to spell the difference between success and failure, according to Danny A. Klinefelter, a professor at Texas A & M's Department of Agricultural Economics who studied the factors that separated a group of top farmers, netting an average of $50,000 annually, from another group that lost $25,000 annually over a six-year period in the 1980's. In most categories, from yield to input costs, the performance difference averaged 5 percent or less.
"I liken it to the .300 hitter in baseball," Professor Klinefelter said. "He only gets one more hit every 20 times at bat than the .250 hitter, but he's an all-star."
In agriculture though, even the best prepared performers cannot get all-star output without plenty of luck. What Mr. Rothermel is hoping for most from now until planting in May is several long stretches of dry weather.

HEADLINE: United Way Affiliates Plan Changes in Regional Governing Board

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH 

 BODY:
Faced with shrinking charitable contributions but growing demands for assistance, United Way affiliates in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are moving to overhaul their regional association to streamline the organization.
Advocates of the proposed reorganization hope it will raise more money and trim operating costs, but the changes are also likely to draw some objections since they will reduce the decision-making powers of the 32 individual United Way affiliates in the region. 
 The proposed changes in the United Way of Tri-State organization will give the leaders of major corporations more seats on the governing board, which decides how funds are collected and then distributed through the 32 local United Ways. The money helps support 1,700 health and human service agencies including those providing child care, drug rehabilitation and help for the disabled and elderly.
 
A Wider Outlook
 Critics of the current system say it encourages each local United Way to operate with its own interests exclusively, ignoring the wider economic and social needs of the entire region. The plan being considered repeatedly emphasizes the advantages of a more regional outlook, and by implication regards the existing arrangement as too parochial, a criticism also voiced by members.
Bill Martin, executive director of United Way of Hudson County, N.J.,said the 32 local United Way affiliates must face new realities. "If they need more money," he said, "they must get out and work for it, not sit back saying 'I'm entitled to it, gimme, gimme, gimme.' "
A board member of one of the largest United Ways, who spoke on condition of anonymity, attacked the plan as a "naked grab for power by the corporations" that donate to United Way, and argued it could damage the organization as a whole.
 
Regional Board to Be Reduced
 But George Harvey, chairman of the Tri-State board and the chairman of Pitney Bowes, said the wide majority of the membership is likely to favor the plan when it is presented for approval on March 31, saying the objections came only from a few participants "because there always is some resistance to change."
Under the plan, the regional board would be reduced from 74 members to between 30 and 40, with three-fourths of those seats going to corporate heads and labor leaders, and 5 to representatives of United Ways -- all of whom are unpaid volunteers. Another 2 seats would also go to local United Ways chosen to ensure both urban and suburban interests are covered adequately. If the larger board of 40 is approved, 3 other seats will go to community or academic leaders. Under the current system, half the board's seats now go to officials of local United Way affiliates.
Tri-State is a singular regional organization in the United Way system. It was created in 1977 to accommodate the region's major corporations, which wanted to run fund-raising campaigns to cover not only their headquarters but also other plants or offices within the region where their employees work and live.
 
Major Companies Cut Back
 In the last campaign, 158 major companies raised $108.3 million, about 8 percent less than the previous year. The poorer showing clearly reflected cutbacks at major companies in the area, as 68 percent of the funds raised come from employees' payroll deductions and corporate gifts.
The plan being considered calls for the distribution of funds to be based on a formula considering the needs of each United Way, how much it raised and how deeply it was involved in helping benefiting agencies that might otherwise not function without its help.
Because of continued corporate cutbacks, Tri-State officials said even less money may be raised this year. The 32 local United Way affiliates run campaigns at smaller companies and keep these resources, leading some executives, including Mr. Martin, to say they should work harder on these fund-raising drives.
 
Changes Long Sought
 Over the years, there have been at least four studies calling for reforms in Tri-State's operations, but the current plan is the most significant, said Ralph Gregory, president of the United Way of Westchester and Putnam, who also runs the advisory group made up of the professional employee heads of the 32 member organizations. He expressed disappointment that advisory members were not included earlier in drafting the reorganization plan, and he expressed concern that the local United Way affiliates would not receive more seats on the reconstituted board to insure that varied local United Ways received adequate representation.
The reorganization plan moves into a sensitive area by calling for more uniform financial reports from the 32 members. If local United Way affiliates do not comply, Tri-State would withhold the members' funds for six months; noncompliance for another six months could lead to the funds being redistributed.
Financial problems at local United Ways have embarrassed the organization in the past. In May 1992, the head of accounting at the United Way of Westchester and Putnam pleaded guilty to stealing $283,000 from the organization. Though an insurance concern made up for the embezzled funds, Tri-State and the local United Way disagreed about who should get the money. Tri-State officials contend it should go back to all the partners because Tri-State advanced funds to Westchester to cover the theft.
 
Shifts in Personnel
 The Tri-State organization itself is undergoing changes: Betty Beene, its president for five years, has told board members she wants to leave when her contract ends next February.
"I'm committed to guiding the organization through the adoption and implementation of its plan for the revitalization of the organization," she said. A transitional board will be proposed March 31 and function until a permanent board is elected during the summer.
Tri-State will continue to search for ways to cut costs, she said, and will move its headquarters to rent-free space given by Chemical Bank at 110 John Street in lower Manhattan, with the present quarters at 99 Park Avenue will be leased to bring in revenue, she said. In addition, staff in the last few years has been cut by more than 40 percent and will decline further.
On an upbeat note, she said the board of directors voted last week to welcome back the United Way of Central New Jersey. That affiliate, with its headquarters in New Brunswick, withdrew last year after objecting to the distribution of campaign proceeds.
"In the past few years, we've spent entirely too much time deciding how to divide the pie," she said. "We need to concentrate on making the pie bigger."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A one-two combination staggers the cable television industry.

BYLINE: By Kenneth N. Gilpin 

 BODY:
THE last few weeks have not been happy ones for cable television companies.
Not only did the Federal Communications Commission announce that cable rates were being rolled back by 7 percent, but the huge $33 billion merger between the Bell Atlantic Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc. fizzled. 
 Those two events, for the next few years at least, will transform what had been a dynamic growth- and investment-oriented business into a more defensive, cautious industry.
For investors, the change means that cable shares should not be bought for their own intrinsic potential, but based on how highly their assets are valued by a potential buyer. And the price those assets will probably fetch is a good bit lower than it was only a week ago.
"The only reason to be investing in the cable business at this juncture is as a takeover play," said Christopher P. Dixon, a cable analyst for Paine Webber Group. "No one knows what the cash flow prospects for these companies will be over the next two to three years. In a week, we have gone from a seller's to a buyer's market."
Frederick Moran, a vice president of Salomon Brothers, said cable companies in big attractive markets are likely takeover targets. Cablevision, which operates in the New York metropolitan area, and Adelphia, which has operations in the Northeast and Florida, fall into this category, he said.
According to estimates from Salomon Brothers, the F.C.C.'s rate rollback will deprive the industry of as much as $3 billion in revenue, and another $15 billion in lost borrowing power.
Much of that debt and cash flow would have been used to finance the capital spending that analysts say is crucial to turn telephones, computers and cable into the information superhighway.
"The industry will have trouble generating enough free cash flow to find the necessary funds to build the superhighway," Mr. Moran said. "That will delay its construction, perhaps as much as five years."
But skeptics said they wondered whether the highway, even if it did get built, would generate the demand necessary to justify the billions of dollars needed to create it.
Stephen Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley, said that last year Americans spent about $160 billion on all forms of multimedia, from televisions and personal computers to videocassettes and movies.
That was more than double the level of a decade ago, and about equal to what was spent on cars and trucks. With real disposable income growing at a snail's pace, Mr. Roach said he was not sure if the benefits of the superhighway would be sufficient to entice consumers to spend even more.
Analysts have acknowledged the risk, and said the days when technological advances created their own demand, as they did in the 1980's, were largely gone. "Near term, the picture isn't very good," said Jessica Reif, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company.
But she recommended two stocks, Tele-Communications and Comcast, which has a hand in the wireless communications alliance announced last week between Nextel and MCI Communications.
"I am very comfortable with the stocks at these valuations," she said. Since January, Tele-Communications has dropped 22 percent and Comcast has fallen more than 12 percent, but the shares of both companies rose on Friday. Tele-Communications gained $1.75, to $23.50, in Nasdaq trading. Comcast rose $1.125, to $21.125, in Nasdaq trading.
A safer but probably less lucrative way to invest in what Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley called the new American dream is in the companies that will buy cable operators.
This group certainly includes the regional telephone companies. The collapse of the Bell Atlantic merger and the F.C.C.'s ruling have given them time to ponder their options.
"The playing field has tilted in favor of the regional Bells," Mr. Moran said. "By handicapping the cable industry's ability to upgrade their services, the Bells have essentially been given time to get into video and other related services."
Entertainment companies are the other obvious group that may make a play for cable companies, Mr. Dixon of Paine Webber said. "Companies like Time Warner and Disney are clearly in the catbird seat," he said.

HEADLINE: Let the Market Decide About Milk Hormone;
The Health of Cows

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"When the Geneticists' Fingers Get in the Food" states, "scientists keep insisting that there is nothing to be concerned about" when bovine growth hormone is used to make cows into "veritable milk machines" (The Week in Review, Feb. 20). But many scientists are very concerned. 
 Forget about the question of hormones in the milk. It's a diversionary issue, the least of our worries about bovine growth hormone.
We are concerned about the health of the cows: excessive milk production reportedly makes them suffer continuously from bruised udders and brings on an early death from metabolic stress.
This is a cruel way to treat a gentle creature.
And we are also concerned because the increased incidence of infection among herds receiving the hormone requires increased use of antibiotics, which in turn raises the specter of transfer of antibiotic resistance from cow bacteria to human pathogens. There are several known ways for this to happen. Antibiotic resistance is a real threat to human health.
We are concerned about stimulating hormone-treated cows to eat more fodder to produce more milk when there is already a milk surplus, which taxpayers are subsidizing.
We are concerned about the results of reliable studies that predict that more than one-third of America's remaining small dairy farmers will be driven out of business by bovine growth hormone.
Not only will this be a kind of cultural genocide, but it will also leave us dependent on comparatively few, large dairy farms, which are likely to be highly unstable for agricultural and economic reasons.
Scientists who are also responsible members of society do not restrict their concerns about their inventions in order to help sell a commercial product.

HEADLINE: New Refugees May Still Leave Vietnam

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Boat People: A Chapter Closes" (editorial, Feb. 22): 
 Since South Vietnam collapsed in 1975, more than 1.5 million Vietnamese have fled by boat (and a few by land) to other countries in Southeast Asia. With the major exception of 1979, when thousands were pushed back, temporary asylum has been granted, pending resettlement in third countries; the only country towing off new Vietnamese arrivals the last few years has been Malaysia.
On Feb. 14, a United Nations meeting ended special status for refugees from Vietnam. Almost all the remaining asylum seekers in camps in the region have been declared economic migrants, with no choice but to return to Vietnam. The conference stopped short of sanctioning forced repatriation in 1995.
It is regrettable that the United States, which led the way for 19 years in maintaining the temporary framework for boat people, almost adopted a position more radical than the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to force Vietnamese home next year. To set a date for forced repatriation would permit, even encourage, countries of asylum to make their own forced repatriation deals with Vietnam without monitoring.
Let us hope voluntary return can be promoted instead, based in part on the improved economic prospects in Vietnam following the lifting of the United States trade embargo. (A small number of asylum seekers who have a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Vietnam should be permitted to resettle.)
The United Nations conference did not spell out the right of future asylum seekers from Vietnam to a hearing before subjecting them to repatriation. Though the flow of refugees from Vietnam has virtually ended, the United Nations refugee agency and United States embassies in the region should be alert for new asylum seekers with legitimate claims as refugees.

HEADLINE: Commercial Realty in New York Shows Signs of a Strong Recovery

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
They cannot agree on how much space still languishes empty, or on what the average rents are. But on some things, New York's commercial real-estate brokers and building owners are unanimous: Buildings are filling up. Landlords are getting more from tenants and giving them less. Some companies are even buying buildings again. All told, brokers and landlords say, the real-estate recession is ending.
"If February's numbers are an indication of what the rest of 1994 will look like, the New York real-estate market is in for a sustained period of recovery," said Barry Gosin, chief executive officer of Newmark & Company Real Estate. 
 Peter L. Malkin, a lawyer who is part owner of the Empire State Building and several other Manhattan properties, agreed. "We have definitely turned the corner," he said.
Average midtown rents, which have plunged from about $40 a square foot per year five years ago to as little as half that amount now, have stopped their slide. The Edward S. Gordon Company, a large brokerage company, says average asking rents -- the rents at which landlords market space, but which can usually be negotiated downward -- are $31.16 a square foot a year now, and brokers and landlords say they are inching up even more.
Concession packages -- months of free rent and landlord contributions toward the cost of customizing a tenant's space -- are tightening, too.
Mr. Malkin says the value of the concessions he has had to offer has declined by one-third to one-half over the last half year or so. Brokers report that all landlords are increasingly tightfisted.
"For the first time in four years, tenants can expect to pay more for the same space tomorrow than they will same space tomorrow than they will today," said Jerry L. Cohen, a vice chairman of Cushman & Wakefield, another large real-estate brokerage firm.
Although they vary from source to source, the numbers are uniformly indicating that vacant office space is diminishing. Newmark says that in February the empty space in the most expensive part of town -- from Third Avenue to Fifth Avenue, from 42d Street to 57th Street -- dropped to 14 percent, the first time it has fallen below 15 percent in three years.
Cushman & Wakefield puts the vacancy rate for midtown's best buildings, regardless of neighborhood, at 14.8 percent at the end of February, down from 16.3 percent about a year ago. Edward S. Gordon is just slightly more conservative, citing a 15 percent midtown vacancy rate.
All those numbers are still way above the 8 percent vacancy rate that real-estate experts have traditionally considered a sign of a healthy market, but it is a trend heading in a direction that the brokers and landlords find heartening.
 
Even Second-Rate Space
 And the figures include empty space in second-rate buildings, as well as oddly configured spaces. Large blocks of space -- those of over 100,000 square feet or so -- in the best buildings have grown exceedingly scarce, and tenants who need them will pay a premium to get them.
"A couple years ago we figured space supply and demand would reach equilibrium by 1997," said Stephen B. Siegel, Edward S. Gordon's president. "Now we think it'll happen by the end of next year."
New York is not alone in recovery. Throughout the country, with the possible exception of Southern California, low interest rates, the scarcity of new construction and a general sense of a strengthening economy have translated into a reviving commercial real-estate market.
Still, Julien J. Studley Inc., a national real-estate brokerage company, reported that New York, San Francisco and the District of Columbia were the only major United States markets where tenant effective rental rates -- the rents paid per square foot, subtracting the value of the concessions -- increased last year. Julien J. Studley, the company's owner, says that particularly in New York, tenants are clamoring to get leases signed before rents go up again.
"One of the clearest signs of recovery in New York is that the pressure to close deals isn't from the building owners anymore," Mr. Studley said.
Not all the news has been good for the real-estate industry in the city. The downtown financial district is awash in space. And those developers who had highly publicized fiscal troubles -- Olympia & York is probably the most well known, but there are others -- have found it almost impossible to get back on their feet. Brokers, afraid that their commissions will not be paid, and tenants, afraid the buildings will not be properly maintained, still shun their properties, even when they have managed to keep them out of bankruptcy.
New York's emerging real-estate recovery represents a confluence of local and national factors. The generally strengthening economy has given many corporate tenants new confidence, and thus a greater willingness to expand. And, since development of new commercial space has been at a virtual standstill over the last four years, those corporations have been filling up existing buildings.
 
Shifting to a Service Economy
 "Not only are we seeing fewer tenant bankruptcies, but existing tenants are taking more space," said Stephen Green, chairman of S.L. Green Real Estate, who says that the 20 Manhattan office buildings his company owns or manages are about 96 percent occupied.
The shift to a service economy in New York has also largely ameliorated the impact of the flight of corporations elsewhere. Over the last 15 years, numerous corporations, including Union Carbide, American Airlines and J.C. Penney, have left New York for Texas, Connecticut and other states.
To make matters worse, many corporations have tried to streamline their decision-making processes by eliminating several layers of management jobs -- exactly the type of headquarters jobs that have traditionally been situated in New York. Even when the economy picks up, few management experts expect those jobs to be restored.
But many of Manhattan's vacant corporate buildings have filled up nonetheless. Avenue of the Americas from 42d Street to 59th Street, once called Corporate Corridor because of the high concentration of corporate headquarters, has turned into Barrister Boulevard as law firms have taken over the empty corporate space.
Banks and financial services companies, many of which have come back in better shape than they were before the 1987 stock market crash, have also moved to midtown. Morgan Stanley, Kidder Peabody, Bear Stearns and Mastercard have all bought or rented huge chunks of space.
 
A Return to Speculation
 Speculative money is also coming back to the market. The British developer Howard Ronson recently bought 383 Madison Avenue, the obsolete building between 46th and 47th Streets that once housed the Manhattan Savings Bank and the advertising agency B.B.D.O., and that has been vacant for a decade. Mr. Ronson plans a new office building on the site. He refused to discuss details, but brokers who know him say he does not have specific tenants in mind.
Corporate tenants are also predicting a space squeeze, and building sales are up. In the last few years, Morgan Stanley paid $176 million for 1585 Broadway, a 41-story building near 47th Street; Bertelsmann A.G. paid $119 million for 1540 Broadway, a 44-story building a few blocks south, and Mutual of America paid $130 million for 320 Park Avenue, a 34-story building near 50th Street.
Thomas F. Pergola, a Chemical Bank vice president who handles financing of owner-occupied buildings, said Chemical Bank closed some $130 million worth of owner-occupied transactions last year, up from $110 million in 1992. But more significant is the fact that he entered this year with more than $300 million in financing deals in the pipeline -- the first time the level of transactions in progress broke $300 million since the end of 1988, just before the real-estate recession hit.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 11, 1994, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Monday about New York City's commercial real estate recovery referred incorrectly to a transaction involving 383 Madison Avenue. A developer, Howard Ronson, has announced an agreement to buy the property, but has not done so yet. He expects to assume ownership in September.

HEADLINE: U.S. Urges the Burmese Military To Talk to Imprisoned Laureate

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
The United States expressed surprise today that a leader of the Burmese military junta had ruled out early talks with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the imprisoned democracy campaigner and Nobel peace laureate.
The United States urged the military dictatorship to open "a genuine dialogue" with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi as soon as possible, said a State Department spokesman, David Johnson. 
 "We're disappointed by the decision not to enter into discussions with the detained opposition leader," he said. "We deplore her continued house arrest, now nearing five years."
The head of Burmese military intelligence, Lieut. Gen. Khin Nyunt, said in an interview on Sunday that face-to-face talks between him and Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi might eventually be possible, but indicated that no decision would be made soon.
He described her attitude as "counterproductive" and harshly questioned her legitimacy as an opposition politician, emphasizing that she was married to a Briton and had lived abroad for three decades before returning to her country in 1988.
 
New Sanctions Possible
 Administration officials suggested that they might step up sanctions against Myanmar, formerly Burma, because of the military's failure to open a dialogue with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. Washington has already suspended all economic and military aid, imposed an arms embargo, ended some low tariffs that had applied to its products and blocked the International Monetary Fund and World Bank from making loans to the country.
State Department officials had hoped that the military's decision to let Repesentative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat, meet last month with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was a signal that the general was ready to meet with her face to face.
Last summer the Administration began a comprehensive review of policies toward Myanmar. One Administration official said the remarks made by General Khin Nyunt would weigh against any easing of policy.
"This obviously will be a new input in our policy considerations, and it's not a positive one," said Thomas Hubbard, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
 
House Arrest Since '89
 Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was put under house arrest in Yangon, formerly Rangoon, in July 1989 as part of a crackdown against the democracy movement. Her party, the National League for Democracy, won national elections in 1990 by a landslide, but the military voided the results.
In pressing the military to open talks with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, Mr. Johnson said "we understand" that the military "has not ruled out the possibility of a dialogue in the future." So "we urge them to begin at the earliest possible time," he said.
Mr. Richardson suggested after visiting Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi last month that General Khin Nyunt was "a pragmatic individual" who might be ready for such talks. He could not be reached for comment today.
American officials heatedly disputed General Khin Nyunt's assertion that support for Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was sparse among the Burmese. "That flies in the face of reality," said one State Department official. "Her party won 80 percent of the seats in the election."

HEADLINE: Dow Rallies by 23.92 Points, to 3,856.22

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In a week with few significant economic statistics to jangle their nerves, the financial markets will likely play the game of "When Will (Not if) the Fed Raise Interest Rates Again?" So the stock market rallied yesterday in moderate trading, when the Federal Reserve Board did nothing and long-term rates on bonds declined.
Stocks like Caterpillar, Allied Signal and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing benefited, as well as defense stocks like Northrop and United Technologies, after the announcement of Martin Marietta's plans to acquire Grumman. 
 Both the stock and bond markets will continue to play the waiting-for-the-Fed game today and probably until March 22, when the Fed's policy- making committee meets to consider why traders and investors seem to be demanding higher short-term interest rates to fight inflation although there is little evidence of rising prices.
 
 
Dow Gains 23.92 Points
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 23.92 points yesterday, to 3,856.22, and the Standard & Poor's 500, which rose 2.17 points, to 466.91, both started upbeat and moved sideways for most of the session.
David D. Holt, vice president for research and strategy at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles, said the early stock jump was a result of an unusual consensus in Europe, where all the leading equities exchanges closed higher. "There was a global market imbalance of demand over supply," he said. "The U.S. computers recognized it; they went ding-a-ling and executed buy orders."
But even after the rally, the Dow was still 122 points off its Jan. 31 peak of 3,978.36 and the S.& P. 500 was 15 points off its Feb. 2 peak of 482.
If, as some analysts are predicting, the stock market "corrects" 10 percent in price over the next few weeks or months, then the Dow will have to drop below 3,600 and the S.& P. 500 to around 434.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.50 points, to 795.05. The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.37 points to 259.07 on relatively light volume of 285.6 million shares. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining stocks by 1,443 to 762. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.58 points, to 469.06.
January consumer credit numbers were reported after the market closed yesterday, but they are likely to have little impact today because the market is focusing on February data or imminent March data for trading decisions.
Still, the credit numbers support a low-inflation view. But they will probably be discounted by the market because harsh winter weather discouraged consumer purchases and a major earthquake disrupted California's economy.
The most active stock yesterday, with volume of 7.2 million shares, was Intel, whose new version of its Pentium microprocessor will be incorporated into the personal computers of such leading manufacturers as Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment and Compaq. The new Intel chip is said to be 50 percent faster than earlier versions. Intel closed up 1 5/8 at 71 1/4.

HEADLINE: THE WHITEWATER INQUIRY;
Bringing Another Presidency and Inquiry to Mind

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
His own travails in the Whitewater affair have nothing in common with the Watergate scandal that drove Richard M. Nixon from office 20 years ago, President Clinton insisted today at a news conference in which he fought his political corner as tenaciously as Mr. Nixon ever did.
"We're not covering anything up," he said. "We are opening up." 
 Had the Clinton White House been as forthcoming as the President suggested it had, Mr. Clinton might have had no reason to dispute the parallel.
In that case, the focus would have remained on the Whitewater transactions themselves, long ago and far away, which are hard to follow and lacking in evident drama. The whole thing might have dried up. But now the spotlight has shifted from the Ozarks to Washington, and words like "subpoena" and "cover-up" have caught public attention. There is now no chance that things will quiet down this year.
The shift in focus, which also happened in Watergate, is of much greater importance this time than two decades ago. The original accusations against Mr. Nixon related to actions during his term as President, but those against Mr. Clinton predated his election in 1992. Suspicions of a cover-up, however, have taken investigators right into current White House activities.
The two cases have obvious differences. Watergate involved gross abuses of power, including the misuse of the F.B.I., among other agencies. Whitewater, on the record to date, has produced nothing approaching that.
 
Grudging Responses
 It is certainly true that Bill Clinton did not dig in his heels as hard or as long as Richard Nixon did. So far, there is less evidence of an effort to block investigators. But Mr. Clinton and his staff did not react to the first set of Whitewater disclosures, or the second or third, by "opening up."
For weeks the White House resisted the appointment of an independent counsel. It admitted only in December that crucial documents had been removed in July from the files of Vincent W. Foster Jr., the Clinton aide who killed himself, and given to the President's lawyer. For a time, Bernard W. Nussbaum, the soon-to-depart White House counsel, said Mr. Clinton might refuse to yield Whitewater documents on grounds of attorney-client privilege.
At every turn, the White House responses to inquiries from reporters investigating the matter have been late, incomplete and grudging.
There are other similarities between Watergate and Whitewater, starting with controversy over documents and whether they have been shredded.
Mr. Nixon liked to dismiss the Watergate scandal as "a third-rate burglary," long after it was clear that it was not the break-in but the abuses of power associated with it that constituted the biggest liability. Mr. Clinton, likewise, often says that the Whitewater episode is rooted in a small-time land deal 16 years ago in which he and his wife lost money.
 
Distracting Questions
 Defending his wife as a woman who has a "moral compass as strong as anybody's in America," Mr. Clinton sounded as defensive as Mr. Nixon used to in proclaiming the virtues of those who worked alongside him.
Two days after Mr. Nussbaum was cast to the wolves, Mr. Clinton found himself answering Whitewater questions at what was supposed to be a news conference on problems in Russia and other former units of the Soviet Union. He said he had more important things to do than defend his conduct, and he asserted that "the American people will be outraged if anybody uses this as an excuse for not doing the people's business."
On April 30, 1973, the day he announced the departure of H. R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman, among others, Mr. Nixon said much the same thing.
"It is essential," he said, "that we not be so distracted by events such as this that we neglect the vital work before us, before this nation, before America, at a time of critical importance to America and the world."
 
Pressure on Democrats
 Mr. Nixon was never able to turn back, full time, to the business of governing. More and more revelations, some directly related to Watergate but most not, kept him on the defensive until he finally resigned. In Mr. Clinton's case, much will depend on what new disclosures, if any, lie ahead.
Democrats on Capitol Hill have maintained a more-or-less united front so far, refusing demands from Republican colleagues for an investigation even though they investigated similar episodes during the Reagan and Bush eras. But that front may be cracking under the pressure of accusations that the Democrats are guilty of applying a partisan double standard.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, became on Sunday the first ranking Democrat on the Hill to suggest that he would consider the possibility of Whitewater hearings.
If disclosures keep coming, and especially if there are any further hints that the White House is trying to steer the investigation, some Democrats' partisan loyalties will surely give way to self-preservation. All of the seats in the House and a third of those in the Senate, after all, will be up for grabs this November, long before Bill Clinton faces the electorate.
 
Similar Reputations
 Like Mr. Nixon, Mr. Clinton is vulnerable in a crisis of this sort because of the ambiguous reputation that preceded him into Presidential politics.
Both men have always been widely admired for their intelligence, their political skills and their grasp of complex public questions. But both have long been dogged by questions of trustworthiness. One brought the nickname "Tricky Dick" into the Oval Office, the other "Slick Willy."
The events of last weekend were sufficiently striking that top Republicans and Democrats have for the first time begun wondering aloud, discreetly of course, whether Whitewater could eventually become serious enough to cost Mr. Clinton a second term.
Early as it is, with so many more events to unfold before 1996, the damage is already substantial, if not necessarily to the President's standing with the public, then clearly to his ability to influence legislators. And if he is unable to push through his already beleaguered legislative proposals, including health care reform and the reorganization of the welfare system, he could lose ground with voters.
The consensus so far, voiced by an influential Democratic senator: "A second term looks less routine, especially if the economy turns sour."
 
THE MEETINGS IN QUESTION
 
 President Clinton today acknowledged that he was briefed some time last October on the decision by the agency overseeing failed savings and loans to ask for a criminal investigation by the Justice Department into the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan in Arkansas, a request that named the Clintons as possible beneficiaries of illegal actions. While Mr. Clinton said he did not remember who briefed him or when, the meeting was one of a series that have recently come to light concerning the referral by the agency, the Resolution Trust Corporation.
 
Sept. 29, 1993 -- Jean Hanson, the Treasury Department's general counsel, meets in the office of Bernard W. Nussbaum, the White House counsel, to warn him of the R.T.C's plan to ask for a Justice Department investigation.
 
Oct. 8, 1993 -- R.T.C. formally asks the Justice Department to look into the matter.
 
Oct. 14, 1993 -- A meeting is held in Mr. Nussbaum's office to discuss how to handle inquiries from news organizations about the status of the Whitewater investigation. In addition to Mr. Nussbaum, the meeting includes Mark D. Gearan, the White House director of communications; Bruce Lindsey, a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton; Ms. Hanson; Josh Steiner, now chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen; and Jack DeVore, then Mr. Bentsen's press secretary.
 
Oct. 31, 1993 -- First press reports of the R.T.C. referral appear.
 
Feb. 2, 1994 -- Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger C. Altman, also the acting head of the R.T.C., meets with Mr. Nussbaum, Ms. Hanson, Harold M. Ickes, the deputy chief of staff, and Margaret A. Williams, Hillary Rodham Clinton's chief of staff. Mr. Altman acknowledges the meeting before a Senate committee on Feb. 24, saying he held the briefing to give the White House a "heads up" on how the R.T.C. would proceed on potential civil claims arising out of Madison's failure.

HEADLINE: Long Islanders Shocked by Grumman's Merger

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BETHPAGE, L.I., March 7

 BODY:
The name Grumman has been synonymous with jobs and economic security on Long Island for more than five decades, so today's announcement that Grumman was being acquired by Martin Marietta, and that still more layoffs might result, shocked many here.
"I'm sorry to see it go," said Lynn V. McDonald, a 69-year-old engineer who spent 30 years at the Grumman Corporation and worked on almost every plane the company produced, as well as the Lunar Module that landed on the Moon. 
 "I'm only a retiree on the outside looking in," said Mr. McDonald, who lives a block south of Grumman's airfield here. "But it must be a lot tougher on those inside, because I don't stand to lose my job."
 
Retirees Also Concerned
 Indeed, although some Grumman employees said the merger might expand their career opportunities, others feared that they might soon join the thousands of employees laid off by Grumman in recent years. And some retirees expressed concern about their pensions and other benefits.
David Griangano, a senior engineer with 10 years at Grumman, said his fellow workers had "a feeling something was about to happen."
"Today confirmed our suspicions," he said. "Now we really don't know what to expect."
Economists said they feared that the Martin Marietta Corporation, which is based in Bethesda, Md., would feel no loyalty toward Long Island and would move more jobs to plants elsewhere to cut costs.
 
'Doesn't Auguer Well'
 "This doesn't augur well for Long Island," said Dr. Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. "It may be good for Grumman stockholders, but it sends a negative message as far as the well being of Long Island's economy."
Spokesmen for both Grumman and Martin Marietta declined to comment on the long-term outlook for Long Island employment.
Norman R. Augustine, the chairman and chief executive of Martin Marietta, said, however, that consolidation would take considerable time and that the merger would have no short-term impact on Long Island.
"We want to grow the corporation, not shrink it," he said.
Renso L. Caporali, Grumann's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement yesterday that Grumman had concluded last year that it had to make a significant strategic move. "We looked at a number of different approaches and combinations, and this is far superior to any of our other options," he said.
 
Politicans Optimistic
 Local officials chose to view the merger with optimism.
Calling it a "perfect match," the Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, said, "Long Island's economy is changing, and this is a move in the right direction."
The Nassau County Executive, Thomas Gulotta, said, "Without the merger, Grumman, as a smaller company, probably would not have been able to survive, and all its jobs would have been lost."
The name of the merged company has not yet been determined, but Mr. Gulotta said that he understood that Grumman would be a part of it, since it "still carried a certain value in bidding on certain projects."
Dr. Koppelman noted that Grumman's work force on Long Island was now down to fewer than 8,900 employees from a peak of 23,000 in 1986 and 11,600 a little under a year ago. "And if Martin Marietta says someday soon, 'Hey, let's centralize,' that could be the death knell for Grumman on Long Island," he added.
Grumman, Long Island's leading non-governmental employer for many years, fell behind the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, with 12,500 employees, last year.
According to a study released today by the New York State Assembly subcommittee on the Long Island economy, the loss of manufacturing jobs on Long Island results from the high cost of electricity on Long Island, high property taxes and an inability to finance expansion.
The subcommittee surveyed 743 chief executives of companies with more than 100 employees and concluded that if these three major issues were not addressed, Long Island would see a "continued dramatic decline in its job base."
 
 
Effect of Previous Cutbacks
 Martin R. Cantor, the subcommittee's chief economist and a former Suffolk County commissioner for economic development, said the manufacturing and construction sectors accounted for 76 percent of the 105,000 jobs lost on Long Island since October 1987 and that the loss of 55,500 manufacturing jobs in the last seven years had cost Long Island's economy $3 billion. Cutbacks at Grumman accounted for nearly half of those lost manufacturing jobs, Mr. Cantor said.
The Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation was formed in 1929 by Leroy Randle Grumman in an abandoned garage in Baldwin, 20 miles east of mid-Manhattan. Its first contract was making repairs on wing floats for Navy planes.
Grumman redesigned the floats and before long was manufacturing not only new floats, but entire planes for the Navy, including a carrier-based single-engine fighter, the XFF-1, nicknamed "Fifi." As World War II approached, Grumman concentrated its efforts at a Bethpage production plant and moved its corporate headquarters here.
 
 
Wildcat With Folding Wings
 It developed the F4F Wildcat fighter that had wings that folded much like a bird's for compact storage at sea. Later generations of Grumman fighters included the F6F-5 Hellcat and the twin-engine F7F-3N Tigercat night fighter.
By 1947, Grumman had switched to jet engines. Its F9F-2 Panther set a new standard for carrier-based fighter plane performance and reliability. Subsequent jets included the F9F-9 Tiger with its Coke-bottle fuselage designed to reduce wave drag in supersonic flight. A later version, the F-14 Tomcat, was regarded as the most advanced fighter in the world and became one of Grumman's mainstays in 1970's.
Aircraft production on Long Island effectively ceased this year when Grumman closed its plant at Calverton, laid off several hundred employees and shifted the work to a Florida plant.

HEADLINE: Politicians Discovering An Issue: Immigration

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EL PASO, March 5

 BODY:
In the seven months since hundreds of Federal immigration agents were deployed along the banks of the Rio Grande here, the traffic of illegal workers from Mexico has all but stopped.
But the flow of politicians to the border here has surged: From across Texas, Washington and California, Republicans and Democrats want to see, and be seen at, a get-tough effort to control immigration. 
 "It's election time," Mayor Larry Francis of El Paso, an independent, said as he took in the panoramic view of the border from his 10th-floor office, "and the border is a hot topic."
Many Republicans have argued that both legal and illegal immigrants burden American social services, while Democrats have played down the costs. But now, even Democrats, who stayed clear of such debates as they relied on ethnic and civil rights groups for support, are joining the chorus, albeit cautiously.
The politicians are prompted by polls showing that the issue is gaining in importance among voters who, polls say, are increasingly worried about the economic impact of immigrants and their effect on American culture.
 
Issue in Elections
 The politics of immigration is getting even more attention because of big elections this fall in New York, California, Florida, Illinois and Texas, which get the greatest share of immigrants. Immigration is also taking a high profile in Congress and the White House, where President Clinton, eager to appeal to moderates, is calling the issue a priority.
But if many are calling for a more aggressive attitude toward immigrants, they do not speak with one voice. Some politicians, particularly conservatives, advocate not only intensified patrols of the borders but also curbing or eliminating access to public services for illegal immigrants. Others, like Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, are also taking aim at legal immigrants. Mr. Simpson introduced legislation this week to cut legal immigrants into the United States to about 500,000 a year from 675,000.
Rather than emphasize legal immigration, the governors of New York, California, Florida, Illinois and Texas -- all of whom are running for re-election this year -- have focused on illegal immigrants. Asserting that their actions are driven by budgetary, not political, considerations, the governors have threatened to sue the Federal Government for help in providing federally mandated services to undocumented immigrants.
Even Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, a son of immigrants who is known for praising immigrants, was more sober in a recent radio interview, saying: "They are part of our great strength. They will be a nourishment for our future," adding, "They are also expensive."
 
Perilous Issue for Democrats
 Immigration is especially perilous for Democrats as they seek to turn it to their advantage -- or, at least, prevent Republicans from keeping the issue as their own -- without alienating core supporters. The exception, of course, is organized labor and increasingly blacks, who look wearily upon immigrants as competition.
In Texas, where Democrats have historically welcomed immigrants to integrate the border towns, Gov. Ann W. Richards has been particularly cautious; she needs to keep her stronghold among Hispanic voters in South Texas to win re-election. But her decision to join in the suit against the Federal Government shows how serious the issue has become.
Mark McKinnon, a Democratic strategist in Austin, Tex., said: "Immigration is a potential powder keg kind of issue. It plays to the politics of fear, and the politics of fear can be very persuasive. You're hearing the Governor saying some things now that she wasn't saying three years ago."
There is reason for concern. Both legal and illegal immigrants cost Texans more than $4 billion in 1992 for education, health care and other services beyond what they paid in taxes, according to a study published this week by Donald Huddle, an economist at Rice University.
 
Fierce Oratory in California
 Federico F. Pena, the Secretary of Transportation, is scheduled to come here next week, the latest in a string of Administration officials and other politicians who have applauded the United States Border Patrol for lining the border with agents. The holes that aliens had punched into the border fences are now repaired, and the crackdown has been well received by many here.
But even the Border Patrol is well aware of the sensitivities involved. The program, originally called "Operation Blockade," has had its name changed to the less intimidating "Operation Hold the Line."
The oratory is fiercest in California, where an anti-immigrant mood seems to reflect that state's dire economic situation. Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, is espousing the toughest controls. He called for a constitutional amendment to deny citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants, which is now guaranteed by law.
Such proposals do not play as well in other states, as Jim Mattox, a Senate candidate in Tuesday's Texas primary, discovered. Early in the campaign, Mr. Mattox, a Democrat, advocated stationing United States troops on the border as part of an effort to use unneeded military assets in crime-fighting at home. Hispanic voters, whom Mr. Mattox had been close to for years and who are an important voting bloc in Texas, were furious. Mr. Mattox's Democratic rivals attacked as well, forcing him to play down the issue.
Vanna Slaughter, coordinator of the Texas Immigration and Refugee Coalition, a new statewide advocacy group for immigrants, said, "We were really quite appalled by it because Jim Mattox for most of us has been a pretty friendly individual."
Mr. Mattox defended his proposal, but acknowledged that he had underestimated the reaction.
"My opponents said there would be tanks running up and down the border with rifles aimed at everyone," he said in an interview. "You've got activists on all sides who are trying to defend our current immigration policies, which are impossible to defend."
As the United States continues to admit a record number of legal immigrants and refugees, and they settle largely in relatively few states, the issue will only intensify.
The Gallup Poll reported last year that 65 percent of Americans believe the number of legal immigrants to the United States should be decreased, twice the number who felt that way 30 years ago.
Bill Ong Hing, a professor at Stanford Law School who specializes in immigration, said he feared that the rush to tighten immigration had resulted in hastily drafted measures that penalize migrants for domestic economic problems that were not their fault. "It's opportunism on the backs of immigrants," he said.
But Representative Lamar Smith of San Antonio, chairman of the House Republican task force on illegal immigration, says it will be hard to fight that attitude.
"Individuals who want to protect illegal aliens are going to be seen as people who are putting the interests of illegal aliens ahead of the interests of taxpayers and workers," Mr. Smith said. "And that's a dangerous position to be in."

HEADLINE: U.S. MOVES TO EASE BEIJING SANCTIONS

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CANBERRA, Australia, March 7

 BODY:
In a gesture of good will toward Beijing, the Clinton Administration has begun to pave the way for the Hughes Aircraft Company to launch a commercial satellite from China.
If the Administration gives its approval within the next few weeks, as expected, it will represent the second time this year that the United States has eased punitive economic sanctions against China. 
 The latest step, reported today by Secretary of State Warren Christopher as he arrived here for talks with Prime Minister Paul Keating, comes as Washington presses Beijing to substantially improve its human rights record so the Clinton Administration can extend China's preferential trade benefits when they expire in June. The launching would put an Australian communications satellite in orbit.
Senior Administration officials, including Mr. Christopher, who is to make his first trip to China as Secretary of State later this week, have denied that Washington is changing its sanctions policy toward China, but the Hughes decision is bound to be interpreted in Beijing as another gesture in line with the Administration's six-month-old policy of intensified political and economic engagement.
 
Pentagon Aide to Beijing
 Indeed, as part of the strategy to engage China rather than to isolate it, Frank Wisner, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, will accompany Mr. Christopher to Beijing and stay to discuss ways to upgrade the two countries' military relationship, senior Pentagon officials said today. Mr. Wisner will be the highest-ranking Pentagon official to visit China since the 1989 crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators.
Last August the Administration imposed sanctions on an estimated $1 billion in high-technology trade with China, after Beijing shipped missile technology and components to Pakistan in violation of international accords.
The sanctions affected the planned launchings of seven commercial satellites on Chinese rockets. In November, on the eve of President Clinton's meeting with President Jiang Zemin of China, Mr. Clinton's national security advisers agreed to keep the sanctions in place unless China signed a formal agreement adhering to the principles of the international arms accord.
But in early January, the White House reversed itself and approved the launching of two commercial satellites from China, one by Martin Marietta, the other by Hughes. White House lawyers said satellites that did not include items on the State Department's munitions list could be approved for export.
Mr. Christopher said tonight that approval of the launchings would be consistent with United States law because Hughes had reconfigured the satellite to remove sensitive coding equipment. That means the satellite would need only Commerce Department licensing, a much easier process.
Asked about the wisdom of allowing the launching when Washington is pressing China on human rights and on the missile accord, Mr. Christopher said it "simply sends a signal of even-handed treatment."

HEADLINE: Paul K. Feyerabend, 70, Anti-Science Philosopher

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Prof. Paul Karl Feyerabend, a gadfly philosopher of science who asserted that scientists have no particular claims on truth, died on Feb. 11 in Geneva. He was 70.
He died of a brain tumor, said officials at the University of California at Berkeley, where he taught from 1959 until he reached emeritus status in 1990. He held a concurrent appointment at the Polytechnic Institute of Zurich. 
 Dr. Feyerabend died just days after finishing the final chapter of his autobiography, on which he had worked for more than a decade. University officials in Berkeley said his friends reported that he was still able to write with his right hand despite growing paralysis.
Dr. Feyerabend held that the rationality of science did not really exist and that the special status and prestige of scientists are based on their own claims to objective truth. He once said that "conceited and intimidating scholars, covered with honorary degrees and university chairs," can be tripped up by a lawyer able to look through the jargon and expose the ignorance behind dazzling displays of omniscience.
"Scientists have more money, more authority, more sex appeal than they deserve," Dr. Feyerabend said in a 1979 article in Science magazine, "and the most stupid procedures and the most laughable results are surrounded with an aura of excellence. It is time to cut them down to size."
To that end, he became a prolific author of articles and books. His best known works are "Against Method" (1975), which was translated into 19 languages, "Science in a Free Society" (1978) and "Farewell to Reason" (1987), a collection of essays.
Dr. Feyerabend was one of the most radical challengers to the long-accepted notion that science is rational and progressive. If there was progress in science, he insisted, it was because scientists broke every principle in the rationalists' rule book and adopted the principle that "anything goes."
Individual theories are not consistent with one another, Dr. Feyerabend held, and since there is no single "scientific method," scientific success flows not only from rational arguments, but also from a mixture of subterfuge, rhetoric, conjecture, politics and propaganda.
 
Served in German Army
 He was born in Vienna and served in World War II as an officer in the German Army, winning the Iron Cross for bravery. In 1945, while fighting the Red Army on the Eastern front, he was shot in the back; the wound left him with a severe limp.
He studied history, physics and astronomy at the University of Vienna, where he received his Ph.D. in 1951. Dr. Feyerabend then became an admirer and protege of the philosopher Karl Popper of the London School of Economics, whose scientific rationalism he later tried to refute.
Besides his teaching posts at Berkeley and Zurich, he taught at the University of Bristol in England, the Institute of Fine Arts and Science in Vienna, Yale University and the Free University in Berlin.
He is survived by his wife, Grazia Borrini Feyerabend.

HEADLINE: Consolidation of Contractors Suits the Pentagon

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
The proposed merger of the Grumman Corporation and the Martin Marietta Corporation fits snugly in the Defense Department's post-cold-war strategy to maintain a smaller but robust base of military contractors.
The end of the cold war has left military contractors scrambling to survive on a shrinking Pentagon budget for jets, ships and tanks. The Pentagon's purchases of new weapons and equipment have declined 64 percent since 1985, military industry analysts say. 
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry has urged military contractors to carry out an orderly consolidation that preserves America's ability to develop the most advanced technology at affordable costs and to expand again if unforeseen security threats emerge down the road.
 
 
Retrenching Is Half Done
 For the Pentagon, the tricky part in all this has been to steer the shrinking industry in the desired direction but to intervene as little as possible. "We're not going to try to manipulate the consolidation of the defense industry, but we want to encourage it," Mr. Perry told reporters in September.
Pentagon officials and industry analysts say the process of consolidation is only about half completed.
"Such mergers and realignment in the defense industry is an inevitable result of the downsizing, and a private deal arrived at between two highly successful companies to become a single, integrated, more efficient company is very much along the lines that Bill Perry is trying to promote," John M. Deutch, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, said in an interview.
In this transition, Martin Marietta has quickly emerged as one of the most aggressive companies. It bought General Electric's aerospace division in 1992 and announced its intent to buy General Dynamics' space system division last year.
The fate of Grumman, however, illustrates the opposite side of the acquisition equation. "Frankly, the world was going to get an awful lot tougher for people in our business," Renso L. Caporali, Grumman's chairman, said today.
 
 
Commercial Applications
 Pentagon officials say they want not only a smaller, healthy military industry, but one that is more flexible. Mr. Perry and other senior Pentagon officials have sought to encourage companies to produce both military and commercial products, or at least to preserve their arms-making capability.
At the same time, the Pentagon and Congress have pledged to overhaul the cumbersome system the military uses to buy nearly $50 billion of new equipment each year. The Defense Department is also rewriting regulations to allow the military to buy more commercial products. Such equipment is less expensive than items built to military specifications, which were deemed necessary during the cold war.
Underlying the Pentagon's push for consolidation and all the other reforms is the military's desperate need to cut costs. Commanders face a choice between paying for a costly acquisition system, including an inefficient industry, or using that money to pay and train troops, and keep them ready for combat.
In pursuing this course, the Pentagon is walking a political high wire. It encourages consolidation but is also trying to be sensitive to communities affected by plant closings and base shutdowns by offering economic incentives to cushion the blow.
"While this is painful for local communities, this is good for the Defense Department because it reduces overhead, and is good for the economy because it frees up capital now tied up in excess capacity," said Loren B. Thompson, deputy director for National Security Studies at Georgetown University. Indeed, the pain on Long Island will be felt in the elimination of an unspecified number of jobs that Martin Marietta said today was needed to improve the efficiency of the combined company.
 
 
 
Subsidized Industries
 The consequences of unfettered consolidation extend only so far. In contrast to the Bush Administration, the Clinton White House has said it will subsidize a few critical industries that cannot produce widely used commercial products. For example, the Navy is seeking to spend $2.3 billion to buy a Seawolf submarine that it says it does not need. But Pentagon officials say it would be more expensive to reopen production lines if they are closed than to run them at low levels.
Asked if he was in essence picking winners and losers in this industrial shakeout, Mr. Perry said last fall, when he was Deputy Defense Secretary: "I don't see it that way. We're determining capabilities we need and taking action."
Industry analysts say there is still enough excess capacity -- and accompanying cost inefficiencies -- to warrant broader consolidation.
"The Pentagon wants industry to sort it out themselves so Government doesn't have to do it for them," said Richard Bitzinger, a military analyst for the Defense Budget Project, an independent research organization. "They don't see a situation arising yet where there are dangerous monopolies exercising an unfair advantage. It's the best way to preserve the best parts of an industry at the least direct cost to the Government."

But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said he still thought the authority's parent board would enact his proposal.
Speaking at a hearing of the City Council's Committee on Transportation, the Transit Authority president, Alan F. Kiepper, said the Mayor's plan to consolidate the New York City Police Department, the housing police and the transit police into one entity would lead to an increase in subway crime, which has been declining in the last four years. 
 "The customers of the subway system would suffer," Mr. Kiepper said. "It's obvious we have an effective policing system for the subway. Why disturb that? What's to be gained? We might save a little money, but at what price?"
The Transit Authority was one of several agencies to present testimony yesterday as the Council considered the impact of Mr. Giuliani's budget plans. In a separate hearing on welfare programs, the committee chairman lashed out at administration officials for being unable to explain how a planned 3,626-person reduction in the Human Resources Administration's work force would affect programs and services.
 
A Campaign Cornerstone
 The plan to merge the three police forces was a cornerstone of Mr. Giuliani's mayoral campaign last year. The Mayor has maintained that consolidating the three police forces, with a total of 38,000 members, would make a more efficient force and save millions of dollars in administrative overhead costs each year.
At a news conference yesterday after Mr. Kiepper's testimony, Mr. Giuliani said that although the plan would be subject to approval by the Transit Authority's parent board, "I'm hopeful that the support to do it is there."
Mr. Kiepper also said he thought any merger would require approval by the State Legislature. "There is a state law which authorizes the Transit Authority to establish a police department to police the subways," he said.
In a first step toward merging the police forces, Mr. Giuliani has planned to consolidate the various forces' administrative offices, emergency services and detective bureaus. Mr. Kiepper said that plan, too, "is ill advised." He continued: "A police department has to have the support services and the administrative arm. To say they should operate without that makes a clumsy arrangement."
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the parent body of the agency that runs the city's subways and buses, has not taken an official position on the matter, although the authority's chairman, Peter E. Stangl, has opposed the plan. The M.T.A. is governed by a board with 14 voting members appointed by the governor. Four of them are nominated by the mayor.
 
Nominees for Board
 On Saturday, Mr. Giuliani nominated Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson, Transportation Commissioner Elliott G. Sander, and Joseph J. Lhota, director of economic development initiatives, for the board. Prema Mathal-Davis, Commissioner of the Department for the Aging under Mayor David N. Dinkins, holds the fourth mayoral position on the board.
Cecily Bailey, a spokeswoman for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, said Mr. Cuomo was open to merger proposals but would be "looking for the support by the affected parties."
At the hearing on welfare, Stephen DiBrienza, chairman of Council Committee on General Welfare, became incensed after the Human Resources Commissioner, Marva L. Hammons, told him that the staff reduction was still at "a planning stage."
 
Summoned to Testify
 In response, Mr. DiBrienza, a Democrat-Liberal from Brooklyn, unexpectedly summoned Linda Gibbs, the deputy director of the Mayor's budget office, to testify. She said that all agencies had been told to reduce their staffs by 16 percent through the severance program but that it was up to the commissioners to decide which positions would be removed.
Mr. DiBrienza lashed back, calling the answers "offensive and somewhat secretive and mysterious for no reason."

HEADLINE: A Fading Political Powerhouse;
New York Democrats Complain to Washington of Needs Ignored and Favors Forgotten

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
For 12 long years, as the Democratic politicians who led New York endured deep Republican spending cuts and cold shoulders from Washington, their perpetual cry was that pointed Brooklynese lament: "We was robbed!" They took it for granted that Bill Clinton's victory, sped at several turning points by strong New York support, would change all that.
But now, with perhaps as many New Yorkers holding senior jobs in the White House and Federal agencies as at any time since the New Deal (when the President was a former New York Governor), New York officials complain that New York itself is what's taken for granted, and their rising cry is, "What have you done for us lately?" 
 The griping covers a range of ground, from broad policy to plain old pork to the presence on the White House staff of a special assistant whose chief responsibility is the political care and feeding of California, the state that has long since supplanted New York as the nation's political powerhouse, with 54 electoral votes to New York's 33, and that is much less securely in the Clinton camp.
"We like to think we had a lot to do with electing President Clinton," said Representative Thomas J. Manton, the Queens County Democratic leader, who backed Mr. Clinton early and now frets about lack of patronage and attention. "Maybe we didn't have as much to do with it as we thought."
 
'Sometimes You Scratch Your Head'
 Or as Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn put it: "There's no question we have more access, and it can make a difference. But sometimes you scratch your head and wonder what it brings you."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is facing a potentially tough re-election campaign and who has never had smooth relations with Mr. Clinton, was so exercised at the thought that New York's influence might be waning that he proposed moving its 1996 presidential primary from April to early March, to compete with California, which moved its primary up from June. There is similar talk in New Jersey, which Mr. Clinton won for the Democrats for the first time since 1964.
Clinton Administration officials freely concede the President's debts to New York, where his victory in the Democratic primary staved off the last real threat by Edmund G. Brown Jr., where the Democratic Convention nominated him and where he won 50 percent of the vote in the general election, a feat exceeded only in his home state of Arkansas. He is to visit the city again on Thursday, one of a half-dozen trips there since taking office, to highlight his proposals for youth service and fighting crime. But they say New York is just one of a handful of important big states, like New Jersey, that Mr. Clinton needs to win again.
Mr. Cuomo and the congressional delegation can recite their grievances like a chorus: The proposed cuts in the current budget for home-heating aid to the poor and for mass-transit operating subsidies, the fears about how regional health-insurance pools could punish places with lots of poor people and how changes in medical education could hurt a state that trains 15 percent of the nation's doctors, the loss to Stanford University of a $36 million high-energy physics laboratory that had seemed a lock for Cornell.
 
Deep Cuts in Reserves
 The latest blow came last week when the Defense Department proposed to cut 5,217 slots from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps Reserves in New York -- more than any other state and twice as many as in California, which has half again as many reserves to begin with. The Army said that reservists in the Northeast had much poorer recruitment and retention rates, but New Yorkers say something broader is afoot.
"This administration is definitely tilted toward California," said Representative Sherwood Bohlert, a moderate Republican from the Mohawk Valley. "There's just no doubt about it."
It is an old complaint. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan noted that the New Deal itself did not especially favor New York, though its creators were New Yorkers.
"The Roosevelt Administration was populated by officials whose policy it was to develop the South and the West pretty much at the expense of the Northeast, especially New York," the Senator wrote last year in his annual report on the gap between New York's contribution to Federal taxes and its receipts in Federal aid. "Hence the Tennessee Valley Authority, the great Western dams, the credit programs and so through that great array of New Deal programs."
In fact, many New Yorkers acknowledge, their expectations were impossibly high, so that the shifts in priorities and the empathy with urban problems that Democrats in the White House have brought seem cold consolation, while complaints that might have been small beer a few years ago loom large.
The truth is that many of the New Yorkers in big jobs, like Harold M. Ickes, the deputy chief of staff; Robert E. Rubin, the chief assistant for economic policy; Bernard W. Nussbaum, the White House counsel who resigned under pressure last weekend, and Roger C. Altman, the deputy treasury secretary, have been so busy shaping global policy or embroiled in political woes like the Whitewater affair that New York is the last thing on their minds.
 
A Tough Sell
 "When people become high officials of the Government, they stop being New Yorkers or Chicagoans or Angelenos," said Felix G. Rohatyn, the former chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation. "They become Government officials."
Moreover, while the President's proposals in fields like health, welfare and crime might be good for New York, many of the specifics that would most help the state remain a tough sell on Capitol Hill, even with Mr. Moynihan's standing as the first chairman of the Senate Finance Committee from the Empire State in more than 150 years.
For example, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Moynihan spent months trying to persuade the White House to change the formula for the Federal contribution to Medicaid, which is based on a state's per capita income, and takes no account of the number of poor people, labor costs or medical needs. The result is that the Federal Government pays 80 percent of Medicaid costs in a state like Mississippi and just 50 percent in states like New York and California.
The White House sent its bill to Congress without changing the formula to New York's advantage, since doing so would hurt many more states than it would help, and Mr. Moynihan is left to make common cause with other rich states like California and round up the votes for change, an uphill battle.
Administration officials cite the way such hard realities can bind even rival states as proof that they are not playing favorites.
"I don't know the source of the upset, but I do know the process is we've been talking both with the state and the delegation," said John P. Hart, deputy director of the White House's office of intergovernmental affairs. "We believe New York wins under the President's health proposals, and the whole effort is staffed with a multitude of New Yorkers, who are very sensitive to its needs."
 
'A Critical State'
 The White House press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, said that California's natural and economic disasters had made it a "special case," but that the President had no intention of taking New York for granted. "New York is a critical state," she said.
There are realities, however.
"Unfortunately, Clinton is anxious to make universal some standards which are already quite high in New York, in terms of programs like health care and so on," said former Representative Barber B. Conable of upstate Alexander, N.Y. "That may not be a bad idea, but it means almost inevitably there'll be some watering down of programs in New York."
Hugh L. Carey saw New York-Washington tensions from both ends, as a Brooklyn Congressman when the state had 41 House members -- 10 more than now -- and then as Governor in the fiscal crisis.
"New Yorkers are born not to be satisfied," he said. "This is the launching of a major aircraft carrier, and you can't expect it's going to go sailing down the waves the first day."
From this perspective, New York's record appears mixed, though calculating it is impossible, because the current budget year, this President's first, is unfinished, and the fight is just beginning for the coming year. For many proposed cuts in the President' current budget -- drafted under tight spending caps imposed by past deficit-reduction agreements -- there are compensating benefits. Thus mass-transit operating funds would be trimmed, but money for construction would increase; money for housing would be cut, but other programs for the homeless expanded.
Even the opposition party, in the person of New York City's new Republican Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, is cautious. "The story isn't over," said Alice Tetelman, Mr. Giuliani's new lobbyist here. "The fight over welfare and health reform is just beginning, and when you look at the role that Senator Moynihan and Congressman Rangel are going to play, I'm optimistic that New York's needs will receive the attention they deserve."
 
More Than Equal
 Cabinet officers like Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who was raised in Harlem, and Donna Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who grew to prominence as president of Hunter College, visit New York often. Their bureaucracies are filled with New Yorkers who return phone calls and requests for help from people back home.
But Administration officials quietly acknowledge that is not the point. They say the New Yorkers want to be preeminent, not just equal to the other big states, like Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and New Jersey, that are important to the President but less important than California, where his poll standings were shaky long before the recent earthquake led him to send billions of dollars in aid.
"Maybe we should be doing more just for New York; we probably should," one senior agency official said. "But that opens up a whole can of worms, with a lot of other states in line."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Climb As Cost of Oil Declines

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Buoyed by a decline in oil prices and a rally in European bonds, Treasury prices rose and yields fell yesterday for only the sixth time since the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Feb. 4.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond rose 12/32 yesterday in late trading to 934/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the prices, fell to 6.79 percent, from 6.83 percent on Friday. Still, the yield has risen about half a percentage point since the Fed acted. 
 Dealers said the European bond trading set the tone for trading in New York. Treasury bonds were already up a quarter of a point in Europe even before the New York market opened. Gerald A. Guile, senior manager of fixed-income securities at Advest Inc., said the European rally was apparently started by traders who had sold bonds short last week, only to find themselves scrambling to buy securities yesterday to cover those short positions as prices rose. In a short sale, a trader sells a borrowed security in the expectation of profiting by buying it back at a lower price.
 
Inflation Worries Assuaged
 The decline in crude oil added strength to the Treasury market's rally, because the drop portends low inflation. Oil producers at a weekend meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council showed no sign of cutting production in the face of declining production.
Analysts also said the Treasury market was relieved that the Federal Reserve made no move yesterday to nudge up short-term interest rates. About the only move the central bank made was to add reserves to the banking system at its normal time of intervention.
Louis Crandall, chief economist for R. H. Wrightson & Associates, said the Fed's move to inject funds into the banking system was a confirmation of the status quo. Economists said the injection reflected a shortage of reserves in the banking system, rather than a change in interest rate policy.
Yields on intermediate- and shorter-term Treasury notes also fell yesterday. And the rate for the one-year bill fell two basis points, to 4.05 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Volatile Market
 Analysts at MMS International noted that the Treasury market was characterized by extreme volatility last week, continuing the bearish trend that has been in place since the Fed pushed up the Federal funds rate on Feb. 4. Nevertheless, these analysts saw prospects for a rebound on the long end. Some analysts, contending that the longer-term inflation fears are exaggerated, expect the long end of the yield curve to stabilize in the weeks ahead.
Inflation, which erodes the returns on fixed-income securities, has become an obsession for some investors, leading to some extreme reactions to any sign of rising prices. Some analysts and traders blame the Fed for the market's inflation scare, contending it tightened when it did not appear to be necessary. Others said the Fed's slow response heightened the concern about inflation.
William B. Shea, senior vice president for government bond trading at the Nikko Securities Company International Inc., said two days of extremely trading high volume last week proved troublesome for short positions. "Technically, when you have a climax to selling, it will be followed up by buying," Mr. Shea said. "But the little investor should remain cautious and stay at the front of the yield curve, inside the two-year maturity."
He added, "They are better off waiting for a confirmed bottom on the long end of the market."
 
Traders See Opportunity
 Yesterday the Treasury sold $25.2 billion in bills, but aside from the weekly auctions, no new supply of Government securities is due until the Treasury's monthly two- and five-year note auctions on March 22 and 23. Traders said the respite might give the bond market a little window of opportunity to bounce, if demand outstrips supply, pushing prices higher and rates lower.
At the weekly Treasury auction yesterday, the average discount rate for a three-month bill was 3.52 percent, up from 3.40 percent last week; it was the highest since June 29, 1992, when it was 3.59 percent. The average discount rate for the six-month maturity was 3.75 percent, up from 3.61 percent last week; it was the highest since June 22, 1992, when it was 3.77 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	99.110	98.104	Discounted Rate	3.52%	3.75%	Coupon Yield	3.60%	3.88%	High Price	99.115	98.114	Discounted Rate	3.50%	3.73%	Coupon Yield	3.58%	3.86%	Low Price	99.110	98.104	Discounted Rate	3.52%	3.75%	Coupon Yield	3.60%	3.88%	Accepted at low price	27%	26%	Total applied for	$58,165,092	$47,008,815	Accepted	$12,635,922	$12,610,812	Noncompetitive	$1,384,871	$997,560	
 
Both issues are dated March 10, 1994. The three-monthbills mature on June 9, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on Sept. 8, 1994.

HEADLINE: Consumer Credit Up Again But the Monthly Pace Eases

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Consumer credit rose $6 billion in January -- the eighth straight increase -- but at a slower pace than the previous month.
Borrowing climbed at a 9.1 percent annual rate, following an 11.5 percent increase in December, revised from the previously reported 11.2 percent, and a 10.7 percent rise in November, the Federal Reserve said yesterday. 
 The December increase was $7.5 billion.
The January rise was smaller than many economists predicted, but they did expect a slower pace, based on a previously reported five-tenths of 1 percent drop in retail sales because of harsh winter weather in much of the nation and the Los Angeles earthquake.
The latest rise brought outstanding debt to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $796.1 billion.
The Fed said growth in revolving credit, which includes credit cards, accelerated in January while growth in auto and other consumer loans slowed.
Many economists expect consumer spending, which represents about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, to level off this year after a buying binge in the final months of 1993 that helped fuel a strong expansion in the economy in the fourth quarter.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board yesterday: "Our economy is doing quite well and it looks as if it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. What we've been striving for is long-term sustainable growth with low inflation, and that's what's resulted thus far."
By category, the Fed said auto loans in January rose at a 2.7 percent annual rate, to $279 billion, after a 6.4 percent increase in December. Revolving credit picked up 14.2 percent, to $284.8 billion, exceeding the previous month's 9.5 percent rise. Other consumer loans climbed 10.6 percent, to $232.3 billion, after a 20.4 percent jump in December.

Talk of Lower German Rates Helps Dollar Gain on Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended narrowly mixed yesterday, firming against the German mark on renewed talk about lower German interest rates but slipping against some other European currencies.
In New York, the dollar rose to 1.7210 marks in late trading from 1.7190 marks on Friday. But the British pound edged up to $1.4902 from $1.4900. 
 News that the large I. G. Metall engineering workers' union had reached a tentative agreement with management raised hopes for a cut in German credit market rates, possibly as early as tomorrow.
 
 
One Obstacle Removed
 The I. G. Metall deal averted a potentially crippling strike only hours before its planned start yesterday.
Many analysts suspected that a strike, along with concerns about unsettlingly high German money supply numbers, would prevent Germany's Bundesbank from easing rates because of concerns about inflation.
But dealers said the wage agreement removed one obstacle to a German easing and supported the dollar.
The dollar tends to benefit from lower German interest rates, which diminish the attractiveness of mark-denominated assets.
"The feeling is that the wage settlement gives the Bundesbank more room to cut interest rates," Bruce English, vice president and head of institutional sales at ABM-AMRO Bank, said. "It makes the dollar a little bit more attractive."
While inching higher against the mark, the dollar failed to make strong gains. Increased attention to the Whitewater affair surrounding the Clinton Administration has made some traders jittery.
"There's talk in the market that if the situation gets any worse it's going to start pressuring the dollar," David Durst, vice president at Bear, Stearns & Company, said.
The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.60 yen, down from 105.65 yen on Friday.
Some traders said the dollar seemed to have bottomed out against the yen. As such, they said they had begun to shift their focus toward stronger American economic fundamentals and away from the trade tensions between Washington and Tokyo.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's quotes, included: 1.4408 Swiss francs, down from 1.4410; 5.8445 French francs, down from 5.8455; $1.3558 (Canadian), up from $1.3573 (Canadian), and 1,691 Italian lire, up from 1,687.

April Contract for Crude Oil Plummets 47 Cents, to $14.10

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Oil prices fell sharply yesterday, approaching their five-year lows, on the growing belief that the world's major oil producers would not cut output even as consumption declines in the second quarter.
A Gulf Cooperation Council meeting over the weekend failed to discuss OPEC oil production quotas, a clue that no reductions were planned at a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in three weeks. 
 Demand for petroleum subsides in spring after the Northern Hemisphere's winter heating season and before the peak summer driving season.
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for April delivery dropped 47 cents, to $14.10 a barrel. Near the close of trading, the May crude oil futures contract hit a low of $14.08, and many see a test of $13.75, the nearby contract's five-year low hit in December.
Cyrus Tahmassebi, Ashland Oil's chief economist, predicted that OPEC would continue its quota of 24.5 million barrels a day.
Demand for OPEC's oil is seen as shrinking to 23.7 million barrels a day in the quarter beginning in April, and non-OPEC producers continue to pump at a brisk pace.
"But if prices continue to go down the next few days, it may force OPEC to take action and that may mean a cut," Mr. Tahmassebi said.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is scheduled to meet March 25 in Geneva.
"I think the market is factoring into prices right now a rollover" of the OPEC quota, said Victor Yu, trader at the Nikkhah Energy Group.
"It is expected to get colder here later this week, but for all intents and purposes the heating oil season is almost over," he added.
Among other energy contracts, April heating oil fell 1.52 cents, to 43.37 cents a gallon; April unleaded gasoline shed 1.38 cents, to 43.75 cents a gallon, after hitting a new contract low, and April natural gas sank 2.1 cents, to $2.167 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Sinking oil prices helped push down inflation-conscious precious metals, which have been under pressure because of concern that the Federal Reserve would increase interest rates. At the Commodity Exchange in New York, April gold dropped $1.70, to $376.90 an ounce, and May silver lost 6.3 cents, to $5.207 an ounce. April platinum, traded at the New York Mercantile Exchange, declined $1.80, to $393.50.
The Fed has said it is keeping an eye on gold prices as an inflation indicator, and may raise interest rates to keep a lid on the economy and inflation.

HEADLINE: NASA Budget Cuts Raise Serious Concerns Over Safety of Shuttle

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.

 BODY:
DESPITE a picture-perfect blastoff of the space shuttle Columbia on Friday and recent euphoria over the successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope, funds for upkeep of the nation's shuttle fleet have been going down steadily, touching off a debate over whether the space agency is being forced to cut corners and raise the risk that its temperamental spaceships might break down or blow up.
Private experts say a rush of belt-tightening is threatening safety. But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, while conceding that it is trimming fat, insists that nothing is being done that would endanger the lives of astronauts. NASA officials say no program change will weaken the agency's commitment to put safety first at all times. 
 The winged spaceships are the world's most complex and dangerous vehicles for the routine transport of people. The risk of catastrophic failure during the shuttle's fiery eight-and-a-half-minute ascent to orbit, the most dangerous part of the flight, is estimated by NASA at about 1 in 75 missions and by private experts at about 1 in 60. In theory, lapses in maintenance could make those numbers even gloomier.
The Challenger disaster eight years ago, in which six astronauts and a high school teacher died, was seen as partly a result of tight budgets that caused declines in maintenance and repair. Joints on booster rockets were known to be weak, but replacements arrived too late to prevent a blowtorch-like leakage of burning fuel and the deadly explosion.
In December, new questions were raised about the booster rockets, which had begun firing unevenly. Critics charged that this type of unevenness could break the spacecraft apart in mid-flight.
The latest focus of worry is a system that has long been considered one of the spaceship's riskiest: the high-pressure pumps that feed liquid hydrogen to combustion chambers for explosive burning. Each of the shuttle's three main engines is fed by one of these high-pressure fuel pumps.
The 3.5-ton pumps are each about the size of an automobile engine but generate an astonishing 75,000 horsepower. This is achieved largely by spinning them at 37,000 revolutions per minute, more than 12 times as fast as the crankshaft of a car zipping along at 60 miles per hour. These rotations put huge stresses on the 122 turbine blades, each about the size of a half-dollar and each producing about 700 horsepower. The exit pressures from the pump are so great that hydrogen fuel, if shot straight up, would rise 34 miles.
"The pumps have been a source of concern from day one," Dr. Seymour C. Himmel, a senior member of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, said in a telephone interview. The high-pressure pumps and similar gear long ago led NASA to conclude that the shuttle's main engines have the highest risk of catastrophic failure of any shuttle system, higher than even the booster rockets that touched off the Challenger disaster.
NASA officials say apprehension about the pumps recently soared when defects were found in a number of their internal welds, after an anonymous tip led to inspections. While no flaw was discovered in the all-important turbine blades, the problematic welds have been banned from flight hardware and have prompted a major inquiry.
"We're under the gun to reduce resources to the shuttle," said Dr. Daniel R. Mulville, a senior official in the safety office at NASA headquarters in Washington. "It's a challenge, but our approach is not to compromise safety."
Joseph J. Trento, a former Congressional aide who follows the shuttle program for the National Security News Service, a private group based in Washington, said the weld troubles arose when NASA, as part of a cost-cutting move, began letting the manufacturer rather than Federal inspectors verify its pump-assembly work.
In general, Mr. Trento said, NASA is playing with fire by trying to run the shuttle on the cheap. "They're keeping the thing together with baling wire and matchsticks," he said. "The budget is being cut and nobody is paying attention."
Funds for shuttle operations have fallen for several years in a row, according to NASA. The budget went from $4.074 billion in the fiscal year 1992 to $3.870 billion in 1993 and $3.601 billion in 1994. In the proposed 1995 budget that President Clinton recently presented to Congress, the funds would drop further still, to $3.381 billion. If corrected for inflation, that is less money than shuttle operations were getting at the time of the 1986 Challenger disaster.
 
Warning of Calamity
 Daniel S. Goldin, NASA's Administrator and a proponent of streamlining in what many have seen as a bloated agency, recently told Congress that the budget could fall no further without raising the risk of calamity.
"This is it," he said. "We can't get any closer to the bone." Mr. Goldin added. "Based on what we know today, we cannot cut human space flight any further without impacting on safety."
While this might seem like budgetary grandstanding, a wide variety of experts, including NASA engineers, say the situation is serious.
One way NASA has trimmed its shuttle budget over the years is by deferring or stretching out costly safety improvements. For instance, work was halted a couple years ago on a replacement high-pressure fuel pump. While the current pump has more than 300 welds, the new one was to have no welds at all and was to incorporate a host of new high-technology materials, vastly increasing its reliability and making it virtually fail-safe. But it would also weigh hundreds of pounds more, negating one reason the lighter-weight welded pump was originally developed.
Another way NASA is trying to cut costs is by reducing inspections of shuttle parts and repair procedures. Inspections skyrocketed after the Challenger disaster. Experts estimate that every time a worker touches the shuttle with a tool that action will, on average, be checked by seven inspectors at one point or another. In all, Congressional experts say, some two million signatures and approvals are needed before any shuttle thunders off the launching pad.
Dr. Himmel of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel said that self-inspection was a broad trend within NASA and industry. And it is fundamentally healthy, he argued. By focusing on building in quality rather than on weeding out poor work, the result is a better product, he said. In theory, any problems are caught by final inspections.
"They're trying to change the culture so that the people who do the work are given a large part of the responsibility for the quality," he said. "Inspection is often just people stamping a piece of paper."
He added: "There's always some degree of risk when you change a system. But managers are suppose to monitor that carefully."
The risks for shuttles became evident when the weld flaws in the high-pressure pump slipped past final inspectors, though, according to NASA officials, none slipped far enough through the parts system to be relied upon during the launching of a shuttle into space.
NASA officials say that a report on Sunday in The Daily News of New York that the Columbia went into space with flawed welds was not accurate. Otto K. Goetz, manager for the shuttle's main engine at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said in response to the article: "We are not flying with faulty welds. If they don't meet the rigorous standards, we don't fly."
 
Problem Is Reported
 Dr. Mulville of NASA headquarters said the weld problem was disclosed anonymously on Nov. 15 through NASA's Safety Reporting System, which was set up after the Challenger disaster. Five kinds of welds in the high-pressure pumps were reported to be faulty, he said. Quick inspections found that the welds were out of alignment. Adjoining pieces were mismatched, weakening the joints. Particularly troubling was weld No. 51, which could not be rewelded without taking the pumps apart.
No moving parts had flawed welds. Instead, the flaws were located on interior casings and areas of the pump that helped direct the flow of hydrogen. And the welds were to operate under enormous pressures, in one case about 7,500 pounds per square inch. At worst, Dr. Mulville said, their failure would cause the collapse of a hydrogen-carrying pathway, causing the pump and its engine to seize up and come to a screeching halt.
"It's a safe shutdown," said Dr. Mulville, "not a catastrophic failure."
Dr. Goetz said all pumps with serious alignment problems in their welds had been prohibited from space flight until a NASA Materials Review Board decided what to do. One option now being considered, he said, is simply to reduce the number of times a suspect part is allowed to power a shuttle. For instance, weld No. 51 is normally allowed to undergo the rigors of a shuttle flight 36 times, but that number might be lowered to the high 20's, Mr. Goetz said, to reduce the risk of a breakdown.
The other option, he said, which would be costly, would be to repair and rebuild the pumps from the bottom up.
Mr. Trento, who has gathered NASA documents on the problem through the Freedom of Information Act, said the situation also involved charges of fraud.
After NASA was alerted to the problem, Mr. Trento said, the agency found that inspection documents had been falsified, apparently in an effort to prevent the delay of the Hubble repair mission in December. "The F.B.I. was brought in and is conducting a criminal probe," Mr. Trento said in an interview.
The manufacturer of the pump, the Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International, based in Canoga Park, Calif., said it had no comment on the pump issue and directed all questions to the space agency. A number of NASA officials said they would have no comment on any F.B.I. investigation regarding the pump or anything else.
The Justice Department recently made public allegations of fraud on the part of several NASA employees and contractors and declared that its investigations were continuing.
 
Action on Alternative Pump
 Last month, after the weld problems came to light, NASA requested and got permission from Congress to renew development work on the alternative high-pressure fuel pump, which is being built by Pratt & Whitney. It is unclear whether the agency's move was related to the discovery of the weld flaws.
The episode is one of a number of recent events where tight budgets and schedules seem to be squeezing the shuttle. Late last year it was reported that the shuttle's boosters had shown large variations in their thrust, prompting a spate of NASA investigations and accusations by critics that the problem was a time bomb waiting to go off.
NASA officials deny any danger, saying the thrust variations do not represent a serious problem. Even the worst foreseeable spike, they say, would be well within the protective limits set for the shuttle. But that assertion was made after NASA lowered the safety margins early last year to keep the shuttles flying.
John E. Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group based in Washington, said the series of recent actions did not build confidence in the future prospects for the world's most complicated flying machine.
"This pattern of activity, of cutting back on safety, of issuing waivers, of flying with problems, strikes me as leading to a situation where the inevitable is going to happen sooner rather than later," he said.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Readings Back to Normal
 CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., March 7 (Reuters) -- Pressure readings were back to normal today in the Columbia's hydraulic system, relieving concerns that the 14-day mission would have to be cut short.
The positive assessment came after three days in which the space shuttle was plagued by an apparent ice buildup in one of its three auxiliary power units. The devices supply hydraulic pressure to operate the shuttle's wing flaps and landing gear. Space officials said the blockage was gone today.


GRAPHIC: The first few minutes of a shuttle flight, while its three main engines are firing, are the most dangerous. Some NASA critics contend that corners have been cut on maintenance and inspection, especially of the high-pressure fuel pumps that feed the engines.
 
"High Pressure, High Risk"
Diagrams: "8 1/2 Perilous Minutes"
 The fuel-delivery system of each main engine has a maze of pipes and valves for circulation of liquids and gases. Hydrogen-rich steam drives turbines of two high-pressure turbopumps (1 and 2) before entering hot gas manifold (3). The hot gas is transferred from the turbines to the main injector (4), where it is mixed with additional liquid oxygen from the oxidizer turbopump (2), for explosive combustion.
 
"Lots of Power in a Small Pump"
 Each of the three 75,000-horsepower fuel pumps weighs about 3.5 tons each, approximately the size of an automobile engine.
 
"Welds Raises Questions"
 Inside each turbopump are rotors bearing 122 half-dollar-size blades, moving at 37,000 revolutions per minute. The safety of key welds in their housing has been questioned, especially that of one weld, No. 51, on the circumference. A plan for a replacement pump with no welds has been reactivated after years of delays because of tight budgets.

Owners Promise To Open The Books

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., March 7

 BODY:
With more than 70 players acting as the receivers, Richard Ravitch threw out the first pitch tonight in the negotiations between the players and club owners for a new collective bargaining agreement. It was more than ceremonial.
In explaining that the owners wanted to achieve "cost certainty" for their business, Ravitch told the players he would share with them all the financial information he and his staff used in hammering out thousands of revenue-sharing plans, one of which the owners finally accepted in January. 
 "Dick said there is nothing they won't turn over," Donald Fehr, head of the players' union, said after a two-hour meeting at a Tampa hotel. "Given the kind of proposal they want, it would be difficult not to give us everything."
 
Absence of Name-Calling
 Nevertheless, it was the kind of step the union and its players are not used to having the owners and their labor negotiators take. The offer by Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, doesn't mean the two sides will have an easier time reaching agreement on the salary cap the owners want. But it helps make for a civilized start.
"Our staffs will be in contact to see if we can arrange the transfer of the data to see if we can make sense out of it," Fehr said. "We want to replicate what the owners went through to get to their revenue-sharing plan. We'll see if we share the same conclusions of their economic analysis."
Fehr and Ravitch and their staffs initially met twice in January 1993, weeks after the owners voted to re-open the labor contract. But the talks then were suspended while Ravitch pursued his effort to get the owners to agree to share a greater portion of their local revenue.
 
Buck Now on Players' Desk
 That plan is in place, but its implementation depends on the players' acceptance of a salary cap. Fehr suggested that the message the players got from Ravitch leaves open the possibility of a change in the revenue-sharing plan.
"They want cost certainty and everything else is flexible," Fehr said. "We take that to mean the revenue-sharing plan is negotiable."
Not that the players are prepared to accept a salary cap that would produce even an amended revenue-sharing plan.
Ravitch said: "We told them our objectives are to produce an economic system in baseball that provides the owners with cost certainty, that we want the right to bargain for the aggregate cost of playing baseball and achieve a system which would enhance competitive balance among clubs. The players' reaction was, 'Why do you want a changed system? How is this different from the past?' "
 
Details No, Dialogue Maybe
 Ravitch did not give the players a detailed proposal, even though that apparently is what the large group came to hear.
"It was intentionally not detailed," Ravitch said. "In the past, when baseball submitted a detailed proposal, we were told it was rigid and it was trashed. Our intention was to state our objectives and elicit their reaction so we could work out a process where we could share revenue information with the players and explain how our revenue distribution system came about."
Fehr said that given the time that has passed since the re-opening of the agreement, the players were frustrated when a proposal was not forthcoming. More frustrating, he said, was the players' presence at the figurative bargaining table with no owners in sight.
 
Players 73, Owners 0
 "The players care an awful lot about baseball and working with the owners," Fehr said, "and if the owners shared that view, they would be here. We had 70-odd players here. Not a single owner will come."
The owners have said that Ravitch is their sole negotiator, and that he, along with his staff -- and not they -- will be at the bargaining sessions.
Although no roll was taken, it appeared that 73 players from at least 10 teams attended the session. Bernie Williams and Steve Howe of the Yankees came from Fort Lauderdale on the other coast. Kevin Brown of Texas came from Port Charlotte, a couple of hours' drive from the south.
Players from Arizona will have a chance to attend the next meeting, scheduled for March 30 in Phoenix.

HEADLINE: Push for Environment Institute

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
IN the belief that environmental policy is often made in scientific ignorance, a broadly based group of scientists, businessmen, environmentalists and politicians has been promoting the establishment of a new Federal institute to guide and finance long-term research on the environment.
After five years of effort, the institute's backers have secured substantial bipartisan support in Congress. And with the appointment today of a leader with international stature on environmental issues to head the campaign, the backers have high hopes that environmental science will soon no longer be, as they see it, the poor stepchild of the Federal research establishment. 
 "It seems this is an idea whose time has come," said Dr. Richard E. Benedick, the new president of the Committee for the National Institute for the Environment, a national, nonprofit organization with more than 5,000 members. Dr. Benedick, a career diplomat who recently retired from the State Department, is perhaps best known as a chief architect of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, the international agreement to protect and restore the earth's ozone layer.
 
Some Political Realities
 Dr. Benedick's optimism about creating an institute for the environment may have to be put on hold. Its key backers in the House of Representatives, where legislation to establish the institution has been introduced, say serious consideration will probably be deferred because of Congress's preoccupation with front-burner issues like health care.
The Clinton Administration has not committed itself on the question, although Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has endorsed it. Carol Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who has been trying to strengthen that agency's science base, said that while she is "for more environmental research, absolutely," it would be important to know what research the institute would pursue.
Nevertheless, there seems little doubt that the proposal has won wide support. Its sponsors range from Representative George E. Brown Jr., a liberal California Democrat who heads the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, to Newt Gingrich, the conservative Republican whip from Georgia. There is also support in the Senate, but no legislation has yet been offered there.
The institute's backers see it as filling a critical but neglected niche in Federal support for science. More than 20 Federal agencies engage in environmental research costing about $5 billion a year, according to a 1993 study by a National Research Council committee. But most of that research serves the agencies' limited agendas and is aimed at short-term regulatory questions.
As a result, advocates of the new institute say, research is conducted in a piecemeal manner that lacks focus on long-term changes in the environment. A Carnegie Commission study in 1992 characterized much of the existing research as "diffuse, reactive and focused on short-range, end-of-the-pipe solutions."
The backers contend further that most Federal environmental research fails to tap the expertise of academia, is done by Government employees and is not usually subjected to the peer-review process through which scientific research is customarily validated. As a result, when policymakers ask questions, the answers are fragmentary and their validity is open to question, the advocates say.
All of this, they add, makes it more likely that environmental policy will be set primarily on political rather than scientific grounds, and even that policy paralysis will result. "The lack of political will to act is due in part to lack of understanding of environmental problems and controversy over the best course of action," the committee says in one of its publications.
The National Research Council panel found no strong commitment to environmental research at the top levels of government. Environmental matters, it found, have been regarded as less important than those involving the military, health and transportation. There is no comprehensive research effort for the environment as a whole, the panel concluded, nor is there any coordinated national plan for environmental research.
Other independent studies have found that existing environmental research heavily favors the physical sciences over research on the impact of environmental change on living things, including people.
 
Focus on Specific Issues
 The shortage of Federal support reverberates in academia, where it exerts a depressing effect on ecological research, advocates of the new institute say. In fact, one early spur to the campaign for the institute was the realization that a lack of Federal dollars leads universities to place a lower priority on ecological research.
Administrators "had simply determined that they could not afford ecologists," Dr. Henry F. Howe, an ecologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago who is vice chairman of the committee for the environmental institute, wrote last year in The Environmental Professional, a journal.
As Dr. Howe, Dr. Benedick and other backers of the institute see it, the institute would address all these shortcomings. Like the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, a new institute would identify gaps in knowledge and set research priorities. It would award research grants competitively and enter into research contracts on particular subjects.
Unlike the National Science Foundation, which focuses on basic research, the environmental institute's priorities would be directed at specific policy issues like global warming and biological diversity. The overall goal would be to develop basic understanding of all the interlocking physical, biological, technological, economic, social and political causes of environmental problems.
No existing research organization is equipped to do all this, the institute's advocates say, and they argue that it would not duplicate research already being pursued by other agencies. While there is no guarantee the institute would solve the basic problem, Dr. Benedick said, "enough people have come to a conclusion that it would provide a proper focus of intellectual power on these issues."
Dr. Benedick cites the scientific effort that led to the Montreal Protocol as an example of the kind of policy research that the new institute would pursue. In that instance, an ad hoc scientific group working for the United Nations studied the causes and remedies of a weakening in the earth's protective ozone shield.
"We agreed that if these experiments were done in a certain way, we'd all have to buy off on the results," Dr. Benedick said. And so, there was an unusual consensus among policymakers about what should be done. But the ozone case was an exception, Dr. Benedick said, and the hope is that the new institute would make it the rule.
 
Need for Independence
 Other ways to achieve this goal have been proposed, including reorganizing and consolidating existing Federal agencies to sharpen the research focus. But Dr. Benedick and his colleagues believe that the leading environmental research agency must be independent. Otherwise, Dr. Benedick said, it could be swallowed up by the needs and agendas of existing agencies.
The campaign for the institute is under way at a time when Federal money is scarce, but Dr. Benedick said it would start small with a budget of $50 million to $130 million, which might grow to $500 million or $600 million, mostly for research grants, in five years.
A bill to establish the institute has gained 66 sponsors in the House. Its chief sponsors are Mr. Brown and Representative James H. Saxton, Republican of New Jersey. Mr. Saxton said he thinks the prospects for passage are "pretty good" because the institute would provide lawmakers with a better foundation on which to build policy, because the solutions to most environmental problems lie in science and because business and the economy would be protected from unnecessary regulation resulting from "overreaching."
But Mr. Saxton said that because of the heavy press of Congressional business, he was "not as optimistic about action in this session as I was six or eight months ago."

LDDS FILES REQUEST FOR LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE TO CUBA

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
LDDS Communications Inc. said yesterday that it had filed a request to provide direct long-distance telephone service to Cuba. The agreement between LDDS and EmtelCuba, the communications arm of the Cuban Government, must be approved by the Federal Communications Commission and the United States Department of the Treasury. 
 In July, the Clinton Administration decided to permit American telephone companies to expand links to Cuba. The decision was in response to a surge in calls to Cuba through Canadian companies, evading the economic embargo of Cuba and charging higher rates than American companies. A.T.& T. maintains limited service to Cuba. LDDS, based in Jackson, Miss., is the nation's fourth-largest long-distance carrier.

HEADLINE: Mitchell's Surprise Transforms Politics in Maine

BYLINE: By KATHARINE SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me., March 7

 BODY:
So many candidates, so little time.
Senator George J. Mitchell's surprise decision not to seek re-election has produced an outbreak of campaign fever here among all sorts of politicians, from erstwhile governors to legislative batboys. 
 Even before Mr. Mitchell announced his decision on Friday, more than a dozen candidates were vying to replace Gov. John R. McKernan Jr., a Republican who cannot seek a third term.
Now, with Mr. Mitchell's Senate seat open, a new field of candidates has emerged. And with both of Maine's two United States Representatives expected to seek to succeed Mr. Mitchell, a multitude of other candidates, including at least a dozen state legislators, are eyeing the sudden possibilities in the House.
 
'Creative Chaos'
 "Everyone has been burning up the phone lines," said Jim Mitchell, the Senator's nephew, who is also chairman of the state Democratic party and a possible Congressional candidate himself. "The dam has broken, there are a lot of opportunities, and everyone is rethinking their political futures."
Ben Coes, executive director of the state Republican Party, had similar observations. "Everything has crashed through; people are flying everywhere," he said. "It's creative chaos."
On Saturday, when Mr. Mitchell held a news conference in Portland's City Hall to discuss his decision not to run again in November, several local politicians worked the room. The atmosphere is especially intense because people who had not planned to run for office this year suddenly have to gather 2,000 signatures by April 1 to get on the June primary ballot.
Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican who has represented half of Maine in the House since 1978, was the first to jump into the Senate race. With time so short, Ms. Snowe announced her decision in a news release today from Washington. She barely had time to consult her husband, Governor McKernan, who is traveling in South America to promote Maine products.
 
Delegation of Freshmen
 "Usually, you want to prepare for these things," she said.
Maine's other House member, Thomas H. Andrews, a Democrat who received Mr. Mitchell's blessing last week, is all but certain to enter the race, possibly on Tuesday.
If both Ms. Snowe, 47, and Mr. Andrews, 40, win their primaries, it could set up a classic clash in the fall between Maine's more conservative north, represented by Ms. Snowe, and its more liberal south, represented by Mr. Andrews. Democrats slightly outnumber Republicans among Maine voters, but even more are independent or belong to minor parties.
Mr. Mitchell's departure raises the prospect of wide-open races this year for four of the state's five major offices -- the Senate seat, the governorship and the two seats in the House. The term of Maine's other Senator, William S. Cohen, a Republican, is not up until 1996.
For an economically precarious state like Maine, which lost 40,000 jobs when New England's high-tech boom went bust in the late 1980's, freshmen in Washington could spell disaster.
Mr. Mitchell is credited with directing substantial aid to his home state, from millions to rebuild bridges and highways and restore passenger train service between Portland and Boston, to money for studies of potato blight, a prime concern of impoverished farmers in Aroostook County.
As majority leader, Mr. Mitchell was also able to persuade Administration officials to change executive orders to protect Maine from certain recycling and fishing rules that would have hurt its important paper and fishing industries. And he prevented, for the moment, the closing of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, averting the loss of thousands of jobs.
"We're in for a period of significant adjustment," said Duane (Buzz) Fitzgerald, the chief executive of Bath Iron Works, the state's largest private employer. "The biggest thing on the minds of people in Maine right now is the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and the Brunswick Naval Air Station, since there will be another round of base closings in '95."
 Mr. Mitchell's absence from the next part of the base-closing process is forcing companies doing Pentagon-related work to look at prospective successors. "We need to talk about what we need to do politically, tactically and strategically, including finding a candidate to back," said Mr. Fitzgerald.
 
 
Worry in Washington
 The Mainers who have benefited from Mr. Mitchell's tenure are not the only people worried about his departure.
With Mr. Mitchell the fifth Democratic Senator to call it quits this year, Democrats in Washington are becoming edgy about their 56-to-44 hold on the Senate. Although three Republican incumbents are also stepping down, the Clinton Administration's preoccupation with the Whitewater investigation and Mr. Mitchell's lame-duck status could scotch Democratic efforts at meaningful legislation this year and imperil their majority.
Mr. Mitchell's seat, once considered safe, could easily slip from the Democratic column. Independent and maverick candidates have often appealed to Mainers, and more than a third of the state's voters are unaffiliated or attached to minor parties. Democrats, who claim 33 percent of voters, only slightly outnumber Republicans.
Implacably Republican since before the Civil War, the state's conservative, mainstream image was long captured in the slogan, "As Maine goes, so goes the nation." But since 1936, when only Maine and Vermont voted for Alf Landon over Franklin D. Roosevelt, the state's quirky electorate earned itself a revised slogan: "As Maine goes, so goes Vermont."
Maine has voted for the loser in more Presidential elections than any other state, and it seems particularly fond of candidates who promote themselves as outsiders. Jesse Jackson and Edmund G. Brown Jr. have done well here, and Ross Perot earned a bigger percentage of the vote here than anywhere else, beating out a Maine resident named George Bush.
Still, the 60-year-old Mr. Mitchell, along with his mentor, former Senator Edmund S. Muskie, has helped bring respectability to Democrats here, and few doubt that he would have been a shoo-in for re-election.
Some here hope that Mr. Mitchell's decision to bow out while things are going well for him will become his lasting legacy and inspire other office-holders to do the same.
"There is universal respect here for the fact that he is leaving while he is on top rather than being, say, indicted," said Rick Barton, the former state Democratic Party chairman. "That's a wonderful gift to the political system, if it will be received."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 19, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on March 8 about politics in Maine misstated the state's record in Presidential elections. Maine has voted for the loser more often than any other state only since 1936, not throughout the history of the country.

Digital Will Cut 6,000 Jobs in Europe

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN 

 BODY:
The Digital Equipment Corporation confirmed yesterday that it planned to lay off 6,000 employees, or 20 percent of its European work force, within the next 12 to 18 months.
In an internal memorandum sent out this weekend and dated yesterday, Vincenzo Damiani, the recently appointed president of Digital Europe, told the company's European managers that estimates he had made last month on projected cutbacks were accurate. Mr. Damiani, who left I.B.M. to join Digital Europe on Jan. 1, was quoted in the press in February as anticipating cutting as many as 5,000 to 6,000 workers from Digital's European work force of 29,000 employees. 
 The struggling computer giant does 64 percent of its business outside the United States. Digital's European operation accounted for nearly half of the company's $14 billion in revenues in 1993 and European employment peaked in 1991 with 41,000 employees.
In an interview with Reuters in February, Mr. Damiani said he was examining the "right size" for Digital Europe as part of a plan for reviving revenue growth and cutting costs. "My fundamental mind-set is in determining how many people we need rather than how many people we need to cut," he said.
 
Cuts From the Bottom Up
 Nikki Richardson, a spokeswoman for the parent company, said the cutbacks were part of Digital's continuing program of staff reductions and that the European cuts would come from the bottom up, as is being done in the company's United States operations.
With two large European acquisitions in the early 1990's, Digital added nearly 11,000 employees just as it began to reduce the rest of its work force. The company, based in Maynard, Mass., currently has 92,300 employees worldwide.
William M. Steul, Digital's chief financial officer, estimated in January that the company would end the fiscal year with approximately 85,000 employees. Mr. Steul said the European market, particularly in Germany, France, Britain and Italy, had been weak for two years.
Mr. Steul noted that the dollar's strength against European currencies continued to hurt Digital's revenues. But he said he expected to see a recovery in the company's European business later this year and next as the economy there turns around.
Digital surprised analysts with a net loss of $72 million in its fiscal second quarter, which ended Dec. 31, 1993. That loss, along with a 12 percent revenue decline, signaled that the company's turnaround efforts were moving more slowly than anticipated.
Digital's stock rose 50 cents yesterday, to $31.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Suffolk Legislators Drop a Ban On Plastic Packaging for Foods

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIVERHEAD, L.I., March 8

 BODY:
Six years ago, environmentalists cheered as the Suffolk County Legislature approved a bill banning a host of plastic products, from hamburger containers to polystyrene cups. Although its champions heralded it as a measure that should be adopted nationwide, the restrictions never really took effect.
Efforts to enforce the stringent law, which permitted biodegradable food containers only, were repeatedly postponed by the 18-member Legislature as delicatessens, retail food stores and fast-food chains requested more time to find substitutes that were cost-effective and environmentally acceptable.
 
Recycling Instead
 But today, the Legislature adopted an amendment eliminating the ban on plastics that would push for more recycling instead. 
 "It's just a beginning," said Legislator Thomas Finlay, a Republican, after his proposal was adopted by a vote of 11-7.
Sipping from a can of soda made of recyclable aluminum, Mr. Finlay said, "The next step is to expand the law and make recycling mandatory."
The bill now goes to County Executive Robert J. Gaffney, a Republican, who is expected to approve it.
Among those who voted against the measure was Legislator Maxine S. Postal, the Democratic minority leader.
"This isn't going to solve the problem," she said. "In reality we're worse off than we were six years ago."
Another opponent, Legislator Nora Bredes, a Democrat who supports environmental causes, said, however, that the old ban "needed to be expanded, not repealed."
The original law to ban plastics was held up by litigation by the plastics industry. The law became an embarrassment even to many environmentalists, who now accept that plastics, when compacted in a landfill, are not much worse than paper.
The plastics ban was enacted when the worst recession in decades was increasing concerns about the burdens of government, and about laws that add to the cost of everyday life.
Environmentalists shifted their focus to a state-by-state drive for laws that pressure the packaging industry to produce lighter packaging, and, like Mr. Finlay's proposal, promote recycling and create markets for recycled products.
During public comment before today's vote, Patricia Brodhagen, a spokeswoman for the New York State Food Merchants Association, which long opposed the plastics ban, urged support of the revised law.
"It strikes a balance between a compelling need to relieve business of an enormous economic burden, and the desire to accomplish waste reduction."
Thomas K. Cullen, vice president of the King Kullen Grocery Company, said that the food industry had been "singled out" by the plastics ban. He said the amended law would "provide relief for that industry and encourage local commercial recycling efforts."
Although Suffolk's plastic's ban failed, it is credited by supporters with pressuring the plastics industry to address long-neglected environmental concerns and prodding McDonald's and other fast-food chains to abandon their plastic foam packaging in favor of cardboard boxes and sacks made from recycled paper.
 
Recycling Refuse
 The new measure would encourage consumers to place plastic refuse in plastic barrels so it could be recycled into supermarket shopping bags and other recyclable products.
In an effort to break the impasses of the last six years, Mr. Finlay's measure allows large establishments like hospitals, nursing homes, cafeterias and schools to comply by setting up programs to separate polystyrene packaging and arrange to have it transported to recycling facilities. Each program would be certified by the County Health Department.
The bill also encourages towns and villages to create dropoff sites for polystyrene materials that homeowners separate from their garbage. Retail food establishments will be able to meet new Health Department rules when they put workable collection and recycling programs in place. Retailers can offer consumers a choice between biodegradable paper packaging or nonbiodegradable plastic containers.
Mr. Finlay hopes to encourage a market for the recyclable materials by providing a mandated source of supply. The bulk would come from large institutions, like hospitals, school cafeterias and corporations, which would provide a constant, dependable stream of used plastic.

HEADLINE: Mayor Details Buyout Offer for City Workers

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Negotiating with New York City's municipal unions for the first time, the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani offered yesterday to pay workers $5,000 to $10,000 each in cash and provide up to a year of health benefits to entice about 7,600 of them to leave the municipal payroll, administration officials said.
As part of its offer, the Mayor's office told the unions that it would allow workers to collect pay for unused vacation days and sick leave, in payments spread out over the next three years. That could amount to "extraordinarily large pots of money," one of the officials said. The offer also included unemployment insurance in most cases, the official said, and a job retraining program. 
 Still, with a median salary of $31,434 in most city agencies, excluding teachers and employees of independent agencies like the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the administration's offer represents at most a few months of salary for most workers.
 
Talks Described as Positive
 That raises questions about how many city workers would be willing to accept the severance offer, which could save as much as $261 million over the next 16 months if accepted by as many workers as the administration hopes. The offer is a vital part of the Mayor's plan to balance the city's $31.2 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins in July.
After the meeting, Stanley Hill, the chairman of the Municipal Labor Committee, described the initial talks as positive. But he declined to comment specifically on the administration's severance offer.
Mr. Hill, the executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, did say that the Mayor's office gave only a broad outline of its proposals and did not identify all the jobs it intends to include under the offer.
"From the point of view of our first time at the table, it was positive," Mr. Hill said. "There's still some very tough negotiations to deal with; I want to make that clear."
Raymond D. Horton of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit fiscal monitoring group, said it was difficult to predict how successful the offer would be. For example, he said, the threat of layoffs might not provide enough incentive if a worker has built up enough seniority to be reasonably well protected.
"The whole thing is a crap shoot," he said. "It's hard to tell how to react. But there might be a lot of people who are one year from retirement who might take $10,000."
The proposal emerged as the Mayor's office and the city's municipal unions met face to face yesterday afternoon at the headquarters of District Council 37, on Barclay Street, a few blocks from City Hall.
While the city's municipal unions announced last week that they would accept a severance program, the details of the packages must still be hammered out in negotiations over the next few days and could change considerably. "It's a fluid situation," said another official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 
Promised Job Cuts
 The Mayor still needs the approval of the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation to use $200 million in a surplus fund to pay for the severance packages. The Mayor hopes the packages will eliminate about half of the 15,000 jobs that he has promised to cut from the 216,000 workers paid entirely by the city.
Quentin B. Spector, the corporation's executive director, said yesterday that the administration had outlined its proposals to the corporation's board of nine directors but had left some questions unanswered.
The unions asked the Mayor's lead negotiator, the Commissioner of Labor, Randy Levine, to return with more details. A meeting was not set, but administration officials said it was important to move quickly in order to offer the severance packages before the end of March.
To succeed, the Mayor's plan also requires a major concession from the unions that would grant the city more flexibility in reassigning workers from agency to agency, making it easier to fill holes in essential services, something the unions have opposed in the past. In return, the Mayor's office would offer cash incentives to workers shifted to new agencies.
If the unions agree, the severance packages would be offered to about 70,000 employees in every agency except the uniformed services, the Board of Education and the independent agencies or authorities, like the Health and Hospitals Corporation or the Housing Authority. Employees with hard-to-replace skills would also be exempted.
The Mayor and his aides said that if the severance packages do not entice at least 7,600 workers to leave their jobs, the administration will have to resort to layoffs by the end of the fiscal year on June 30 to keep the city's budget balanced.
Managers and administrators would be eligible for the severance packages, as well as rank-and-file workers.
Under the proposal at yesterday's meeting, an employee with up to two years' experience would receive $5,000, or four weeks' pay, whichever is greater. The payment then rises based on years of experience, reaching a maximum of $10,000 for employees with at least five years on the job, said an
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Polluted Soil Frozen and Vaporized

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PATERSON, N.J.

 BODY:
For more than 100 years, until 1978, the Public Service Electric and Gas Company and its predecessors manufactured methane gas from coal and oil here on the banks of the Passaic River. Now, nearly 15 years after the plant was closed, the legacy of that production is 16,000 cubic yards of soil contaminated by a malodorous mixture of hydrocarbons, including benzene, a chemical suspected of causing cancer.
That much contaminated soil, if spread over a football field, would be more than 12 feet deep. And Public Service, under orders from the state to clean up the land, is paying a contractor $27 million for the job. 
 The contractor, Seaview Thermal Systems, hopes its experimental technique -- which involves freezing the surrounding soil to a depth of nearly 30 feet and covering the site with a giant tent as the work proceeds -- may serve as a model for cleaning up hundreds of similarly contaminated sites around the nation.
 
Local Gas Manufacture
 From the mid-19th century until shortly after World War II, many utilities manufactured gas locally for street lights and cooking. Then giant pipelines were built, and natural gas was pumped from fields in the Southwest to customers in the Northeast and Upper Midwest.
All the gas-making plants eventually closed; the one in Paterson was shut 15 years ago. But in the decades they operated, coal or oil was heated to drive off the gas, which left coke or heavy oil that could be burned for heat.
"The tar literally dripped out of the coke as it was moved out of the ovens," said John J. Tyrrell, an engineer with Seaview Thermal Systems of Blue Bell, Pa. "Most of it was stored in pits, but some of it dripped on the ground during shipment."
 
2,000 Polluted Sites
 These old gas-manufacturing sites are a major pollution problem for utilities. There are an estimated 1,800 to 2,000 such sites across the country, mostly in downtown locations. Besides the 13-acre site that Seaview is cleaning up in Paterson, Public Service has 37 others throughout New Jersey.
Most of the sites are adjacent to environmentally vulnerable waterways, since coal was largely shipped by barge. Indeed, it was an oil slick on the Passaic River five years ago that led public health officials in Paterson to conclude that the Public Service site was the culprit.
The simplest, albeit crudest, way to clean the contaminated soils is to burn them, and that has been done in less populous areas. But hazardous-waste incineration is increasingly unpopular, particularly in densely populated areas like northern New Jersey, because of fears of toxic emissions.
"Air permits are hard to obtain in New Jersey," said Joseph E. Rosina, gas plants manager for the utility.
 
Houses Preclude Incineration
 And William B. Packer Sr., principal owner of Seaview Systems, said that incineration would not be an option in Paterson because there are houses within 50 yards of the contaminated site. "Incinerators rightly suffer from 'Nimby' syndrome," Mr. Packer said, using the acronym for "not in my backyard."
So Public Service searched for a new technology and settled on an approach that promises to all but eliminate air emissions. Moreover, Seaview's approach produces materials that can be re-used, in this case clean dirt, water and a mix of hydrocarbons resembling heavy heating oil that can be sold to refineries for blending with crude oil.
Because the cleanup technique will recycle all the materials, rather than letting any hazardous waste remain, Public Service hopes to stave off future regulatory and liability costs.
 
Soil to Be Vaporized
 Seaview intends to dig up the contaminated soil and heat-treat it in a chemically inert atmosphere to vaporize -- but not burn -- the hydrocarbons and ground water it contains. The cleanup of the site, the largest parcel of clear land in the city, is just getting started and is expected to take a little over two years.
Seaview purchased rights to the technique, which Browning-Ferris Industries, the big trash hauler, developed before it decided to quit the hazardous waste business several years ago. In theory, it is simple: the contaminated soil is placed in sealed, electrically heated cylinders that are 8 inches in diameter and 20 feet long. To prevent combustion in the mixture, all the oxygen is replaced with nitrogen, then it is heated to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat vaporizes the water and hydrocarbons -- even the heavy, asphalt-like materials -- but without oxygen, they cannot catch fire.
The gases are condensed in a 15-foot tower known as a distillation column, where the water is separated from the hydrocarbons, which can be sold to petroleum refineries for rendering into gasoline and other fuels. The clean soil is to be used to refill the pits being excavated, and the water is to be reinjected into the soil.
"All your hydrocarbons boil by 1,200 degrees, so if you heat the soil to 1,800, you will drive everything off," Mr. Packer said.
 
Process Is Complex
 Although simple in theory, the process is complex in execution because of the proximity of the river and the need to keep noxious odors from reaching nearby houses.
Public Service started by driving sheets of steel into the ground along the riverbank to block water flow at the site. Then Seaview devised a method for isolating the most contaminated two areas on the site: an underground tar-storage tank beneath the spot where a gas manufacturing building once stood, and the ground under a former storage tank.
Because some of the heavy hydrocarbons are denser than water, they have seeped through 27 feet of soil down to bedrock. Since that level is below the local water table, the excavators risked flooding from the surrounding area, which could contaminate large amounts of water that would then have required costly treatment as hazardous waste.
The solution was to build a "freeze wall" around each of the sites, that is freezing the soil surrounding the work areas to contain the surrounding ground water. This was accomplished by drilling 216 shafts, spaced three to four feet apart, through the soil and an additional 10 feet into the bedrock. Then a brine solution, chilled to below 0 degrees Fahrenheit was pumped through them for six to eight weeks to establish a frozen zone four to five feet thick.
 
Plastic Lining Used
 Once this water barrier was established, excavation began in February on the old tar pit, which is closer to the river. The refrigeration will continue -- largely unaffected by the temperatures above ground -- for as long as it takes to take to remove the contaminated soil, line the area with plastic sheeting as an extra measure of security, return the cleaned soil and cap the excavation with additional layer of plastic sheeting and more clean soil.
But freezing the surrounding soil does little to control the pungent smell of the hydrocarbons as they are unearthed. To control the smell, Seaview has erected large tents over the working area, maintaining the air inside at a slight negative pressure, so any airflow is in rather than out. The air exhausted from the tents is passed through activated charcoal, which absorbs the hydrocarbon vapors. Workers inside the tent wear filtration masks.
Although this is the first full-scale commercial application of the technology, Mr. Rosina of Public Service said it appeared that the technique was more environmentally benign and economical than digging up the soil and hauling it to a remote location for incineration.
"We decided this was the only game in town," he said.

Sauro/The New York Times)
 
Diagram: "Cleaning Soil With Heat, Not Fire"
 In the past, cleaning up soil contaminated with tar, oil, creosote and other hydrocarbons meant burning, which often entailed hard-to-obtain burning permits and hard-to-molify opposition fron neighbors, who did not want soil pollution turned into air pollution. Seaview Thermal Systems says its new method sidesteps both obstacles by using heat to extract they hydrocarbon pollutants for recycling instead of burning them off.
 
1. Contaminated soil is dug up and placed in a closed heating chamber. To prevent combustion, the chamber's atmosphere is a non-flammable gas like nitrogen instead of air.
 
2. Soil is heated above 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit by an electric heater. At that temperature, even the most viscuous hydro-carbon contaminants, like asphalt, will evaporate out of the soil, leaving it as clean as ordinary soil.
 
3. The vapor that was driven off the soil in the heating chamber is condensed. Hydrocarbons are separated from the water and nitrogen gas that came out of the heating chamber with them.
 
4. Water, nitrogen gas and liquid hydrocarbons are each filtered and purified for reuse. The liquid hydrocarbons accumulate in an oily mixture that can be used as raw material for a crude oil refinery to make various petroleum products.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
A former TV star is reborn as an all-too-human spokeswoman for a Weight Watchers' campaign.

BYLINE: By Michael Janofsky 

 BODY:
NO matter what celebrity Kathleen Sullivan might once have enjoyed as a Famous Person for ABC Sports and CBS News, she has demonstrated a remarkable willingness to play the role of Everywoman in leading America into the perilous world of dieting.
Perilous, because diets don't always work. They're hard. They can be lonely. Some diet companies are not always straight with consumers. And who wouldn't rather eat chocolate ice cream and potato chips? 
 Further, specific diets are a difficult sell no matter how desperate people may be to slim down, and that's essentially why Ms. Sullivan was so attractive to Weight Watchers International Inc. as a spokeswoman for a new program called Superstart!
First, she fitted the demographic profile as "our prototypical member," Jeff Myers, a marketing vice president at Weight Watchers, said. "She's 40 years old, pleasing in her physical appearance, but in her own words, someone who has let herself go a little bit and the weight has crept up."
Yet resonating in that description were four years of emotional baggage, as Ms. Sullivan has revisited in scores of interviews since the print and television campaign began in January. The painful points: loss of her job as a host of "CBS This Morning" in 1990, the subsequent death of her father and a divorce.
If all that drove her into hiding from public view, it also seemed to humanize her by the time she re-emerged as a corporate pitchwoman in a campaign in which she provides periodic updates on her weight loss. Not even she realized it right away, long accustomed to the arbitrary distance generally kept between the well known and the anonymous. But through the early weeks of the campaign, a trip to the grocery store or a walk down the street invariably resulted in casual encounters with people emboldened as never before to make contact.
"Like a woman who followed me off a plane just to thank me," Ms. Sullivan recalled in an interview last week. "She had lost four pounds and said she couldn't have done it if she had not seen the ad campaign."
If the campaign has been a fairly stunning experience for Ms. Sullivan, it has dazzled the management of Weight Watchers, a subsidiary of the H. J. Heinz Company. By all available measures, business has increased significantly for 1994, improving the company's estimated 50 percent share of the weight-control market, and the only apparent variable has been Ms. Sullivan.
Mr. Myers said that despite cold weather and heavy snows in the East, an earthquake in California and the plodding pace of economic recovery, Weight Watchers had seen regional membership gains of 5 percent to more than 20 percent. And those increases came during a time, industry officials say, when fewer Americans are participating in organized diet programs.
"A spectacular success in a bad year," Anthony J. F. O'Reilly, the chairman, president and chief executive of Heinz, said of the campaign results.
But why? For years, weight-loss companies have used endorsers as a hook, Weight Watchers among them, with the actress Lynn Redgrave. Brooke Shields recently signed with Slim-Fast. Jenny Craig has become a persona in her own right, starring in her own commercials.
Yet Ms. Sullivan provides more than celebrity endorsement. Her return to prominence as a soldier in the battle of the bulge has turned a mirror on most Americans. Like them, she succeeds, fails and tries again. That her star once shined so brightly only made her thud that much louder. Yet, here she is again, standing, dusted off, the amazing shrinking woman.
Dennis Branoff, the owner of 90 Weight Watchers operations in Michigan and Indiana, said he heard it from staff members almost daily. He recalled one woman's reaction to seeing Ms. Sullivan in a commercial: "I remembered her story, her fall from grace. I empathize with that."
Even in ascent, it has not been easy for the former newscaster. She crossed that line from journalist to paid informer, and has been criticized. It happens a lot with journalists who do that, but they're not always worse for the wear. Linda Ellerbee told wonderful stories as a television reporter, then sold Maxwell House coffee and made enough money to open an independent production company, and now tells wonderful stories again as a television reporter, this time to children and teen-agers. Mary Alice Williams, a former newscaster for CNN and reporter for NBC News, now speaks the virtues of Nynex.
Ms. Sullivan has endured her share of verbal darts and arrows since the campaign began. Doesn't bother her, she said. Besides, she's a smaller target now.

HEADLINE: Lines Drawn in a War Over a Milk Hormone

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis., March 4

 BODY:
A month after a genetically engineered dairy hormone went on sale to farmers, leaflets, labels and advertisements have proliferated in food markets here in a war of words over the hormone's usefulness and safety. On one side are the drug's maker and dairy industry giants; on the other, a coalition of dairy processors and consumer groups.
At stake is consumer acceptance of dairy products made with milk produced by cows treated with the drug. 
 It is enough to make people like Kathy Steele, a 37-year-old dietitian and mother of three, nervous about a food that until now has enjoyed a reputation for wholesomeness.
"I'm very much concerned about this hormone, to the point that I buy only the brand of milk that I know doesn't have it," Ms. Steele said in an interview at Copps supermarket here as she corralled her children, Michaela, Annie and James, and carried a friend's baby, Brian Maki, in a child backpack. "I know the Government says things are safe that turn out not to be safe. You can't always trust what they say."
 
'It's Caused a Commotion'
 Steve Schofield, the dairy manager at Copps, said he had heard scores of customers express the same concerns. "It's caused a commotion," Mr. Schofield said. "People don't want the hormone, and they want to know if they're getting it in their food. We're getting 25 calls a day, 6 or 10 letters a day, and if you stand down by the dairy cases, people come up all the time and ask you about it."
Mr. Schofield says milk and dairy sales have not fallen in his store, one of Madison's largest supermarkets. But he added that cheese products with labels that say they are free of the hormone are selling briskly.
The drug, manufactured by the St. Louis-based Monsanto Company, is variously known as B.S.T., for bovine somatotropin, or rB.G.H., for recombinant bovine growth hormone. It increases milk production in cows by stimulating the animals' milk-producing metabolic systems.
The Food and Drug Administration, which approved the drug in November, says that it is safe and that milk produced by hormone-treated cows cannot be distinguished from milk from untreated cows.
In 1986, Wisconsin farmers protested the hormone's development because they feared it would lead to surpluses and declining farm incomes. Since then, no new farm technology has generated as much economic evaluation, scientific analysis or political attention as B.S.T., especially in this state, which has more dairy farms than any other.
Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, was an early and vocal opponent of the hormone and rode the issue all the way to Capitol Hill. When farmers criticized the University of Wisconsin in the late 1980's for proposing to study B.S.T., Donna E. Shalala, then the university's chancellor and now the Secretary of Health and Human Services, became a prominent defender of the hormone.
 
Drug's Sale Is Strong
 Now that the hormone is being sold, many dairy farmers are buying it. Monsanto said sales had been especially strong in New York, where the company and veterinarians estimate that 10 percent of dairy farmers are using B.S.T. In Wisconsin, where milk production is the foundation of a $10 billion dairy industry, 4 percent to 6 percent of the state's 29,000 dairy farmers are treating their cows, farmers and Monsanto agreed.
Despite the Government's insistence that milk from treated cows is safe, dairy industry surveys indicate that shoppers are nervous about the hormone's use and that many would like labels on foods from herds treated with the hormone.
It is just such concerns that worry Monsanto, which spent at least $300 million on the drug's development and has staked much of the company's future on other genetically engineered products to be used in agriculture.
The company has responded by developing a political and legal strategy to resist calls for product labels. With the help of the top executives of the $64 billion national dairy industry, the company persuaded the drug agency to establish guidelines on Feb. 8 for labeling only milk from untreated cows.
The Government did not require labels on milk from treated cows, saying the hormone naturally occurs in all milk. Any label saying or suggesting that some milk or dairy products were "hormone-free" would thus be false, misleading and illegal.
Monsanto has gone even further by hiring two Washington law firms to police the food industry for advertising and labeling that the company says it believes violate the guidelines or the drug agency's marketing laws. So far, the company has sent letters to six small food companies warning that their advertising or labels were "false and misleading," said Lisa Watson, the manager of health and consumer affairs for Monsanto.
On Feb. 18, Monsanto sued two milk processors, Swiss Valley Farms, a dairy cooperative in Davenport, Iowa, and the Pure Milk and Ice Cream Company in Waco, Tex., who informed customers that their cows were not treated with the hormone.
 
Right to Inform Consumer
 "We contend that these companies falsely implied to consumers that their products are more wholesome and in other ways superior to products that come from milk from B.S.T.-treated cows," Ms. Watson said.
In interviews, executives at the two processors said they had done nothing wrong and would fight the lawsuits. "The main issue, and perhaps the only significant issue, is the right of a food seller to inform the consumer what may or may not be in the food product," said John Palmer, a claims manager for the MSI Insurance Company in St. Paul, which is handling the lawsuit for Swiss Valley Farms.
Several food industry executives said Monsanto was trying to intimidate retailers and prevent consumers from getting the information that many want. "They are afraid that if labeling becomes widespread, it will kill the hormone, which it would," said Bob Wills, the owner of Cedar Grove Cheese, a small manufacturer in Plain, Wis., that was the first company in this state to label its products.
The red labels, approved by the State Department of Agriculture, say Cedar Grove cheeses are "producer certified rB.G.H. free." Since affixing the labels to his cheese, Mr. Wills said sales had increased at least 20 percent.
"It's amazing the lengths people will go to find our product," Mr. Wills said in an interview in his home by the cheese plant, which, he says, now operates 21 hours a day to fill orders.
Perhaps the most visible evidence of changes in milk buying habits prompted by the hormone's use is in natural food stores in Madison, as well as in New York, Atlanta, San Francisco and other cities. Store owners said sales of milk and cheese from untreated cows were soaring.
"This hormone is an issue with us," said Lori Tooker, who was shopping here with her family at the Magic Mill natural food market, where the dairy manager said sales had climbed 30 percent in a month. "We really don't know if it's safe. We feel it's been pushed on the dairy industry."

HEADLINE: Trying to Rescue a Soured Oil Bet

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
From an office on Madison Avenue, a former oil trader turned Italian sculpture expert is quietly unraveling what some have said is one of the biggest bad bets in the commodities business.
Since mid-December, Nancy Kropp Galdy has been working 12 to 18 hours a day, sometimes seven days a week, trying to make the most of a mountain of oil futures contracts that have already produced $1.35 billion in losses. 
 By her account, she runs on adrenaline much of the time. She doesn't know when her job as a hired gun will end or even what she'll be paid when it does. All in all, it's an improbable scene.
But then, she's no everyday oil trader and the task is extraordinary: she is playing a critical behind-the-scenes role in the increasingly contentious rescue of one of Germany's largest industrial companies, Metallgesellschaft A.G.
 
A $1.9 Billion Bailout
 The mining and engineering conglomerate stunned world financial markets in December by disclosing that huge oil futures losses on the New York Mercantile Exchange had pushed it to near bankruptcy. Only a hastily arranged $1.9 billion bailout by creditor banks in January averted disaster.
Executive heads have rolled in the United States and Germany, and public charges, countercharges and lawsuits are now flying. But almost overlooked in the fracas is the fact that Metallgesellschaft came away holding contracts representing a staggering 160 million barrels of oil, and something had to be done with them.
Ms. Kropp Galdy has been trying to unwind that enormous position with as much gain and as little pain as possible. So far, she and a team of experts have cleared away about half the contracts. Since the remaining positions are spread across the gamut of energy products, from oil to gasoline, outside experts said there was no way to determine the remaining value of the company's position. Not surprisingly, it is a topic that the company and Ms. Kropp Galdy will not discuss. But there is a lot of money -- and a lot of risk -- still to be dealt with.
It's not a glamorous job, and Ms. Kropp Galdy purposely keeps a low profile. That's partly strategic. In the oil trading game, it pays not to tip your hand, especially if competitors know you're under pressure.
 
'Caught Up in It'
 "You know you are doing this for a limited period of time, and you get caught up in it," she said in an interview. "But this is not a job that one person can do alone. You pull on all the expertise you can draw on."
Asked why she undertook such an assignment, Ms. Kropp Galdy speaks of challenge and loyalty, not money or glory. "You feel an intense responsibility to do your best," she said. "We have not yet talked about remuneration, but we will, and they will be fair. Those things are not important. When you do something like this you do it by need."
It's certainly not a job she sought. Once an oil trading virtuoso who helped to put Morgan Stanley & Company in the business, first in New York and later in London, Ms. Kropp Galdy, who says her age is 40-something, chucked the high-stakes commodity game four years ago for a life of art and culture in Florence, Italy.
There, she learned the language and immersed herself in 15th-century sculpture, while her husband, Thomas Galdy, a former oil broker, established himself as a private dealer in Old Master drawings. After 11 years trading oil, she was burned out. "It takes a while to come down, but I had no regrets," she said.
When Metallgesellschaft's problems broke into the open last year, however, Ms. Kropp Galdy's days at home inevitably became numbered, burnout or not.
For one thing, she's well regarded by her peers. "In our business, you get to know who the leading names are fairly quickly," said Richard D. Black, a partner at the London law firm of Middleton Potts, shipping and commodity trading specialists. "Morgan Stanley was a big player in the market and Nancy was the head trader and good at her job."
Plus, the New York Mercantile Exchange, where energy futures contracts are traded, is not known as a benevolent place, and Metallgesellschaft's problems -- if not actual trading positions -- were no secret. Not everyone could cope with those conditions.
"The job she has is that of a Mississippi gambler who has the mind of a computer and nerves of steel," said Peter Beutel, an oil trader and president of Cameron Hanover Inc., a Bronxville, N.Y., research, brokerage and money management firm.
 
Second Time Around
 But Ms. Kropp Galdy says she felt an even stronger pull. She had worked through a similar crisis in 1988 for Germany's largest commercial bank, Deutsche Bank A. G., a big Metallgesellschaft shareholder and a leader of its rescue party.
That job delayed the start of Ms. Kropp Galdy's new life for about eight months, while she worked to extricate Klockner & Company, a trading company Deutsche Bank had taken over, from hundreds of millions of dollars of potential losses. It also left her with strong memories and loyalties.
In that instance, she and her husband were at Gatwick Airport near London, right after she left Morgan Stanley, when during a phone call a friend frantically insisted that the Deutsche Bank chairman, Albert Herrhausen, known in the German press as the "Almighty Supreme Being," was looking for her.
"I sort of stopped and said this is totally absurd. Yeah, Mr. Rockefeller wants Nancy to call him," Ms. Kropp Galdy said. But after getting past Mr. Herrhausen's secretary on the second try, she realized it was true.
According to Ms. Kropp Galdy, Mr. Herrhausen said: "A lot of people in Germany tell me you are the one to help us. Will you come? I said sure. Thomas was standing there saying, 'Sure, what?' I told him we were going to Germany."
This time, Ms. Kropp Galdy was only slightly more prepared. In early December, as news of Metallgesellschaft's problems hit front pages across Europe, the Galdys were interested readers at home in Florence.
"We sort of made a lot of stunned comments," Ms. Kropp Galdy recalled, "and Thomas made a joke, saying, 'Well, since Deutsche Bank is involved, you'll probably get a phone call tomorrow.' I said no way, it won't happen. That was too long ago."
 
Call From Germany
 But it happened. Less than 24 hours later, Renaldo Schmitz, a Deutsche Bank director and chairman of the Metallgesellschaft supervisory board, was on the phone. (Mr. Herrhausen was no longer at the helm; he was killed by a bomb planted by German terrorists in his Mercedes limousine in 1989.)
"He introduced himself and we spoke about Herrhausen," she said, a conversation that "definitely affected" her. "I said I felt very committed to helping Deutsche Bank," she said. "It was an important conversation."
After that, deciding what to do didn't take long. "I called him back in half an hour," Ms. Kropp Galdy said. "But before I called him I had started to pack."
Ms. Kropp Galdy, as a consultant to the MG Corporation, Metallgesellschaft's American subsidiary, would not discuss specific strategy. She said her team's objective in managing the trading book was the same as it was in the Klockner case: "get as much money back as possible."
For Metallgesellschaft, that book started growing in earnest last spring, when its American subsidiary offered refined products like gasoline and heating oil to customers under fixed price contracts that extended as long as 10 years.
The company seemed to hedge those long-term commitments against a rise in crude oil prices by buying short-term energy futures and over-the-counter derivatives contracts. In theory, if MG had to pay more for the oil it would supply to its customers, it could offset the cost with profits made as the value of its futures contracts also rose.
But some traders figured MG was speculating heavily on a rise in short-term prices.
 
Prices Moved Down
 Oil prices did not rise. Instead, crude oil prices reached their lowest level in five years in the first week of December, while gasoline hit a seven-year low. Indeed, MG's positions were so enormous that they pushed down prices, partly because market participants were willing sellers of spot contracts to MG.
Philip K. Verleger, a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, estimated recently that without MG's presence in the market, the spot contract gasoline price would have been 2 to 5 cents a gallon higher in the fourth quarter.
Faced with huge declines in the value of its hedging contracts, MG became subject to margin calls from the futures exchange. Holders of futures contracts are expected to cover their losses on a daily basis if they want to hold on to their positions.
The positions were so big that MG was incapable of meeting its margin calls. That failure precipitated the crisis and led to the eventual bailout by its creditors.
MG has denied speculating on oil prices, but will not comment on how its hedging strategy led to its giant losses.
In January, bitter winter weather drove spot prices up for gasoline, heating oil and crude, making Ms. Kropp Galdy's job a bit easier. "I hate cold weather, but we will take whatever help we can get," she said. Prices have softened since.
Some market watchers suggest that if MG has somehow been able to maintain its positions, the January price rise may have cut the company's losses, and may have even turned them into a profit. But the amount needed to accomplish that -- numbers like $1 billion are bandied about -- apparently was just too big.
"Retrospectively, it appears to me that MG may have overreacted, and turned paper losses into actual losses," said Mr. Beutel, the Bronxville researcher. "If they had left everything alone, they would have made some money."
W. Arthur Benson, the senior vice president who developed MG's trading strategy, certainly thinks so. On Feb. 28, scarcely three weeks after he was dismissed by MG, Mr. Benson sued MG and Deutsche Bank in Federal District Court in Maryland, contending that the company could have avoided more than $1 billion in losses if his strategy had not been abandoned. He is seeking $1 billion in damages.
In the lawsuit, he asserts that Ms. Kropp Galdy's strategy of liquidating the company's positions "resulted in price speculation which created losses of some $1 billion."
Experts familiar with MG's situation say they do not put much stock in those claims. "If they hadn't gotten out of the market, the market wouldn't have rallied," Mr. Verleger said. "From everything I hear, Nancy Kropp has done an amazingly good job of holding things together."
MG and Ms. Kropp Galdy declined to discuss the suit, or how it or any other litigation might affect the way the MG group she is part of trades.
And she chose not to speculate on how she might respond if the telephone rings again in the future, and another Deutsche Bank official is on the line. "It depends," she said. "When you put this much out, you have to care."

HEADLINE: Clinton to Unveil Jobs Bill That Focuses on Retraining

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
President Clinton on Wednesday will announce a jobs bill that would mark a shift in Government emphasis from providing temporary relief for laid-off employees to trying to meet the needs of workers whose jobs will not reappear, even in an improving economy.
The proposal would focus on retraining and job placement for the unemployed by establishing one-stop career centers, financed by Federal and state funds. 
 White House and Labor Department officials say the centers would provide an array of counseling services, like information on resume writing and assistance in obtaining unemployment benefits.
 
Billed as Major Initiative
 The proposed legislation, which Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich has been promoting in speeches and private meetings around the nation, has been billed as one of the Administration's major initiatives.
It would cost about $13 billion over five years, but Labor Department officials said almost all the money for the retraining and job placement programs would come from merging programs for displaced workers and from shifting money within the department's budget.
Under the proposal, which the Administration calls the Re-employment Act, programs for workers displaced by specific changes in the economy -- by downsizing in the military industry, for example, or by the effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement -- would be combined into a single, broader program for laid-off workers.
The goal is to streamline a system so complicated that workers who were employed at the same factory sometimes now have entirely different benefits even if they lost similar jobs at the same time.
 
2 Years of Training Aid
 Under the Administration's plan, workers could get financial aid for as long as two years if they are enrolled in certain retraining programs, like nursing school, that require long periods of study yet offer graduates a reasonable chance of stable employment.
Other elements of the proposal include a computerized national jobs bank to help the unemployed identify what work is available, and where, and personal assistance in the details of job searches, like how to how to dress for an interview. Relief services for the unemployed would continue.
The President will announce the new plan just five days before a conference he has called on worldwide unemployment. The conference, which convenes on Monday in Detroit, will bring together labor specialists from around the world for two days of meetings in which participants will study labor markets, changing technologies and world unemployment problems.
In recent speeches, Mr. Reich has argued that policy makers' basic concept of unemployment protections should shift. "We need to turn the unemployment system into a re-employment system," he said last week in an address to students at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies.
 
'Years of Work'
 Mr. Reich and other Labor Department officials describe the new legislation as an effort to deal with an employment pattern in which people who have lost their jobs are not finding new ones. The effort would treat jobless workers as clients, not just as financial dependents, and would link benefits more closely to education and training.
Putting these concepts into practice will be difficult, labor specialists say. "No one has really stood back and asked what it would take to consolidate and reduce the system," said Andrew B. Hahn, a professor of public policy at Brandeis University. "On the ground, it is going to take years of work to implement."
But Mr. Hahn said he basically supported the Administration's proposal "because it has become kind of a mantra in the social policy field that our policies are too fragmented."
Public support for the measure may be easier to garner now than in years past, he added, because increasing numbers of middle-class workers have lost jobs through corporate layoffs and industry readjustments.
"They have had to use the system," Mr. Hahn said, "and they have been reacting with horror to the colossal nightmare of programs we have now."

HEADLINE: Postal Service Seeks 3-Cent Rise For First-Class Stamp in Early '95

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
The United States Postal Board of Governors today approved a proposal to increase the price of a first-class stamp by 10.3 percent, to 32 cents from 29 early in 1995.
The plan, announced by Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon and the postal board's chairman, J. Sam Winters, is part of an increase in all postal rates. 
 Second-class rates would jump 10.2 percent. Third-class rates -- used most often for bulk or "junk" mail -- would jump 10.3. Parcel post rates would increase 13.2 percent. The cost of sending a postcard would go up 2 cents, to 21 cents from 19, and express mail would cost an additional dollar, or $10.95. For first-class mail, the charge for each additional ounce after the first ounce would increase to 25 cents from 23.
The proposal now goes before the independent Postal Rate Commission, which is expected to hold hearings and make a decision within 10 months.
Mr. Winters said the new rates would "provide a small but sufficient increase" in revenue to operate in the black. The Postal Service is expected to have a $1.3 billion deficit this year.
Mr. Runyon added that the proposal, the smallest his organization had requested in 25 years, was two points below the rate of inflation over the last four years. The last increase -- to 29 cents from 25 -- was proposed about four years ago and took effect in February 1991.
For the average American, the increase would mean an additional $8 to $9 a year for stamps.
 
Break for Bulk Mail
 The last time the post office raised rates, it drew the most anger from third-class mailers, whose material amounts to 38.4 percent of the total amount of mail and who saw a 26 percent increase then.
This time around, the bulk mailers seem pleased.
"Ten percent versus 26 percent" is an obvious improvement, said Robert Kamerschen, the chief executive of Advo Inc., the nation's largest third-class mailer.
Arthur B. Sackler, the managing director of a coalition of big corporations, called the approach fair and balanced.
The post office usually follows a waltz-like rhythm: the first year after prices go up, it makes money. The second, it breaks even. The third year, it loses.
This time, the Postal Service waited four years before requesting a rate increase. Many credit Mr. Runyon, who cut 33,000 jobs since starting his job in 1992, for making the post office more efficient.
"He's broken the three-year cycle," said Moe Biller, the president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents 360,000 postal workers. "He's a far more efficient, competent man than his predecessor and an incredibly gutsy guy."
Every penny that the post office adds to the cost of a stamp results in $920 million in revenue.
Sitting in a warehouse in Kansas City, Mo., almost 19 billion first-class "G" stamps, or nondenominated stamps, which will assume the value of the new stamp, are ready for distribution.
The Postal Service has also printed two billion "make up" stamps, which will supplement all the leftover 29-cent stamps that consumers have stored away in their desks.

HEADLINE: House Panel Begins Deliberations on a Health Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
Congress today entered a new phase in its effort to revamp the nation's health care system as a House subcommittee began deliberations on a bill substantially different from President Clinton's proposal.
The Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health began analyzing the bill, proposed by its chairman, Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, with lawmakers of both parties saying they felt they were participating in a historic process. 
 "Few issues grip the American people as deeply as the health care crisis," said Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia. "Health care is a basic right of all individuals. It's not a privilege."
Lobbyists for doctors, dentists, psychologists, small businesses and other interests swarmed over Capitol Hill today as the subcommittee took up health care legislation after 36 days of public hearings. Just after the panel convened, President Clinton spoke to trade association executives defending his proposal and expressing optimism about its future.
 
A Test of Strength
 Mr. Clinton said he was not distressed by recent obituaries for his health plan. "I have seen a lot of endeavors in which I was involved over the last 15 years given up for dead," he said.
The ranking Republican on the subcommittee, Representative Bill Thomas of California, said he would push for an up-or-down vote on the President's proposal, just to show that it lacked support. "The American people deserve a test of strength for the President's plan," he said.
But Mr. Stark said he expected no votes till next week. At the moment, he does not have a majority for his proposal in the 11-member subcommittee, but he said he might be able to forge such a majority with help from other Democrats.
Mr. Stark's bill would expand Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, to cover people who are unemployed, people who have no connection to the labor force and low-income people now in the Medicaid program, as well as part-time, temporary and seasonal workers.
 
Leaner Benefits Package
 Mr. Stark's plan, like the President's, would require employers to pay at least 80 percent of the cost of health insurance for their workers. In addition, he suggested a new Federal payroll tax, equal to eight-tenths of 1 percent of wages and salaries. But he made clear that he was open to other ways of financing his plan.
Mr. Stark said his proposal would achieve the President's goal of guaranteeing health insurance for all Americans while controlling medical costs. But he proposes a leaner package of benefits, with less coverage for mental health services and long-term care.
Mr. Stark would not require consumers or employers to obtain coverage through purchasing groups like the alliances proposed by Mr. Clinton. Under Mr. Stark's proposal, the Government could directly regulate doctors' fees and hospital charges but would not regulate health insurance premiums, as Mr. Clinton wants to do.
The prospects for Mr. Stark's proposal in the full Ways and Means Committee, on the House floor and in the Senate are unknown. But White House officials said they were pleased to see one Congressional panel moving ahead with health legislation.
Under Mr. Stark's proposal, employers with more than 100 employees would have to contribute to the cost of health insurance for their workers beginning Jan. 1, 1995. For employers with 100 or fewer employees, a similar requirement would take effect Jan. 1, 1997. These smaller businesses could enroll their workers in the new Federal program, known as Part C of Medicare, or they could buy private insurance.

HEADLINE: California Listing Its Debt

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
In a move that could shake up a traditionally staid market, California began listing about $3.3 billion in municipal debt for trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
California, the first state to list tax-exempt bonds on the exchange in years, hopes to create more demand for its debt and thus pay lower interest rates on new state bonds. 
 The listing puts the California bonds on the exchange's computerized trading system, which lets brokers and dealers review the latest offers and enter bids on the bonds.
The move has the potential to change the behavior in a market dominated by conservative investors who usually hold bonds until the principal matures -- up to several decades later. The improved access to information may entice more investors to buy and sell bonds prior to maturity.
The listing comes at an opportune time for the tax-free market, which faces mounting pressure from Federal regulators to disclose more information about bonds.

HEADLINE: Bonn Journal;
Now Breathing Down Kohl's Neck Is Big Socialist

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BONN

 BODY:
If Germans could choose Chancellors the way Americans pick Presidents -- voting for them by name on the ballot -- a 46-year-old state Governor would beat Helmut Kohl by a landslide, all the public opinion polls indicate.
Rudolf Scharping, a Social Democrat, is giving Mr. Kohl the most serious political challenge he has faced since he became Chancellor in 1982. 
 Soaring budget deficits, unemployment of more than four million and the $100-billion-a-year cost of German unity have made the Chancellor an unpopular man.
But Germans vote for parties, rather than picking their leader directly, and they will not vote until Oct. 16.
In the meantime, Mr. Scharping is trying to sell himself to voters as a new face who is not a shot in the dark. If Germans elect the Social Democrats, his message goes, they will be getting a responsible, middle-of-the-road party that will put their country on a safe and solid footing after Mr. Kohl's center-right Christian Democratic alliance led it into a morass.
 
The Beard Will Stay
 Mr. Scharping, a jogging and bicycle enthusiast, stands out in a crowd. He is a big man, though not as large as the man he wants to replace -- bronzed, with a deep baritone voice and a shock of brown hair and horn-rimmed glasses, which give him a serious look. He also has a beard, although no German Chancellor since World War II has worn one. But he insists that if he takes over, it stays.
"I don't want to join the Government, I want to lead it," he said here the other day, alluding to frequent speculation that German political parties are all so unpopular that they may have to form a grand coalition that unites the present Government and its opposition.
If Mr. Scharping is to lead, the Social Democrats will have to win more votes than the Christian Democratic alliance, which won 43.8 percent in the 1990 election. Recent polls showed Mr. Scharping's party with the support of 38 percent to 41 percent, compared to 32 to 35 percent for Mr. Kohl's party.
Mr. Scharping became the youngest leader in the history of his party last summer after a scandal forced the resignation of his predecessor. Since he took over, his message has been that the pacifist, antinuclear, anti-American policies that relegated the Socialists to the opposition for so long are over.
Like Mr. Kohl before him, he is the Premier of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, and has been a politician all his life, though he became Premier only in 1991. He studied political science at the University of Bonn and has held party office since 1974, when he became a national vice chairman of its youth wing.
About the most dramatic moment of his career occurred in 1968 when the party expelled him for a year for taking part in an antimilitary protest against a fund-raising concert for the German military band. He lives with his wife and three daughters in Mainz, the Rhineland-Palatinate state capital, and not in Bonn.
But if Mr. Kohl could make the leap, he believes, so can he. He has the enthusiastic support of Helmut Schmidt, who was his party's last Chancellor, before it veered left in the early 1980's and disavowed Mr. Schmidt's decision to accept American intermediate-range nuclear missiles on German soil.
The missiles are gone now, and so is the Soviet Union, but Mr. Scharping says he is proud that his state is home to 150,000 Americans in uniform.
He went to Munich early in February to persuade NATO defense experts and ministers that if he is elected Germany will be just as loyal an ally as it is now. "NATO was and remains an essential complement to the integration process within the European Union," he told them. "On this question there is no disagreement among Social Democrats today. This has not always been the case."
Mr. Scharping's party supports participation by German troops in United Nations peacekeeping operations, provided there is a guarantee that they will not be involved in combat. "A Social Democratic Chancellor will not make the German Army available for an operation like the war in the Persian Gulf," he said in Bonn the other day, but then neither did Mr. Kohl in 1991.
 
Differences Are Slight
 On domestic and economic issues, the differences between Mr. Scharping and Mr. Kohl are even less striking. This Social Democrat does not even object to privatization of public services. "Whoever can do the best job of making them dependable, affordable, and universally available should do it," he said the other day.
Like Mr. Kohl, he has told the labor unions, his biggest single constituency, that German economic competitiveness requires lower labor costs, and that shorter working hours can save jobs, but only at lower wages.
As for the welfare state, he says: "The state soaks up 50 percent of gross national product as it is. We don't want to make it even higher."
But until the problems of rebuilding formerly Communist eastern Germany have been solved, he said, the Social Democrats are for a 10 percent surcharge on the individual income tax starting next year, instead of the 7.5 percent surcharge the Christian Democrats say they will impose.
Mr. Kohl has been doing his best to dispel the notion that there is not much difference between the parties, digging up old allegations that the Social Democrats -- and Mr. Scharping personally -- were ready in the late 1980's to concede to East German demands that Bonn stop granting automatic citizenship to people who fled the Communist Government.
If the Social Democrats had been in power, the Chancellor tells the 16.5 million people in the east, unification might never had happened in 1990. Mr. Scharping dismissed the argument as "mudslinging," and promised that if elected he would ould do a better job of repelling right-wing neo-Nazis than the Christian Democrats.

HEADLINE: $1 Million Religion Prize for Capitalism Defender

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS 

 BODY:
Michael Novak, a scholar known for formulating a theological defense of capitalism, has won a prize of nearly $1 million established by one of capitalism's most successful practitioners.
Mr. Novak, whose religious arguments linking democracy and capitalism influenced opinion in Eastern Europe and are echoed in Pope John Paul II's writings, was named the winner yesterday of the 1994 Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion. 
 The prize, created 22 years ago by Sir John M. Templeton, an American-born British subject who is widely considered the dean of global investing, honors a person judged to have advanced the world's understanding of religion. Valued at 650,000 -- $968,500 at yesterday's exchange rate -- the prize will be awarded by Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace on May 4.
Sir John, who is active in the Presbyterian church, stipulated that the prize money should always surpass that of the Nobel Prizes, which he felt had overlooked religion. He sold his money management firm, Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger, for $913 million in 1992 and now, at the age of 81, lives in the Bahamas.
Previous winners include Mother Teresa and the Rev. Billy Graham. Last year's winner was Charles W. Colson, the former special counsel to President Richard M. Nixon who established a prison ministry after serving seven months for his role in the Watergate cover-up.
Mr. Novak, a 60-year-old Roman Catholic who once studied for the priesthood, was a proponent of many of the changes in Catholic teachings and practices introduced by the Second Vatican Council, which he covered on special assignment for Time magazine in 1963. He was an outspoken opponent of the war in Vietnam while teaching religious studies at Stanford University in the mid-1960's.
In the 1970's, when he also taught at the State University of New York at Old Westbury, L.I., and at Syracuse University, Mr. Novak moved into the ranks of neoconservative thinkers and politicians. In 1978, he became a resident scholar in religion and public policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington.
Encountering opposition to capitalism in politically active religious circles, Mr. Novak in 1982 wrote "The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism" (Simon & Schuster) arguing that capitalism and democracy were mutually supportive embodiments of Christian principles. He also wrote several books criticizing the socialist elements in Latin American liberation theology.
Drawing bitter criticism from many of his former liberal allies in the church, Mr. Novak also organized opposition to the American Catholic bishops' pastoral letters on nuclear weapons and on the economy in the mid-1980's. At a news conference yesterday in Manhattan, he said he had largely agreed with the bishops' final versions of those documents.
In her memoirs, Margaret Thatcher, the former British Prime Minister, said Nr. Novak's writings had influenced her views on "quality of life" issues. Lady Thatcher served on the nine-member panel of judges who awarded the prize. The panel also included James Billington, the Librarian of Congress, and George Gallup Jr., the pollster.
 
The Needle's Eye
 Mr. Novak said he would use much of the prize money to finance scholarships at colleges where he studied and to support Crisis, the conservative Catholic monthly that he edits.
Asked about the New Testament's warnings against riches, Mr. Novak replied, "The more you have, the stricter your judgment will be, and the more you are responsible for."
Sir John, who attended the news conference, added, "I just hope we haven't kept Michael out of the kingdom of heaven."

Nagging Inflation Fears Push Bond Prices Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of United States Treasury securities reversed early gains yesterday amid the nagging fears of inflation and concern about the timing of the Federal Reserve's next move to raise short-term interest rates. The selloff in bonds pushed interest rates to the highest level since June.
Follow-through strength from overseas bond markets and comments by a Federal Reserve governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, in a Baltimore speech to the Commercial Finance Association Monday night provided the market with an early lift. But the selling began to pick up steam by midsession after Mr. Lindsey's comments were put in context. 
 The 30-year Treasury declined by 26/32 of a percentage point, to 9210/32 , as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.86 percent, from 6.79 percent on Monday. Rates on short-term maturities were also higher, with the three-month bill at 3.54 percent, up from 3.50 percent, and the six-month bill at 3.77 percent, up from 3.73 percent.
Intermediate maturities like 3-year and 10-year notes also felt the brunt of selling. The yield on a 3-year note rose seven basis points, to 5.31 percent, and the 10-year rose eight basis points to 6.39 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
 
 
'Three Something'
 According to traders, the reports on their computer screens in the morning said that Mr. Lindsey of the Fed indicated that short-term interest rates would be "three something."
"Not many people took it serious," David A. Ader, managing analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said. "But apparently some took it as a sign that the Fed would not tighten again."
Soon after the market moved on reports of Mr. Lindsey's remarks, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board in Washington said that the comment was not intended as a forecast. It was meant to be humorous, the spokesman said.
According to a text of Mr. Lindsey's speech, it does appear that he meant the comment as a joke. In opening his speech, he said: "As economic and investment professionals, you've all come to appreciate how easy it is to make a forecast these days. Whatever the question, the answer is three. What will real growth be? About three. What will inflation be? About three. What about short rates? Three something.
"Tonight, however, I am going to resist the temptation of just uttering the number three and sitting down."
Analysts said the confusion in the market did not help Fed credibility yesterday.
 
 
'Some Traders Saw Otherwise'
 Mr. Ader noted that people who own a lot of Treasury securities had no patience with the attempted clarification by the Fed spokesman. "The market's retreat appeared to coincide with the spokesman's comments and the release of fourth-quarter nonfarm productivity, which should have been good for the market," Mr. Ader said. "But unbelievably, some traders saw otherwise."
Mr. Ader believes the strong revision by the Labor Department of the fourth-quarter productivity gain to an annualized 6.1 percent, the largest increase in more than seven years, and the drop in unit labor costs at an annual rate of 3.1 percent should have provided further evidence to the market that inflation was not a problem.
"The gain in productivity is good for the market, and to be taken as inflationary is a counter-read by the market," Mr. Ader said. "People just look for excuses in a bearish market."
Productivity measures the time, effort and cost of producing goods. Rising productivity suggests businesses are improving their efficiency and delivering goods at competitive prices and lower costs, analysts say.
With the selling under way and people's impatience running out, the market "just gave up the constructive optimism that it had started the session with," Mr. Ader said. The weekly Johnson Redbook report on United States department store sales, which was somewhat strong, had little impact, he said.
"This suggests that we're going to see some more weakness" in bond prices and higher interest rates over the near term, Mr. Ader said. He expects trading will be choppy, with the market in a narrow range as prices approach those of last week, but do not fall much lower.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Remains Static; Gold Ends Higher in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar barely moved against some other leading currencies for a second day yesterday as fund managers stayed on the sidelines after recent turbulence in global securities markets.
Traders were also believed to be waiting for fresh news on American and German interest rates. 
 Gold prices rose after falling in Europe. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery closed at $377.70 an ounce, up 80 cents from Monday.
The dollar traded in a tight range against other currencies. "This is one of the slowest days we've seen in a long time," Matt Porio, a vice president at Chase Manhattan, said.
He and others said major fund managers were absent after suffering losses in recent weeks on volatile bond and stock markets.
"Now everybody's kind of shell-shocked and waiting on the sidelines," David Durst, a vice president at Bear, Stearns, said.
Traders were apparently watching for indications of whether the Federal Reserve Board might soon nudge interest rates higher. They were also awaiting today's announcement by the German central bank of its new rate for two-week repurchase agreements, which the bank uses to influence the money market.
The rate for the variable repurchase agreements is expected to fall slightly, perhaps one-tenth of 1 percent or even one-twentieth of 1 percent, traders said.
A larger cut in German rates could have the effect of helping the dollar at the expense of the mark. Higher interest rates often increase a currency's popularity by translating into a higher return on deposits in that currency. Lower rates often do the opposite.
In Tokyo yesterday, the dollar closed at 105.54 yen, up 0.04 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar fell to 105.30 yen. In New York, the dollar ended at 105.37 yen, down from 105.50 Monday.
The Canadian dollar rose to 73.77 United States cents, up from 73.68. The British pound finished at $1.4884, cheaper than $1.4905 late Monday.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, included: 1.7143 German marks, down from 1.7185; 1.4380 Swiss francs, down from 1.4405; 5.8240 French francs, down from 5.8380, and 1,690 Italian lire, up from 1,689.

HEADLINE: Productivity Had Big Jump In 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The productivity of American companies rose in last year's fourth quarter by the largest amount in more than seven years, the Labor Department reported yesterday. But for all the talk of America's newly achieved competitiveness, the new numbers failed to show that corporate America has regained its old ability to rapidly increase its efficiency, the department said.
Productivity -- that is, the quantity of goods and services that the nation's workers produce in a given hour -- rose at an annual rate of 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter. That rise, covering all business except farming, was the best showing since the first quarter of 1986, when productivity rose by 6.9 percent. Most of last quarter's gain was in manufacturing, where productivity advanced by a very strong 7.2 percent.
 
 
Debate Over Data
 The latest productivity figure, which is a sharp revision from the previous estimate of 4.2 percent, renewed a debate that flares up whenever the Labor Department releases productivity figures. On one side are those who argue that American business, and particularly manufacturing, has finally returned to the high levels of productivity growth that prevailed until 1973. As a result, they say, American companies are now as competitive as German and Japanese companies. That view has been invoked frequently by companies to justify the layoffs of thousands of workers considered a drag on efficiency. 
 "There have been 60,000 layoffs in telecommunications alone this year," Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, said. "That is not job shifting; that is upheaval. We have become through this downsizing far more productive and cost efficient than we were in the past."
The Clinton Administration has resisted this view. Most of the fourth-quarter gain reflected the improving economy rather than big gains in corporate efficiency, according to Edwin Dean, chief of the productivity division at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"I would be conservative and take the position that we have not really changed that much; we have not become all that more efficient," Mr. Dean said. "One can explain a lot of this improvement by noting that there was slack in the system as a result of the recession, and as the economy has recovered, the slack has been used up. People have simply worked harder to fill all the orders, and so their productivity has risen."
Some of the figures released yesterday support Mr. Dean's argument. What the work force produced to satisfy the rising national demand increased by 9.3 percent, for example, while total hours worked went up by only 2.2 percent -- the implication being that people worked harder within their scheduled hours.
 
 
Sharp Revision
 The 6.1 percent figure released yesterday represented an unusually sharp revision from the previous estimate. It was based on new data that showed output for exports to have been much greater in the fourth quarter than previously tabulated.
If the Clinton Administration is correct that most of the gain in productivity is a result of the upturn in the economy, then as long as the upturn continues, the productivity gains might be expected to continue as well; corporate America would have less justification for the layoffs and job eliminations it says are necessary to achieve higher productivity.
"Clinton has to deliver on his promise of eight million new jobs to get re-elected," Mr. Roach said. "But if companies keep laying off and downsizing, he has a problem. So the Administration talks against the productivity rationale for the job cuts."
Productivity growth was significantly higher in the post-World War II period, rising at an average annual rate of 2.5 percent from 1948 to 1973, and supporting strong growth in American living standards.
 
 
Durable Goods
 That average declined to less than 1 percent a year after 1973, despite bursts of improvement following the 1974 and 1982 recessions, and the recession that ended in 1991. With the strong fourth-quarter showing, productivity for last year rose by 1.7 percent, with most of the gain coming in the manufacture of such durable goods as computers and other electronics equipment, machinery, cars and trucks. Productivity among durable goods manufacturers rose at an annual rate of 12.3 percent in the fourth quarter.
For all of 1993, manufacturing productivity rose by 5.1 percent, on top of a rise of 4.2 percent in 1992 -- the strongest two-year showing in more than 15 years.
The productivity report also suggested that inflationary forces in the economy were weak. The Labor Department said that unit labor costs -- the labor cost to produce a car, a pair of shoes or some other product or service -- had declined in the fourth quarter at an annual rate of 3.1 percent. It was the largest quarterly drop in more than a decade, and the second consecutive quarterly decline.
"It has been 31 years since we have had two consecutive quarterly declines in unit labor costs," Mr. Roach said. "That indicates extraordinary control over labor costs, which is only possible when productivity is rising more than the norm."

HEADLINE: Martin Marietta Gobbles Up Grumman

 BODY:
In the latest mega-dollar deal in the defense industry, the Martin Marietta Corporation has agreed to buy the Grumman Corporation for $1.9 billion. Grumman, the venerable Long Island aerospace company, founded in 1929, is just another in a long line of military contractors to fold its wings as Pentagon procurements slow to match a vastly shrunken threat.
Defense jobs will continue to disappear. That is not the consequence of consolidation in the industry, but of smaller Pentagon budgets. Grumman's work force, for instance, is down to 18,000, from 33,700 in 1987. Many more layoffs are likely with the end of F-14 production and cancellation of other carrier-based aircraft. 
 That will mean even harder times around Grumman's Bethpage, L.I., headquarters. Washington and Albany need to do what they can to ease the plight of the unemployed.
The defense industry was overdue for major contraction. While many companies began diversifying, Martin Marietta and Grumman remained heavily dependent on defense, which accounts for at least 85 percent of their revenues. Such businesses have to eat or be eaten by others in the industry.
For Grumman the choice was clear: Find a buyer that valued its expertise in defense electronics, information systems and surveillance aircraft, like the Navy's E-2C Hawkeye and the Army-Air Force's JSTARS. Martin Marietta will now become the world's largest defense electronics company.
Some worry that consolidation will reduce competition. But the defense industry has never been very competitive. Seldom did more than two companies bid on a big contract. And losers often won, as the Pentagon tried to keep production lines going by spreading contracts around.
With the downsizing at the Pentagon, there are too few defense contracts to spread around. To promote competition, Washington needs to break down the wall between military and non-military production, eliminating the overly specific requirements and reams of classified paperwork that have kept new entrants out of defense work.
The Clinton Administration is trying harder than any of its predecessors to do just that. If it succeeds, it might make the defense business more competitive, and at less cost to taxpayers.

HEADLINE: In America;
Cigarette Smoke and Mirrors

BYLINE: BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
For years the tobacco industry, which has been unceasingly inventive in developing ways to champion its treacherous products, has tried to spread the peculiar notion that it would be bad for the economy if too many Americans wised up and kicked the cigarette habit.
The reasoning is as follows: Sharply reduced tobacco consumption, resulting in sharply decreased sales of tobacco products, would hurt not only tobacco-producing states but all other states as well. Businesses related to the production, sale and distribution of tobacco would shut down, people would be thrown out of work, and state and Federal governments would lose the substantial revenues they realize from taxes on tobacco. 
 A number of studies have been commissioned by the industry to show that the economic impact of tobacco is huge. Thus kicking the habit may be good for your health, but the industry warns that it may be harmful to others. By putting out that last cigarette, you could be putting someone out of a desperately needed job. The children of tobacco salesmen and distributors could be forced to go hungry. And by not paying your fair share of cigarette taxes you could be contributing to the national deficit.
Consider the "Save Our Jobs" rally scheduled for today in Washington. Thousands of cigarette workers plan to demonstrate in opposition to proposed hikes in Federal tobacco taxes.
As many as 9,000 workers are expected from just one plant, the giant Philip Morris U.S.A. complex in Richmond, which produces half a billion cigarettes a day. Somebody has to smoke all those cigarettes or somebody else is out of work. Hard-core smokers are a dying breed, so others are needed to take up the slack. In light of current employment conditions, reaching for that next pack of Marlboros could be seen as one's civic duty -- like paying taxes but without the compulsion of law. Smoking as an act of altruism.
Well, perhaps not.
A careful new study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and released just yesterday, disputes the economic findings of the tobacco industry studies. In particular, the new study asserts that a sharp decline in smoking will not hurt the economies of non-tobacco-producing states and will not lead to decreased employment.
In fact, the study, by a pair of researchers at the University of Michigan, found just the opposite: "Reducing or eliminating tobacco product spending in Michigan will increase employment in the state, as well as health."
The researchers, Kenneth E. Warner, a professor of public health policy and administration, and George A. Fulton, a research scientist in the Department of Economics, said their findings were based on a computerized study of the Michigan economy and could be applied to other non-tobacco states.
"The [tobacco] industry's estimates greatly exaggerate tobacco's economic importance," the study says. "Implicitly, they treat the resources devoted to tobacco product production and distribution as disappearing if sales decline or cease altogether. However, the amount of economic activity associated with tobacco product sales would not disappear if consumers decreased their spending on tobacco products. Rather, it would be redistributed as consumers use the same money to purchase alternative goods and services.
"Just like spending on tobacco, this alternative spending would generate employment and tax revenues associated with the production, distribution, and sale of purchased goods and services."
In Michigan, consumers spend about $1.8 billion a year on tobacco products. That's a lot of cash to be redirected in a state's economy.
Toward the end of their study, Mr. Warner and Mr. Fulton addressed the issue that the tobacco industry cannot allow itself to acknowledge: Smoking makes people sick and that's a boon to the health care sector.
"Thus," says the study, "by producing illness, tobacco generated economic activity (jobs and incomes) in the health care industry in Michigan, just as it did in tobacco retailing and wholesaling."
The merchants of death don't mention that when they're bragging about how terrific smoking is for the economy.

HEADLINE: Prices for Recycled Materials Have Become Low and Attractive

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In response to Mark Shantzis of Hi-Rise Recycling Systems in "Recycling Creates More Problems Than It Was Meant to Solve" (letter, March 2), I would like to clarify a few points about the markets for recyclable materials and the economics of recycling in the United States. 
 Mr. Shantzis refers to a "growing mountain of unused bottles and cans" because recyclable materials are being "priced out of the market." In actuality, prices for most major recyclable commodities have declined during the economic recession, making them a more economically attractive feedstock for manufacturers. Economics studies have also indicated that using recycled materials can lower a manufacturer's energy costs or other operating expenses.
Corporate America plays a critical role in stimulating the recycling marketplace, by purchasing recycled products and marketing consumer goods made from recycled material. I believe that businesses can do even more for recycling, but disagree with Mr. Shantzis's statement that "corporations have not been particularly aggressive in marketing recycled products to consumers."
For instance, 600 companies that have joined the National Recycling Coalition's Buy Recycled Business Alliance spent more than $10.5 billion on recycled products and materials last year, an increase from the $2.7 billion the founding 25 corporations spent the year before. In New York, daily newspaper publishers (including The Times) voluntarily agreed to increase their use of recycled newsprint; those publishers have already exceeded their goals.
Contrary to Mr. Shantzis, recyclable materials markets have grown by leaps in the last few years, thanks to the market development efforts of New York and other states. The issue is not if a community has a market for recyclable materials, but what price it can get for them.
The average cost of processing recyclables at a materials recovery facility is about $50 a ton (not $130 a ton, as Mr. Shantzis indicates), and the cost is picked up by municipalities, not manufacturers, as he states. These economic issues can be worked out, however, by continued efforts by businesses, states and communities to develop markets and optimize cost-effective methods of collecting, processing and using recovered materials.

HEADLINE: Beyond Auto Shop: An Experiment in High School Job Training

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Feb. 26

 BODY:
Kim Jabbie, a high school freshman, spent three hours at a local morning radio station the other day. She visited with Josh Reynolds, the producer of the show. She tried speaking into the microphone. She watched as he wrote copy. It seemed like fun.
Soon, she will visit Emanuel Hospital here, to see what health workers do.
And, at the end of the school year, 
 Kim, who is 14, will decide what she wants to do when she grows up.
Her decision will help guide what courses she takes and what summer jobs she gets. The program, at Roosevelt High School here, is one of the most aggressive efforts in the country to address shortcomings in job training. Freshmen visit workplaces, sophomores sign up for one of six career tracks, and juniors and seniors get internships or jobs in their chosen vocations. Right now it is a pilot program; Roosevelt is one of six Oregon high schools where the experiment is going on. But by the 1996-97 year, all high schools in the state will be required to have similar programs.
The effort started two years ago, when Oregon became the first state to require all public high schools to teach job skills, particularly to students not planning on college. The program is being watched by the White House and the Education Commission of the States as they look for ways to increase the competitiveness of American workers. There is already evidence that the program is helping retain students who are most likely to drop out.
Under Oregon's school-to-work program, all students take a core curriculum of academic courses, but lessons carry career-related applications. In English, for instance, students who pick careers in health care might write a paper on health costs. In earth science, students in natural resources might learn to test soil acidity or experiment with erosion.
 
Concern About Pigeonholes
 The emphasis on training for work -- a tenet of the Clinton Administration's education legislation now before a Congressional conference committee -- has drawn its share of critics. They say students may be just as vulnerable to getting pigeonholed as students were in the old vocational education programs, when low achievers wound up in auto mechanics and hairdressing classes.
The critics say that 10th graders are too young to make intelligent career choices. "The one thing that I found the most fault with was the age," said Gary D. Watts, senior director of the National Center for Innovation, the research arm of the National Education Association, the biggest teachers' union. "There is nothing magic at 16. Do these kids know what is at stake? I don't think so."
For all the criticism, parents like Miss Jabbie's mother, Korra, believe the program has merit. At the least, she said, it will give her daughter a realistic view of work. "It's a positive thing," Mrs. Jabbie said.
For her part, Kim came away from her visit to the radio station, KEX-AM, with many of her questions answered about the communications business. "This is something I think I would like to do," she said in a cab on her way home.
One surprising benefit of the plan is that it appears to have lowered the dropout rate significantly. Two years ago at Roosevelt, the 9th-grade dropout rate was 16 percent. Today it is 6 percent.
Oregon officials use that information and other arguments to counter the criticism. They have said repeatedly that their plan is flexible enough to allow students to move from any of the six career paths if they feel they made the wrong decision.
The officials also said they are committed to financing the program, despite recession-induced cuts in state financing and a property-tax limit approved by voters two years ago. At Roosevelt High School alone, designing and introducing the job-training curriculum and retraining teachers has cost nearly $200,000 in the three years it has been in effect. But state and local officials hope for a share of the more than $1 billion that the Federal Government plans to spend for such programs through the 1997 fiscal year.
"We are very clear that these programs are about increasing options, not foreclosing options for students," said Augusta Kappan, the assistant secretary for vocational and adult education at the Education Department.
She said the Oregon school-to-work program combines these elements of three other job-training models widely embraced by public schools:
*Career academies, in which a high school operates under one professional theme with ties to businesses in that industry.
*Technical preparation schools, emphasizing connections with community colleges, allowing students to train for a job while attending school.
*Cooperative education, which includes putting students in jobs they are interested in as careers while in school.
Although it will be years before officials can determine how well the Oregon program works, the Roosevelt plan has drawn early support from the people most affected: the students.
"This is great!" said Jonathan Cyphers, a 15-year-old sophomore, as he spent a morning at the North Portland Veterinary Clinic. "I love animals. I could do this."
In three hours, he watched a veterinarian and two technicians spay a Labrador named Katrina and neuter a stray cat, Muggins, and got a primer on drugs to cure ailing animals.
Jonathan is enrolled in health occupations, which offers a curriculum heavy in science as well as mathematics, English and history. The student said the exposure to health professions (he had already visited Emanual Hospital here) will help him make better decisions about what college courses to take. After watching a parade of pets and strays growl and hiss their way to surgery, he said he would consider veterinary medicine. "I could go either way," he said.
And for those students who do not plan on higher education, the program offers a chance to look over skilled jobs, like that of technician at the North Portland animal clinic.
"Kids really get tired thinking they have to go to school eight more years to become a veterinarian," said Molly O'Brien, the clinic's office manager. "A lot of them have expressed interest in becoming a technician." That, she said, requires two years of community college.

HEADLINE: BOXING: NOTEBOOK;
Bowe Keeps His Glove in HBO View

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI

 BODY:
Riddick Bowe, who seemed so invincible only a few months ago, seemed so much history yesterday.
 The name of Bowe, the former heavyweight champion of the world, rarely came up as the people who run the careers of the current champions, Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield, spoke of an eventual showdown between the pair next November. 
And Bowe? He is fighting South Africa's Francois Botha in June. Nothing more for now. But the paths of Holyfield and Lewis are well-plotted by HBO, which wants a unified title for the most altruistic of reasons: it's good business.
 But as Seth Abraham, who runs HBO Sports, said yesterday, "In boxing, everything is subject to change." And HBO is keeping its options open. Thus, Bowe's fight with Botha is being televised by -- you guessed it -- HBO.
 Thus, a Bowe victory, and perhaps unexpected losses along the way by Lewis and/or Holyfield -- and Bowe is back.
 
Is Anti-Bowe Plot Afoot?
 Rock Newman, Bowe's manager, believes an anti-Bowe plot is afoot, hatched by Dan Duva, who promotes Holyfield, and Frank Maloney, who manages Lewis.
 "Try as they might," Newman said yesterday, "there is a very calculated and mean-spirited attempt to keep Riddick out of the heavyweight picture." He pointed out that after Bowe lost his two titles to Holyfield in November, Bowe dropped to fourth in the rankings of the World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation.
 "Lewis's people manipulated the rankings," charged Bowe's attorney, Milt Chwasky. With Bowe ranked so low, Holyfield doesn't have to worry about a mandatory return fight.
 Nonetheless, this is the course that Lewis and Holyfield are on: Lewis, the World Boxing Council king, faces Phil Jackson, father of six, on May 6 in Atlantic City. Lewis will presumably win, and then fight Oliver (Atomic Bull) McCall. Meanwhile, Holyfield defends his two titles against Michael Moorer on April 22. That will be followed by a bout in August against an opponent to be determined. And then, the title fight in November.
 "I'd rather not say anything about a man when he's down," said Lewis's manager, Maloney, yesterday when asked about Newman. "But I will say that Rock enjoyed it when other people were down and he could call the shots."
 Newman did not deny this.
 "I was difficult to deal with," he conceded, "because I demanded the lion's share and those sleazebags couldn't stand it. No matter what they do or say, Riddick will be the heavyweight champion of the world again."
 Bowe's weight, which two months before his title defense had soared to 288 pounds, is "just where we want it," Newman said yesterday. He claimed that Bowe weighs 265 pounds. If so, that is still 30 pounds above the weight he expects to be for Botha.
 Such things are unimportant to Newman, planning the return to titlehood.
 "We'll be back," he said, and added with no humor in his voice, "and we're going to have fun in the process."
 
Skipping Class for Ring
 Seth Braunstein, one of Jesse Ferguson's co-managers, will skip school next week.
 Next Wednesday, four days before his 37th birthday, Ferguson, a former victim of Bowe's, faces Frank Bruno, a former victim of Lewis's, in London, Braunstein will take off from classes at the University of Chicago, where he is continuing his work toward a degree.
 "I'm taking five economics classes in 10 weeks," said Braunstein. "I never finished and I thought, if I don't do it now, I never will."
 He and his partner in boxing, Greg Cohen, have taken on their second fighter. His name is Tony Simon, out of Detroit, and he made his debut in Scranton, Pa., last Sunday with a one-round knockout of Terry Thompson.
 
Self-Serving Ad Agency
 Kevin Kelley, the newly crowned World Boxing Council featherweight champion who is his own advertising agency, continues to put his name out there. He has had it pasted on the sides of private cabs in his native Queens. He has a new line of engraved pencils which he distributes, along with buttons and posters. He also has a title fight coming up the night of the Lewis-Jackson affair. Kelley faces Jesse Benavides.

HEADLINE: CLINTON PLAN SEES WELFARE COSTING $6 BILLION A YEAR

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
A draft of the Administration's welfare plan offers the first cost estimates of President Clinton's pledge to "end welfare as we know it," outlining significant new expenditures on child care, training and work programs.
The projections are preliminary and could undergo major changes as Mr. Clinton and his aides resolve several policy issues. But the cost of the programs, which the Administration projects at $6 billion in 1999, and the means of financing it, are likely to be central points in the debate when Congress takes up the issue this year. 
 Welfare rolls are at record highs; the Government now spends $23 billion a year on Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the main Federal welfare program.
Republican leaders in Congress as well as the President have proposed sweeping changes in welfare that would require recipients to join work programs. While the public may hear those calls as promises to save money, both parties have said they will increase spending in the initial years.
 
Why Plans Cost More
 The Clinton plan would spend $15 billion in the first five years in addition to the $23 billion a year being spent on Aid to Families With Dependent Children. That is actually $5 billion less than a bill being put forward by 162 House Republicans.
The plans to enroll welfare recipients in work programs cost more than simply mailing checks because the Government has to hire additional supervisors and provide child care to the single parents in the program.
The annual cost of the Administration's program, as outlined, would grow to $6 billion by 1999. But because the program is being phased in over more than a decade, that figure significantly underestimates the eventual costs, which will begin escalating in the sixth year and beyond.
 
Painful Hunt for Revenue
 The draft does not say how the money will be raised. Budget laws require new spending to be offset by program cuts or tax increases, and some officials say the painful hunt for revenue may force a smaller program.
The costs of the Clinton plan escalate sharply in later years because by then increasing numbers of welfare recipients will exhaust a time limit and be forced to work. Because Congressional budget rules have a five-year accounting period, the Administration is not forced to explain how those later costs will be borne.
But past attempts to overhaul the welfare system have faltered when the money ran low, and long-term financing is crucial. "It's a real concern," said Sid Johnson, director of the American Public Welfare Association, which represents state welfare officials. "You have to keep you eye on the long-term ball and what you're committing yourself to."
David T. Ellwood, an Assistant Secretary of Health, and Human Services who is a co-chairman of the group drafting the President's plan, expressed confidence that future financing would keep pace. "We're not playing budget games," he said. "We're going to do the right thing."
Mr. Clinton's pledge to "end welfare as we know it" was among his most successful campaign themes, and he has promised a bill this spring. The plan would expand training programs and then require parents still unemployed after two years to work.
The draft of the plan, which was circulated among Cabinet members last week, also outlines policy disputes that have begun to divide the Administration. One of the most important is: should mothers who work part time at low-wage jobs be allowed to collect supplementary welfare payments after the two-year limit expires?
The officials favoring that provision are led by Mr. Ellwood. They say part-time work is the first step out of dependency, but it often is not enough to support a family. Depriving part-time workers of supplementary welfare payments, they say, would force some mothers to increase their work hours, thus spending less time with their children, or fall deeper into poverty.
The officials expressing concern about the supplementary payments are led by Bruce Reed, a White House aide who is the other co-chairman of the group drafting the plan. They contend that continued welfare payments to part-time workers could encourage people to remain on government aid.
Mr. Reed said his concerns are less political than substantive. "I want to make sure that everything we do steers people toward self-sufficiency as quickly as possible," he said.
A copy of the draft was provided by an Administration official who feared the plan could wind up hurting poor families. The issues it describes are sufficiently sensitive that the Administration scheduled an unusual briefing today in response to questions about the paper from The New York Times.
Officials distributed the draft to other reporters on the condition that they not quote from it, and the officials spent an hour praising the provisions, on the condition they not be identified.
The $6 billion annual spending contains several provisions that have escaped much notice. It includes $945 million, for instance, in additional welfare payments to two-parent households, as an incentive to keep families together. It also includes $2 billion for child care to working poor families who are not on welfare, as a means of keeping them off the rolls. And it includes $250 million for a demonstration project in which the Government would make child support payments if an absent parent fails to do so.
The plan also projects potential cost savings, including $150 million a year if states are allowed to deny additional cash to parents who conceive additional children while on welfare, and $50 million a year by requiring mothers under the age of 18 to live at home.
But the plan would spend only $690 million a year on the work program itself in 1999. That is a fivefold increase from the previous year, however, and the amount would continue to escalate as more people reached the time limit.
No one knows how high it will ultimately grow. By 1999, the Administration predicts, 130,000 welfare recipients would have exhausted the two-year limit and joined the work program. But there are five million families on Aid to Families With Dependent Children, and one official has estimated that from 500,000 to 2.3 million will eventually reach the time limit.
