HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Bleak Job Picture Darkens the Mood

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
AT face value, the first estimate of gross national product in the third quarter, released by the Commerce Department this week, implies that the recession is over: total output of goods and services, adjusted for inflation, rose at an annual rate of 2.4 percent.
But practically nobody took the number at face value. Economists noted that the gain in G.N.P. was largely a result of a slower rate of inventory cutting. Inventories declined at an annual rate of $12.9 billion in the third quarter, less than half as fast as the $27.2 billion second-quarter drop. The slower decline added $14.3 billion to G.N.P. But final sales -- G.N.P. less inventory change -- rose by only six-tenths of 1 percent, just a smidgen above the gain of three-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter. 
 Even more disturbing, economic activity slackened after the summer. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said the economy turned "demonstrably sluggish" in recent weeks. And the Conference Board reported that its index of consumer confidence plunged 12.5 points, to 60.4, in September -- arousing fears of a double dip.
A good part of the explanation for the bleak mood of consumers and the widespread disbelief that the recession is over is the persistence of unemployment -- and, among those who have not seen a pink slip, worry about being laid off.
Some of the most prominent American companies, in both services and goods, have announced layoffs. Edward S. Hyman of the International Strategy and Investment Group noted that just in October layoffs were announced by American Express, Pacific Telesis, Hercules, Amoco, Raytheon, Westinghouse, Allied-Signal, RJR Nabisco, Boeing, United Technology, Exxon, Sears, Campbell Soup, Citicorp, A.T.& T., Amoco, I.B.M., Bell Atlantic, Rockwell, Time Inc., General Electric, Wal-Mart, Chase Manhattan, U.S. Shoe and Phelps Dodge.
The reasons may differ from company to company: Some are military contractors, caught in cutbacks; some are retailers, hurt by consumers; some are banks, squeezed by bad loans; some are publishers, hit by weak advertising; some are victims of their own acquisitiveness, deep in junk bonds or other debt and struggling to cut costs. But payroll trims are seen as a universal elixir -- though corporate layoffs boomerang, depressing consumer confidence, corporate sales and profits.
To ordinary people, the prime measure of a recession is unemployment, not gross national product. And the unemployment rate, despite the third-quarter recovery in real G.N.P., stayed like an indigestible lump in the belly of the economy. The civilian jobless rate averaged 6.8 percent in the third quarter, the same as in the second. The jobless rate was down a hair to 6.7 percent in September (well within the reach of probable error.) Unemployment data for October will be announced this morning, but economists interviewed earlier saw no reason for significant change.
For black male teen-agers seeking work, the jobless rate in September was far worse -- 40.8 percent, up from 31.4 a year ago.
Thus far, the recovery, even assuming it is still in motion, has been too slow to bring down the jobless rate. In the 1960's, Arthur Okun of the Brookings Institution produced what was known as Okun's Law: That the economy must grow at an annual rate of 3 percent just to keep the unemployment rate constant. Since the law was promulgated, the rates of productivity growth and labor force growth have slowed, and an economic growth rate of only about 2.5 percent is consistent with a constant unemployment rate.
Thus, the 2.4 percent growth reported for the third quarter was not enough to bring down unemployment, but only to hold it steady. If economists are right that the fourth-quarter growth rate will slip to 1 or 2 percent, unemployment will probably worsen, increasing the anxieties of President Bush and other Republicans about the 1992 election.
What to do to get the jobless rate down, consumer confidence up and the economy humming again? The standard remedies are monetary ease and fiscal stimulus. The Fed this week seemed to be moving, albeit gingerly, toward greater ease, but there are concerns that, with consumer and business confidence down, pushing out reserves and pushing down interest rates is like "pushing on a string," in William McChesney Martin's phrase. The huge and growing budget deficit will inhibit either big tax cuts or big spending increases.
A different approach -- and an old-fashioned one -- would be a public jobs program. This is advocated by Sar Levitan and Frank Gallo of the Center for Social Policy Studies of George Washington University. In a new study, "Spending to Save: Expanding Employment Opportunities," they argue that this is the best way to alleviate joblessness, hardship and poverty, promote the work ethic and self-reliance, provide neglected goods and services and help the economy emerge from recession.
But the economy will probably have to get much worse before Congress and the President turn to a direct jobs approach.

HEADLINE: Affordability Of Housing Up

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
A combination of declining mortgage interest rates and housing prices made homes more affordable for the average family in September than they have been in 14 years, the National Association of Realtors said today.
The group said its housing affordability index stood at 116.1 for the month, up from a revised 111.2 in August. It was the largest monthly gain since record-keeping began in 1971 and the highest since May 1977 when it measured 118.6. 
 In September last year the index was 110.2.
The affordability index measures the ability of a family in the United States earning the national median income to buy a home at the median price.
Families earning the national median income of $36,361 a year had 116.1 percent of the income needed to qualify for a conventional home loan, the trade group said.
Regionally, it was easier to buy a house in the Midwest and South based on local median incomes and prices.
A Northeast family earning $40,049 had 93.0 percent of the income needed to buy a house priced at $136,900, while in the West, a family earning $37,788 had 83.3 percent of the income to buy a $144,000 home.
A Midwest family earning $37,491 had 156.6 percent of the income needed to buy a house priced at $76,300. A family in the South earning $32,703 had 113.7 percent of income to buy a $92,000 home, the group said.
The interest rate used to calculate the index was 9.17 percent, down from 10 percent a year ago.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mixed as Traders Await Economic Reports

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against other major currencies yesterday as traders anticipated further cuts in American interest rates.
Gold prices were mostly lower. 
 The dollar spent much of the day moving in a narrow range as traders waited for a batch of big economic indicators due out today.
In particular, the market was waiting to see what the Government's October employment report would show.
The question was whether the report would prompt the Federal Reserve to push interest rates lower for the second time this week. On Wednesday, the central bank appeared to signal that it was easing its monetary policy when it allowed the Federal funds rate to fall a quarter percentage point to 5 percent.
The funds rate is the interest banks charge one another on short-term loans.
Other reports due today include the Government's Index of Leading Indicators and its construction-spending figures.
No one was expecting good news. "We're generally still looking at a weak economy," said Earl Johnson, a vice president with Harris Trust in Chicago. He predicted the employment figures would be soft. Then the market will be "waiting to see if the Fed takes action," he said.
The dollar is likely to fall if today's reports are negative because the currency draws support from higher or stable rates.
The British pound fell against the dollar, slipping to $1.7395 in New York from $1.7445 late Wednesday. In earlier London trading, sterling rose to $1.7445 from $1.7425.
The dollar fell against the Japanese yen. In New York, it closed at 130.75 yen, down from late Wednesday's 131.05. In Japan overnight, the dollar fell 0.05 yen to 131 yen and in London, it was quoted at 130.55 yen.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Mixed in Slow Session

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed in slow trading yesterday, as credit market participants waited for the release of October's employment statistics this morning and wondered how the Federal Reserve Board might respond.
The Fed, which was thought by many to be easing monetary policy on Wednesday, did nothing yesterday to discredit the notion that it had indeed lowered its target for the overnight Federal funds rate to 5 percent from 5.25 percent. 
 At the same time, however, analysts said movements in the Federal funds rate yesterday did not entirely eliminate the possibility that market participants had attached more significance to what took place on Wednesday than the Fed intended.
 
Intrigue About the Fed
After opening at 5 percent, the Fed funds rate traded as high as 5 5/16 percent yesterday, before drifting back down.
"There is some intrigue lingering about the Fed," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research on the foreign-exchange and credit markets.
"But I think this is going to be an academic issue, because I think the employment report is going to be soft enough so that they will show they have eased," he said.
In advance of this morning's report, the consensus estimate among Wall Street economists was that nonfarm payroll employment rose by a very modest 18,000 last month.
 
Cut in the Discount Rate?
 Doubts about the Fed lingered, but traders who seemed certain that an easing of monetary policy occurred on Wednesday said that a weaker economy might compel the Fed to reduce its discount rate to 4.5 percent from 5 percent.
"I don't think this is the last easing move we will see," a government bond trader said. "We probably will see a discount rate cut on Friday, and if not then, on Tuesday."
Anthony J. Vignola, chief economist at Kidder, Peabody & Company, has come to a similar conclusion. In releasing a revised and more dismal economic forecast yesterday, Mr. Vignola said growth over the next two quarters would likely be at half the rate that had been expected.
"The economy has deteriorated considerably over the last month or so," he said. "The extraordinary restructuring in the economy, particularly in services, is constraining employment and income growth."
 
Lower Bond Yields Are Seen
 Slower growth will allow interest rates to move lower, Kidder, Peabody's revised forecast said.
"We think that the funds rate will hit a cyclical low at 4.5 percent and that bond yields will fall to 7 percent," Mr. Vignola said.
A survey of the nation's purchasing managers originally scheduled for release today became public knowledge late yesterday. The results showed that conditions in the manufacturing sector had slipped during October. The report had almost no impact on prices in the credit markets.
Traders also tended to gloss over a report from the Fed showing that all three measures of the nation's money supply posted strong increases during the week ended Oct. 21.
 
Market for Treasuries
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds were offered late yesterday at a price of 102 13/32, down 6/32, to yield 7.91 percent, compared to 7.89 percent late Wednesday.
Prices of shorter-term Treasury notes fared better. By late in the day, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 27/32, up 1/32, to yield 7.45 percent. And the 6 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 9/32, also up 1/32, to yield 5.68 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.82 percent late yesterday, up one basis point, or a hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates also rose one basis point, to a late offered rate of 4.83 percent. But one-year bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 4.81 percent.
 
Citicorp's Offering
 New-issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market was highlighted by a Citicorp two-part offering of $1.5 billion worth of new senior debt securities backed by credit card receipts.
The largest portion of the debt sale consists of $850 million of seven-year securities. The 7 7/8 percent notes were priced at $99.55 to yield 7.961 percent, 82.5 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/8 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing. The remaining $650 million were sold as 6.25 percent two-year notes. They were priced at $99.87 to yield 6.322 percent, 63 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
The First Boston Corporation acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated AAA by Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
MCI's Five-Year Notes
 In addition to the Citicorp offering, the MCI Communications Corporation offered $250 million of five-year notes through an underwriting group led by Merrill Lynch & Company. The 7 5/8 percent securities, which mature on Nov. 7, 1996, were priced at $99.84 to yield 7.664 percent, 92 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 7/8 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing. The securities are rated Baa-1 by Moody's and BBB by Standard & Poor's.
Traders in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said prices of most issues were narrowly mixed in sluggish trading.
Trading was also said to be slow in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds. Traders said prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/8 of a point.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Empire State Buyer Found

 BODY:
The Prudential Insurance Company of America has found a buyer for the Empire State Building, according to a letter the company sent to a partnership holding an 84-year lease on the property.
Peter Malkin, a New York real estate investor with a substantial interest in the partnership that controls the lease, said the buyer was listed as E. G. Holdings and the sale was scheduled to be completed on Nov. 15. Which investors or institutions are represented by E. G. Holdings was not specified in the letter, Mr. Malkin said, and could not be determined yesterday. 
 Prudential declined to discuss details of the sale, and the letter did not indicate the price at which the property would be sold.
The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that a member of the family of J. Peter Grace, the chairman of W. R. Grace & Company, had agreed to buy the 102-story building, located at Fifth Avenue and 34th, Street, for $40 million. The Journal could not say, however, who in the Grace family would be the buyer. The Grace company said Mr. Grace himself was not involved, but it would not speak for other members of his family.
Several real estate executives said yesterday that the reported purchase price was remarkably high and would be difficult to justify on strict economic terms. The building is controlled by a master lease that gives Mr. Malkin and his partners control over it and most of its income for the next 84 years.

HEADLINE: Economic Malaise Across the Midwest

 BODY:
Throughout the American Midwest, traditional home of industry and can-do optimism, a mood of hestiancy, mistrust and disorientation seems to have taken hold.
 Nebraska still welcomes travelers with a billboard saying "The Good Life," but interviews in four states suggest a deep malaise about the nation's leadership and economy. Purchases of goods from cars to combines are bring postponed.
 It is not merely that nobody believes Vice President Quayle's statement that "the country is out of the recession." It is that few perceive the Administration to have the means to revive the economy.

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Stocks Flat as Dow Falls 2.68

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks finished flat in moderate trading yesterday, but the broader market continued to show strength. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 2.68, to 3,069.10.
Economic data relased yesterday -- like the report that factory orders were down in September for the second consecutive month -- had little impact. Investors found few incentives to buy aggressively, especially ahead of today's employment report, analysts said. 
"The traders stayed largely on the sidelines awaiting Friday's employment numbers, which some hope will allow the Fed to lower interest rates further," said Harry W. Laubsher, senior vice president and market analyst for Tucker Anthony. "Buying interest was on the shy side, with breadth and volume disappointing."
Big Board volume was a moderate 182.2 million shares, down from 200.8 million shares on Wednesday. Gaining issues outpaced losers by 904 to 725, nearly the same margin the previous day.
The New York Stock Exchange composite was up 0.06, to 216.54, with the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, slipping 0.50, to 392.46.
Trading on the American Stock Exchange was also light, with the composite up 3.13, to 387.31. The Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 indexes both rose to record highs for the second consecutive day. The Nasdaq reached 542.98, up 1.66, and the Russell went to 184.97, up 1.62.
Earnings reports affected several stocks. Household International, a financial-services concern, fell 7 7/8, to 49 7/8, after the company said earnings would be hurt by higher loan delinquencies.
Trading in UAL, the parent of United Airlines, was stopped for a while, as the airline reported third-quarter profits that were considerably lower than Wall Street expectations. The stock fell 2, to 132 3/4.
Novell, which markets computer networks, rose 2 3/4, to 51 3/4, as it was added to the S.& P. 500, replacing Cross & Trecker, a machine tool maker being acquired. Shares of Advance Micro Devices rose sharply when the company told analysts at a meeting in California that it expected higher fourth-quarter revenues. Daniel Klesken, an analyst at Prudential Securities, increased his earnings estimates for 1991 and 1992, after the company's presentation, traders said. The stock rose 1 3/4, to close at 12 7/8.
Lotus fell 3 1/4, to 24 1/4, as some analysts downgraded the company, noting that sales of its 1-2-3 for Windows product remain sluggish and may face stiffer competition in the first quarter. Borland rose 9 3/4, to 67 3/8, on news of new-product plans, and Microsoft, was down 5/8, to 93 7/8.
First Brands, a manufacturer of home and auto consumer products, rose 1, to 30 1/2, regaining some of the losses incurred on Wednesday when it dropped more than $3.

DATELINE: DOWS, Iowa

 BODY:
Across the Midwest, traditional home of industry and a can-do optimism, a mood of hesitancy, mistrust and disorientation seems to have taken hold.
Nebraska still welcomes travelers with a billboard saying, "The Good Life," but interviews with dozens of people in four states suggest a profound uneasiness about the nation's leadership and its economy. Purchases of everything from cars to combines are being postponed. 
 Take the Muhlenbruchs, whose life amid the wheat and soybean fields of central Iowa continues to offer certain virtues. "You can still yell at your husband and at least the neighbors won't hear," said Gayle Muhlenbruch. While farming is not always profitable, the land teaches hard work, husbandry and what she calls, "the plain fact that people have got to be able to help themselves."
Steadily applying such values, and shunning vacations for 20 years, Mrs. Muhlenbruch and her husband, Darwyne, prospered. They gradually expanded their farm to 700 acres from 160 and sent their two children to college. Now, however, an uneasiness has crept into their lives.
"Things are sort of floating right now, just floating," said Mr. Muhlenbruch, who is 52 years old. "You feel real uncertain. If the economy was better, I would buy a new tractor. But that can cost $80,000. So I'm waiting."
He is not alone in holding off big purchases. It is not merely that nobody believes Vice President Dan Quayle's statement that "the country is out of the recession" or that many see a "double-dip" downturn coming after the blip of confidence.
It is that few perceive that the Bush Administration has the means to revive the economy. As a result, support for the President seems muted and most people, rich and poor, urban and rural, said they had not decided how they will vote next year.
What depresses many people in the Midwest is a sense that things cannot get better in the foreseeable future. In response, many urge increased taxes on the rich, a cut in the bureaucracy, an end to what they see as pervasive pork-barrel politics and limits on terms for Congressmen. But even those suggesting such measures seem to have little conviction that a real improvement will result.
They may not understand the precise nature of the Federal deficit, but they sense that that fiscal relief is probably impossible or counterproductive.
Where consumers during past recessions looked to the President to cut taxes as a firm signal of determination to lift the economy, now they have little faith in his ability to act.
"If people thought that there was a program that could correct the situation, that in itself would improve confidence," said Richard T. Curtin, director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan. "That is a missing element of optimism which helped end past recessions."
In Washington, "they've dug a pretty deep hole for themselves," said John Mandal, the deputy sheriff of Wright County, Iowa. "And that makes me pessimistic. The Government's no different from my family or a business. You can't keep operating in the red."
Jerry Maier, an Iowa farmer with 650 acres that are scarcely profitable, added, "We've had to tighten our belts on everything and become efficient, but the Government has just spent way beyond its means."
To help buy Christmas presents for her three children, Renee Scott of Des Moines, who works in the circulation department of The Des Moines Register, is trying to get a second job. "I fight to get ahead, yet I have to pay for Congressmen's free lunches and haircuts," she said. "If I make out a dud check I get a $15 fine, but if they write one it's no big deal. Why don't they take a look at how we live?"
 
A Dark Threat: The Federal Deficit
 The Federal deficit, $285 billion this fiscal year and headed for a record $345 billion next year, seems to loom large over the Midwest as the symbol of a profligacy and carelessness that appear beyond rectification.
But the deficit is only one of several factors that cause people to scoff at statements from economists and the Government that the recession ended in May, when the economy started growing again, albeit slowly. Growth amounted to 2.4 percent in the last quarter, less than half the growth rates generally recorded when the country emerges from recession.
Falling or stagnant property values have also undermined people's sense of their wealth. Nervousness and pessimism, meanwhile, seem to have been compounded by a conviction born of the savings-and-loans debacle and the recent Congressional check-bouncing scandal that nobody in Washington is to be trusted.
In the face of this accumulated disgruntlement, Federal reports of improved employment or consumer spending have made scant impact, even though the recession has been much harder on the two coasts than the Midwest. As Roger Brinner, the executive director of DRI-McGraw-Hill said: "Laymen are not enamored of G.N.P. numbers. The layman asks: have things gotten better?"
Many Midwesterners say no. They ask what use are the values of thrift, honesty, hard work, if Washington practises none of them. And they wonder what cause there is for optimism if, as Tim Smith of the Carter Avenue Frame Shop in St. Paul noted, "the Federal figures are all contradictory, so I get back to the basic fact my business is off 10 percent and therefore the recession is not over"?
 
An Anxious Mood In the Small Details
 In this anxious mood, small details strike people. Students like Andrea Hoagland and Kathryn Gardner at the University of Iowa see the library staff being cut. Scott Holmes, the owner of a Des Moines jewelry store, says that "when I say no to salesmen, even in this run-up to Christmas, they don't seem disappointed; they seem to expect it." Ken Neff, who runs a Radio Shack store in Wahoo, Neb., sees sales dropping 10 percent over last year's levels as farmers wait to see how good the harvest is; and Conrad Horland, an engineer in Minnesota's Department of Transportation, is alarmed by a hiring freeze.
Betty Yunek, a retired school librarian from Lake City, Iowa, said, "There are just too many gray areas in Washington as far as right and wrong are concerned." Shaking her head in indignation, she added, "I really get upset about the savings-and-loans bailouts, which are wrong and expensive."
President Bush's predilection for foreign policy forays also seems to have fostered an image of Washington extravagance as well as a sense that he is oblivious to the country's economic woes and has forgotten that, as Dennis Ott, a laborer in Warren, Wisc., put it, "you should take care of your own first."
Feelings were summed up on the radio last week by Paul Harvey, the voice of the Midwest. He spoke scathingly of Congressmen "living above the law" before declaring roundly that "the threat of bankruptcy is now greater than the threat of war."
 
Some Find Little To Complain About
 Not everyone agrees that things are so bad. Nancy Egan, who works for the St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company, said she and her husband had a combined annual income of about $90,000 and had noticed no change in their lives and no complaints among their friends. "Look," she said, "I'm a white middle-class American, what do I have to complain about?"
Kari Griffin of Des Moines, a teacher, also said she felt that the economy was doing fine and that the rise in unemployment merely reflected the fact that "so many young people are too lazy to clean up and go out and look for a job."
But Mr. Harvey's statements plainly reflected an anxiety which has tended to prolong the recession by delaying spending, undermining investment and keeping people on the defensive with their eyes on their credit card payments.
For example, Joseph Giannetti, a Minneapolis photographer whose business is off 50 percent this year, said he was waiting to see films at the $1.50 movie theaters rather than going to $6 cinemas, cooking more at home, and considering abandoning his studio for a smaller one.
In St. Paul, Roger P. Chamberlain, a banker with a salary of $62,000 and total annual income of about $75,000, said he and his wife had cut their contributions to charity, refinanced their mortgage and put off buying a new car because they felt "the country will be in the doldrums for a while" and are intimidated by the cost of college education for their two children.
 
The Future Seems To Be a Colder Place
 Over all, it seems that constant reports of firings and dismissals have fed a gloomy conviction that deep structural changes are taking place, and many jobs will not return, even when the good times do. "Lean and mean is the watchword in industry," said R. James Gesell, the chairman of the small Cherokee State Bank in St. Paul, "and people feel that's not going to change."
The Cherokee bank, which has two branches and assets of about $100 million, has cut its staff to 50 from 55 a year ago and is resorting to part-time help when necessary. Its operations have been hit by the fact that demand for new loans is weak.
Mr. Gesell put his luxurious St. Paul home, set on two acres of woodland, on the market 11 months ago. He was asking $370,000, but the closest thing he had to an offer is $180,000, which he describes as attempted robbery. Because he and his wife feel a furnished home sells better, they have not moved most of their things to their adjacent new house.
"So when we have people over," the banker said, "I run back and forth with a couple of chairs."
Others adapt to the recession in more painful ways. Jim Rasmussen, a 33-year-old furnaceman in a St. Paul lead foundry, was doing fine as long as the gulf war lasted because bombs need lead and prices were high. But after the war, lead prices dropped and he was fired.
Since then, he says he has knocked on the doors of countless warehouses and factories, but "they all say they're laying off, not hiring." His unemployment checks stopped recently, and President Bush vetoed a $6.5 billion bill that would have provided additional benefits. His wife Stacey earns $6.35 an hour as a baker, but the couple is worried about food bills, concerned about their two children, aged 3 and 9, and having trouble with payments on the $36,000 house they bought last year.
"You're going to have to take a job at McDonald's," Stacey Rasmussen told her husband. "But we're getting a little old to be flipping hamburgers at $4 an hour."
As for Mr. Muhlenbruch, the farmer, he gazes out at the gently undulating farmland. "I believe in paying as you go," he said, "and the Government should have done the same."

(Todd Endorf for The New York Times) (pg. D1); Among the people of the Midwest, there is mixed puzzlement and resentment over what is seen as Government's inability to live within its means. Renee Scott, who works in the circulation department of the Des Moines Register and is looking for a second job to help her pay for her children's Christmas gifts, expresses anger at having "...to pay for Congressmen's free lunches and haircuts."

HEADLINE: Factories' Orders Show Drop of 1.7%

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Two reports released yesterday suggested a slight slowdown in manufacturing activity, which has previously been a bright spot in the nation's wobbling economy.
A survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management, released last night, indicated that while manufacturing activity in the United States continued to expand in October, the pace of growth was slower than in the previous month. It was the first slowdown in the growth rate in the survey since January. 
 Earlier in the day, the Commerce Department announced that orders for manufactured goods dropped 1.7 percent in September, the second straight monthly decline.
As evidence of sluggishness mounted, President Bush expressed concern over the economy, saying, "It is not as strong as, obviously, we would like it to be." He continued, "I am also concerned about mixed signals on consumer confidence and business confidence. We are pleased that the stock market has performed well in recent months, but consumer confidence has slipped."
The purchasing managers' survey, a widely followed barometer of economic activity, also showed that growth in new orders, both for export and domestic shipment, was slower than it had been the previous month. And the survey showed employment continuing a 33-month decline and falling in October at a faster rate than in the two previous months.
"The economic recovery wavered in October as the rate of growth slowed to the lowest level in three months," said Robert J. Bretz, the chairman of the association. He cited specifically the weaker growth in new orders, which he said signaled "relatively modest overall growth for the remainder of 1991."
The purchasing managers' report is consistent with the latest news from the Commerce Department on factory orders, said Carl Palash, vice president and senior economist with McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei in New York.
"The reason factory orders fell so much was the big drop in defense and aircraft-shipping orders, which are highly volatile," Mr. Palash said. "The underlying non-transportation orders rose, continuing a modest uptrend. But orders aren't rising much faster than production."
And that, he added, bodes ill for employment growth. "These reports confirm other evidence that manufacturing orders are rising modestly, but not fast enough to prompt companies to boost hiring," he said. "The manufacturing sector has been the strong sector, and now it's weakening. That's why the Federal Reserve is easing up on interest rates."
There is no firm evidence yet that the Fed has actually elected to cut interest rates. But, according to The Associated Press, Marlin Fitzwater, the Presidential spokesman, told reporters at the White House today, "I don't think anyone doubts that it happened." Mr. Fitzwater added, "There could be other cuts to come."
 
Interpreting the Index
 The purchasing manager's index, which is assembled by the association, fell in October to 53.5 percent, from 55 percent in September. A reading above 50 percent indicates the economy is expanding, while a reading below that level indicates a contracting economy. Each month from February to September, the index hit a higher number than in the previous month; the October reading is the first month-over-month decline since January.
Orders for new business increased at a slightly lower rate for the second straight month, but remained at a relatively high level, said Mr. Bretz, director of corporate purchasing for Pitney Bowes Inc.
 
Divergent Trends
 The Commerce Department reported that orders for both durable and nondurable goods declined to $238.9 billion, after seasonal adjustments, from $243.2 billion in August. The report also revised the August figures to show orders falling 2 percent, steeper than the 1.9 percent decline initially estimated.
Unfilled factory orders fell six-tenths of 1 percent, the third straight decline, while shipments rose two-tenths of 1 percent, for the sixth consecutive climb. Analysts said that with shipments going out faster than orders were coming in, there could be layoffs and weaker employment in future months.
Military orders plunged 47.8 percent in September, the steepest drop in more than seven years, the Commerce Department reported. Excluding that sector, orders rose four-tenths of 1 percent. Transportation, which is also volatile, fell 14.5 percent after a 9.2 percent decline in August.
Over all, orders for long-lasting durable goods slumped 3.2 percent, to $121.5 billion. Durable orders were off 4.1 percent the previous month.

UAL's Profit Off; Continental's Loss Thins

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
The UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, yesterday reported sharply lower third-quarter earnings and Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., parent of Continental Airlines, reported that third-quarter losses had narrowed substantially.
Both airline companies are struggling to recover from the severe downturn in passenger traffic that began in January with the Persian Gulf war, which also doubled fuel prices. 
While traffic has recovered somewhat, the increase has been anemic. Traffic in September, for example, was up only five-tenths of 1 percent over that of September 1990.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
United Airlines
 UAL had earnings of $25 million, or $1.05 a share, compared with profits of $106.1 million, or $4.87 a share, in the corresponding quarter last year. Revenue totaled $3.23 billion, up from $2.97 billion in the 1990 quarter.
The results "were below everybody's expectations," said Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company. Most analysts had exptected earnings of $1.50 to $2.25 a share.
Stephen M. Wolf, UAL's chairman, president and chief executive, attributed the results to fare-cutting by other airlines operating under bankruptcy protection and struggling to survive. These airlines, including Midway and America West, cut fares to encourage travel and increase cash flow. But the lower fares have put pressure on the profit margins of United and other healthy airlines like American.
United tends to have more routes in areas where it competes with weaker carriers that are cutting fares, Mr. Wolf said. He said that until the fare-cutting moderated and the economy improved, United's profits would be weak. But he said he saw "some very preliminary signs that our U.S. passenger business may have begun to improve."
Mr. Murphy said there were some signs that the fare-cutting had moderated. But he added that United's third-quarter yields, or its revenue per seat, were down 1 percent. He said that during the same period, American Airlines, which is United's main competitor, showed a gain of 3.6 percent on its yields.
Mr. Murphy said American's higher yield showed it was getting higher fares for its mix of seats than United. In its third quarter, American had a profit of $70.3 million, up from $65.6 million in the 1990 quarter.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, UAL's stock closed down $2 a share, to $132.75.
 
Continental
 Continental Airlines Holdings, which is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, reported a third-quarter loss of $19.7 million, substantially less than the $88.3 million it lost in the third quarter last year. Revenue remained largely unchanged, at $1.5 billion.
The airline, which plans to file its plan for debt reorganization before Nov. 28, when its right to do so expires, showed an operating profit of $25.5 million in the quarter.
Robert R. Ferguson 3d, the chief executive, said that "passenger traffic rose nearly 7 percent in this year's third quarter on a 2 percent capacity increase, while passenger revenue increased just over 4 percent due to pressure on yield as a result of the recession and weak industry demand."
Continental Airlines Holdings' stock closed up 25 cents, to $1.75, on the American Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Big Banks Set Back By House

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
Handing a defeat to the White House and the nation's largest banks and a victory to the securities and insurance industries, the House of Representatives narrowly voted today to impose significantly more restrictions on the expansion of banks into new businesses than President Bush had sought.
In a vote that essentially preserves the division of financial services that has prevailed since the Depression, the House decided, 216 to 200, to allow banking companies and securities companies to merge, but only if they keep fire walls between the activities so high that, the big banks assert, they cannot offer securities services on a competitive basis. 
 The measure, one of several main provisions in the comprehensive banking legislation, was worked out last week by two leading Democrats, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Representative Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, the chairman of the Banking Committee.
 
Clouded Prospects
 The White House had threatened to veto a bill that included the Dingell-Gonzalez measure, and today's vote falls short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a Presidential veto. With the rapidly declining bank insurance fund in need of new money, today's vote clouds the prospects for passage of a broad bill to overhaul the banking industry this year.
Republican leaders in the House tonight vowed to seek to kill the entire banking legislation Friday; the vote is expected to be close.
A critical part of the legislation is a provision to provide a large taxpayer loan to the bank insurance fund, which has a balance of less than $3 billion. Congress is under pressure to approve more money for the fund, and that pressure could lead to passage of a stripped-down bill.
Under the measure passed by the House, banking and securities operations owned by the same company would not be permitted to share customer information, conduct joint-marketing efforts or have any financial ties like extensions of credit.
The measure would end the Federal Reserve's authority to chip away slowly at the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which split the banking and securities industries, by granting exemptions to large American and Canadian banks to set up new businesses that offer limited corporate securities underwriting services.
In addition, the measure would allow state-chartered banks to continue selling insurance if permitted by the chartering state, but only in states that also permit it. That would eliminate the so-called Delaware loophole, which has enabled some banks to offer insurance services nationwide.
And the measure would prohibit nationally chartered banks from underwriting insurance.
The Senate Banking Committee has approved, although narrowly, a measure that puts significantly lower barriers between securities and banking affiliates. But like the House version and unlike the Administration's, it would not permit industrial companies to own banks.
The Senate bill would also restrict the ability of banks to enter the insurance industry and includes a number of provisions for consumers that the banks have opposed. Debate in the Senate, expected within the next few weeks, is likely to be rancorous.
The House measure is a compromise by Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Dingell to settle a dispute over whether and how to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act. Their feud had prevented legislation for overhauling the banking industry from coming to the House floor.
Supporters of the Gonzalez-Dingell compromise say the measure would grant banks sufficient new powers while keeping enough safeguards to protect taxpayers and depositors. Opponents say it is far too restrictive.
In a thinly veiled reference, President Bush said shortly before today's vote that the measure would "move banks backwards" and make them "even less competitive in the global marketplace."
"Congress must not give in to the interest groups that seek to hold back progress," Mr. Bush said at the swearing-in ceremony for William Taylor as head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, succeeding L. William Seidman. "The stakes are too high, and we cannot afford to wait any longer."
 
New Deal Legislation
 On the House floor, debate was steeped in discussion about the New Deal legislation of the 1930's that erected the barriers between the securities and banking industries. Supporters of the Gonzalez-Dingell agreement also referred frequently to the 1982 legislation that deregulated the savings and loan industry, a move that many asserted led to an estimated $500 billion bailout of the industry over the next 40 years.
"This is an historic moment," said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who helped forge the Gonzalez-Dingell agreement. "We don't want to tie the hands of the bankers. We want to make them competitive. But we don't want to repeat the mistakes of the 1980's."
Administration officials and banking lobbyists had fought for the motion to strike the provision, which received the support of 187 Democrats, 28 Republicans and the House's sole independent, Bernard Sanders of Vermont, and was opposed by 70 Democrats and 130 Republicans
 
Gingrich Criticizes Foley
 Visibly angered, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the second-ranking Republican in the House, said after the vote that Republicans had been tricked by House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington. Mr. Foley, he asserted, told them that the Gonzalez-Dingell compromise would fail, and so they agreed to vote to permit the debate.
A spokesman for Mr. Foley said the Speaker had made no representations.
The vote to permit the debate had the support of eight Republicans, and passed by a bare 210 to 208.
Separately, the House overwhelmingly rejected a proposal by Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, to create a "core banking" system. The proposal, which was defeated by a vote of 312 to 106, would have imposed limits on the interest rates that banks and savings institutions could pay and on the amount they could lend to a single borrower. In exchange, the institutions would be permitted to lend money in affiliated companies that could not make use of insured deposits.

HEADLINE: Mayor Wants To Freeze Tax On Property

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins wants to freeze New York City property taxes for at least two years -- and perhaps four if he can win support from the City Council and Albany for a mix of new fees to finance garbage collection or bridge maintenance, senior mayoral aides said yesterday.
But City Hall officials said the Mayor had not yet made a final decision, as he prepares his four-year plan for keeping the budget balanced, due next Wednesday. They said the plan would also call for cutting the city work force by a total of 25,000 jobs by 1995 and would count on nearly $1 billion in aid from a state takeover of Medicaid costs, roughly twice what Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has proposed to provide in that period. 
 The plan would freeze wages of city workers through next June, as previously announced, and perhaps for another year as well, while calling for a range of unspecified productivity increases to make workers more efficient, officials said. The Mayor would not cut his ambitious plans for police hiring, aides said.
 
Early Retirement Program
 The 25,000 jobs to be cut would include the thousands already eliminated from the 247,000 on the city payroll of last November. In September, the head count stood at 234,121 workers, but that number is expected to rise by 5,000 to 6,000 before shrinking again because of new hiring required in the wake of an early retirement program for senior teachers in the Board of Education.
Some senior mayoral aides still question the wisdom of a tax freeze, and even the idea's supporters said that shifting revenue or cost projections might yet make a freeze impossible but that the Mayor strongly favored it. Mr. Dinkins is struggling to close estimated budget gaps of more than $1 billion in each of the next three fiscal years, and of perhaps $250 million in the current year, which ends on June 30.
"It depends on everything falling into place," one senior aide said.
But that will be difficult since many of the proposals would require the approval not only of the Council but also of the State Legislature and the Governor at a time when economic prospects remain cloudy, Mr. Cuomo's Presidential plans are uncertain and the municipal unions are resistant to backing City Hall without assurances of no further layoffs or potential wage rewards.
In one sense, by freezing taxes, Mr. Dinkins would simply be acknowledging political realities. The City Council has vowed to bitterly resist further tax increases in the wake of two years of record increases, and leading business groups have urged a four-year freeze on all taxes. And Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, has urged a two-year freeze as one condition that might persuade him to provide a $1 billion aid package, some of which the city might use in lieu of tax increases.
 
A Broad Commitment
 But mayoral aides said Mr. Dinkins also hoped to build public support for his plan by making a broad commitment to stabilize the city's economic base in a recession. In the fiscal crisis of the mid 70's, the city froze real estate taxes for four years.
The Mayor also hopes a freeze might gain him leverage for the politically difficult idea of creating "trust funds" or new public authorities to finance trash pickups or bridge repairs through tolls, auto-use fees or residential user fees for garbage collection.
For months, a mayoral task force of business and labor leaders has studied the idea of charging tolls on the 13 East River and Harlem River bridges that are now free, to raise hundreds of millions of dollars. This week, the panel split on the issue, with business members supporting the tolls and labor leaders opposing them, so now city officials are considering raising auto registration fees, other auto user fees or gasoline taxes that could be segregated to maintain bridges.
Proposals to charge residents for garbage pickups have met resistance because fees would hit poor residents worst. But city officials have studied granting income tax credits to lessen the impact for low-income people. "We want to try to have a plan that everybody says is discussable," one senior mayoral aide said. "Some past ideas have been dismissed as D.O.A., but now it's time to stop writing the obits."
 
Meeting With Vallone
 Mr. Dinkins met with Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone on Wednesday, seeking to form a unified front for approaching the State Legislature and the Governor. Albany would have power over many of the city's proposals, from imposing the new fees or tolls to passing and accelerating Governor Cuomo's proposal to have the state assume the city's Medicaid costs in exchange for the city's surrendering some of its taxing authority.
"It was a very encouraging, upbeat meeting and it's clear we're talking the same things now: tax freeze, downsizing and a cooperative front," Mr. Vallone said yesterday. "I really very much would like to have a sensible agreement where we could stand side by side, which would be wonderful, good for the city and good for the state."
In the past, Mr. Vallone, who is from Astoria, Queens, has looked askance at creating an authority to maintain the bridges, especially if it involved tolls. He has also raised concerns about charging fees for garbage collection since it is considered one of the most basic municipal services in New York, though other cities charge for it, and commercial establishments here must already pay private haulers to take their trash away. But he stressed yesterday that the only thing he had flatly ruled out was further tax increases.
While Mr. Dinkins's hopes for the tax freeze involve the property tax, his aides said they did not expect that his plan would propose increases in any other taxes, either. But they noted that to speed the pace of the state's takeover of Medicaid costs, they might eventually have to propose some increases in the personal income tax to help finance that in the coming years.
Mr. Vallone said it was "too early to talk about anything like that."

HEADLINE: Pentagon May Give Moscow $1 Billion

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
In a novel effort to accommodate a changing world, the Pentagon is nearing agreement with Congress to transfer up to $1 billion from its budget to give the Soviet Union food and medical aid and help convert Soviet military industries into civilian projects, senior Bush Administration and Congressional officials say.
The plan, which has the support of the White House and Congressional leaders, would be incorporated in the $291 billion 1992 Pentagon budget nearing final approval in Congress. 
 Seeking to justify the use of tax money that might otherwise be diverted to American domestic needs, the plan's architects, including the Democratic chairmen of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, contend that the investment would increase American security by helping prevent further instability in the Soviet Union.
 
'Potential for Chaos'
 "We're talking about the potential for chaos in a country with 30,000 nuclear weapons," said Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. "It's clearly in our interest not to allow food and medicine shortages to trigger some kind of unrest."
In a challenge to the Soviet aid proposal, however, some Republican Senators held up final approval of the conference committee report tonight, demanding that cuts in American military spending be directed to domestic concerns.
Senator Daniel R. Coates of Indiana said after a meeting of the Armed Services Committee that a "significant number of people" on the committee are demanding more time to consider the plan, which he called "potentially volatile."
"We're closing down military bases and shutting down our defense industries here, and there are people out of work, and we're providing a billion dollars of assistance across the ocean," he said.
But Senate leaders predicted a momentary impasse would not undermine the plan.
Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood and a delegation of American business leaders are currently in the Soviet Union examining the prospects for converting Soviet military industries to the manufacture of badly needed consumer goods.
It is unclear how the gesture of tapping the Pentagon budget for Soviet aid may influence the debate over whether to make deep cuts in American military spending because of the collapse of Communism and the diminished Soviet military threat.
Pentagon aid to the Soviet Union would be separate from and in addition to other public and private American assistance currently under consideration, including increased agricultural loan guarantees and direct food aid this winter. The total amount of proposed Pentagon aid has not been determined, the officials said.
When the idea was first suggested by Mr. Aspin in August after the unsuccessful hard-line coup in Moscow, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney dismissed it as "foolish" and "a serious mistake" that could damage United States security.
Under gentle prodding from the White House, though, Mr. Cheney is now ready to relent on the condition that the Pentagon has authority to make the necessary budget cuts and to decide how the money will be spent on the Soviets, Administration officials said.
The Soviet aid package is the brainchild of the two influential leaders of the Armed Services Committees, Mr. Aspin and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. For the last several weeks, the two men have worked with their staffs and quietly with key Administration officials to draft a proposal acceptable to Congress and the Pentagon.
The lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on the plan, which is included in the military budget bill that House and Senate negotiators are expected to complete in the next few days.
The full House and Senate are expected to approve the compromise bill, which then goes to President Bush. Administration officials said the plan would not violate last year's budget agreement because the Soviet aid would come out of the Pentagon's budget. No Pentagon money could be devoted to domestic programs this year without reopening the budget agreement, a very unlikely possibility.
Lawmakers have suggested that the Pentagon consider a number of steps to assist the Soviet Union, including using Air Force planes to transport food and medical aid to the Soviet people this winter and to provide other help in distributing the aid.
Lawmakers have also suggested offering economic incentives to private American companies that do business with the Pentagon to invest in the Soviet Union, creating a panel of American experts to help speed American investment in converting Soviet military industries into commercial companies, and developing a United States-Soviet program to destroy nuclear and chemical weapons and clean up environmental pollution resulting from military activities.
Senator Nunn also said it was urgent to "get out in front of the explosion of technical and scientific knowledge" in the Soviet Union to prevent economic turmoil that could create a demand in potentially hostile developing countries for the thousands of Soviet technical experts.
Mr. Aspin said that the assistance program could be patterned after the Army's successful relief operation to supply food, medicine and other supplies to thousands of Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq after the Persian Gulf war. In that operation, the Army provided nearly 2,700 tons of bulk food, 200,000 gallons of drinking water and 212,000 blankets to the Kurds.
Arkady Volsky, the deputy director of the committee running the Soviet economy, has said that even optimistic forecasts put unemployment at 2 million people next year in a Soviet military-industrial complex that currently employs 7.8 million workers at 2,500 factories.
Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan said on Wednesday that the Soviets have asked the United States for $2.5 billion in credit guarantees to purchase American farm products and an additional $1 billion in food and medical aid, but that a United States response was still in the works.

HEADLINE: THE MIDDLE EAST TALKS;
3 Speeches: The Area Is 'a Dangerous Battleground' - The Syrians 'Have Never Carried the Banner of War'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from speeches delivered yesterday at the Middle East peace conference by the Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir; the leader of the Palestinian delegation, Haidar Abdel-Shafi, and the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa. Mr. Shamir's speech was recorded by Reuters. The Associated Press recorded the speech by Mr. Abdel-Shafi, who spoke mainly in English. Mr. Sharaa's remarks were translated from the Arabic by the conference's organizers and provided by The A.P.
 
YITZHAK SHAMIR
 It is an honor to represent the people of Israel at this historic moment and a privilege to address this opening of peace talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
I would like to express our profound appreciation to our Spanish hosts for their hospitality, and for making this gathering for peace possible. In its 2,000 years of wandering, the Jewish people paused here for several hundred years until they were expelled 500 years ago. It was in Spain that the great Jewish poet and philosopher, Yehuda Halevi, expressed the yearning for Zion of all Jews, in the words, "My heart is in the East, while I am in the uttermost West."
I would also like to extend our appreciation to the co-sponsors of this conference -- to the U.S., which has maintained a strong friendship with Israel in an alliance that has overcome occasional differences. And to the Soviet Union, which saved the lives of many Jews during the Second World War and has now opened its gates to the repatriation of Jews to their ancient homeland.
The people of Israel look to this palace with great anticipation and expectation. We pray that this meeting will mark the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the Middle East, that it will signal the end of hostility, violence, terror and war. That it will bring dialogue, accommodation, coexistence and, above all, peace.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
To appreciate the meaning of peace for the people of Israel, one has to view today's Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel against the background of our history. Jews have been persecuted throughout the ages in almost every continent. Some countries barely tolerated us, others oppressed, tortured, slaughtered and exiled us. This century saw the Nazi regime set out to exterminate us. The Shoah, the Holocaust, the catastrophic genocide of unprecedented proportions which destroyed a third of our people, became possible because no one defended us. Being homeless, we were also defenseless.
But it was not the Holocaust which made the world community recognize our rightful claim to the Land of Israel. In fact, the rebirth of the state of Israel so soon after the Holocaust has made the world forget that our claim is immemorial. We are the only people who have lived in the Land of Israel without interruption for nearly 4,000 years. We are the only people, except for a short crusader kingdom, who have had an independent sovereignty in this land. We are the only people for whom Jerusalem has been a capital. We are the only people whose sacred places are only in the land of Israel.

 	 	 		. . .	 	No nation has expressed its bond with its land with as much intensity and consistency as we have. For millennia our people repeated at every occasion the cry of the psalmist,: "If I forget thee, Jerusalem, may my right hand lose its cunning!." For millennia we have encouraged each other with the greeting, "Nnext year in Jerusalem.!" For millennia our prayers, literature and folklore have expressed powerful longing to return to our land. Only Eretz Israel, the Land of Israel, is our true homeland. Any other country, no matter how hospitable, is still a diaspora, a temporary station on the way home.
To others, it was not an attractive land. No one wanted it. Mark Twain described it only a hundred years ago as "a desolate country, which sits in sackcloth and ashes, a silent mournful expanse, which not even imagination can grace with the pomp of life."
The Zionist movement gave political expression to our claim to the Land of Israel. And in 1922 the League of Nations recognized the justice of this claim. It understood the compelling historic imperative of establishing a Jewish homeland in the Land of Israel. The United Nations Organization reaffirmed this recognition after the Second World War.
Regrettably the Arab leaders, whose friendship we wanted most, opposed a Jewish state in the region. With a few distinguished exceptions, they claimed that the Land of Israel is part of the Arab domain that stretches from the Atlantic to the Persian Gulf.
In defiance of international will and legality, the Arab regimes attempted to overrun and destroy the Jewish state even before it was born. The Arab spokesman at the U.N. declared that the establishment of a Jewish state would cause a bloodbath which would make the slaughters of Ghengis Khan pale into insignificance.
In its declaration of independence on May 15, 1948, Israel stretched out its hand in peace to its Arab neighbors, calling for an end to war and bloodshed. In response, seven Arab states invaded Israel. The U.N. resolution that partitioned the country was thus violated and effectively annulled.
The U.N. did not create Israel. The Jewish state came into being because the tiny Jewish community, in what was Mandatory Palestine, rebelled against foreign imperialist rule. We did not conquer a foreign land. We repulsed the Arab onslaught, prevented Israel's annihilation, declared its independence and established a viable state and government institutions within a very short time. After their attack on Israel failed, the Arab regimes continued their fight against Israel with boycott, blockade, terrorism and outright war. Soon after the establishment of Israel, they turned against the Jewish communities in Arab countries. A wave of oppression, expropriation and expulsion caused a mass exodus of some 800,000 Jews from lands they had inhabited from before the rise of Islam.
 
Distortion of History
 Most of these Jewish refugees, stripped of their considerable possessions, came to Israel. They were welcomed by the Jewish state. They were given shelter and support, and they were integrated into Israeli society together with half a million survivors of the European Holocaust.
The Arab regimes' rejection of Israel's existence in the Middle East and the continuous war they have waged against it are part of history. There have been attempts to rewrite this history, which depict the Arabs as victims and Israel as the aggressor. Like attempts to deny the Holocaust, they will fail. With the demise of totalitarian regimes in most of the world, this perversion of history will disappear.
In their war against Israel's existence, the Arab governments took advantage of the cold war. They enlisted the military, economic and political support of the Communist world against Israel, and they turned a local, regional conflict into an international powder keg. This caused the Middle East to be flooded with arms, which fuelled wars and turned the area into a dangerous battleground and a testing arena for sophisticated weapons. At the U.N., the Arab states mustered the support of other Muslim countries and the Soviet bloc. Together they had an automatic majority for countless resolutions that perverted history, paraded fiction as fact and made a travesty of the U.N. and its charter.
Arab hostility to Israel has also brought tragic human suffering to the Arab people. Tens of thousands have been killed and wounded. Hundreds of thousands of Arabs who lived in Mandatory Palestine were encouraged by their own leaders to flee from their homes. Their suffering is a blot on humanity. No decent person, least of all a Jew of this era, can be oblivious to this suffering.
Several hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs live in slums known as refugee camps in Gaza, Judea and Samaria. Attempts by Israel to rehabilitate and house them have been defeated by Arab objections. Nor has their fate been any better in Arab states. Unlike the Jewish refugees who came to Israel from Arab countries, most Arab refugees were neither welcomed nor integrated by their hosts. Only the kingdom of Jordan awarded them citizenship. Their plight has been used as a political weapon against Israel.
The Arabs who have chosen to remain in Israel -- Christian and Muslim -- have become full-fledged citizens enjoying equal rights and representation in the legislature, in the judiciary and in all walks of life.
We, who over the centuries were denied access to our holy places, respect the religion of all faiths in our country. Our law guarantees freedom of worship and protects the holy places of every religion. . . .
I stand before you today in yet another quest for peace, not only on behalf of the State of Israel, but in the name of the entire Jewish people, that has maintained an unbreakable bond with the Land of Israel for almost 4,000 years.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We have always believed that only direct, bilateral talks can bring peace. We have agreed to precede such talks with this ceremonial conference, but we hope that Arab consent to direct, bilateral talks indicates an understanding that there is no other way to peace. In the Middle East, this has special meaning, because such talks imply mutual acceptance, and the root cause of the conflict is the Arab refusal to recognize the legitimacy of the State of Israel.
The multilateral talks that would accompany the bilateral negotiations are a vital component in the process. In these talks, the essential ingredients of coexistence and regional cooperation will be discussed. There cannot be genuine peace in our region unless these regional issues are addressed and resolved.
We believe the goal of the bilateral negotiations is to sign peace treaties between Israel and its neighbors, and to reach an agreement on interim self-government arrangements with the Palestinian Arabs.
But nothing can be achieved without good will. I appeal to the Arab leaders, those who are here and those who have not yet joined the process: Show us and the world that you accept Israel's existence. Demonstrate your readiness to accept Israel as a permanent entity in the region. Let the people in our region hear you speak in the language of reconciliation, coexistence and peace with Israel.
 
Renouncing the Uprising
 In Israel there is an almost total consensus for the need for peace. We only differ on the best ways to achieve it. In most Arab countries the opposite seems to be true: the only differences are over the ways to push Israel into a defenseless position and, ultimately, to destruction. We would like to see in your countries an end to poisonous preachings against Israel. We would like to see an indication of the kind of hunger for peace which characterizes Israeli society.
We appeal to you to renounce the Jihad against Israel. We appeal to you to denounce the P.L.O. covenant which calls for Israel's destruction. We appeal to you to condemn declarations that call for Israel's annihilation, like the one issued by the rejectionist conference in Teheran last week. We appeal to you to let Jews, who wish to leave your countries, go.
And we address a call to the Palestinian Arabs: renounce violence and terrorism, use the universities in the administered territories -- whose existence was made possible only by Israel -- for learning and development, not agitation and violence, stop exposing your children to danger by sending them to throw bombs and stones at soldiers and civilians.
Just two days ago, we were reminded that Palestinian terrorism is still rampant when a mother of seven children and a father of four were slaughtered in cold blood. We cannot remain indifferent and be expected to talk with people involved in such repulsive activities.
We appeal to you to shun dictators like Saddam Hussein who aim to destroy Israel, stop the brutal torture and murder of those who do not agree with you, allow us, and the world community, to build decent housing for the people who now live in refugee camps. Above all, we hope you finally realize that you could have been at this table long ago, soon after the Camp David accords were first concluded, had you chosen dialogue instead of violence, coexistence instead of terrorism.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We know our partners to the negotiations will make territorial demands on Israel. But, as an examination of the conflict's long history makes clear, its nature is not territorial. It raged well before Israel acquired Judea, Samaria, Gaza and the Golan in a defensive war. There was no hint of recognition of Israel before the war in 1967, when the territories in question were not under Israeli control.
We are a nation of four million. The Arab nations from the Atlantic to the gulf number 170 million. We control only 28,000 square kilometers. The Arabs possess a land mass of 14 million square kilometers. The issue is not territory but our existence.
It will be regrettable if the talks focus primarily and exclusively on territory. It is the quickest way to an impasse. What we need, first and foremost, is the building of confidence, the removal of the danger of confrontation and the development of relations in as many spheres as possible.
 
Site of Talks
 The issues are complex, and the negotiations will be lengthy and difficult. We submit that the best venue for the talks is in our region, in close proximity to the decision makers, not in a foreign land. We invite our partners to this process to come to Israel for the first round of talks. On our part, we are ready to go to Jordan, to Lebanon and to Syria for the same purpose. There is no better way to make peace than to talk in each other's home. . . .
For many hundreds of years, wars, deep antagonisms and terrible suffering cursed this continent on which we meet. The nations of Europe saw the rise of dictators and their defeat after lengthy and painful struggles. Now, they are together -- former bitter enemies -- in a united community. They are discussing the good of the community, cooperating in all matters, acting almost as one unit. I envy them. I would like to see such a community rise in the Middle East. And I believe that, despite all differences between us, we should be able, gradually, to build a united regional community.
Today it is a dream, but we have seen, in our own lifetime, some of the most fantastic dreams become reality. Today, the gulf separating the two sides is still too wide, the Arab hostility to Israel too deep, the lack of trust too immense, to permit a dramatic, quick solution. But, we must start on the long road to reconciliation with this first step in the peace process.
 
HAIDAR ABDEL-SHAFI
 Once again, Christian, Muslim and Jew face the challenge of heralding a new era enshrined in global values of democracy, human rights, justice and security. From Madrid, we launch this quest for peace, a quest to place the sanctity of human life at the center of our world and to redirect our energies and resources from the pursuit of mutual destruction to the pursuit of long prosperity, progress and happiness.
We, the people of Palestine, stand before you in the fullness of our pain, our pride, and our anticipation for we have long harbored a yearning for peace and a dream of justice and freedom. For too long, the Palestinian people have gone unheeded, silenced and denied, our identity negated by political expediency, our rightful struggle against injustice maligned, and our present existence subsumed by the past tragedy of another people.
For the greater part of this century, we have been victimized by the myth of a land without the people and described with impunity as the invisible Palestinians. Before such willful blindness, we refused to disappear or to accept a distorted identity. Our intifada is a testimony to our perseverence and the resilience waged in a just struggle to regain our rights.
It is time for us to narrate our own story, to stand witness as advocates of a truth which has long lain buried in the consciousness and conscience of the world. We do not stand before you as supplicants, but, rather, as the torchbearers who knew that in our world of today ignorance can never be an excuse. We seek neither an admission of guilt after the fact nor vengeance for past inequities, but, rather, an act of will that would make a just peace a reality. . . .
The co-sponsors have invited us here today to present our case and to reach out to the others with whom we have had to face a mutually exclusive reality on the land of Palestine. But even in the invitation to this peace conference, our narrative was distorted and our truth only partially acknowledged.
Palestinian people are one fused by centuries of history in Palestine, bound together by a collective memory of shared sorrows and joys and sharing a unity of purpose and vision. Our songs and ballads, our . . . children's stories, the dialect of our joys, of our jokes, the image of our poems, . . . which colors even our happiest moments, are as important to us as the blood ties which link our families and clans.
Yet, an invitation to discuss peace, the peace we all desire and need, comes to only a portion of our people. It ignores our national, historical and organic unity. We come here wrenched from our sisters and brothers in anxiety to stand before you as the Palestinians under occupation, although we maintain that each of us represents the rights and interests of the whole.
We have been denied the right to publicly acknowledge our loyalty to our leadership and system of government, but allegiance and loyalty cannot be censored or severed.
Our acknowledged leadership is more than just the democratically chosen leadership of all the Palestinian people. It is the symbol of our national unity and identity, the guardian of our past, the protector of our present and the hope of our future.
 
Brutality of Occupation
 Our people have chosen to entrust it with their history and the preservation of our precious legacy. This leadership has been clearly and unequivocally recognized by the community of nations with only a few exceptions, who had chosen for so many years shadow over substance.
The governance of the nation and conditions of our oppression, whether the disposition and dispersion of exile or the brutality and repression of the occupation -- the Palestinian people cannot be torn asunder. They remain united, a nation, wherever they are or are forced to be. In Jerusalem, ladies and gentlemen, the city which is not only the soul of Palestine but the cradle of free-world religions is tangible, even in its claimed absence from our midst at this stage. Its apparent, though artificial, exclusion from this conference is a denial of its right to seek peace and redemption for it, too, has suffered through more an occupation.
Jerusalem, the city of peace, has been barred from the peace conference and deprived of its calling. Palestinian Jerusalem, the capital of our homeland and future state, defines Palestinian existence past, present and future, but itself has been denied a voice and an identity. Jerusalem defies exclusive possessiveness or bondage. Israel's annexation of Arab Jerusalem remains most clearly illegal in the eyes of the world community and an affront to the peace that this city deserves.
We come to you from a tortured land and a proud, though captive, people, having been asked to negotiate with our occupiers, but leaving behind the children of the intifada and the people under occupation and under curfew, who enjoyed us not to surrender or forget. As we speak, thousands of our brothers and sisters are languishing in Israeli prisons and detention camps, most detained without evidence, charge or trial, many cruelly mistreated and tortured in interrogation, guilty only of seeking freedom or daring to defy the occupation. We speak in their name, and we say, "Set them free."
. . . As we speak, the eyes of thousands of Palestinian refugees, deportees, and displaced persons since 1967 are haunting us for exile as a cruel fate. Bring them home. They have the right to return. As we speak, the silence of demolished homes echoes through the halls and in our minds.
We must rebuild our homes and our free state. And what do we tell the loved ones of those killed by army bullets? How do we answer the questions and the fear in our children's eyes for one out of three Palestinian children under occupation has been killed, injured or detained in the past four years?
How can we explain to our children that they are denied education or schools so often closed by the army . . . or why their life is in danger for raising a flag in the land where even children are killed or jailed? What requiem can be sung for trees uprooted by army bulldozers? And, most of all, who can explain to those whose lands are confiscated and free waters stolen?
. . . Remove the barbed wire, restore the land and its life-giving water. The settlements must stop now. Peace cannot be waged while Palestinian land is confiscated in myriad ways and the status of the occupied territories is being decided each day by Israeli bulldozers and barbed wire.
This is not simply a position. It is an irrefutable reality. Territory for peace is a travesty when territory for illegal settlement is official Israeli policy and practice. Settlements must stop now.
 
Equal Partnership
 In the name of the Palestinian people, we wish to directly address the Israeli people, with whom we have had a prolonged exchange of pain. Let us share hope, instead. We are willing to live side by side on the land and the promise of the future.
Sharing, however, requires two partners willing to share as equals. Mutuality and reciprocity requires -- must replace domination and hostility for genuine reconciliation and coexistence under international legality. Your security and ours are mutually dependent, as entwined as the fears and nightmares of our children.
We have seen some of you at your best and at your worst, for the occupier can hide no secrets from the occupied, and we are witness to the toll that occupation has exacted from you and yours. We have seen you anguish over the transformation of your sons and daughters into instruments of a blind and violent occupation, and we are sure that at no time did you envisage such a role for the children whom you thought would forge your future. We have seen you look back in deepest sorrow at the tragedy of your past and look on in horror at the disfigurement of the victim turned oppressor. Not for this have you nurtured your hopes, dreams and your offspring.

 	 	 		. . .	 	To the co-sponsors and participants in this occasion of awe and challenge, we pledge our commitment to the principle of justice, peace, and reconciliation, based on international legitimacy and uniform standards. . . . We shall pursue our people's right to self-determination, to the exhilaration of freedom and to the warmth of the sun as a nation among equals.
This is the moment of truth. You must have the courage to recognize it and the will to implement it, for our truth can no longer be hidden away in the dark recesses of inadvertency or neglect. People of Palestine look at you with straightforward, word-for-word, direct gaze, seeking to touch your heart, for you have dared to stir up hopes that cannot be abandoned.
You cannot afford to let us down, for we have lived up to the values you espoused and we have remained true to our cause. We, the Palestinian people, made the imaginative leap in the Palestine National Council of November 1988, during which the Palestine Liberation Organization launched its peace initiative based on Security Council Resolution 242 and 338 and declared Palestinian independence based on Resolution 181 of the United Nations, which gave birth to two states in 1948, Israel and Palestine.
 
Mutual Recognition
 In December 1988, a historic speech before the United Nations in Geneva led directly to the launching of the Palestinian-American dialogue. Ever since then, our people have responded positively to every serious peace initiative and has done its utmost to insure the success of this process.
Instead, on the other hand -- Israel, on the other hand, has placed many obstacles and barriers in the path of peace to negate the very -- the validity of the process. Its illegal and frenzied settlement activity is the most glaring evidence of its rejectionism, the latest settlement being erected just two days ago.
These historic decisions of the Palestine National Council wrenched the course of history from inevitable confrontation and conflict toward peace and mutual recognition. With our own hands and in an act of sheer will, we have molded the shape of the future of our people. Our parliament has articulated the message of the people, with the courage to say yes to the challenge of history, just as it provided a reference in its resolutions last month in Algiers and in the Central Council meeting this month in Tunis to go forward to this historic conference. We cannot be made to bear the brunt of other people's no. We must have reciprocity. We must have peace.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Our homeland has never ceased to exist in our minds and hearts, but it has to exist as a state on all the territories occupied by Israel in the war of 1967, with Arab Jerusalem as its capital in the context of that city's special status and its nonexclusive character.
This state, in a conditional emergence, has already been a subject of anticipation for too long. It should take place today, rather than tomorrow. However, we are willing to accept the proposal for a transitional state, provided interim arrangements are not transformed into permanent status. The time frame must be condensed to respond to the dispossessed Palestinians' urgent need for sanctuary and to the occupied Palestinians' right to gain relief from oppression and to win recognition of their authentic will.
During this phase, international protection for our people is most urgently needed, and the -- the dual application of the Fourth Geneva Convention is a necessary condition. . . . Bilateral negotiations on the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the dissolution of Israeli administration, and the transfer of authority to the Palestinian people cannot proceed under coercion or threat in the current asymmetry of power. Israel must demonstrate its willingness to negotiate in good faith by immediately halting all settlement activity and land confiscation while implementing meaningful confidence-building measures.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We are here today with the support of our people, who have given itself the right to hope and to make a stand for peace. We must recognize as well that some of our people harbor serious doubts and skepticism about this process.
Within our democratic social and political structures, we have evolved a respect for pluralism and diversity and we shall guard the opposition's right to differ within the parameters of mutual respect and national unity. . . . The process launched here must lead us to the light at the end of the tunnel. And this light is the promise of a new Palestine -- free, democratic, and respectful of human rights and the integrity of nature.
Self-determination, ladies and gentlemen, can neither be granted nor withheld at the will of the political self-interests of others. For it is enshrined in all international charters and humanitarian law. We claim this right. We firmly assert it here before you and in the eyes of the rest of the world.
For it is a sacred and inviolable right which we shall relentlessly pursue and exercise with dedication and self-confidence and pride. Let's end . . . this unnatural condition of occupation, which has already claimed too many lives.
No dream of expansion or glory can justify the taking of a single life. Set us free to re-engage as neighbors and as equals on our holy land. To our people in exile and under occupation who have sent us to this appointment, laden with their trust, love and aspirations, we say that the load is heavy and the task is great, but we shall be true.
In the words of our great national poet, Mahmoud Darwish, "My homeland is not a suitcase and I am no traveler."
To the exiled and the occupied, we say you shall return and you shall remain and we will prevail, for our cause is just. We will put on our embroidered robes and kaffiyehs and in the sight of the world and celebrate together on the day of liberation.
Refugee camps are not fit for people who had been reared on the land of Palestine in the warmth of the sun and freedom. The hail of Israeli bombs almost daily pouring down on our defenseless civilian population in the refugee camps of Lebanon is no substitute for the healing rain of the homeland. Yet the international will had insured their return in United Nations Resolution 194, a fact willfully ignored and unenacted.
Similarly, all other resolutions pertinent to the Palestinian question, beginning with Resolution 181 through Resolutions 242 and 338, and ending with Security Council Resolution 681, have until now been relegated to the domain of public debate rather than real implementation. They form the larger body of legality, including all relevant provisions of international law within which any peaceful settlement must proceed.
 
FAROUK AL-SHARAA
 The peoples of the entire world and not only the peoples of our region are buffeted by conflicting feelings toward this conference, feelings fluctuating between success and failure, between optimism in achieving peace and the pessimism of a regression to conflict and confrontation.
It is no exaggeration to state that the continuing intransigent Israeli position which is bereft of any justification is the one that places the world on the brink of incalculable dangers and prevents the region from enjoying peace.
The Arabs throughout their long history have always advocated peace, justice and tolerance. Their history, both ancient and modern, abounds with evidence to that effect. The Jews and oriental Jews in particular know better than anyone that they have lived among Muslim Arabs throughout history, wherever they happen to coexist, without ever suffering any form of persecution or discrimination, either racial or religious.
Rather, they have always lived in grace and dignity, participating in all walks of life. The Jews have never known a level of security, tolerance and equality approximating the security, tolerance and equality they have enjoyed in the lands of Arabs and Muslims.
Anyone perusing the pages of history today would realize the blatant contrast between this tolerance and full equality with which the Arabs treated the Jews for hundreds of years on the one hand, and the persecution, injustice and discrimination inflicted on the Arabs and particularly Palestinian Arabs languishing on the Israeli occupation on the other.
Suffice it to recall if only such a reminder were heeded, that had Israel's political orientation since 1948 been humane, millions of Arabs, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese would not have been uprooted from their homes nor -- nor would they have been denied, until today, their right to return. Had Israel's policies not been settler-colonialist, Palestinians languishing in the Israeli occupation since 1967 would not have been denied all their fundamental rights, foremost among which is their right to self-determination. . . .
The list of evidence of inhumane Israeli practices is long and well documented. These are practices which were condemned by dozens of resolutions adopted by the United Nations. These are practices of which the Israelis are tacitly cognizant themselves. They are known to many a fair-minded historian and journalist in the West. Although some do not dare address these practices frankly and unequivocally, for reasons which are, regrettably, not known to wide sections of European and U.S. public opinion. First, among these reasons is that Jewish extremists, both inside and outside Israel, harass those writers and journalists and jeopardize their livelihoods and future.
If they happen to be Christian, they're accused of being anti-Semitic, but if they are Arabs and Muslim, it is easiest to accuse them without any evidence whatsoever of terrorism and the intention of destroying Israel.
 
Usurping Aggressors
 Contrary to every law known, the burden of proof in the minds of these extremists is incumbent on the accused. Thus, the innocent becomes a suspect in the eyes of a large sector of Western public opinion. The aggressors who have usurped the land of others by force, thus, become the advocates of peace. Whereas, the victims of aggression, who demand the return of their occupied land and their usurped rights, become terrorists and destructive warmongers.
Distinguished co-chairmen, we have never carried the banner of war and destruction. Syria has consistently called for the achievement of comprehensive and just peace on the basis of United Nations resolutions. We have always emphasized our sincere intention and serious desire for peace.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Peace and the usurpation of the land of others cannot coexist. For peace to be stable and durable, it must encompass all parties to the conflict on all fronts. Developments in our region have proved this fact. Israel exploited the signing of its peace with Egypt in 1979 to then proceed to annexing Jerusalem in 1980, the Golan in 1981 and invading Lebanon in 1982. It is clear that Israel perpetrated this series of aggressive acts at a pace that exceeds the pace of its withdrawal from the Egyptian Sinai.
In the aftermath of each act of aggression, the Security Council was called upon to convene and resolutions were unanimously adopted: Resolution 476, declaring the annexation of Jerusalem as null and void, Resolution 497, declaring the imposition of Israeli laws in the Golan as being null and void and with no international legal validity, and Resolution 425, calling for unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
However, as was the case with Resolutions 242 and 338, these resolutions were not implemented at the time, due to Israel rejection and intransigence and due to the atmosphere of the cold war between East and West. . . .
It is noteworthy to point out in this context the Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, on the basis of which the peace conference is being convened, were adopted as a compromise between the permanent member states of the Security Council. As is well known, the majority of those states have been sympathetic to Israel since its creation.
Hence, the implementation of these two resolutions should not be the subject of new bargaining during bilateral negotiations. Rather, they should be implemented in all provisions and on all fronts. Resolution 242 emphasizes in its preamble the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war.
This means that every inch of Arab land occupied by the Israelis by war and force, the Golan, the West Bank, Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, must be returned in their entirety to their legitimate owners.
International public opinion is aware more than ever before, and especially following the gulf crisis, that double standards are no longer acceptable in this age, that the principles of international law, not the law of the jungle, must be respected and that United Nations resolutions, not brute force, must be applied.
 
Uprooting of Syrians
 At last, the states of the world have also come to realize that Israel alone resists the efforts for peace with all the influence it can muster. It is Israel which perpetuates its occupation of the territories of others by force. All have come to realize that Israel follows a futile and obsolete ideology based on annexation, the building of settlements and the uprooting of Arabs from land in which they had lived for centuries in order to replace them with new immigrants who have never lived in this region.
In this regard, Syria would like to remind the co-sponsors of the conference and through them the international community that Israeli occupation of Syrian and Palestinian territories has resulted in uprooting approximately half a million Syrian citizens from the Golan who have to date not been able to return. The occupation has also resulted in the presence of over a quarter-million Palestinian refugees in Syria who are denied the right to return to the homeland of their fathers and forbears in Palestine.
The claims invoked by Israel for the migration of world Jewry to it at the expense of the native Arab population are not sanctioned by any legal or humanitarian principle. If the entire world were to adopt such claims, it would have to encourage all Christians to emigrate to the Vatican and all Muslims to emigrate to Holy Mecca.

 	 	 		. . .	 	In order for a just peace to be established, no Arab land must remain under Israeli occupation, nor can the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination remain denied. If the objective is truly for the peoples and the states of the region to co-exist, to enjoy security, peace and prosperity, to place their plentiful energies and resources at the service of their . . . development, how can such a desirable objective logically be realized without eliminating occupation and restoring legitimate rights?

 	 	 		. . .	 	This firm Syrian position, whose every element is anchored in the principles of international legitimacy and the resolutions of the United Nations -- that position deems it imperative for Israel to withdraw from every inch of the occupied Syrian Golan, the West Bank, Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the south of Lebanon.
This position also deems it imperative to safeguard the legitimate, political and national rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among which is their right to self-determination. The building of settlements in the occupied Arab territories is an illegal action. It is considered null and void, and it stands as a major obstacle in the way of peace.
Thus, it is imperative that the settlements be removed. The continuation of settlement activity in the Arab-occupied territories, particularly since the peace process has commenced, is tangible evidence that Israel does not want to reach genuine peace.

HEADLINE: Storm's Huge Waves Make Hurricane Seem Tame on Massachusetts Coast

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINOT, Mass., Oct. 31

 BODY:
Peter Montgomery knew the storm was bad when he looked out his window Wednesday and saw waves breaking over the top of Minot's Light, a 100-foot-tall stone lighthouse that is a landmark of the Massachusetts coast.
The old gray shingled house where Mr. Montgomery lives, a mile from the lighthouse on a spit of land that juts out into Massachusetts Bay, was also being pounded by the raging northeaster. "Every time a wave hit the building, you could feel it -- va boom! -- the whole house shook," said Mr. Montgomery, a caretaker for a group of summer residents. 
 Mr. Montgomery and his wife wanted to evacuate, but when he stepped out the back door, a wave came crashing over the top of the three-story building, sending him scurrying back inside. By his calculation, the wave must have been at least 50 feet above the normalhigh-tide mark.
As he discovered this morning, he would not have gotten far anyway. The only road through the village of Minot, part of the town of Scituate, 20 miles southeast of Boston, was torn to shreds, with yawning 10-foot-deep holes, utility poles tilted at crazy angles and, in some places, new stretches of sand and rock where pavement had been until recently.
 
Compared With '78 Blizzard
 For Mr. Montgomery and thousands of other residents along the Massachusetts coast, the storm seemed far worse than the hurricane last August, and possibly as bad as the blizzard of 1978, officially the worst storm ever to hit the area.
"I think when this is all totaled up, the damage will surpass the '78 storm," said Joe Manley, the Chief of police and a 25-year resident of Nahant, a peninsula that sticks out into Massachusetts Bay north of Boston. With waves surging over much of the Nahant peninsula, the authorities evacuated about 300 people Wednesday. A causeway connecting Nahant to the mainland was closed, stranding people at both ends.
What made the storm, which originated Monday off the coast of Nova Scotia, more terrifying was that few people expected it to be so severe. "When Mother Nature strikes, people often don't want to believe it or don't want it to interfere with their lives," Mr. Manley said.
Mark Docurral, an unemployed engineer, was in the Harbor View restaurant in Scituate Wednesday evening as the ocean invaded it, leaving it three feet deep in water. Outside, a lobster boat floated past on Front Street, after it had broken loose from its mooring.
"A fisherman jumped in and tried to start the engine, but it just crashed into two stores," Mr. Docurral said. The scene along the waterfront was made more even bizarre as the power lines sparked, creating a blue background in the heavy rain and winds of up to 75 miles per hour, he said.
The police in Scituate said today that as many as 100 homes there might have been destroyed.
In Minot this morning, state policemen and members of the state National Guard, called out as part of a declaration of emergency by Gov. William F. Weld, were stopping curiosity seekers from driving close to the ocean.
 
Differences Over Toll
 Because the damage was caused almost entirely by the force of the waves which built up over two days, rather than by high winds, comparing the amount of damage with that from Hurricane Bob last summer is a problematic exercise, specialists said.
Doug Forbes, the director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, estimated that the total damage left by Hurricane Bob was about $1 billion. "I don't think we'll approach the $1 billion figure with this storm," he said.
But Donna Nelson, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross in Boston, said today, "This makes Hurricane Bob look like nothing."
But there was no dispute about the severity of the storm from residents along the coast, from Gloucester in the north to Cape Cod in the south. In Gloucester, two antique cars floated in the harbor after their garage was swept into the ocean. Several large houses were left as little more than debris.
 
Families Flooded Out
 In Swampscott, a working-class community on the shore north of Boston, many businesses were flooded out after waves broke through sea walls.
In Hull, another long peninsula south of Boston, 80 percent of the town was isolated by the rising ocean, and about half the residents were without electricity, said Joseph Murphy, the town manager. A number of houses were splintered by the waves, he said. Statewide, at least 1,500 people spent the night in emergency shelters, officials said.
Parts of Cape Cod were among the hardest-hit areas, especially those facing east and north along the outer Cape from Chatham at the elbow to Provincetown at the tip. "There are some places on the outer Cape where the beach is completely gone," said Tony Bonanno, the chief ranger at the Cape Cod National Seashore.
 
Surprise Lobster Dinner
 On Nantucket Island, just south of the Cape, a number of residential areas remained under three to four feet of water today, and several stores were flattened by the pounding waves.
In Minot, Mr. Montgomery consoled himself with the spectacular view from the third floor of his house, watching the waves build higher and higher. As the winds eased and the tide went out, sending the waves off his lawn, he went out for a walk. There on the lawn, he found four lobsters in pots that had been swept ashore.
Although he was without electricity, telephone service and running water, he cooked up the lobsters on a gas stove. "I made them with a garlic sauce and linguine," he said. "It was a great candlelight dinner."

HEADLINE: Democrats Agree on Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
Spurred by a demand for quick action by President Bush, Congressional Democrats have agreed on a new plan to pay extended unemployment benefits to people out of work at least half a year, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said tonight.
The plan, which Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, said he could support because it paid for itself, may end three months of partisan wrangling over helping about three million long-term unemployed people. 
 Today's agreement was prompted by a move by the President, who has killed two earlier versions of the bill, to complain of the "politics being played" on the issue and urge quick action. Democrats have scored heavily on Mr. Bush's opposition in recent months, but at leadership meetings today they worried over the risk that the President and other Republicans might now blunt their advantage if they delayed.
Mr. Bush's sudden aggressive backing of action on jobless benefits appeared to reflect political concern that the issue was cutting against him. While his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today that the President had supported benefits since "Day 1," as recently as mid-September the Office of Management and Budget asserted that extra unemployment benefits merely "increase the unemployment rate," suggesting that the jobless preferred more benefits to getting jobs.
But today the disagreement was among the Democrats, who spent the day arguing over how to pay for the benefits.
 
Mitchell Opposes Plan
 For the second consecutive day George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, held out against other Democrats who wanted to pay for a major part of the bill's cost by speeding up collections from some high-income taxpayers. He told them he wanted to pay for it by cutting foreign aid.
But in an interview tonight Mr. Foley said Senator Mitchell "is with us" on the estimated tax approach, conceived by Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee. "He has no problem with the Bentsen bill," the Speaker said of Mr. Mitchell.
Telephone calls to the Senator's office produced no response.
Mr. Mitchell's backing may have been produced by a decision by Mr. Foley and Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to go ahead and introduce the bill in the House on Friday, with or without the Senate majority leader's support.
Mr. Bush asserted today that he had been for extended benefits all along so long as they did not "bust the budget agreement." He added, "I get a little annoyed at the politics being played at the expense of people that do not have the benefits and need them."
It was this charge and the expectation that further Democratic delay would give it resonance, a House source said, that persuaded Mr. Foley and Mr. Rostenkowski to go ahead and introduce a bill on Friday.
 
20 Weeks of Extra Benefits
 The measure would provide up to 20 weeks of extra benefits in states hit hardest by the recession, and cover everyone still out of work who had exhausted his or her benefits since March.
Out of its $5.7 billion cost, $3.2 billion would come from a provision requiring high-income taxpayers who expect sharp earnings increases to compute their estimated tax on the basis of what they expect to earn. Under current law, they are allowed to pay on the basis of what they earned the previous year. This would enable the Government to collect a portion of future years' taxes a year ahead of the present schedule.
Another $1.7 billion would be raised by extending to 1996 a program under which the Internal Revenue Service deducts unpaid student loans from tax refund checks. And $900 million would be raised by another 1996 tax extension, a two-tenths of 1 percent surcharge on the taxes employers pay for unemployment insurance. Although the money would not come into the Treasury this year, under budget act accounting rules it would be counted as if it did.
The measure appeared to meet the conditions Mr. Bush laid out in a carefully organized discussion with reporters and lawmakers before meeting with Republican leaders.
He said he wanted a program that was temporary, not permanent, and this one would expire next July. He also said he wanted a measure that did not violate the budget agreement, and one that did not raise taxes. Because this bill extends existing taxes and provides for faster collection, it could be defended as not raising taxes.

HEADLINE: Crime Rate Could Claim Longtime Houston Mayor

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
After leading this city through a decade marked by a spectacular economic boom and an equally spectacular bust, Mayor Kathryn J. Whitmire is trying to persuade voters that she can deal with the commonplace problems like street crime.
In a nonpartisan election Tuesday, Mrs. Whitmire faces her toughest challenge since she was elected Mayor of the nation's fourth-largest city in 1981. With two strong contenders running against her, a runoff election may be necessary. 
 The two challengers -- Bob Lanier, a wealthy land developer, and State Representative Sylvester Turner, who is trying to become the city's first black mayor -- have portrayed her as a tired incumbent who has grown ineffective.
They have relentlessly blamed her for a rising crime rate that has fostered an atmosphere of fear throughout the city even though Houston has had more crimes at other times in recent history and its problems even now are less severe than those of other major cities.
 
'Stuck in the Middle'
 Recent public opinion polls indicate that Mr. Lanier is gathering strength among middle-class white voters and that Mr. Turner is attracting blacks.
"For the first time in her career Whitmire is losing ground as a campaign closes," said Richard Murray, a professor of political science at the University of Houston who has done extensive polling on the race. "She faces two challengers who are working two different constituencies that do not overlap. This leaves her stuck in the middle having to contest 100 percent of the electorate."
In a survey made public last week by a local television station, KPRC-TV, 32 percent of the 400 respondents favored Mr. Lanier, 23 percent chose Mrs. Whitmire and 12 percent picked Mr. Turner. The margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
Mrs. Whitmire, a 45-year-old accountant, was first elected mayor as an outsider who had demonstrated her independence and efficiency as the city controller. Houston's oil boom was then nearing its peak, and a coalition of black voters and moderate whites rallied around her as a counterbalance to the city's powerful business interests.
 
Anti-Incumbent Fever
 By the time she first sought re-election in 1983 oil prices had crashed and property values were spiraling to a 30 percent drop. She presented herself as the cool crisis manager who could keep the city going even as its tax base seemed to be vanishing. Mrs. Whitmire used the same appeal to win successive two-year terms, and even in her last campaign in 1989, when the city's recovery was well under way, she ran as the heroine of the hard times.
This year she tried the same approach in seeking a sixth term, advertising herself as "Houston's Champion." But she quickly ran into voters who are infected with the anti-incumbent fever that has presented itself around the country and who are also in a near frenzy over the crime issue.
Public anger began to rise last year over the early release of hundreds of inmates from county and state prisons that operate under longstanding Federal court orders prohibiting jail overcrowding. Then, several murders and armed robberies in the past six months were highly publicized because they occurred in affluent white neighborhoods rarely touched by violent crime.
 
Police at the Center
 Mr. Lanier, 66, and Mr. Turner, 37, have focused their campaigns almost exclusively on proposals to add police officers to a force whose ranks were depleted during the lean years of the oil bust. When hiring was halted in 1986, the department had 4,500 officers and staff, and even though hiring was resumed in 1989, it is still only at 4,100.
Mrs. Whitmire responded with plans of her own, but she has appeared to be on the defensive even as the Police Department hurriedly unveiled programs to increase overtime work and to round up parole violators.
Striking out at her opponents, Mrs. Whitmire called them "latter day converts to crime" in a televised debate last month. Mr. Turner responded: "I'm not late on fighting crime. The reason why I am running is the Mayor is late."
The tone of the campaign turned even more acid recently as Mrs. Whitmire highlighted reports by The Houston Chronicle showing that land investments owned by Mr. Lanier had increased in value as a result of decisions he made while sitting on the state highway commission and the city's mass transit board.
 
Could All Be for Nought
 Even if she wins re-election, Mrs. Whitmire might instantly become a lame duck, because public opinion polls show overwhelming support for a term limitation referendum on Tuesday's ballot. If adopted, it would prohibit any city official who has served two terms from seeking re-election.
Deepening the uncertainty are lawsuits brought against the city by the Justice Department and by local Hispanic groups contending that the city's election districts discriminate against Hispanic voters.
Only one of the 14 members of the City Council is of Hispanic descent, even though Hispanic people make up 28 percent of the city's population of 1.7 million people.
Until Tuesday night the candidates faced the possibility that the election might be postponed, but then in separate actions Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court and a special three-member panel of district and circuit Federal judges sitting in Houston refused emergency requests for a delay.
No final decisions have been made on the merits of the cases.
Dallas will also have municipal elections Tuesday, and the vote there will be the first under a new redistricting plan that was the result of a long Federal court battle over minority representation. Public opinion polls in the nonpartisan mayor's race indicate that former United States Representative Steve Bartlett holds a substantial lead in a field of six candidates.

HEADLINE: TV Ads and Attacks Increase In Pennsylvania Senate Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 31

 BODY:
As Pennsylvania's Senate race moves into the home stretch, the candidates are increasing their television advertising, expanding into radio advertising and stepping up their attacks on each other.
Dick Thornburgh campaigned in Pittsburgh, talking about his ideas for creating jobs while his new television advertisement was playing all over the state. 
 "While my opponent was Governor Casey's Secretary of Labor and Industry, the number of people out of work increased by 100,000," he said.
And echoing his new television advertisement, the former Attorney General added that 500,000 new jobs were created while he had been Governor from 1979 to 1987. Neither Mr. Thornburgh, nor his advertisement mentioned that about 400,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in Mr. Thornburgh's administration or that unemployment almost reached 15 percent at the height of the 1982 recession in his first term.
 
Democratic Opponent
 His Democratic opponent, Harris Wofford, campaigned in Philadelphia today, where more than one-quarter of the state's 2.8-million registered Democrats live. He visited the Northeast Older Adults Center, a large recreation complex for the elderly in northeast Philadelphia. Politicians pay special attention to the elderly in this state, where one in five people is over the age of 60, and one in three voters is over 60.
Mr. Wofford addressed a crowd of about 120 people about skyrocketing health-care costs and the need for national health insurance. And he attacked Mr. Thornburgh's record on issues concerning the elderly. In particular, he said Mr. Thornburgh was taking credit for a benefit program that he had once opposed.
"Dick Thornburgh opposed the Pace program," Mr. Wofford said, referring to the Pharmaceutical Assistance for the Elderly. It is a state program that provides a $6 subsidy for every prescription drug purchase made by 373,000 Pennsylvanians, who are over 65 years old and have incomes below $16,200. "He fought against it and then tried to lower its benefits before it was passed and then he takes credit for it."
 
Signed Program Into Law
 The state lottery, which was set up to support elderly programs like Pace, reimburses elderly residents for about $225 million worth of medication a year.
The Thornburgh campaign maintains that Mr. Thornburgh can claim credit for the program because he signed it into law in 1983.
It turns out that the man who first proposed the program was a Democrat and one of Mr. Thornburgh's former political opponents, James Lloyd, a state Senator. Mr. Lloyd first proposed the program in his campaign for lieutenant governor on the 1982 Democratic gubernatorial ticket against Mr. Thornburgh, who was seeking re-election.
Mr. Thornburgh won the election and subsequently objected to the proposed program because of its cost; but he ultimately signed a compromise bill when it became clear that his veto would be overridden by Democrats and Republicans in the General Assembly.

HEADLINE: THE MIDDLE EAST TALKS;
MIDEAST FOES LIST DEMANDS AND TRADE ANGRY CHARGES ACROSS CONFERENCE TABLE

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID, Oct. 31

 BODY:
In salvos of intransigent oratory, Israel and its Arab neighbors said today that they all hoped to end the bloodshed in their region, but disagreed about almost everything else -- who was at fault, what to do about it, even where further peace talks should be held.
On a day when the Palestinians at last found their place at a major Middle East peace conference, the Arabs demanded that Israel stop creating settlements in occupied territories and give up territory it had taken from Arabs in 1967. The Israelis in turn demanded that the Arabs recognize Israel's right to exist. 
 Each accused the other of deception, brutality, treachery and aggression, exactly as they have done for most of the 43 years that they have been at each other's throats.
 
Both Sides Listen
 But for the first time, representatives of much of the Arab world listened across the same table to an Israeli leader denouncing them, remaining in their chairs throughout, and the Israeli leader, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, listened to their replies. He stayed put even though the Palestinian delegates identified themselves in so many words with the Palestine Liberation Organization, something the Israelis had said could prompt them to walk out.
In one especially heated passage, Farouk al-Sharaa, the Syrian Foreign Minister, accused Mr. Shamir of "faking facts and history." [Excerpts from speeches, pages A10 and A11.]
In reply, at a later news conference, Benjamin Netanyahu, an Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister, accused the Arabs of complicity with Hitler, Himmler, Ribbentrop and Eichmann in planning the Holocaust, and said Syria had spoken in terms of "vituperation, slander and condescension."
 
Less Rigidity Expected
 "These are just their opening statements, maximalist bargaining positions," a senior American official said. "A lot of it is for television and the political audiences back home. People will start to soften their ideological rigidity once face-to-face negotiations get under way."
But other top-level Americans who have worked for months to bring Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians together in Madrid expressed disappointment at what one called the "truculent tone" of today's speeches. None could point to any overt sign that the participants were ready to yield ground in the private, direct talks scheduled to start Sunday.
Indeed, it was unclear when, where and even whether those talks would begin. The Israelis and the Arabs remained deadlocked tonight, despite mediation efforts by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, over Mr. Shamir's demand that they be held in the Middle East, with a first round in Israel. The Arabs insisted that the plan had always been to negotiate in Madrid and argued that they would be recognizing Israel, in effect, by going there.
There was even some doubt expressed that the single organizational session that everyone had agreed to for Sunday at the Royal Palace in Madrid would go forward as planned.
The Palestinians said explicitly for the first time that they would accept limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip as an interim stop on the way to statehood. In accepting the terms of invitation to the conference, they had implictly said the same thing, but some saw an incremental step forward.
Israel accepts the idea of limited autonomy, which it had agreed to in the 1978 Camp David agreement with Egypt and the United States, but rejects the idea of Palestinian sovereignty. Nonetheless, there has been very tentative talk among the Palestinian delegates and others here in the last 48 hours of some form of eventual confederation, possibly economic, possibly economic and political, involving Jordan, Israel and some sort of Palestinian entity.
 
Jordan Faults Radicals
 There was also a small conciliatory note from Jordan. Its delegate urged both sides to work for "the dawn of a new era" and pointedly called on Arab radicals to shed their rigid ideologies.
So the initial two days of the conference here, the first of which was dominated by speeches by Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, have developed into a microcosm of the Middle East, marked by hopeful words from the great powers, hateful words from the countries of the region and fragile theorizing about what might be. So far, Madrid has been spared the physical violence that has long disfigured the eastern end of the Mediterranean.
The mood inside the 18th-century conference hall, with its marble columns and pilasters, its glittering chandeliers and immense Renaissance tapestries, was somber and businesslike. There was little applause after the day's five speeches, ranging in length from 30 to the full 45 minutes allowed.
Mr. Shamir opened this morning's session with a blunt warning that Arabs would lead negotiations into an impasse if they proceeded immediately to demand the return of the remaining land Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war -- the West Bank, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. Israel returned all of the Sinai captured from Egypt in 1967 as part of the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt.
 
Earlier Hostility Noted
 "We know our partners will make territorial demands on Israel, but an examination of the conflict's long history makes clear its nature is not territorial," Mr. Shamir said. He argued that the Arabs had been equally hostile to Israel in the years when Israel was within its original borders, after the 1948 war and the truces of the next year, and he made no mention at all of the United Nations resolutions calling upon Israel to virtually return to the pre-1967 borders.
Nor did the grim-faced Prime Minister, who spoke in English, offer any hint of a concession to the Arabs on East Jerusalem, site of Arab as well as Jewish holy places, which is now occupied by Israel, or on the rapidly expanding Israeli settlements on captured Arab land. The Palestinians fear that the settlements will soon be so extensive that there will be no room for a Palestinian state.
Mr. Bush's appeal on Tuesday for territorial compromise appeared to have left Mr. Shamir unmoved, although some Israeli doves said the Prime Minister at least had not made what one called a "not one inch" speech.
Jordan came next, and its Foreign Minister, Kamal Abu Jaber, a onetime professor of politics, opened with the same word as Mr. Shamir: "Peace." That is a traditional greeting in both Hebrew and Arabic.
 
Conquest Is Challenged
 The Jordanian delegate focused sharply on United Nations resolutions embodying the principle that land must not be acquired by force of arms.
Apparently frustrated by Mr. Shamir's hard line, Mr. Abu Jaber later demanded at a news conference, "If we can't talk about Jerusalem, if we can't talk about withdrawal, what on earth are we doing here?"
Mr. Shamir had invited the delegations to begin the face-to-face talks in Israel, remarking, "There is no better way to make peace than to talk in each other's home."
Mr. Abu Jaber replied, "The momentum in Madrid is good, the spirit in Madrid is good, and we should keep the talks here."
The Israel Ambassador to the United States, Zalman Shoval, told Reuters, "One meeting and one meeting only can take place in Madrid."
 
Arabs Insist on Madrid
 But the Syrian Foreign Minister, Mr. Sharaa, said, "The conference opened here and will continue here."
A Palestinian spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, said, "The Palestinian position is that there can be no bilateral negotiations in Israel as long as Israel occupies Palestinian territory."
It was not clear whether or not the Israelis were bluffing, but several times they threatened to break up the conference. Mr. Shamir said on the "MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour," for instance, that if the Arabs persisted in their view, "we will not have bilateral negotiations, and there will not be any continuation and there won't be any practical results."
But the day's high drama came in the appearance of the Palestinians, and the chief Palestinian negotiator, Dr. Haidar Abdel-Shafi, played the moment for all it was worth, speaking not only to those listening in person but also to a global television audience.
"We come to you from a tortured land and a proud though captive people, having been asked to negotiate with our occupiers," said the 72-year-old physician, a lean and aristocratic man who was briefly expelled from his native Gaza in 1967 by the Israelis. Looking down the plain white cloth covering the T-shaped table to Mr. Shamir, he called out, "Set them free!"
 
Arafat Is Invoked
 Dr. Abdel-Shafi all but dared the Israelis to walk out, not only invoking the name of Yasir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization leader with whom Mr. Shamir refuses to deal, but also referring to "our acknowledged leadership, clearly and unequivocally recognized by the community of nations, with only a few exceptions." The speech was reportedly approved by Mr. Arafat in telephone conversations with Dr. Abdel-Shafi Wednesday.
Mr. Shamir just sat there, now drumming his fingers, now closing his eyes. He wrote notes furiously and passed them to aides sitting behind him.
A new state of Palestine "must be born on the land of Palestine to redeem the injustice and destruction of its historical reality and to free our people from the shackles of victimization," Dr. Abdel-Shafi declared.
"The people of Palestine look at you with a straightforward, direct gaze, seeking to touch your heart, for you have dared to stir up hopes that cannot be abandoned," he said to the conference organizers. "You cannot afford to let us down, for we have lived up to the values you espouse."
For his part, the Lebanese Foreign Minister, Faris Bouez, renewed his Government's demand that Israel pull its troops out of the 400-square-mile section of Lebanon that lies along Israel's northern border, an area he compared to "a vital limb." The occupation and the fighting accompanying it "have cost Lebanon and the world dearly," the 36-year-old official said.
 
Toughest Line by Syria
 The toughest line was taken by Syria's chief delegate, Mr. Sharaa, who said it was Israel's bellicosity that had kept the Middle East at war or on the brink of it for decades. He also accused the Israeli Government of inhumane treatment of Palestinians who live in the occupied territories.
"It is no exaggeration," the minister said, according to the official translation of his Arabic text, "to state that the continuing intransigence is a position which is bereft of any justification and is the one thing that places the world on the brink of incalculable danger."
He added: "Peace and the usurpation of the land of others cannot co-exist. Every inch of Arab land occupied by the Israelis by war and force -- the Golan, the West Bank, Jerusalem -- must be returned in their entirety to their legitimate owners."
On Friday, each of the five delegations will make a rebuttal speech.

HEADLINE: Tax Increase Turns a Once-Confident New Jersey Senator Nervous

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PERTH AMBOY, N.J., Oct. 31

 BODY:
For the first time since voters in his blue-collar and traditionally rock-solid Democratic district sent him to Trenton 14 years ago, Senator Laurence S. Weiss is uncertain about his chances for re-election.
"There was a time when a Democrat couldn't lose around here, but now . . .," Mr. Weiss said, finishing the sentence with a shrug of his shoulders, during a recent day of campaigning. 
 A $2.8 billion package of tax increases last year and the seething anger it produced have shaped the legislative campaigns of both major parties and given Republicans a theme to use to try to defeat even the most powerful Democrats.
 
'I'm the Bull's Eye'
 "I'm in a targeted district," said Mr. Weiss, who is chairman of the Senate Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for drafting and approving the state budget. "But I'm not the target, I'm the bull's eye."
As Mr. Weiss and his Republican opponent, Randy Corman, have campaigned in the 19th District of northern New Jersey, each has followed a story line that has been repeated by candidates across the state.
"Voters view incumbents negatively who have supported Florio tax and economic policies," said David Welch, president of David Welch Associates of Arlington, Va., and chief media consultant for the New Jersey State Republican Committee. "We know that and the Democrats know that and that's the way most of the Republican campaigns have been framed."
Mr. Corman, a 31-year-old assistant counsel to the Senate Republicans, uses every opportunity to link Mr. Weiss with the tax issue.
"There are other planks in my platform," Mr. Corman said in an interview. "I've got a long concern and record on environmental issues. But right now, the voters are concerned with taxes and I think Larry Weiss is more vulnerable than most Democrats."
 
The Weiss Approach
 In a campaign style that has melded old-fashioned, door-to-door campaigning with a constant stream of advice from a media consultant, Mr. Weiss shares his campaign office, much of his literature and nearly all of his appearances with the two Democratic candidates for the Assembly from his district: Thomas J. Deverin, the senior member of the Assembly with 22 years in office, and Jay Ziznewski, a lawyer running for his first statewide office.
A recent day of campaigning carried the trio from a senior citizens center -- where Mr. Weiss handed out a campaign brochure emblazoned with the word "Grandpa!" and a picture of him with his 2-year-old twin grandchildren at the beach -- to three different supermarket parking lots where they passed out reams of campaign literature, none of it mentioning taxes.
At one point the handshaking was temporarily halted as a campaign aide rushed from one of the supermarkets frantically waving a shopper's newspaper. A full-page ad paid for by the campaigns of Mr. Corman and the Republican Assembly candidates, Stephen Mikulak and Ernest Oros, showed a picture of Mr. Weiss, Mr. Deverin and the Governor with the caption: "For Two Years, Florio, Weiss & Deverin Have Been Laughing All The Way To The Bank. On Nov. 5th You Can Wipe The Smile Off Their Faces."
"The Republicans feel I'm carrying a lot of heavy water," Mr. Weiss said as he stopped shoppers to shake their hands. "They can criticize me, but I hope that the people understand that our opponents don't have solution one."

HEADLINE: New Unemployment Claims Dip

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
The Labor Department reported today that new claims for unemployment benefits around the nation fell more sharply than expected in the week ended Oct. 19, but economists were divided on whether the report was a sign of strength in the economy.
Adjusting for seasonal factors, the number of Americans filing for initial unemployment benefits that week fell 47,000, to a total of 405,000. 
 Claims in the previous week had risen 29,000 to 452,000, their highest level in five months.
The department said claims in New York State dropped 3,315, claims in New Jersey fell 3,305 and claims in Connecticut declined 1,169 in the week that ended Oct. 19.
 
The Holiday Factor
 State officials who collected the data said the shortened workweek resulting from the Columbus Day holiday, on Oct. 14, explained the decline, since newly unemployed people had had fewer days to apply.
Many Wall Street analysts had anticipated a drop for that reason, but they were still surprised at the size of the decline.
"I wouldn't read too much into the numbers," said Brian Jones, an economist for Salomon Brothers. "We need a few more weeks before we can say that the economy has turned."
But Irwin Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover Trust, said the sharp decline "seems to be more than just because of the Columbus Day holiday."
 
'A Positive Sign'
 Mr. Kellner said the latest data could mean that the downward trend in new unemployment claims, which was interrupted in mid-year, had now resumed. Weekly claims had dropped to 400,000 in late June and early July but climbed thereafter.
Labor Secretary Lynn Martin said in a statement today that the new data were "a positive sign that the country's economic recovery continues to move ahead."
Regionally, the Labor Department said, California led the decline in claims, reporting a drop of 7,071, followed by Texas with 4,566 and Michigan with 4,411.
The four-week average of claims fell to 429,000, from 435,250 for the prior four weeks.

Unhappy, Senators Threaten Filibuster

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
Today, the Senate opened debate on a major energy bill. More accurately, the Senate opened debate on whether to debate the energy bill at all.
Several Senators, mostly Democrats, are so unhappy with a centerpiece of the measure -- drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- that they have pulled out the legislative weapon of last resort: the threat of a filibuster. 
 Because the bill's chief author is also a Democrat, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, the chairman of the Energy Committee, the procedure has ignited an intraparty feud. It comes at a particularly bad time. Senate Democrats have been wounded in recent weeks by their failure to derail the nomination of Justice Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court and by President Bush's success at vetoing a bill that would extend unemployment benefits.
Senator Richard H. Bryan, a Nevada Democrat who is a leader of the filibuster drive, said Senator Johnston's opponents believed they had no recourse, because Mr. Johnston would not agree to separate votes on the most disputed elements of his bill: the Arctic drilling and higher fuel efficiency standards for cars.
"It is not an obstructionist tactic," Mr. Bryan insisted. "We are trying to wrest ourselves free from the procedural straitjacket that the proponents of drilling in the Arctic Refuge have placed us in. We hope we can get their attention."
It was clear on the floor of the Senate today that the threatened filibuster did indeed generate great attention, providing many Republicans with the opportunity for impassioned speechmaking about procedural gamesmanship at the expense of the Democrats. By evening, the tone of the debate had turned cutting and personal.
"We are seeing an extraordinary situation here," declared Senator Frank H. Murkowski, an Alaska Republican. "We are debating whether this bill, a comprehensive energy bill, should even be taken up. I am absolutely appalled that my colleagues would take a position opposing the debate on an energy policy for this nation."
Chastising his colleagues for "petty jurisdictional squabbling," Mr. Murkowski went on to say: "We are like crabs walking down the beach; we are going sideways. It is absolutely incredible."
The other Alaska Republican, Senator Ted Stevens, also weighed in. "We should be having some active debate on the floor," he said, "not questioning whether we should take up a vital bill like this."
Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat and leader of the filibuster movement, took the floor in defense, saying Mr. Johnston's bill "runs roughshod over the jurisdiction of at least three committees" and "makes a mockery of the committee process and the Senate rules that none of us should tolerate."
Senator William V. Roth Jr., a Delaware Republican, also rose on the floor to lend the potential filibusterers his support, citing his concerns about the Arctic drilling.
"I do not make a habit of voting against the efforts of my colleagues on a motion to proceed to legislation," he said. "However, in this case, I have decided to make an exception."
A showdown vote is scheduled for Friday, when backers of the energy bill will seek to muster the 60 votes necessary to block the unlimited debate. Lawmakers on both sides said the vote could be close.
For decades, filibusters were largely the tool that Southern Democrats used to block passage of civil rights legislation. But now, said Donald A. Ritchie, the Senate's associate historian, Senators use them in a "freewheeling" fashion on many issues "to make it as difficult as possible for a majority to act."
In the case of the energy bill, the calendar has afforded the filibuster plotters an advantage, because lawmakers who would not ordinarily be eager to go along with scuttling a bill are more willing to do so in order to get their own legislation before the Senate.
"A filibuster at this stage, at the last month before a recess, can be very effective because there's a lot of legislation bottling up," Mr. Ritchie said. "Time is on the side of the people filibustering."
A case in point: some of the same senators decrying a filibuster today were behind the tactic last year when they wanted to sink a bill sponsored by Mr. Bryan that called for increasing auto mileage efficiency standards. The tactic worked; the measure died.

HEADLINE: Joseph Papp, Theater's Champion, Dies

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
Joseph Papp, director of the New York Shakespeare Festival and one of the most influential producers in the history of the American theater, died yesterday at his home in Greenwich Village. He was 70 years old.
He died of prostate cancer, said Richard Kornberg, his press representative. All Broadway theaters will dim their lights at 8 tonight in tribute to Mr. Papp. 
 Mr. Papp rose from a childhood in the slums of Brooklyn to found the New York Shakespeare Festival, through which he presented free Shakespeare in Central Park for more than three decades. In the 1960's, he took over the old Astor Library and turned it into the Public Theater, a huge six-theater complex in which he presented and championed the work of many young playwrights, including David Rabe, Thomas Babe, Ed Bullins, Caryl Churchill, David Hare, David Henry Hwang, Wallace Shawn, Vaclav Havel, Miguel Pinero, Ntozake Shange, Michael Weller, George C. Wolfe, David Mamet, Tina Howe and John Guare.
The Public was the birthplace of two landmark American musicals, "Hair" and "A Chorus Line," the longest-running show in Broadway history. Mr. Papp also helped build the careers of many actors, among them James Earl Jones, Meryl Streep, Raul Julia and Kevin Kline.
 
'Most Important Force'
 To many in the theater world, Mr. Papp was the most significant figure in noncommercial and institutional theater in the United States over three decades. Indeed, Bernard Jacobs, president of the Shubert Organization, Broadway's biggest theater owner, said in 1977, "Joe Papp is the most important force in the English-speaking theater today." Writing about Mr. Papp in The New York Times in September, Frank Rich called him "the only giant left in the field" and said that he had left "the New York theater an almost completely different place than he found it."
Mr. Papp took Shakespeare to the schools and to the city streets. He exercised a profound influence in bringing to the attention of the public the work of many important black, Hispanic and Asian-American playwrights and actors. He was among the first to use minority actors in major Shakespearean and other classic roles.
He had many triumphs. Three plays he produced won Pulitzer Prizes: Charles Gordone's "No Place to Be Somebody," Jason Miller's "That Championship Season" and "A Chorus Line." His plays also garnered more than 20 Tony Awards. His production of "A Chorus Line," which was directed by Michael Bennett and won a Tony as best musical in 1976, cost $1,145,000 to take to Broadway and grossed almost $150 million for his New York Shakespeare Festival. It ran from 1975 until April 28, 1990, a total of 6,137 performances.
 
Transfers, Triumphs And Disappointments
 "A Chorus Line" was a prime example of a practice in which Mr. Papp engaged often and well, one in which he was a pioneer: moving a play to Broadway from Off Broadway. In 1972, he achieved perhaps his greatest success with transferred works, winning both major Tony Awards: best play, for "Sticks and Bones," David Rabe's harrowing tale of a Vietnam War veteran, and best musical, for a tuneful version of Shakespeare's "Two Gentlemen of Verona," which starred Raul Julia and was first performed in Central Park. The next year, "That Championship Season" won the Tony for best play.
But Mr. Papp also had his share of failures and detractors. He was an outspoken public figure, and his statements were rarely intended to be diplomatic. He was quick to anger at those with whom he disagreed, or who disagreed with him. He was assailed on one hand as too avant-garde, and on the other as too commercial.
Perhaps his biggest defeat was at Lincoln Center. He ran its theater company from 1973 to 1977, when he abruptly decided to give up the job, uncomfortable with the institutional and financial strictures that came along with the post.
In recent years, many critics sensed a decline in the quality of the Public's output; at his death, he was in the middle of an ambitious project that has received mixed critical reaction, a cycle of all of Shakespeare's plays.
In May 1990, weakened by illness and seeking to attract new audiences and to infuse what he termed "fresh creative blood," he made major changes in his theater's artistic structure. In August, he named JoAnne Akalaitis, a founding member of the experimental troupe Mabou Mines, as his successor as artistic director of the Shakespeare Festival.
 
An Outsider Who Moved In
 Mr. Papp was a man of contradictions. He prided himself on being an outsider and a radical, and he was long a scathing critic of what he called "that old whore Broadway."
But as he began moving his plays uptown, and with his success of the early 1970's, from "Sticks and Bones" to "A Chorus Line," he was embraced -- and allowed himself to be embraced -- by the commercial theater.
Mr. Rich, summing up Mr. Papp's career in The Times, observed: "Paradoxically enough, he beat Broadway at its own game by reviving the lost arts of high-stakes artistic gambling and nonstop promotion that had once made the Great White Way an electrifying venue." In proving -- with shows like "Hair" -- the commercial viability of work being done by the nonprofit theater, he continued, Mr. Papp "started a complete reversal of the power equation of the New York theater."
To Mr. Papp, theater was always more than theater. "Theater is a social force," he once said, "not just an entertainment." His goal, he said, his guiding force, was to bring theater to the people and to "radicalize the environment."
He seemed to care deeply about his proteges. When one, Miguel Pinero, an ex-convict who wrote "Short Eyes," an explosive look inside prisons, was arrested, Mr. Papp went to the police station to post bail. Yet he also often fought with his writers, becoming involved in long-term disputes with Mr. Rabe and Sam Shepard.
He fought bureaucracy, unions, foundations, audiences, critics and even the City of New York. In the beginning, he successfully fought a weekly battle to obtain the money to present his park performances. Then he took on the most powerful politician in New York at the time, Robert Moses, for the right to continue his free Shakespeare performances in Central Park. He battled his playwrights, and he battled the critics.
 
Self-Made Mogul And Old-Time Showman
 One of his greatest talents was as a fund raiser, using his very public persona as a prime means of soliciting contributions. He made television commercials for the festival, affecting the swaggering stance of a self-made mogul, talking out of the side of his mouth and gesturing grandly with a cigar. He appeared in ads for the telephone company, on billboards, on the sides of telephone booths, in black tie and scarf, off for a night at the theater.
Joseph Papp was born on June 22, 1921, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn to Samuel (Shmuel) and Yetta Miritch Papirofsky. His parents spoke Yiddish, and Yosl Papirofsky, as he was named, began to learn English only when he was old enough to play in the streets and go to school.
His childhood was spent in poverty, "surrounded by terror," he once recalled. "I got beat up regularly," he said.
His father was a trunk maker. To help the family make a living, Yosl would shine shoes, pluck chickens and, with his father, sell peanuts from a pushcart. His family would move several times a year, often in the middle of the night, because they could not pay the rent.
During World War II, he served in the Navy and had his first real encounter with the stage. "I put on shows on a flattop," Mr. Papp wrote in a 1970 reminiscence.
After the war, he went to California, to the Actors' Laboratory, which included many people from the Group Theater. After two years, he became managing director of the lab, graduating in 1948. The lab, however, split apart because of political disputes: Many of his colleagues, he wrote, were members of the Communist Party.
Back in New York, Mr. Papp began working as a television stage manager for CBS. He changed his name from Papirofsky to Papp because, he said, Papirofsky was too long to fit on the television screen during the credits. In 1954, in a church on the Lower East Side, the Emmanuel Presbyterian Church, he began staging free Shakespeare.
In 1956, he received the backing of the New York City Parks Department and its commissioner, Moses, and moved his free Shakespeare to the 2,000-seat East River Park Amphitheater on the Lower East Side. The season was produced for about $20,000, a figure that eventually expanded to the $16 million it cost to keep the Public Theater afloat in 1987. (Recession cutbacks brought the budget down to $10.5 million this year.)
That first season, there were two productions, first "Julius Caesar," directed by Stuart Vaughan, which opened on June 29, 1956, and then "The Taming of the Shrew." The casts performed without pay, and included, as the shrew, the young Colleen Dewhurst.
The next year, what was becoming the New York Shakespeare Festival Company toured the five boroughs with a mobile theater, then settled in Central Park, by West 81st Street near the Belvedere Castle, on the site that would later become its permanent summer home, the Delacorte Theater.
In 1958, Mr. Papp, who had continued working for CBS, was called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. He denied that he had been a member of the Communist Party after June 1955, but he took the Fifth Amendment and declined to say anything about his activities before that date. CBS dismissed him, but he was reinstated after an arbitration ruling, the first person to be rehired by a television network after having been let go because of testimony before the House committee.
Mr. Papp had his famous battle with -- and victory over -- Moses in 1959. As Robert A. Caro tells it in "The Power Broker," his biography of Moses, it was Stuart Constable, Moses's top aide, who started the dispute while Moses was on vacation. What happened, Mr. Caro wrote, was this: Constable, who was politically very much on the right, found out about Mr. Papp's testimony -- or lack of it -- and became upset at the idea of a leftist producing Shakespeare for the masses. He decided that Mr. Papp would have to go and told the producer there would be no more Shakespeare unless the public was charged a fee. Mr. Papp refused. When Moses returned, he upheld his aide's decision.
The producer took the case to trial, and although a lower court ruled in favor of Moses, the Appellate Division decided unanimously that imposing unnecessary admission charges was "in violation of the public's parks rights." The season went on, free of charge, and the next year plans were made to construct a permanent theater near the Belvedere Castle site. The new theater, named for George T. Delacorte, who donated $150,000 toward its $400,000 cost, opened in 1962, with "The Merchant of Venice."
 
Expansion And Discoveries
 In 1966, Mr. Papp decided to expand. In a pioneering example of architectural recycling, he took over the landmark Astor Library on Lafayette Street in Lower Manhattan as his new headquarters, renaming it the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. He turned the building into a six-theater complex that showed plays and classic films. He let the sun shine in with "Hair," the prototypical rock musical for the Age of Aquarius, which went on to become a major hit on Broadway. He discovered David Rabe with "The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel."
In the mid-1970's, at the same time "A Chorus Line" was being created, Mr. Papp took over Lincoln Center Theater, while continuing at the Public and in the park. Meanwhile, "A Chorus Line" opened at the Public, moved to Broadway and became the biggest hit in Mr. Papp's career.
But at Lincoln Center attendance declined. In 1977, in his fourth and most successful season -- with productions of "The Threepenny Opera," "The Cherry Orchard" and "Agamemnon" at the Vivian Beaumont Theater and Mr. Rabe's "Streamers" at the Mitzi I. Newhouse Theater -- Mr. Papp suddenly announced that he was leaving Lincoln Center. He declared that he felt "trapped in an institutional structure both artistically and fiscally."
For the rest of the 1970's and throughout the 80's, Mr. Papp continued to produce Shakespeare and works by new playwrights, many of them dealing with social issues. Among them were plays like Larry Kramer's "Normal Heart" and Harry Kondoleon's "Zero Positive."
He also continued to transfer plays and musicals to Broadway from the Public and Central Park, sometimes successfully and sometimes not. The hit transfers included his Central Park production of "The Pirates of Penzance," which starred Linda Ronstadt and George Rose; "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," which won the Tony Award for best musical in 1986; David Hare's "Plenty," and "Cuba and His Teddy Bear," starring Robert De Niro.
Mr. Papp never hesitated in speaking out. In 1973, outraged that CBS had postponed its planned presentation of "Sticks and Bones," he denounced the network as perpetuating a "cowardly cop-out" and canceled a $7 million contract, refusing to produce the 11 more plays he had agreed to do.
Last year, outraged by obscenity restrictions imposed by Congress on recipients of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, Mr. Papp rejected endowment grants totaling $373,000 and called the restrictions "unacceptable, reprehensible and insidious."
His relationships with his writers could be volatile. Mr. Papp and Mr. Rabe did not speak for four years after Mr. Papp, the playwright said, told him that if Mr. Rabe had not become a writer he would have been a murderer. In 1981, Sam Shepard left the Public after a dispute over the handling of his play "True West" and vowed that Mr. Papp "would never see another play of mine." Mr. Papp never did.
Many playwrights and actors, however, had an abiding love and respect for him. "He speaks from the heart," Wallace Shawn once recalled. "He has a quite amazing access to his own irrational side. So you don't get an academic response from him. You always get an unexpected response, which makes you feel that the encouragement is based on something he feels."
Despite all his success, Mr. Papp lived modestly with his wife, Gail Merrifield, in an apartment three blocks from the Public. "I help make millionaires," he once said, "but I'm not a millionaire."
Mr. Papp was married four times; the first three marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by Ms. Merrifield, who is director of plays and musicals at the Public, and by four children from his first three marriages: Susan, Barbara, Michael and Miranda. Another son, Tony, died of AIDS in June at the age of 29.
There will be a private funeral service for Mr. Papp at the Public Theater today. A public memorial service will be announced.
Mr. Papp once remarked that he loved to walk through the Public just before curtain time. "It's just a matter of touching base," he said, "letting them know I'm alive, I care. When I walk through the theater, I try to make sure the public toilets are clean, the lights are on properly. It's like it's my own place, so I have a great deal of concern for how it looks." For many years, he would show up at the Delacorte at show time almost every summer evening to watch the crowds entering the theater and taking their seats.
"When the moon is out and the wind begins to whisper," he said, "it's theater at its best. You can't beat it."

HEADLINE: Challenged by Foes on Economy, Bush Wonders Whether to Answer

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
At an unusually tense meeting in the White House this morning, a frustrated President Bush received sharply conflicting recommendations from his top economic and political advisers about how the Administration should respond to the weakness of the economy on the verge of an election year.
Toward the end of his meeting with Cabinet secretaries, other senior Administration officials, political counselors and Republican Congressional leaders, according to people who were there, Mr. Bush said that he felt as if he were in the middle of a hurricane where all he could hear was noise, and he wished aloud that those around him would give him cohesive advice instead of bickering among themselves in the Cabinet Room.
 
Answering the Democrats
 The division was over political strategy, not economic policy, over whether to answer the challenge from Democrats in Congress with seemingly bold proposals or to keep on a quiet and steady economic course.
All the advisers accept the fundamental Republican principles of a lower capital gains tax and tight reins on social spending. And with the country facing a budget deficit of about $350 billion this year, cutting taxes sharply or increasing Government spending, the steps Administrations normally take when the economy looks bad in an election year, are out of the question.
The President did not tip his hand. But he was quoted as saying that Democrats were approaching economic issues as if the political campaign had begun and that the White House needed to respond in kind.
Mr. Bush, who has been heavily criticized by the Democrats for his opposition to a bill that would extend unemployment benefits for three million Americans, today accused the Democrats of holding up the bill. In response, Congressional Democrats agreed on a new version. [Page A18.]
At the meeting, Vice President Dan Quayle and Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher were said to have strenuously argued that Mr. Bush should press hard now for a lower capital gains tax and other measures, even at the risk of losing, so the public would see that the President was fully engaged in dealing with the economy.
They were reported to have quoted public opinion polls showing that most people believe the President has not paid enough attention to the economy and that the people gloomiest about the economy are those who most blame the President for the problem.
But Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, argued just as strongly that the President should sit tight for the rest of the year and not risk a battle he could not win with Congress over taxes.
Democrats have the votes in Congress, they were said to have asserted, and if the President reopens tax and spending questions, Democrats will turn it to their advantage.
The White House is not the only place in town with serious splits over the economy.
Speaking at a Capitol Hill hotel today, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, compared Mr. Bush's stewardship of the economy with that of Herbert Hoover before the Great Depression, and he said the economy needed "action not just words" from Congress.
But in his office at the Capitol, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Speaker of the House, said he did not think action on taxes and other economic issues was likely or wise this year.
 
Risk to Bush
 The chief Senate Democrat on tax issues, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee, started much of the economic debate last week with his proposal to give families a $300 tax credit for each child. His counterpart in the House, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, opposes that plan and any action on taxes this year.
Republican leaders in Congress are also divided. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia are determined to fight for lower capital gains taxes and more favorable deductions for individual retirement accounts. But two of the most respected Republican voices in Congress on economic matters, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and Representative Bill Gradison of Ohio, have argued against those proposals.
The tension in the Bush Administration and Congress reflects the consensus in political circles that the main threat to the President's re-election is the prospect of a sour economy.
This summer, Mr. Bush and his advisers felt the economy was out of the woods. The recession seemed to have ended and the country seemed to be poised for strong growth in 1992.
 
A Mysterious Relapse
 But for reasons not yet clear, the recovery stalled this fall. Some Administration economists say the forecast made in July that the economy would grow by a rather healthy 3.6 percent next year no longer looks realistic.
And Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and a strong political ally of the Administration, said in a speech at the University of Rhode Island this week that the economy was "demonstrably sluggish" and no longer had the "spark" it showed over the summer. He said he could not tell whether the slowdown would end soon or drag into next year when the political damage would be most serious.
After his meeting in the Cabinet Room, Mr. Bush spoke to a group of small-business executives who had been invited to the White House. During a photo session, the President said the economy had "turned the corner" and was "headed for recovery," but he quickly added, "I'm still concerned about the economy and that it's not as strong as obviously we'd like it to be."
Most Presidents have preferred dealing with foreign policy, where a national consensus can often be found, than economic policy, where almost all steps generate vocal opposition. But Mr. Bush has spent so much time on foreign affairs that his advisers now feel it is essential for him to be seen as coming to grips with the economy.
As a consequence, his first meeting Wednesday afternoon after he got off the plane from Madrid was with economic advisers, and on a political fund-raising trip to Texas he intends to visit a factory Friday and talk about how he plans to make the United States more competitive.
 
Last Year's Bruises
 The Bush advisers who counseled against confronting Congress over the economy had two different arguments.
Mr. Boskin, who is on leave from Stanford University, was said to have asserted that the economy would satisfactorily rebound without further action by the Bush Administration and that tax-cutting measures could lead to higher interest rates and thus be counterproductive.
Mr. Brady and Mr. Darman were said to be more concerned that the President would be badly bruised again as he was in the fight over the budget last year. Then, Democrats managed to portray Mr. Bush as a patron of fat cats who was concerned only with helping the wealthy.
Many of the scars from the budget battle remain. John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, who was criticized then for dragging the President on an unpopular course, had almost nothing to say at today's meeting. And Representative Gingrich, who was burned last year when he led the Administration charge for a capital gains tax only to have the President drop the idea, reflected some of his resentment.

HEADLINE: The Art Market;
A Crucial Auction Test: Will Prices Keep Falling?

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
THE art world is holding its breath. The outcome of the next two weeks' New York auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art will reflect the current state of what has decidedly been a precarious market.
Given declining auction prices, the big question is whether things have finally hit bottom. The auction houses are estimating that these sales will total $250 million, as compared to the $358 million brought in last year. 
 But even some auction-house officials admit it's difficult to predict the outcome with any certainty. "We're in such a period of stagnation, it's absolutely impossible to tell what's going to happen," David Nash, Sotheby's director of Impressionist and modern art, said recently.
Christopher Burge, Christie's president and chief operating officer, is more optimistic. "Economic recovery is not what we had hoped," he said, "but at the same time art of truly good quality is doing very well."
As always in a down market, this is a particularly difficult time for the auction houses to put together strong sales. The reason: private consignors who don't have to sell are, for the most part, holding on to their art until prices go up. Which means, if business remains slow, buyers may be able to cash in on bargain prices for what is on the block. (Impressionist and modern works in next week's sales will be on view at the auction houses this weekend.)
In addition, distress-sale merchandise is evident. In Sotheby's contemporary-art catalogue, for example, two lots are actually marked "property sold by order of the creditor." Christie's has one such notation. Other works in both Sotheby's Impressionist and modern-art sale and its contemporary-art sale are being offered by speculators who bought these pieces for top dollar at the recent height of the market and are now forced to sell because they are facing financial difficulties.
But some of the most important art that will be offered at both auction houses in the next two weeks is estate property. In fact, many of these pieces have been unavailable for years.
This season's sales begin at Christie's on Tuesday evening, with what experts say is one of the greatest private collections of Impressionist and modern art, from the estate of Burton and Emily Tremaine.
Christie's estimates the collection of 50 works, all fresh to the market, will bring more than $35 million. In order to lure the property away from Sotheby's, Christie's has guaranteed the family a minimum price, regardless of the sale's result. Though nobody at the auction house is talking, experts in the field say they believe the guarantee runs anywhere from about $28.5 million, or 5 percent below the sale's low estimate of $30 million, all the way up to $40 million. Both figures are reported to be significantly bigger than the guarantee Sotheby's offered the Tremaine family.
What with the delicate state of the market, and the memory of the guarantee Sotheby's extended last fall to paintings from the estate of the automobile maker Henry Ford 2d in a sale that badly misfired, this is a risky business indeed. "I don't like the principle of guarantees," Mr. Burge said. "But this is a two-horse race and we have to compete."
Burton Tremaine, an industrial-lighting executive who owned the Miller Lighting Company in Meriden, Conn., and his wife, Emily Hall Tremaine, began collecting this century's most important artists more than 60 years ago. The collection chronicles many of the major art movements from 1913 to the present. "The Tremaines put together a very personal collection, buying among the best of what was available," explained Michael Findlay, who heads Christie's department of Impressionist and modern art. "At the time they bought many of these paintings, the works were by no means the icons they are today."
Take Leger's "Petit Dejeuner," for example. A humorous depiction of three nude women set in a vivid, post-Cubist interior, it is now considered one of the artist's most important works. (This is a smaller and earlier version of "Le Grand Dejeuner," a painting that is at the Museum of Modern Art.) "Le Petit Dejeuner" has an estimated price of $8 million to $10 million. Another important piece in the Tremaine collection is "Premiere Disque" by Robert Delaunay, a circle of concentric colors painted in 1912. This is the initial work in a series now considered to be the first abstract paintings exhibited in Paris. Christie's estimates it will fetch $2 million to $3 million.
Art from the Tremaine Collection will also be the anchor of Christie's Nov. 12 sale of contemporary art. This is not the house's first sale of contemporary art belonging to the Tremaines. In 1988, after the death of Mrs. Tremaine, Christie's held an auction of some of the family's contemporary holdings that brought in $26 million, still a record for a single-owner sale of contemporary art.
This season's auction features many outstanding paintings, among them Jasper Johns's "Device Circle"of 1959. It is a boldly colored work that is the first of many in which Mr. Johns explores the theme of the circle. It is estimated to bring $5 million to $7 million. Another highlight of the Tremaine collection is Willem de Kooning's "Villa Borghese," on the block at an estimated $2.5 million to $3.5 million. "It sits on the cusp of his big landscapes," said Diane Upright, who heads the contemporary-art department at Christie's. "And it is one of his earliest East Hampton pastoral scenes."
In addition to the Tremaine paintings, the sale also features a group of smaller, less expensive works that Christie's hopes will appeal to a broader group of collectors. For example, it is offering a Robert Motherwell, "Spanish Elegy No. 17," estimated to bring $50,000 to $70,000; a Frank Stella, "Greek Key" ($45,000 to $65,000), and an Ad Reinhardt, "Blue Composition" ($40,000 to $50,000).
Sotheby's sales are aimed at attracting a wider group of buyers, too. "We chose the best paintings we thought would sell in the present market," Mr. Nash said. "But what is available is pretty haphazard." Leading its sale of Impressionist and modern art on Wednesday is a group of 15 pictures from the property of the Yaseen family of Harrison, N.Y. (Leonard Yaseen was an industrial real estate entrepreneur). Sotheby's guaranteed this group of pictures for a sum described by Mr. Nash as modest. The star picture in this group is Giorgio de Chirico's "Delights of the Poet," one of a well-known series that depicts eerily lighted, desolate piazzas. It is estimated to sell for $2.5 million to $3.5 million.
Also for sale are three works from the estate of Wendell Cherry, co-founder and president of Humana, a hospital chain. These include Fantin-Latour's "Still Life of Fruit and Flowers," estimated to sell for $1.5 million to $2 million; Degas's "Danseuse," a pastel over monotype estimated to bring $1.5 million to $2 million, and a large pen and ink drawing by Matisse, "Femme Se Reposant," with an estimate of $200,000 to $250,000.
Sotheby's sale of contemporary art, on Nov. 13, includes an important estate, too: nine works from the collection of Helmut Anton and Margot Kraetz of Germany, who formed their holdings of German, Conceptual and Minimalist artists in the late 1960's and the 1970's.
But what experts will be watching with special interest at that sale are the more than 30 lots belonging to the London-based advertising magnate Charles Saatchi. Though not identified as Mr. Saatchi's, these are works all familiar to collectors and experts in the field. Not only has Mr. Saatchi always been a visible personality in the contemporary-art world, he has also been criticized for selling large numbers of pieces by specific artists and in the process devaluing their work.
Also up for sale at Sotheby's is "Jubilee," an important black-and-white Johns marked in the catalogue "property of a Scandinavian collector, sold by order of the creditor." The Scandinavian collector is Hans Thulin, the 43-year-old Swedish real-estate magnate who was a big buyer at auctions three years ago but is now in serious financial trouble. The picture is estimated to sell for $4 million to $5 million, considered by many in the field as far less than Mr. Thulin paid for it at the height of the market.
For the auction houses, coming up with the presale estimates for the artworks during this buying climate has been difficult. While experts say the market is back to 1986-87 levels, everyone has a different opinion of what is accurate. "It's a moving target," Mr. Findlay explained. "It's difficult to know what's a realistic price. We do our homework and try to be fair, but we're working three months prior to the sales. If we put too high an estimate on a painting, it scares people away; if too low, they think something's wrong with it."
Much will depend on who's buying. "We won't see dealers bidding," Mr. Nash said. "They don't have the cash or the confidence. The Japanese are not in the mood at the moment either. And the speculators have completely disappeared."
Predictions are that private collectors will be buying as they did last spring. "I'm seeing old faces again," Mr. Findlay reported. "Serious collectors who haven't added to their collections in two or three years because they refused to pay the high prices are coming back."
Moreover, both auction houses report there has been institutional interest, something neither has seen for several seasons. So if prices stay low, some of this art will end up in museums, which will be much to everyone's benefit.

HEADLINE: Pasta Aside, Marathon Is Still Pure at Heart

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
I RUN a little; this is part boast, part confessional. Because I started all alone, 30 years ago, in combat boots, I never take personally the brie and chardonnay slurs leveled at runners by slobs. Because I dropped out to swim for 15 years, I missed the good times when running seemed political, and there was a collective joy in taking control of one's body, in believing that running could Fixx anything. Now we have the New York City Marathon on Sunday with almost 26,000 entrants running for Ronzoni and Seiko and Vermont Pure Natural Spring Water as well as for themselves. Somehow it's O.K. Perhaps this is why the Marathon is among the most beguiling of events -- beneath its dandy's clothes still beats a pure heart.
"The race itself is still pristine," says Dr. George Sheehan, the shaman of the sport. "The hype is there but you can get past it. Where you place doesn't matter. It's you and your digital watch." 
 I first met Sheehan at the Boston Marathon in 1968. He was 50, a born-again runner who had competed in college, stopped for many years to play tennis, then began running again to drain off angry energy after breaking his hand. He quickly became an Ancient Mariner, buttonholing strangers to share his wondrous revelations, his runner's highs, his intense spirituality and his uncommonly fine common sense about comfortable shoes and finding the pace and distance that fits you. He suggested to the shy that they wear ski masks when they ran.
He was a "fitness freak" then, but within 10 years his "Running and Being" (Simon and Schuster) was a best-seller, six months ahead of Jim Fixx's "The Complete Book of Running" (Random House). Sheehan now thinks that while Fixx brought millions into running, he kept many of them in the sport by validating what they were feeling.
And so, Sheehan is an accomplice, nay, an unindicted co-conspirator when Allan Steinfeld crows, as he did yesterday, that criminal imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Steinfeld, the Marathon's coordinator, was offering another benchmark of his event's success. Bad guys were selling marathon knock-off knick-knacks. Steinfeld revealed that "SWAT teams of lawyers and police officers" would be roaming the city over the weekend to seize the illegitimate shirts and hats and bags that bore the Marathon's trademarked name and logo.
But Sheehan must be held accountable, too, for the millions of personal revolutions achieved since running became the symbol for people trying to make themselves, and in a sense their worlds, better. In a shrewd essay in last May's issue of Runner's World magazine, the writer Marc Bloom listed "Smoking Outlawed on Domestic Flights" as a historical moment in the last quarter-century of running. The social change that made such legislation possible came out of the running movement, as powerful a force in its way as the struggle for black civil rights or the women's movement at those times when it was allied with the consumer movement rather than the peddling of all those jelly-roll sneakers for terminal pronation.
Which brings us to pasta, which is where the running hard sell is today. Sheehan always liked to point out that running is an inexpensive sport populated by cheap people. I used to think he was mostly talking about himself. But since carbohydrate loading became a passion as the country began to slide into recession it seemed as though running was making cheap food chic as it once made cheap shoes trendy.
And so, yesterday, Frank Shorter, who won the Olympic marathon in 1972, unveiled his new relationship with Ronzoni and offered samples of three kinds of pasta that the company, owned by the chocolate manufacturer, Hershey, was pushing as complex enough for marathoners. And over at the Coliseum, where runners were checking in, it was possible to carbo overload on at least five different kinds of pasta being offered free, along with magazines, drinks, and fittings for shoes so complex that runners need to know the sequence in which parts of their feet hit the ground.
Is this all necessary?
"Get past it," said Sheehan, who stopped running marathons six years ago when prostate cancer treatments slowed him down to nine-minute miles. "One thing that's so special about running is the realization that the competition is within oneself, that the others are there to encourage you, pace you in the struggle within yourself and against time.
"Runners don't look around at the finish, they look at their digital watches. I was in a race recently where we were specifically asked not to look down at our watches at the end because it spoils the picture."
I am still asking the man questions after all these years: "George, what does it all mean?"
"It means we are given a 75-year warranty but we need to read the book of instructions," he said. "Diet. Sleep. Moderate alcohol. No smoking. And exercise. It's all very simple, but not easy."

HEADLINE: After Madrid, Time to Dig In

BYLINE: By Richard W. Murphy; Richard W. Murphy was Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs in the Reagan Administration.

 BODY:
With the Madrid conference ending today and Arab-Israeli bilateral talks about to begin, questions about the peace process trouble Americans.
Were the parties ready for Madrid? The Arabs and Israelis probably have not fully thought out their negotiating strategies for the next stage, but it is wrong to say they went to Madrid only because we dragged them there. They went also because they are tired of decades of conflict. 
 Arabs and Israelis alike resent the fact that years of confrontation have slowed their economic, social and political development. Many Israelis are concerned about the occupation of the territories, its effect on their building a democratic Jewish state and on their country's image abroad. Besides, the ending of the cold war has removed the incentive for Washington and Moscow to develop strategic alliances in the region. This has forced the parties, perhaps the Arabs more than the Israelis, to rethink their overall strategies.
Might the American efforts that brought them together have created a dynamic that could end up harming regional stability?
To suggest that Madrid may have set a course for war is nonsense. Whatever the outcome of the bilateral talks, there is no prospect of another war for many years. The disaster Saddam Hussein's adventuring brought Iraq reminded the Arabs and Israelis that the world will not tolerate efforts to resolve the region's rivalries militarily. Nonetheless, the military buildup continues and with it the potential for another war. Syria's purchases of Czech tanks and North Korean missiles are well-known. We can fairly assume that Israel will work to maintain its edge in nonconventional and conventional weapons.
How much more effort should America invest in behalf of an elusive Middle Eastern peace?
The U.S. and the Soviet Union will complete their formal roles as co-chairmen when the Madrid ceremonies end. To join the bilateral negotiations, both countries must be invited; such an invitation may come soon. Moscow's mediating energies will be limited. Even though Moscow retains influence in the region because of its long cooperation with Syria and the Palestinians, its contribution to the talks may well be simply good will. The burden of guiding the talks to some measurable success will fall to the U.S.
President Bush will have amply fulfilled his pledge to try to work out Arab-Israeli differences by pushing to convene the conference and start the bilateral talks. While popular at home, he faces mounting criticism for neglecting domestic policy. He surely knows that even if he appoints a special envoy to the talks, he will have to devote a substantial amount of time to the negotiating process. Would he find it worthwhile?
The developments that made possible this opening for U.S. diplomacy -- the ending of the cold war and defeat of Iraq -- ironically removed any readily apparent need for Washington to pursue an elusive Arab-Israeli peace. Still, the area remains volatile, and continuation of the Arab-Israeli conflict could eventually damage our friends and economic interests.
Even if Iran is serious about its threat to liquidate Israel, this threat can be controlled. The Egyptian-Israeli peace is cold, but it is not in either party's interest to let the treaty fall apart. Saudi Arabia is secure, and Kuwait will be back in full oil production within two years.
The basic reason for our continued role as the main mediator is that we have gotten in too far to get out. We will not be able to do the whole job, but no one can substitute for us. Our withdrawal would condemn the area to deteriorating security.

HEADLINE: Senate Fought for Six Months Over Brandeis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You suggest (The Week in Review, Oct. 20) that one approach to end Presidential-senatorial bickering over Supreme Court nominees "might be to find nominees of such eminence that few people would dare oppose them -- senior politicians like governors or senators, or widely admired judges." You give Louis D. Brandeis, appointed by Woodrow Wilson in 1916, as an example. 
 Brandeis was neither office holder nor judge. He was in private practice, known to Americans as the "people's attorney." He invented Savings Bank Life Insurance as an inexpensive safeguard for workers' families.
He fought against municipal and national transportation monopolies, attacked the banks organized in what he called the "money trust," designed many of Wilson's progressive policies, advocated conservation of land and natural resources, and argued for women's suffrage, legalization of unions, unemployment insurance, old age pensions, industrial profit-sharing, and minimum wage and maximum hours laws. He did this for no salary, becoming the model for modern-day lawyers in pro bono work.
This list suggests why his confirmation was anything but assured or quiet. The Senate Judiciary Committee took more than 1,000 pages of testimony. Among Brandeis's louder opponents were Senator Henry Cabot Lodge; Elihu Root, former Secretary of War and Secretary of State; Moorfield Storey, former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and Thomas Lamont, the J. P. Morgan partner. A. Lawrence Lowell, president of Harvard, circulated an anti-Brandeis petition signed by more than 50 Boston brahmins.
He was attacked by The Wall Street Journal, The Nation and The New York Times.
Those supporting him included Walter Lippmann; Felix Frankfurter and 8 other members of the 11-man Harvard Law School faculty; Rabbi Stephen Wise; Frances Perkins, future Secretary of Labor; Charles Eliot, former Harvard president; Samuel Gompers, American Federation of Labor president; The New York World and New Republic.
Brandeis's wife had predicted that his nomination would be accompanied by a "burst of fireworks." They lasted for six months. A Judiciary Committee subcommittee voted 3-2 for the nominee. The vote of the full committee, strictly along party lines, was 10-8. He was confirmed primarily because the Democrats had a majority of more than 2-1 in the Senate.
Tumultuous battles over Supreme Court nominees are not necessarily undesirable. The Judiciary Committee and the Senate become arenas in which political differences are expressed, sometimes bitterly. Lack of disagreement may indicate only that the nominee has views that are largely unknown.
Brandeis did not appear before the committee; that was not yet the custom. It was left to other witnesses to attack and defend his character, which they did with great zest. And of course he went on to become one of the country's greatest justices.
The problem does not lie with the process. It is to be found in a committee that is unable or unwilling to ask nominees and witnesses the right questions and to insist on answers, and in a President who cynically chooses a nominee so far from the best.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Auto Spots Focus on the Road Again

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
MANY of the advertising campaigns for 1992 model automobiles are trying an even more ambitious task than selling cars during a recession: They are trying to rekindle America's love affair with the open road.
In television and radio commercials, print advertisements and billboards, auto makers like Buick, Chevrolet, Lexus, Mazda and Saturn are seeking to restore some of the excitement and "searchlights outside the showroom" glamour that typified car campaigns in the 1950's and 1960's, when Mercury offered buyers "more of everything" and Pontiac promised drivers they would be "riding high." 
 Automobile and advertising executives say that much of their advertising during the 1980's, which played down model-year unveilings in favor of no-nonsense recitations about antilock brakes and fuel economy, dampened consumers' infatuation with cars.
"Over the past few years, automobiles have become much more of a commodity purchase," George Peterson, president of the Auto Pacific Group, a marketing and product consulting company, said in a telephone interview from his office in Santa Ana, Calif. "Manufacturers were losing sight of just how emotional a purchase of an automobile is to a lot of people."
The notion that there once was such a warm relationship between car and driver is one "that our research indicates is very much missed by today's consumer," said John Yost, senior vice president and general manager of Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco, the agency for Saturn, a new car of the General Motors Corporation.
Hoping that "Saturn could be part of restoring some of that romance," Mr. Yost said, the car's television commercial features footage of old cars and an announcer waxing nostalgic.
"What was meant to be a hunk of metal to get you from point A to point B had become a refuge, almost family," the announcer says. "You had something special, almost magical. Isn't it time you felt that way again?" the spot ends.
In another throwback to a more romantic era, the sheet draped over cars in countless commercials and dramatically pulled away to reveal new models is making a comeback. Sheets, particularly those that flap in a breeze and then blow off, have been spotted in spots for Buick, Chevrolet, Ford, Lexus, Mazda and Pontiac.
"We're trying to create that sense of drama about the new product," said Mark Gjovik, executive vice president and group account director at D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, the Pontiac agency, in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. "You can always put off buying a new car," he added, "but if there's a lot of exciting new hardware at a dealer, that's worth a look."
The agency for Lexus, Team One Advertising in El Segundo, Calif., is "really pleased with the results" generated by its sheet spot, said Skip Sullivan, senior vice president and management supervisor. He added that the findings from consumer research, as well as the response from dealers, have been positive for the spot, which uses special effects to show a sheet in the shape of a Lexus LS400 that is blown off to uncover a new smaller model, the ES300.
Thomas O'Grady, president of Integrated Automotive Resources Inc., a Wayne, Pa., consulting firm, agreed that some car ads "were somewhat boring" and that it made sense "to try to bring back the fall feeling of old days."
But in the fractious advertising world, not everyone is participating. The first campaign by Wieden & Kennedy Inc., Portland, Ore., for its new client, Subaru of America, is based on the assumption that a car is "a machine," as one print ad puts it. "Let's get rid of all the marketing glamour about the automobile, and see the car for what it really is."

HEADLINE: 2d Bank Cuts Its Prime Rate

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Nov. 1

 BODY:
The Southwest Bank said today that it would lower its prime lending rate, but analysts did not expect other banks to follow suit until the Federal Reserve cut interest rates again.
Southwest said it would cut its prime rate a quarter percentage point to 7.75 percent, effective Monday. Southwest becomes the second regional bank to reduce the key rate from the 8 percent level that has prevailed in the banking industry since Sept. 13. 
 The First Fidelity Bancorporation of Lawrenceville, N.J., cut its prime rate on Wednesday to 7.75 percent.
But no leading banks have taken similar action thus far.

HEADLINE: Water Utility of a Thousand Faces

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
What a difference a decade makes.
At the dawn of the 1980's, JWP Inc. was a $40 million water utility that had lost money for eight straight years and at times teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. 
 Now, that same water supplier has metamorphosed into a $3 billion technical-services company, which instantly moved to the forefront of personal computer reselling in August when it gained control of Businessland. For JWP, it was a natural extension of its experience in installing sophisticated electrical, mechanical, electronic and pollution-control systems for high-profile corporations.
Among an eclectic list of projects, the company has created trading floors for Merrill Lynch, energy management systems for Sears, Roebuck and "clean rooms" for Hewlett-Packard's manufacturing of computer chips.
 
'Do Virtually Everything'

Just this summer, an affiliate of JWP, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., about 20 miles from Manhattan, signed a six-and-a-half-year $468 million contract to convert New York City's sludge into fertilizer pellets that will be marketed nationally.
"They'll do virtually everything but pour slab and put up walls," said David Loeb, a vice president and research analyst at Oppenheimer & Company.
The wide swath that JWP has rapidly cut through the specialty contracting fields has translated into astronomical growth; the loss of $495,000 that the company had in 1980 now seems like a faint bad dream compared with a $59.3 million profit last year.
But such rapid growth, much of it through acquisitions, has not come cheap, and JWP's debt-to-equity ratio is a steep 1.2 to 1.
 
High Receivables

Analysts say the debts are balanced by the company's high receivables, a source of cash if the company suddenly needs it.
A tougher problem has been the recession, which has hurt the equipment renovation business, maintenance contracts and computer reselling this year, analysts said.
On Thursday, the company reported third-quarter earnings of $15.3 million, or 39 cents a share, down from $16 million, or 42 cents a share. The purchase of Businessland pushed revenues up to $944.9 million, from $744.6 million.
The company's share price rose 25 cents yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, to $15.25, off its 52-week high of $23.
"It's not going to be a great year for us," said Andrew T. Dwyer, the company's chairman and president, who nonetheless expects annual profits to be up.
From Water to Computers
Still, the question remains: How could a company that continues to provide water to a quarter of Queens become the nation's largest computer reseller operating through company-owned outlets? And why would it want to?
The answers lie in a fundamental shift that the company initiated in the mid-1980's, a shift that was painstakingly orchestrated by the boyish Mr. Dwyer, who is 43 years old.
Armed with a degree in history from Yale, a law degree from New York Law School and two years of experience as a corporate lawyer, Mr. Dwyer joined the company as a vice president in 1976.
"I wasn't a very good lawyer," Mr. Dwyer said, but he was the son of JWP's chairman, Martin Dwyer Jr., who died in 1986.
JWP was born in 1877 as the Jamaica Water Supply Company, which underwent several name changes until it settled on JWP in 1986, the year its stock moved onto the Big Board.
 
Diversifying From Water

For much of its history, the company functioned primarily as a provider of water to Queens and Nassau County on Long Island. But a series of small outside ventures that the company undertook in the late 1960's -- among them lighting fixtures and prefabricated concrete -- turned sour amid the oil crisis and recession of the mid-1970's.
"It got pretty close to bankruptcy," Mr. Dwyer said.
By the late 1970's, Mr. Dwyer and Ernest W. Grendi, 45, now JWP's executive vice president and chief financial officer, began to rein in the company. After selling off JWP's money-losing ventures, sprucing up the water utility and making the overall company profitable again, Mr. Dwyer set his sights on diversification. In addition to providing services like plumbing and piping, JWP could branch out, Mr. Dwyer believed, and offer big companies, institutions and municipalities a long menu of specialty contracting services they would not ordinarily find in one place.
"We tried to identify those marketplaces where there was a need for sophisticated equipment," Mr. Dwyer said.
 
Wall Street Clients

One of the company's first targets was Wall Street, where booming securities firms found they had to retool, expand or move their offices to accommodate new technology and growing demand. JWP offered virtually everything needed to create high-technology trading floors, including the installation and maintenance of air-conditioning, wiring, telephones, data cables and computers. Salomon Brothers; Morgan Guaranty; Goldman, Sachs, and other firms have employed JWP.
Other, more diverse clients -- DuPont, Illinois Bell and Sharp Hospital in San Diego among them -- soon followed, with requests for solid-waste conversion plants, security systems and electrical networks.
As clients signed on, JWP embarked on a course of aggressive acquisitions that widened its geographic scope and expanded its services.
"The key to their success has been putting a lot of management attention into carefully developing their acquisitions," Mr. Loeb, the Oppenheimer analyst, said. "They don't overpay. They have very strict numbers regarding what an acquisition needs to contribute to JWP. And they achieve those numbers."
Forest Electric, a New York company that JWP acquired in 1986, and Dynalectric of McLean, Va., purchased in 1988, broadened JWP's electrical repertory. University Industries of San Diego, which JWP acquired in 1988, helped it gain a foothold on the West Coast and offer more extensive mechanical services. And Drake & Scull Holdings, a British electrical and mechanical company that JWP acquired in 1989, brought international exposure.
 
A Natural Step

Because JWP was increasingly called upon to set up computer systems, selling computers to its clients seemed like a natural outgrowth, said James R. Ryan, vice president of investor relations. To that end, the company in 1990 picked up Neeco Inc., a reseller of desktop computer systems based in Canton, Mass., and gained control of Businessland of San Jose, Calif., in August of this year.
The new computer unit that the company has created, JWP Businessland Inc., will have sales of about $1.8 billion worldwide, mainly in the United States, making it the largest reseller of computers operating through its own outlets. The Computerland chain has sales of about $3 billion, mainly through franchisees.
JWP now counts 21,000 employees in 195 offices, compared with 400 employees in 5 offices in 1980. Company officials and analysts swear by JWP's decentralized style of management, which allows many of the company's acquisitions to maintain their identities under the close scrutiny of the home office.
 
'They Watch Very Closely'
 "They look over the shoulder of the people who run their companies," said Carey Tharp, a senior analyst at H. G. Wellington & Company. "There's a lot of decentralization, but they watch very closely."
If JWP has a weakness, Mr. Tharp said, it is its lingering susceptibility to a sluggish economy.
"Some of the environmental business has been postponed because municipalities don't have the income," Mr. Tharp continued. "And margins on the smaller contracts on the West Coast and in the East are lower because the bidding is tougher."
"But," he added, "for a company of this nature to have flat earnings in a recession is pretty darn good."

Next Computer Inc. said it would lay off about 30 people, or 5 percent of its work force. Most of Next's 600 employees are based at the company's headquarters in Redwood City, Calif. Next also has a manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif.
Steven P. Jobs, Next's founder, chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview that the layoffs were because of a rethinking of Next's business plan that focuses more on corporate customers creating their own software programs rather than using off-the-shelf products.

Citibank Names Head Of Foreign Debt Panel

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Citibank, the largest American bank lender to Latin American countries and the leader in negotiations to reorganize those countries' debts, yesterday named Mike de Graffenried chairman of the bank's debt-restructuring committee.
Mr. de Graffenried, 42 years old, will replace Robert A. McCormack, who moved to a new position in the bank to help resolve its problems with commercial real estate loans. 
 The appointment comes as bankers, led by Citibank, are negotiating with Brazil on a package of financial options covering about $40 billion in medium- and long-term debts. Brazil has already begun to make cash interest payments that will cover about $2 billion of its $8 billion in interest arrears, with the remainder of past-due interest to be covered once the country and banks agree on a broader debt package.
Analysts expect the solution for Brazil to be somewhat similar to that worked out for other countries, where bankers have accepted a package that allows them to choose among making new loans, accepting a market rate of interest on a reduced amount of existing loans, or accepting a below-market interest rate on the existing loans. The packages also include various mixtures of United States Treasury zero-coupon bonds and financial assistance from international organizations to guarantee some principal and interest payments.
Mr. de Graffenried, who speaks Spanish and Portuguese, is no stranger to the debt talks. After the Mexican loan default in 1982, he joined the Citibank debt-restructuring team led then by William R. Rhodes, now a bank vice chairman, and was deeply involved in earlier loan agreements with Brazil and Argentina. After a tour of duty as Citibank's senior officer in the Persian Gulf region, he returned to New York and the debt-restructuring group.
"In the 1980's, there was a real sense of crisis, and living moment to moment," Mr. de Graffenried said in an interview yesterday. Currently, he said, the most heavily indebted countries are past the liquidity crises that threatened their ability to pay for imports and interest on their loans.
He noted that the economic rebound in Mexico, Chile and Venezuela, which followed internal changes and debt restructurings, could make negotiations easier "by showing other countries that there is a benefit to be derived."
What the solution will be in the cases of Brazil and Argentina, the two largest remaining debtors, remains to be seen. Mr. de Graffenried declined to comment on the current state of negotiations with Brazil. Talks with Argentina, which owes banks about $25 billion but has been making partial interest payments of $60 million a month, could begin later this year.
Mr. de Graffenried lives in Westport, Conn., with his wife, Pilar, and their 15 year-old son.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Heavy Trading On Gloomy Economic Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar plunged in heavy trading yesterday as new economic reports showing the economy has continued to decline prompted a broad selloff.
Gold prices were mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, bullion for current delivery settled at $355.60 an ounce, off $2.50 from Thursday. Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $355, down $2.70. 
 "The dollar is sitting on its lowest levels in quite a few months based on a continued, clearly weak economic picture," said John McCarthy, chief dealer at ABN-AMRO Bank N.V.
In a much-anticipated report, the Labor Department said the unemployment rate climbed one-tenth of a point to 6.8 percent in October as factory and construction workers suffered enormous layoffs.
A separate report showed the Government's chief economic forecasting gauge, which is meant to project economic activity six to nine months from now, declining for the first time in eight months.
Analysts expect the data will prompt the Federal Reserve to provide a new round of interest rate cuts in an effort to revive the sputtering economy. Such a move would be bearish for the dollar since lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors.
The dollar broke through the criticial technical and psychological support level of 1.6580 German marks, which prompted even more selling.
"With prospects of continued pressure on interest rates in the U.S. and with firm interest rates in Germany, the mark zoomed against the dollar and other major currencies," said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
Analysts said the belief that the Bank of Japan will move soon to trim interest rates there tempered the dollar's decline against the yen somewhat. But the dollar settled sharply lower against all other leading currencies.

Browning-Ferris Fills A Long-Vacant Position

 BODY:
Browning-Ferris Industries, the Houston-based waste disposal company, said yesterday that Bruce E. Ranck had been named president and chief operating officer. The posts had been vacant since John E. Drury left in January.
Mr. Ranck, 42, has spent 21 years at the company. He had been performing many of Mr. Drury's former duties as executive vice president in charge of North American solid-waste operations. 
 "Mr. Ranck's experience and knowledge will be critical to B.F.I. during this time of transition," said William D. Ruckelshaus, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is the company's chairman and chief executive.
Mr. Ranck takes over a company that has endured grim and embarassing economic news in recent months.
In September, Browning-Ferris said its fourth-quarter earnings would be down 38 cents a share from the previous quarter -- which had already been considered low. A month earlier, the chief financial officer, R. John Stanton Jr., sold 60,000 common shares, about half his holdings.
Browning-Ferris officials have attributd the company's shaky economic performance to the recession. But analysts have noted that most of its competitors were not affected by the downturn.
But Mr. Ranck sounded a positive note in a statement yesterday. "B.F.I. is a strong, solid company, with good managers at every level of its operations," he said.
Browning-Ferris's shares fell 37.5 cents each yesterday, to $17.75, just above their 52-week low, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr. Ranck received a bachelor's degree from Michigan State University in 1970. He lives in Houston with his wife and five children.

HEADLINE: Treasuries Mixed in Reaction to Jobs Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The October employment report received a mixed reception in the credit markets yesterday, as prices of shorter-term Treasury notes improved but bond prices fell.
Immediate reaction to the report was positive, as traders bought securities after the Labor Department said non-farm payrolls contracted by 1,000 jobs and the unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a point, to 6.8 percent. 
 But concern about next week's quarterly refunding auctions -- a worry compounded yesterday by a sharp drop in the dollar on foreign exchange markets -- and disappointment that the Federal Reserve Board did not immediately respond by easing monetary policy ultimately persuaded market participants to sell securities.
"There is a good deal of reluctance to buy in front of the refunding," one government bond trader said. "And while prices of shorter-term maturities are higher, there is some concern that if the Fed doesn't move again those securities may be too expensive."
At a series of auctions next week the Treasury intends to sell a total of $38 billion worth of new 3-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
Concern about the market's ability to absorb such enormous amounts of securities almost always leads traders to turn cautious beforehand.
Yesterday's sharp drop in the dollar compounded those worries, analysts said, because a weaker dollar makes it less likely that foreign investors will be interested in buying significant amounts of the new securities.
Although the Fed chose not to push short-term interest rates down for the second time this week, most analysts said the weak employment statistics make such a move very likely.
But they said they were surprised that those same factors -- new evidence of economic weakness and a likely policy response from the Fed -- did not cause bond yields to fall yesterday.
"We may be at the stage in the cycle where further Fed easing doesn't guarantee lower bond yields," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "Whatever the causes for it, bonds lost buying support when they moved to higher prices."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 102 6/32, down 1/4 of a point, to yield 7.93 percent, compared with 7.91 percent late Thursday and 8.04 percent on Oct. 25.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 25/ 32, down 3/32, to yield 7.46 percent. But prices of the 6 7/8 percent five-year notes rose by 3/32, to 100 21/32, to yield 6.71 percent. And the 6 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 22/ 32, up 1/8 of a point, to yield 5.62 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates continued to decline.
By late in the session, three-month bills were offered at a discount rtae of 4.74 percent, down 8 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 7 basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.76 percent.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 12.75 on Program Selling

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks fell in heavy trading yesterday after a late series of program trades and a weak bond market pushed prices lower. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 12.75 for the day, at 3,056.35, but it was up 51.43 for the week.
Many investors stayed on the sidelines, awaiting a cut in the discount rate after the Labor Department reported that employment had declined, contrary to expectations. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 206.5 million shares, up from 182.2 million on Thursday. Losing issues outnumbered gainers by 845 to 772.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 1.14, to 391.32, and the Big Board composite was down 0.53, to 216.01. The American Stock Exchange composite fell 0.46, to 386.85.
On the Nasdaq, the composite index was off 2.05, to 540.93, while the Russell 2000 was off 0.35, to 184.62.
 
11 Trading Programs
 Program selling emerged early. Birinyi Associates tracked "a healthy amount" of such transactions -- 11 trading programs throughout the day. Their combined effect pulled the Dow down about 29 points.
A sluggish report on jobs and a decline in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators spurred hopes that the Fed would quickly ease credit, but when it became apparent that it would not happen yesterday, stock prices fell.
Gene J. Seagle, director of technical research for Gruntal & Company, said the economic reports made the pressure being exerted by President Bush for lower rates more likely to be successful.
Another indication of a discount rate cut is the money supply, which a Federal Reserve report on Thursday showed was increasing, something it had not done in a while, Mr. Seagle added.
"A probable cut in the discount rate, plus awful returns for investors with certificates of deposit and money funds, should set the stage for a new high on the Dow, with a thrust through the 3,100 level," Mr. Seagle said. He added that the Treasury's quarterly refunding next week "could also enhance the chances of a rate cut."
Shares of American International fell 1 1/8, to 86 7/8, after the insurer reported lackluster third-quarter earnings linked to its property and casualty operations. Traders said analysts at Dean Witter and Alex. Brown lowered their 1991 and 1992 earnings estimates.
Immune Response was up 1/4, to 59 1/2. The stock had risen 6 1/8 on Thursday because of a regulatory panel meeting to discuss how to measure the effectiveness of AIDS vaccine trials. The biotechnology company, in a venture with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, is conducting clinical trials of an AIDS vaccine.
American Home Products rose 1 3/4, to 75 1/4, after Barbara Ryan, an analyst at Prudential Securities, raised her 1991 and 1992 earnings estimates. She cited the company's strong third-quarter earnings and new contraceptive and arthritis drugs.
The Food and Drug Adminstration's approval of Syntex's Ticlopidine, a product that reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal thrombotic strokes, moved the stock as high as 46 1/4 yesterday before it closed down 1/8, to 45 5/8. The stock had risen 1 3/8 the day before. Traders noted that analysts at Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney were repeating their buy ratings.
On the strength of its higher fourth-quarter earnings, Ralston Purina stock rose 2 1/8, to 52 5/8.
Technology stocks were among the most active issues yesterday, with Intel up 1 1/4, to 41 7/8, and Borland Intertnational up 2 3/8, to 69 3/4. Novell, on the other hand, lost 1 1/2, to 50 1/4, and Dell Computer fell 2 1/4, to 22 5/8.

HEADLINE: Indicators Index Falls a Tenth of 1%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
The Commerce Department reported today that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators turned down one-tenth of 1 percent in September, the first drop in eight months. It had been flat a month earlier.
The indicators are the Government's chief barometer of future economic activity and are intended to forecast the economy over six to nine months. Thus, the drop heightened fears of renewed recession. 
 "The next six months do not present a pretty picture for the economy at all," said Allen Sinai, an economist for the Boston Company. "Rather than a recovery, it's looking more like a double dip or the extension of a recession that might never have ended."
 
'Flirting With a Double Dip'

"It's clear we're flirting with a double dip," Larry Meyer of Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a St. Louis economic forecasting company, said. The indicators are "flattening out, telling us the economy has lost any sense of upward momentum," he continued, adding, "It's moving sideways."
Three consecutive declines in the index are considered a fairly good sign of an approaching recession, although the index failed to predict the last contraction. It did not start turning down until August 1990 -- the month after the recession began.
In September, 6 of the 11 forward-looking indicators in the index were negative.
And Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic counselor for DRI-McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting service, said the five components that made positive contributions did not "show any sign of strength right now."
"Over all, it's a flat environment," Mr. Chimerine said.
 
Housing, Manufacturing Weaker

Most analysts concur that the economy, after spurting last spring and summer after the Persian Gulf war, has tailed off. Both the housing and manufacturing industries, which had paced the recovery, have weakened in recent months.
Consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, remains sluggish, and today's Labor Department report on growing unemployment is not likely to stimulate any activity.
"Not only is income falling, but everyone else is worried about their jobs, and that's a devastating combination," Mr. Chimerine said.
The biggest negative in the index of leading indicators was a shrinking money supply, which the Federal Reserve watches closely as a sign of economic growth. The Fed is believed to have nudged short-term interest rates down earlier this week in an attempt to stimulate economic expansion.
 
Other Components

Other negative components were declining orders for new plants and equipment; falling prices for raw materials, which indicate slack demand; a shorter average workweek; rising claims for unemployment insurance, and lower stock prices.
Positive contributors were an increase in building permits, rising orders for consumer goods, improving consumer confidence, an increase in unfilled orders and slower delivery times, which also suggest increasing orders.
The various changes left the index at 145.4 percent of its 1982 base of 100. The index has risen 2.8 percent in the last six months, wiping out a 1.2 percent loss during the previous half-year.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Rises to 6.8%, as Economy Stalls

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Underscoring that the economic recovery has slowed to a near standstill, Labor Department figures showed today that payroll jobs failed to rise in October and that the unemployment rate edged back up to its August level of 6.8 percent.
Although the report was only modestly worse than expected, despite sharp job losses in manufacturing, retail trade and construction, economists said it added to fears that the midyear rebound had stagnated. 
 "You're just not getting any follow-through to the recovery we saw in the spring and early summer," said Edward F. McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The economy is dead in the water."
 
'Back Into Recession'
 Congressional Democrats were quick to seize on the report. Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said it indicated that the economy "is heading back into recession."
Party leaders renewed efforts to win approval of legislation to extend jobless benefits by up to 20 weeks for those who have exhausted them. House Democrats failed to get their bill past the committee stage, though, even though the Administration endorsed it hesitantly. Still, leaders of both parties said they felt a bill providing extended benefits could be passed soon. [Page 49.]
Today's employment figures also prompted the White House to make one of its strongest pleas yet for the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy again.
Mr. Bush, whose advisers are reported to be offering him conflicting advice on how to spur the economy, called for lower rates in an interview with a Houston television station. And the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with the President on a campaign fund-raising trip to Texas, said that "lower interest rates always have been a good way of stimulating the economy."
In a separate report, the Commerce Department index intended to predict the course of the economy turned negative in September, albeit by a slight one-tenth of 1 percent, the first decline since January. Spending on construction, on the other hand, posted an unexpected and sizable gain for the month.
The Federal Reserve, which earlier this week presided over a reduction in the overnight lending rate among banks, did nothing further today, but analysts continued to anticipate a cut in the discount rate and possibly other easing steps. The central bank's main policy-setting body, the Open Market Committee, meets on Tuesday to plot strategy through mid-December.
"I don't really see what's holding them back," commented Daniel Friel, economist at the NCNB Corporation in Charlotte. He said the economy had lost so much momentum that national output in the fourth quarter might show no gain at all after rising at a 2.4 percent pace in the July-September quarter. Mr. Friel said he was particularly concerned about manufacturing and construction, two sectors that typically lead the economy out of recession.
 
Factory Jobs Drop
 Factory jobs dropped 32,000 last month after a 31,000 loss in September, a combination that erased advances posted in July and August. The October decline was concentrated in durable goods, including machinery, electronic equipment, transportation equipment, instruments and primary metals.
Jobs in retail trade fell by 47,000, the biggest since April, as seasonal hiring for the holiday season by department and variety stores fell short of expectations.
And in construction, which enjoyed a small gain in September, 29,000 jobs were lost last month. The industry has now shed 10 percent of its jobs since May 1990 and the unemployment rate for construction workers has climbed over this period to 16.2 percent from about 10 percent, said Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics.
On the brighter side, however, service jobs advanced for the sixth straight month, with a 101,000 gain -- divided among health care, business and other services -- that largely offset declines elsewhere. Though there is stagnation in key sectors, said Douglas P. Handler, economist at Dun & Bradstreet, "there are pockets of strength."
Over all, payroll jobs eased by 1,000, in contrast to modest anticipated gains ranging between 15,000 and 35,000.
 
Rate for Women Rises
 According to the department's survey of households, employment fell by 198,000 last month, but because of a decline in the labor force the ranks of the jobless swelled by 140,000, to 8,582,000. The unemployment rate for adult women rose three-tenths of a point, to 5.8 percent, after declining in September, while the jobless rate for adult men was unchanged at 6.4 percent, the report also showed.
A total of 2,537,000 workers had been jobless for 15 weeks or more during the Oct. 6-12 survey week, 175,000 more than in September.

HEADLINE: House Panel Fails to Clear Benefits Bill

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
House Democrats stumbled today and failed to get their new bill for extended unemployment benefits out of the House Ways and Means Committee, even though the Bush Administration endorsed it hesitantly.
But Congressional leaders of both parties and the budget director, Richard G. Darman, said they felt a program could be agreed on early next week, and that a bill providing benefits to about three million people out of work more than half a year could be passed soon. 
 Today's disagreement in the committee, which grumbled over lack of advance notice of a Democratic leadership decision to push the $5.5 billion bill forward with a new financing mechanism, was plainly a setback to the hopes of Democratic leaders to retain a partisan advantage on the issue.
"The legislation is more complicated than we anticipated," said Representative Dan Rostenkowski Democrat of Illinois, the committee chairman, after several members from both parties had complained that they did not know how the financing would work.
Democratic leaders had hoped to finance the extra unemployment benefits in large part by speeding up payments from upper-bracket taxpayers who expected sharp earnings increases from one year to the next. Some committee members complained this would be unfair to taxpayers who did not know how their partnerships, mutual funds and other income would work out.
This was a major shift by Democrats who had twice before sought to pay for extended benefits by raising the deficit, the chief reason cited by President Bush for killing those measures. The new proposal was devised by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
 
Estimated Tax Payments

His proposal to increase estimated tax payments by many taxpayers with incomes over $50,000 would require them to estimate, and make payments on, the income they expect to earn in a given year. Under current law, they can estimate taxes based on the previous year's income if that is more advantageous to them.
Outside the committee room, several Republicans said they favored the idea. "It's just paying your taxes on time," said Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader.
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, said, "It seems to me that's not unfair."
Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas and the Senate minority leader, said on the floor that he liked the idea.
Mr. Darman, the budget director, told reporters "we were not opposed in principle to more rapid tax collection." But he said a few more days' time would be helpful to the Administration in seeing just who would be affected by the change, and to make sure it did not "accidentally hit a whole lot of people you don't want to hit."
The sharpest opposition came from Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, and President Bush's own Congressman. He said the plan was unfair to people who could not estimate their income accurately, and did not affect merely the rich, because "50 percent of the tax returns that are expected to be affected are under $200,000."
Mr. Rostenkowski said he did not know what he would do on Monday, but said he could move forward with the Bentsen plan if a few questions were answered. Reflecting the view of most party leaders on Capitol Hill, he said, "I think we ought to do something."
Mr. Darman and Lynn Martin, secretary of Labor, both chided the Democrats for seeking political advantage in quick action today. A news conference trumpeting the Democratic bill had to be canceled after Mr. Rostenkowski halted the committee meeting without action.
But Mr. Darman told reporters the Administration could offer several plans that involved modest variations on what the Democrats were proposing, and they could be worked out if the Democrats wanted.
Mr. Dole was even more insistent on the chances of an agreement. He told the Senate: "It can be done in an hour. The differences aren't that great."

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
I.R.S. Audit Rate Continues to Drop

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Although the Internal Revenue Service gets huge amounts of information on interest, dividends and other income from banks, brokers and others, the chance of a taxpayer's being subjected to an audit continues to shrink. The service managed to scrutinize only 80 individual returns in every 10,000 last year, down from 92 in 1989.
Despite the flood of Forms 1099 that curb opportunities to underreport, the I.R.S. frets about compliance. Increases in work load that have outstripped resources and the ever-greater complexity of the tax law -- amended more than 100 times since 1980 -- are two of the biggest problems, it says.
"The number of returns filed, particularly business and corporate returns, has increased, while staffing has hardly grown at all," the I.R.S. stated in its annual report. 
 Examinations last year produced recommendations for $22.3 billion in additional tax and penalties. But what the I.R.S. calls its rate of audit coverage, which was 2 percent for individual returns in 1980, continues its long decline. Last year's drop, to eight-tenths of 1 percent, was the fifth in a row since a 1985 uptick. Audits of corporate taxpayers, however, edged up last year.
The audit rate, affected by many factors, has considerable geographic variation. By region, audits per 10,000 individual returns were highest in the Southwest (108) and in the West, including Alaska and Hawaii (101). In the rest of the nation, the figure drops to between 59 and 79, while for international filers it is only 48.The number of delinquent accounts in the agency's active files grew almost 9 percent, to more than 3.5 million, although this jump was less than the 13 percent surge in delinquent accounts during 1989.
One element of the I.R.S. report, though, is relatively stable over the decades. Last year, the cost of collecting each $100 was 52 cents, the same as in 1965. In the interim, the cost ranged from 40 cents in 1969 to 56 cents in 1976.
Total revenue collected grew 4.2 percent last year, to $1.1 trillion, somewhat below the consumer inflation rate of 6.1 percent.
 
Deduction Denied

In a case that could affect artists and other taxpayers who donate works to charity, the United States Tax Court this week upheld the I.R.S. in denying The San Francisco Chronicle a $2.9 million deduction for giving its clippings library, reproduced on microfiche, to the California Historical Society.
The court held that the clippings, which dated back to the earthquake year of 1906, were not the kind of property that could be subject to capital gains and that therefore any deduction was related to the cost of producing them. But the production cost -- more than $10 million -- had been written off as annual business expenses, and so the cost basis was zero, the court held.
Judge Theodore Tannenwald Jr. said it might be that this type of material should qualify for capital-asset treatment when donated to charity but that such qualification would have to be determined by Congress.
 
Footnotes
 *Employees who pay for child care while they work are allowed to take a child-care credit on their tax returns or to take advantage of an employer-provided benefit -- dependent care accounts, in which up to $5,000 of compensation may be set aside annually on a pretax basis. But beginning with 1989 returns, it had to be one treatment or the other, not both. At nearly all income levels, workers are generally better off using dependent-care spending accounts rather than the child-care tax credit, A. Foster Higgins & Company, a benefits consultant, has calculated. Tax savings from the dependent-care account, now offered by about half the employers, are especially big if the taxpayer has only one child and expenses exceed the $2,400 limit for one dependent under the tax credit. The accounts may be used for day care, preschool tuition or other expenses in caring for a dependent of any age.
*By tightening the rules governing interest allocation for figuring foreign tax credits, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 made it less attractive for American companies with sizable overseas operations to issue debt. In response, many of these concerns relied more heavily on preferred stock, according to a study by Julie H. Collins and Douglas A. Shackelford, accounting professors at the University of North Carolina. Small or weak companies tended to be hurt most seriously by the law because of limited access to the market for preferred.

HEADLINE: New York Area Unemployment

 BODY:
Unemployment in New York City rose in October to 8.5 percent from 7.7 percent in September. This rate was considerably higher than the national rate of 6.8 percent reported yesterday.
The jobless rate also jumped somewhat in New York State to 7.2 percent from 6.8 percent and in New Jersey, to 6.8 percent from 6.2 percent. 
 "The October figures do not indicate any marked change in the unemployment situation as compared to recent months," said Jesse Benjamin, deputy regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the bureau's regional commissioner, noted that New York State's unemployment had risen from 5.5 percent in October 1990.

HEADLINE: Gloom Seems to Deepen For Allentown's Jobless

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALLENTOWN, Pa., Nov. 1

 BODY:
Shirley George survived the first three rounds of layoffs at the Unisys Corporation's branch office here. But not the fourth.
"I figured I'd get it sooner or later," said Mrs. George, 52 years old, who kept the company's records and archives. "Let's face it: Unisys is unloading a lot of people. It's going to catch up with you eventually." 
 National unemployment figures inched up another notch in October after rising steadily for the last few months. Cities like Allentown, which enjoyed a renaissance of investment and job growth only a few years ago, are feeling the pain of the sluggish economy. The downturn has refused to go away, and despite Government reports heralding the start of a recovery, albeit an anemic one, things seem to be getting worse here.
 
'A Big Dose of Reality'
 Many people laid off in recent weeks said they had thought they would make it through the recession with their jobs intact. "You think everybody's expendable but you," said John Phillips, who earlier this week lost his job as a district manager for the Pepsi-Cola Company, a position he thought was untouchable. "It's a big dose of reality. Feels very weird to be walking into an unemployment office for the first time."
The Allentown unemployment rate was hovering right at the national average of 6.8 percent in September. Yet people who have lost jobs since summer agreed, in a series of interviews, that the outlook for work had grown much bleaker in recent weeks, and they seemed to accept it grudgingly as an inevitable symptom of a regional, and national, illness.
"I know this winter's going to be very tough," said Joe Recker, 33, who last month lost his job as a production operator for the Stroh Brewery Company, where he worked for 12 years. "But the brewery has seen its sales drop. I don't like it, but I can't argue with them over it."
 
Recalculating Family Finances
 With children ages 8, 6 and 3 to worry about, Mr. Recker and his wife, Carolyn, have been recalculating their finances since he received his layoff notice. Mrs. Recker is considering a part-time job in a bridal shop to supplement her pay as a full-time day-care worker.
"It's a matter of being one of the survivors," said Brian Gimson, general manager of Ceramet, a machine parts maker that laid off 22 people out of its 150-member work force this year. "Everyone is forced to look at themselves a little harder, to see where they can pare down."
At the Allentown branch of the Pennsylvania Job Center, where those who have lost work can apply for Government benefits and sift through a computerized listing of new jobs, one of Mr. Gimson's former machinists, Cliff Mangan, pointed to a bulletin board with job postings. In August, when he first started looking at the board, he said, there were usually two or three sheets posted, but in recent weeks, he has not seen a single one. The board remained starkly empty today.
 
Data May Hide Some Jobless
 Allentown's director of community development, Don Bernhard, said that although the local economy had not changed much over the last year, he thought the number of people who had exhausted their 26 weeks of unemployment benefits was growing. "There's a growing sense that more people are out of work than the figures indicate," Mr. Bernhard said. "Those people are falling off the table." Statistics released on Thursday marked another drop in the area's overall employment, down 2,100 jobs, to a total of 318,100.
Last year, Allentown, a city of about 100,000 on the eastern edge of Pennsylvania, about 50 miles north of Philadelphia, was ranked at the very bottom of a list of 300 metropolitan areas compiled by Money magazine. The cities were judged on their desirability as places to live, based on criteria including crime, weather and pollution, housing and jobs.
Rankings aside, the sleepy town of stately, well-attended churches remains safe by urban American standards: only five murders were committed in the first half of the year, fewer than a single day's average in New York City.
Historically, the city's economic backbone consisted of heavy industry -- Mack Truck and Bethlehem Steel were among the largest employers -- until those operations scaled back, moved away and closed in the 1970's and 80's. The pop singer Billy Joel even titled a song "Allentown" in 1982 when plant closings lifted unemployment to almost 12 percent.
Then came a vigorous revival in the late 1980's, when light industrial and other companies were attracted by the area's stable and reliable work force. The jobless rate dipped below 4 percent in 1989. A transition to service-oriented and light industry was aided by an influx of businesses from neighboring New Jersey, where labor and housing costs are higher.
"Three, four years ago, it was on fire," said Laurin Fegley, 23, whose four years as a car salesman ended with a layoff in May. "Everything was moving; you could sell anything. But now people aren't spending what they once did. Companies aren't doing anything differently. The entire region is just moving slower."
The current recession is swamping the service sector as well. A senior executive at Merchants Bank, which since last year has laid off 200 of its 1,000 employees in 50 state branches, maintains that the layoffs resulted not from a lack of business but from the need of its parent, the First Fidelity Bancorp of Lawrenceville, N.J., to consolidate its staff by cutting payrolls.
The executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the layoffs as part of a broad push for productivity. "Everybody's hurting," he said. "This softness of the economy is lasting much longer than we expected, and it's causing problems because of its duration."
A sneeze by one of the area's major industries, for example, can still induce a cold. The Bethlehem Steel Corporation, which is based in the area and has a large steelmaking operation on the Lehigh River, this week reported an unexpectedly large $61 million loss for its third quarter, and plans for a joint venture with British Steel are expected to eliminate about 2,000 administrative and plant jobs.
"Bethlehem Steel affects everyone in the Lehigh Valley," Mr. Bernhard said. "You just can't ignore it."
Next to many of those sharing his three-hour wait to see an employment counselor at the Pennsylvania Job Center, Mr. Phillips, 32, who is single and ready to move elsewhere in search of a new job, is philosophical about his fate. "Companies have to save money, just like everyone else," he reasoned.
Jim Moyer, a 49-year-old machinist who was laid off two weeks ago after 30 years with his company, said some of his friends were accepting the inevitability of a lower salary in a new job. He himself hesitated last week before turning down a job that offered $6 an hour, compared with the $16 an hour he had been earning.

The Economy
Payroll jobs failed to rise in October, and the unemployment rate edged back up to its August level of 6.8 percent, Labor De partment figures showed, reflecting an eco nomic recovery that has slowed to a near standstill. Although the report was only mod estly worse than expected despite sharp job losses in manufacturing, retail trade and construction, economists said it added to fears that the midyear rebound had given way to stagnation. [Page 1.] In Allentown, Pa., some of the faces behind the layoff notices. [49.] 
 House Democrats failed to get their bill for extended jobless benefits out of the Ways and Means Committee, even though the Bush Administration endorsed it hesitantly. But leaders predicted a program would be agreed upon early next week. [49.]
The Senate derailed an energy bill, effectively defeating the Administration's plan to open an Alaskan Arctic wildlife refuge to oil drilling to reduce dependence on foreign oil. Congressional officials predicted an energy bill would get to the floor this year. [37.]
The stage was set for a vote on comprehensive banking legislation as early as Monday, as House Democrats repelled a White House attempt to kill the package. [37.]
The Index of Leading Economic Indicators slipped 0.1 percent in September, the Commerce Department said. It was the first drop in eight months, and heightened fears of renewed recession. [49.]
Construction spending increased 1.1 percent in September, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $406.5 billion, up from $402.1 billion in August, Commerce said. It was the third straight rise. [49.]
A former White House aide who represented a leading B.C.C.I. figure committed no ethics violations, the White House said. [24.]
 
 Companies
CBS Inc. announced its largest quarterly loss ever, $169.1 million, reflecting write-offs of its costly commitments to televise Major League Baseball and the National Football League. [37.]
R. H. Macy & Company said its losses narrowed in the fourth quarter to $72.3 million from $80 million a year earlier, and that sales increased slightly for the first time in many months. [37.]

 Markets
Stocks fell in heavy volume after a late series of program trades and a weak bond market pulled prices down. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,056.35, down 12.75. Many investors were awaiting a hoped-for cut in the discount rate. [40.]
Shorter-term Treasury notes improved but bond prices fell as traders had a mixed reaction to the October jobs report. [40.]
The dollar plunged in heavy trading on the economic reports. Gold prices were mixed, with bullion for current delivery at $355.60 an ounce, off $2.50, on the Comex. [46.]
Soybeans rose sharply amid expectations of Soviet food aid and supply worries. Grain futures also settled mostly higher. [46.]

Blaze Hones a Sense of Community

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Nov. 1 -

 BODY:
The deadly firestorm that scorched the hillsides of Oakland has turned a middle-sized city into the sort of place where neighbors gather for potluck suppers and trade gossip outside the post office.
With more than 3,000 residences destroyed and 5,000 people left homeless, the ordinary webs that bind neighbors have been unraveled. But the families who lived on the burned ravines and ridges overlooking San Francisco Bay have found new ways -- some might say old ways -- of keeping in touch. 
 Without a permanent address or a telephone number, they communicate on bulletin boards that have sprung up overnight all over this city of 372,000 people and flock to neighborhood meetings that have taken place virtually every night since the Oct. 20 blaze.
Without a back fence to talk over, they pass the time of day at the corner store or at a new community assistance center here, a teeming warehouse where all manner of rebuilding difficulties are supposed to get solved.
The need to congregate is manifest in many ways.
On one charred block, a single home remains, and so that is where residents gathered for a potluck. At a community center, there was a spaghetti feast for hundreds of people who wore name tags with arrows pointing up or down to signify whose houses were saved or destroyed.
This week, children returned eagerly to schools that had been closed in the fire-scarred neighborhoods, and were thrilled to be reunited with friends. For some, the books and pencil cases in their desks are their only remaining possessions.
People are also reaching out with messages on ad hoc bulletin boards that have become ubiquitous here: at markets, on telephones poles in charred neighborhoods and in The Oakland Tribune, which dedicates one page each day to fire victims seeking help and donors offering it.
Victims, for the most part, are looking for scattered friends, lost pets and housing. Donors are offering anything and everything, including trucks to haul debris, massage treatment, grief counseling, strollers and pianos.
The premier bulletin board is at the Chimes Market, in the heart of the Rockridge neighborhood, and the postings there are a chronicle of kindnesses great and small.
"Many cats seen at Lake Temescal mixing with the wild ones. Could yours be there?"
"Room available in lesbian household."
"This dog is still alive," with a photo attached. "Are you looking for him?"
Similar notices also hang at the assistance center, where booths have been set up by the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the State Department of Motor Vehicles, the local utility companies and an array of legal and social service agencies.
When fire victims are not at the center seeking answers to a daunting list of questions, they go up to the hills where their homes once stood and pick through the debris, which covers about two and a half square miles.
For now, the landscape is all white ash, blackened trees and sepia chimneys. But wildflower and grass seed has already been sown to prevent erosion, and within a week, if there is a bit of rain, the hills will begin sprouting orange poppies and purple lupine.
When night falls, the fire victims flock to neighborhood meetings where they share information and bombard the Mayor with questions about building permits, liability insurance, debris removal and the like.
Sometimes Mayor Elihu Harris is received warmly and other times with catcalls and expletives. He is so tired that his eyelids droop and his speech slurs. Usually, the early hostility of the audience is cooled by the meticulous presentation of Oakland's city manager, Henry Gardner, who offers his home telephone number as an expression of concern.
The majority of people at the meetings say they plan to rebuild, which seems more a function of economics than sentiment. Most homeowners are insured for full replacement costs, and they would walk away with far less money if they sold their lots and bought houses elsewhere.
When the fire victims step to the microphone with questions for officials, they identify themselves by where they lived and whether they intend to stay.
"I used to live and expect to live again at 5895 Grizzly Peak Boulevard," said Garrett Gruener, who organized a meeting on Wednesday at the Claremont Hotel, which was attended by 500 burned-out residents.
But not everyone is that certain.
"My name is Gil Chasin and I live at 30 Vincente Place," said another young man. "I mean I lived at 30 Vincente Place. I mean I live at. . . ." His voice trailed off in confusion. He stammered out several more verb tenses. Then he shook his head and fell silent.

HEADLINE: BUSH ADOPTS PLAN TO ATTACK CRITICS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Nov. 1

 BODY:
As White House advisers fret about the sour economy and the voter discontent it has stirred, President Bush is solidly fixing the blame for both on official Washington, and especially on its Democratic majority in Congress.
The strategy, urged on Mr. Bush for weeks by some of his leading political advisers, surfaced unexpectedly Thursday night in Houston, and the President repeated his attack on Democrats in a talk here tonight. 
 The President's shift in tactics came after months of near silence on critics' charges that he is neglecting the economy and other domestic issues. It also followed a turbulent White House meeting on Thursday morning at which Mr. Bush's political advisers urged him to tackle the economic issue head on, while his budget director and chief economist urged him to take a lower-key approach.
 
Fire-Breathing Assault
 In Houston that night, Mr. Bush transformed what had been billed as a 10-minute pep talk to Republican loyalists into a 50-minute fire-breathing assault on Congress's ethical and intellectual flaws.
Before a crowd of wealthy Republicans, he repeatedly condemned Congressional Democrats as "old thinkers" and "small-bore" partisans who were blocking what he characterized as his agenda of fresh solutions for the nation's ills.
Then, with Mr. Bush and Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, sitting nearby, Vice President Dan Quayle called for two-term limits on all United States senators. Mr. Gramm is serving his second term.
Mr. Bush repeated that performance tonight in Dallas, where he spoke to another $1,000-a-head audience contributing to his still-unannounced re-election campaign.
 
'Problem Is in the Congress'
 "The problem is in the Congress of the United States and the liberal Democrats that control it," Mr. Bush said tonight to a hotel ballroom filled with Dallas Republicans. "Those old guys that control the subcommittees haven't had a new idea in 30 years."
Mr. Bush said he "had been kind and gentle" to the Congress but had ended up "a javelin-catcher" at the receiving end of Democratic attacks. "I can't wait to be a candidate when I decide to be one and take this to the American people," he said. "They're tired of it; they're sick and tired of it.
"Why do you think the American people are so fired up about term limitations? Because they've wised up; they understand it. And I'm going to fight for that, too, all next year," he said to wild applause.
The President has sharply criticized Congress before, most notably in a Washington speech last month after the seamy battle over Judge Clarence Thomas's confirmation to the Supreme Court. But his remarks this week have easily been the most bitter and most partisan in recent memory.
 
Pledge to Fight Critics
 In an interview with a Dallas television station today, the President suggested that, his patience exhausted, he was reacting to a stream of unfair attacks from Democrats seeking political gain out of the recession.
"I've been kind of a shock absorber for highly partisan criticism," he said, "and I'm not going to do that anymore. I'm going to say when a guy takes me on in a demagogic way, I'm going to hit him right back."
The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today that Mr. Bush's attack on Thursday had not been planned, but was a spontaneous departure from the less strident speech that he had been prepared to deliver.
But both Democratic and Republican political strategists said today that they saw a larger meaning to Mr. Bush's tactics at a time when public revulsion against entrenched government is running high.
"Whichever side gets to decide who's the Establishment has a leg up" in the coming Presidential campaign, one Republican adviser said.
In that political race, this adviser said, "the Democrats started earlier, but Bush has a lot more material to work with."
 
Casting Bush as Insider
 Democrats are already hammering the economic and domestic policy themes in this fall's campaigns, casting Mr. Bush and Republicans as the Washington insiders who are responsible for a national malaise.
As challengers in 1980, Mr. Bush and Ronald Reagan rode a similar wave of discontent with incumbent Washington into the White House. But after 15 years in Washington and a decade as a symbol of Republican control of Government, Mr. Bush faces a much tougher task in casting himself as an outsider battling the capital's bureaucratic mess.
But Mr. Bush also has substantial ammunition for this battle. Public confidence in Congress as reflected in polls has dipped markedly, and a series of legislative debacles -- from influence-peddling by the savings-and-loan industry to check bouncing and the Thomas hearings -- has painted an even darker image of incompetence and corruption.
Notably absent from Mr. Bush's remarks, at least for now, is any indication that the White House plans new initiatives to deal with the economy.
Democratic strategists in Congress professed today to be undisturbed by the President's new bluntness. To the contrary, they said, Mr. Bush's change in tone suggested that his critics were hitting a soft spot in the President's political armor.
"Here's a man who is towering in the popularity polls, who's 23 to zip in the veto contest in Congress, and he sounds defensive and excited," one Democratic adviser said. "I think he's scared stiff on the economy and he's in a big fix as to what to do about it."

HEADLINE: Foreign Doctors Flocking to Rescue Long-Shunned Areas of Dire Poverty

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WELCH, W.Va.

 BODY:
Few doctors want to build a practice or make a home in a place like this. An economic sinkhole whose coal-mining jobs have been vanishing, Welch is a remote Appalachian outpost filled with the very poor and the very sick.
Heart attacks, breathing disorders, diabetes and depression are the doctor's daily diet, and the county hospital has had little luck luring doctors even from West Virginia's own medical schools. 
 So Welch imported doctors like Siva Prasad from India, Piayon Kobbah from Liberia, Godfrey Chithambo from Malawi, Dale Barnes from the Bahamas, and Cecelia Bella, Julito Sultan and Andres Rago, all from the Philippines.
 
Many Come From India
 Fifteen of the 19 doctors on the staff of the state-owned Welch Emergency Hospital, the only hospital serving a three-county population of 115,000, are immigrants. "We'd be pretty dead without them," said Stephen Shride, the hospital administrator.
So it is throughout much of rural America, where people are 10 to 15 years older, on average, than those in cities and where people have access to less than half as many doctors per capita. Graduates of foreign medical schools, more than 90 percent foreign-born, make up a fifth of the nearly 600,000 physicians practicing in the United States, according to the American Medical Association. About 25,000 come from India, the biggest source.
No one seems to have tallied the numbers working in rural areas recently. "It's higher than one would expect," said Dr. David A. Kindig, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Wisconsin in Madison who in 1971 founded the Public Health Service's National Health Service Corps.
Dr. Kindig did a study a few years ago of foreign graduates working in communities of fewer than 10,000 people and found that their numbers doubled from 1975 to 1985, to a point where they represented 15 percent of the communities' physicians. The figure is probably closer to 20 percent now, he said. In a later survey, Dr. Kindig found that 75 percent of the physicians intended to stay in the communities.
 
Cutbacks in Program
 More and more American-born physicians shun the primary care work that the communities need most: family practice, pediatrics, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology. They choose instead the higher status, better pay and narrower scope of the specialities practiced in metropolitan areas, which also offer access to large communities of doctors and better equipped hospitals.
In the 1970's through the mid-1980's, the Public Health Service dispatched thousands of Americans a year for stints in underserved areas in return for Government scholarships to medical schools. Federal budget cuts all but halted the program, with fewer than 50 such doctors sent out a year in the late 1980's. The program has been revived, but on a much smaller scale.
Like American doctors, most foreign-born doctors cling to the metropolitan areas, particularly in the Northeast and in Ohio, Illinois and Florida, where they go for hospital residencies and internships. But more and more have been moving beyond the cities, in part because recent changes in the immigration laws, intended to help communities that cannot find American doctors, make working in rural areas a condition for remaining in the United States. Heavy recruiting by desperate communities and a desire to escape discrimination by urban American doctors are also factors.
Under the immigration laws, a foreign doctor in this country for medical school, an internship or a residency must return to his home country for two years when his studies are finished. But if he is offered, and accepts, a job in one of the 2,100 areas the Federal Government has designated as medically underserved, the two-year requirement can be waived and he can apply for permanent residency in the United States.
The foreigners also tend to settle down and raise families in the communities. Encountering less professional discrimination, which, they say, most often takes the form of belittling their methods and judgment, they say they have more opportunity in rural areas. Typically, they earn $80,000 to $200,000 a year -- less than they would make in bigger cities, but easily enough to provide higher standards of living than those they left at home.
Among states with largely rural populations, West Virginia has the highest concentration of immigrant doctors. One of every 1,750 people of the state is a graduate of a foreign medical school, as against one in 25,163 in Idaho, with the fewest.
 
Where Infirmities Abound
 And in West Virginia, few places illustrate the importance of foreign doctors to rural communities better than Welch, and few offer so rich a laboratory of rural people's infirmities. Dr. Prasad, 42 years old, came to Welch to start a practice in internal medicine two years ago. "Mr. Shride contacted me to see the hospital," he said. "My wife liked the place. I did not apply anywhere else."
"I see just about all the patients," Dr. Prasad said. "They come with breathing problems and chest pains. Most of them smoke. You see a lot of diabetes, hypertension and kidney failure problems. They have poor knowledge of nutrition."
Among his patients, the most common meal is biscuits soaked with a gravy made of flour, milk, lard or grease from the frying, and salt and pepper. Goodson's, the only supermarket around, runs $12.99 specials for 25-pound tubs of Valleydale lard, and it's a very popular item, as an ingredient and as a medium for frying.
"I have seen heart attacks here with people under 40," Dr. Prasad said. "It's their dietary habits and smoking."
 
Settling 30 Miles Away
 The Prasads have settled in the slightly more affluent town of Bluefield, 30 miles away, and put their sons, 13 and 14, in the local schools. Rather than take a paying job, Dr. Prasad's wife, Santhi, a cellular biologist, works on their sons' schooling.
"Two hours every night, math and science," Dr. Prasad said. "She is very devoted to that."
Dr. Barnes, 37, the chief of staff, comes across as much more American than the other doctors, no doubt because his parents, teachers in Seventh-day Adventist schools, moved from the Bahamas to Detroit when he was 7. He is a graduate of the Loma Linda University medical school in California, where he was in the top 10 percent of his class, and did a residency in internal medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
Dr. Barnes was sent to Welch four years ago by the Public Health Service. Although not a citizen, he qualified for a Federal scholarship in medical school and in return was assigned here. He completed his obligation two years ago, and as an unmarried man in a town barren of most amenities, he said he would rather be elsewhere.
He said he has been staying on until the hospital can recruit a new chief of staff. But Mr. Shride said a sense of mission seems to hold Dr. Barnes here, too: "9 o'clock, 10 o'clock at night, his car is still here."
 
Reasons to Be Depressed
 Dr. Barnes sees all the maladies Dr. Prasad does and cites the same causes: smoking and diet. A reason the habits persist, he said, is the hopelessness of the area. "There is a lot of just plain depression," he said. "When you're on call regularly, you get two or three suicide attempts a week."
Dr. Rago, 47, who has worked in or near Welch as a family practitioner for 16 years and is also an American citizen, said his fees for examinations range from $25 to $45, but many patients pay nothing. "If they can't pay, what can you do?" he said. "They say, 'You can bill me.' You don't have any choice. You cannot say, 'I won't see you.' "
Among patients, the one recurrent complaint is the English spoken by some of the doctors, a problem the doctors try to deal with. "They'll look real hard at your face, and they can tell if you can't understand," Cathy Smyth, a payroll clerk, said. "If they see you don't understand, they'll repeat it real slow."
 
Questions of Color
 Billy Mullin, 45, permanently disabled at the age of 32 by black lung disease, the scourge of coal miners, was sitting on a bench outside the hospital one recent day, having a cigarette. He said his disability check came to $1,800 a month. "I had a heart attack in February," he said. "They took care of me like a baby. But I could hardly understand their language. The nurse, she tell me what he said."
Patients, most of whom are white, say they are not troubled by putting themselves in the hands of doctors who mostly are not white.
"When people in West Virginia see somebody different, they seem not to be threatened," Dr. Prasad said. He said some people are amused by the red dot, a bindi, that Mrs. Prasad wears on her brow in the tradition of Hindu wives.
But bigotry does crop up. Dr. Barnes, who is black, recalled the departure of a partner in a practice the two had here. "He was a light-skinned black, and he had a lot of patients who assumed he was white," Dr. Barnes said. "When he left, people asked if he could recommend another white doctor."
Still, the doctors say they are more readily accepted in Welch than in big cities. "You find discrimination in big medical centers where there are residency programs," said Dr. Bella, director of the pathology lab.
And when immigrant doctors move from one state to another, licensing boards often demand more paperwork of them than they ask of Americans, even after the immigrants have been admitted to practice in other states.
"They find they are discriminated against by state licensing boards, and sometimes they are," said Dr. Roy Schwarz, senior vice president for medical education at the American Medical Association. "The quality of these physicians is about the same that it is for U.S. graduates."
Graduates of foreign medical schools must pass a medical exam to work in the United States, and about a quarter of the 20,000 or so who apply each year a year do. Then they must apply for residency assignments in American hospitals.
The doctors here wrestle with the moral issue of serving American communities, however impoverished they are, instead of ones at home. Dr. Bella and her husband, a doctor from whom she is now separated, have moved back and forth, working in both the United States and the Philippines. She said she preferred Welch, in part because she found it a better place for raising her 9-year-old daughter.
Dr. Rago and his wife, a registered nurse, hurried back to the Philippines for two weeks to help the victims of the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano in June. But after 16 years in Welch, he said, he considers himself a thoroughly rooted American.

HEADLINE: Kentucky Race for Governor Leaves Voters Yawning

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRANKFORT, Ky., Oct. 31

 BODY:
Democrats have had an electoral stranglehold on the Kentucky governorship for the past 20 years, and 1991 does not appear to be the year Republicans will break that hold.
If the polls and pundits are correct, the Democratic candidate, Lieut. Gov. Brereton C. Jones, will sweep past his Republican opponent, Representative Larry J. Hopkins, in Tuesday's election. The incumbent, Wallace G. Wilkinson, a 49-year-old Democrat, is barred by state law from succeeding himself. 
 But Mr. Jones's expected victory, no matter how sweeping, is not likely to mask the ennui, frustration and deep-seated cynicism about politics and politicians that the poll takers have found this year in Kentucky's electorate, as well as in much of the nation's.
 
'A Really Sorry Campaign'
 Indeed, at the start of the final weekend before the election here, many voters seem more than sated by a campaign in which the candidates have generally ignored public issues in favor of attacks on one another over the handling of personal finances.
"It's been a really sorry campaign," said Kim Blackburn, a pet shop manager in Lexington. "This state has all kinds of problems, especially economic problems because of the recession, but all we've heard is a lot of personal attacks by the candidates. I don't know who I'll vote for. It's hard to get your heart into it."
Mr. Hopkins, 58 years old, has spent much of the campaign suggesting that Mr. Jones might be a tax evader because the Lieutenant Governor, one of Kentucky's leading horse breeders, has refused to make public his tax forms.
Mr. Jones, 52, has said repeatedly that he has paid all his taxes. But Mr. Hopkins continues to demand that his opponent make public his tax returns, and wonders aloud why they are being withheld if there is nothing to hide.
"Can you trust him?" he asks voters. "It's an indication of character."
 
32 Overdrafts in One Year
 Mr. Jones, for his part, has spent much of the campaign recalling that Mr. Hopkins, who has represented Kentucky's Sixth Congressional District in the state's Bluegrass country since 1978, was one of the House members recently found to have written overdrafts on the House bank, 32 checks in his case.
Mr. Hopkins says the bank never actually processed the checks; thus, they did not "bounce." But Mr. Jones is not satisfied.
"How many people do you know who have bounced 32 checks in one year that didn't go to jail?" he asks voters.
Both candidates are regarded as political moderates, and both have themselves expressed concern about the negative tone of the campaign. Like many candidates around the country, they have talked about a need to change the campaign system.
Mr. Hopkins has called for limits on the number of terms elected officials can serve. Mr. Jones has said that if he is elected he will impose a new code of ethics on executive branch officials "within 60 seconds of my taking the oath of office."
 
More Interest in Lottery
 But to many Kentucky voters, the talk of campaign reforms and government ethics has a hollow ring.
So little has been said by the candidates about such pressing issues as rising health care costs, neglected schools and economic development in Kentucky's chronically depressed mountain regions that many Kentuckians are talking less about who will win the governor's race than who will win Saturday's state lottery, worth nearly $40 million, and which thoroughbreds will run off with the $10 million in Breeders' Cup purses offered the same day at Churchill Downs.
State election officials report a sharp falloff in voter registration, and expect a low voter turnout on Tuesday.
In several debates, Mr. Jones and Mr. Hopkins have explored the major issues facing the state, though not in great depth, and have showed that they have some significant differences, though not a large number.
Mr. Hopkins has said he favors more limits on abortions, but he has not been explicit. Mr. Jones would leave the decision on whether to have an abortion to the mother, at aleast in the early months of pregnancy.
Mr. Hopkins favors right-to-work laws on the ground that they would encourage more industries to move to Kentucky. Mr. Jones is much more pro-labor, saying, for example, that he would give state employees some bargaining rights.
 
A Focus on Personality
 "Basically, this has not been an issues race," said Penny Miller, a political scientist at the University of Kentucky who has written several books about the state's politics.
"That's often true of Kentucky races," she added. "Personality tends to count more. The problem with this race is that it has gotten too personal. A lot of people are just plain turned off."
Both President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle have visited Kentucky in an effort to give Mr. Hopkins's campaign a lift. But the latest poll, made public on Thursday by The Louisville Courier-Journal, showed Mr. Jones leading Mr. Hopkins 52 percent to 27 percent, with 22 percent undecided.
The poll takers interviewed 529 adults whom they considered likely to vote. The poll, conducted by telephone on Oct. 24-28, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Mr. Hopkins tried to play down the poll results in an appearance this morning at one of his campaign offices in Lexington. "The poll that really counts, the mother of all polls, will be on Tuesday," he said.
Mr. Jones, appearing at a rally Wednesday night in Louisville, anticipated the results of the poll, telling cheering supporters that some good news was coming his way, and shouting, "We're going to give Larry Hopkins the whipping he deserves!"

HEADLINE: Mexican President Outlines Program for Changes

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 1

 BODY:
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari unveiled plans today for Mexico's continued transformation in the second half of his term, promising sweeping changes in agriculture, in education, and in the distant relations between church and state.
After three years in which he has concentrated on modernizing the economy and laying the groundwork for free trade with the United States, Mr. Salinas turned in his annual State of the Nation address to themes of social change. 
 "A great dividing line" still holds the country apart and holds it back, he said. "That line is poverty."
Mr. Salinas acknowledged "certain deficiencies" in the electoral system put in place for the congressional and gubernatorial elections on Aug. 18, which his Revolutionary Institutional Party won by a landslide. The party later surrendered two of the six state governorships it won because of opposition charges of fraud.
 
Interrupted by Jeers
 But as he called for dialogue with the opposition parties to help improve the process, the President was interrupted by the jeers of their representatives. And even before he had arrived in the Chamber of Deputies to speak, opposition leaders took the same podium to protest low wages, official human rights violations, and the Government's control of political resources and electoral appeals boards.
"It is not enough, sirs, that we be equal before the law if we are not equal in the face of authority," said a leader of the conservative National Action Party, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos.
Much of Mr. Salinas's two-hour address was a vigorous defense of Mexico's market-oriented economic policies. For the first half of this year, he noted, economic growth approached 5 percent on an annual basis. The 11.9 percent inflation in the first nine months of 1991 is the country's lowest in 16 years, he said.
Mr. Salinas did not mention the possibility of fixing the peso to the dollar, and several Government officials have said in recent days that the possibility appears increasingly remote. He brushed off Mexico's growing current account deficit as an inevitable consequence of greater private investment and the need for imports. Despite the imbalance, he noted, foreign-ex change reserves had risen as of Thursday to the highest in Mexico's history, nearly doubling in one year to $16.71 billion from $8.415 billion a year before.
 
Government Program Criticized
 Some economists have criticized the Government's busy privatization program as a transference of resources that has not significantly improved the lot of impoverished Mexicans. Real minimum wages, according to an economic consulting firm here, fell in September to their lowest level since 1980. But Mr. Salinas said today that profits from the sale of government enterprises would increasingly be channeled to social programs.
Focusing on the system of communal lands that was established over a 30-year period after the Mexican Revolution, Mr. Salinas argued that the country should shift its emphasis from the redistribution of farmlands to their productivity. While not spelling out his plans precisely, he indicated that he would allow peasant farmers to join with outside investors. Government officials said the new policy would also allow the farmers to lease their lands for the first time.
"In the past, land distribution was a path of justice," Mr. Salinas said. "Today it is unproductive and impoverishing."
In an effort to improve the notoriously poor quality of Mexican education, Mr. Salinas said he would decentralize the present system, giving new resources to the states so that they could administer the schools. A senior official said this would allow the Government to break the stranglehold on change that the giant national teachers' union has been able to maintain by bargaining as a single unit.
Taking up his inaugural pledge to address the 130-year-old split between the Mexican state and the Roman Catholic Church, Mr. Salinas called for "reconciling the definitive secularization of our society with effective freedom of religion."
While insisting on the continued separation of church and state and of secular education in public schools, he somewhat obliquely suggested a new willingness to give churches legal status, to allow them to own property, and to improve relations with the Catholic hierarchy.
The Mexican primate, Ernesto Cardenal Corripio Ahumada, later pronounced the President's comments "magnificent."

HEADLINE: Dutch Study Is Issue in Euthanasia Vote

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
As the voters in Washington State consider whether doctors should be allowed to end the lives of terminally ill patients who have asked to die, people on both sides are bolstering their arguments with a new study from the Netherlands, where euthanasia is illegal but widely tolerated.
Opponents of the measure, which appears on next Tuesday's ballot, say the Dutch study shows that unless euthanasia is strictly forbidden, some doctors will kill patients without their consent. Supporters say it shows that such fears are greatly exaggerated. 
 The report, commissioned by the Dutch Government and published in early September, was summarized in the Sept. 14 issue of the British medical journal The Lancet.
Through interviews with doctors, examination of death certificates and other methods, the study showed that about 2,300 deaths a year, or 1.8 percent of all deaths in the Netherlands, were deliberately caused by doctors acting on their patients' orders.
And it found that 1,000 more people were put to death by their doctors without their consent, despite professional and judicial guidelines limiting euthanasia to people who explicitly and repeatedly ask for it.
In all the deaths cited in the study, doctors killed patients by lethal injection or gave them a lethal mixture of drugs to drink.
To Deborah Senn, a Seattle lawyer who is a leader in the movement for a yes vote in the Washington referendum, the Dutch study "really rebuts the argument" that euthanasia is "out of control in the Netherlands."
But Dr. Carlos E. Gomez, a physician and public policy analyst whose own study of euthanasia in the Netherlands, "Regulating Death" (Free Press), has just been published, says the study shows that the Dutch "have already done what was worst feared."
 
'Boundary Area' Cited
 Richard M. Doerflinger, an official in the Secretariat for Pro-Life Activities of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the number of patients killed without explicit requests in the Netherlands would be the equivalent of more than 17,000 people killed each year without their consent in the United States.
Mr. Doerflinger noted that the extent of euthanasia in the Netherlands would be almost doubled if 2,500 cases in what the Dutch researchers called "a boundary area" -- where painkilling drugs were administered with an intention of bringing on death as well as reducing suffering -- were counted.
According to the study, in 30 percent of the deaths where doctors accepted the risk of shortening a patient's life by administering high doses of painkilling drugs, they listed bringing on death as one objective. In an additional 6 percent of the cases, doctors said causing death was their chief objective.
Dr. Gomez said he saw no difference between giving high dosages of painkillers with a deliberate intent to kill and the study's category of euthanasia accomplished with clearly lethal drugs.
 
Little Difference Seen
 Reached by telephone in the Netherlands, Dr. Johannes J. M. van Delden, a researcher of the study who wrote the Lancet article, agreed that the difference was slight.
"It is not up to me to say whether these cases are euthanasia or not," said Dr. van Delden, who is associated with the Center of Bioethics of Utrecht University and the Health Council in The Hague. "If you want to call it euthanasia, please do.".
Dr. Richard Fenigsen, a retired Dutch physician and outspoken critic of euthanasia who is now in the United States, contended that the study should have also listed as euthanasia many of the deaths caused by high dosages of painkillers or decisions to forgo or halt life-prolonging treatments. By his definition, 19.4 percent of deaths in the Netherlands should be considered euthanasia.
But Ms. Senn said, "I think the opponents are playing with the numbers." She noted that in more than half the cases in which patients were killed without their explicit request, the patients had become mentally incompetent after earlier expressing some general wish for euthanasia if their suffering became unbearable.
Ms. Senn, who recently visited the Netherlands and talked with health officials there, said the study showed that the practice was "self-limiting."
 
Abuse by Doctors Doubted
 "Everything I hear is that doctors in Holland find this a very draining experience," she said. "It is illogical to think that doctors will abuse the practice."
The study found that Dutch doctors agreed to fewer than a third of 9,000 explicit requests every year from patients who expressed a desire to die or to be assisted in committing suicide.
Because economic pressures are often suggested as a potential cause for abuse of euthanasia, Ms. Senn said it was significant that the study showed the absence of economic considerations in decisions about euthanasia.
By contrast with the Netherlands, Ms. Senn added, the Washington State measure stipulates that no patient could be killed unless the request was written and signed before two witnesses, and that two doctors had to agree that the patient was terminally ill with less than six months to live.
But Dr. Gomez said the Dutch study illustrated the fragility of any guidelines. "I was told up and down that under no circumstances could patients be euthanized without their consent," he said.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Musings Cast Pall Over Race

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's public hand-wringing about whether to seek the Presidency has slowed but not frozen the pace of the just-formed Democratic primary field, fund-raisers and campaign aides said this week.
The candidates' travels have picked up as the six major Democratic candidates have taken their campaigns to New Hampshire, Kansas, Florida, Iowa, Georgia, Maine and Arizona in the days that the New York Governor continued to tantalize political insiders with talk of the Presidency. 
 Most of the candidates have said they are unaffected by Mr. Cuomo's musings. But other Democrats have noted that some big-money contributors are holding out on committing themselves as long as Mr. Cuomo's candidacy remains a possibility.
"You have to run your own campaign," said Robert Farmer, the former Democratic Party treasurer who is now raising money for the campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. "You can't be looking over your shoulder to see what other people are going to do."
But he added that money has been harder to pry loose in some political circles, particularly in New York, where many prominent Democrats have ties to Governor Cuomo.
"That doesn't mean that if you have some friends they won't stand up for you," Mr. Farmer said. "But if you have mutual friends, it kind of freezes you."
 
New Pall Over Campaign
 Whether the candidates will admit it, Mr. Cuomo's return to the circle of speculation casts a new pall over a campaign that had already been slow to start.
That sluggish start has had something to do with the activity of the announced candidates themselves. Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, for example, are sidestepping joint appearances at events that would have been mandatory in the more heated campaign four years ago. In addition, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia has just returned to the stump on a regular basis, more than a month after announcing his candidacy in Richmond.
Some Democrats appear to welcome the possibility of a Cuomo candidacy. Aides to Mr. Clinton, for example, are convinced that the presence of a liberal Northeasterner in the race will set Mr. Clinton further apart in voters' minds as a moderate Southerner.
Others hope that Mr. Cuomo's presence will lend sufficient weight to the Democratic field to force President Bush into a defensive position if the economy stays sluggish.
Paul Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts, is one of those. "To beat George Bush, you have to win a nomination that has value," he said at a news conference on Thursday in Concord, N.H. "Whoever wins with Governor Cuomo in the race will have the necessary momentum against George Bush."
 
Different Conclusion
 Republican operatives see a similar advantage, but have reached a different conclusion. Where anxious Democrats see stature in a Cuomo candidacy, Mary Matalin, the chief of staff for the Republican National Committee, said the White House saw a "flawed record" that they could exploit. Mr. Cuomo, the Republicans say, is a clearer target than other Democrats.
Mr. Cuomo's indecision has clearly sent more tremors through the Democratic field than the ruminations of that other famous undecided Democrat, the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Mr. Jackson -- who has run twice and is expected to announce his plans for 1992 at a news conference on Saturday -- had already been counted out of the race, even by many of his own supporters, well before Governor Cuomo expressed his renewed interest.
And Mr. Jackson's decision, some veteran fund-raisers noted, would have more of a political than financial effect on the race. Since Mr. Jackson never traveled the traditional fund-raising route in his two national campaigns, few money-raisers have felt compelled to remain neutral until he makes a final decision.
The story is different for Mr. Cuomo, who is widely considered able to raise large sums of money with relatively little effort.
 
'Sense of a Diminished Field'
 If Mr. Cuomo ultimately decides not to run, he may have caused more damage than he intended. Strategists in both parties speculated that by raising expectations that he would enter the race, Mr. Cuomo instantly reduced the standing of the declared candidates.
"He has added to the sense of a diminished field," said Rich Bond, a Republican who worked in President Bush's 1988 campaign and is still close to the White House.
But on the campaign trail Democratic candidates will admit to no such thing. To concede that Mr. Cuomo is a significant threat to their nascent campaigns would be catering to the notion that the Democratic Party's chances without him would suffer.
And for now, they see no reason to go on the attack.
Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former California Governor who announced his candidacy two weeks ago, said he would welcome Mr. Cuomo. "Sure, let him come in," he said on the Cable News Network call-in program "Larry King Live." "Why not?"
Democratic strategists remain unsure of whether the perceptibly slowed campaign can be attributed to Mr. Cuomo, a slowed economy that has hobbled fund raising or disenchantment with the declared Democratic field.
"I think money is going to be slow this year for 100 reasons," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic strategist who is not aligned with any of the Democratic candidates. "And if some contributors whose pockets aren't that deep can blame it on Cuomo, I wouldn't be surprised if they did."

Harnisch Presses His Face Up Against the Window

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Pete Harnisch of the Houston Astros was one of the most consistently effective pitchers in the National League this year, and he might be one of the most pained this winter. Because of the timing of the demotion of the Phillies' Rod Booker to the minor leagues last July, Harnisch will not be eligible for salary arbitration.
Booker's effect on Harnisch is a result of the 17 percent solution to the 1990 spring training lockout. 
 The key to the settlement was the compromise that granted salary-arbitration eligibility to the senior 17 percent of the players who have been in the major leagues between two and three years and had at least 86 days of service in the most recent season. Prior to the settlement, three years of major league service were necessary for arbitration.
The economic advantage of being eligible for arbitration is obvious from last year's results. The initial 17 percent group -- 14 players -- nearly tripled their collective salaries, receiving a 196 percent raise. The year before, players who had between two and three years in the majors saw their salaries jump only 20 percent.
Harnisch, whose 2.70 earned run average was the fifth best in the National League, made $275,000 in 1991. He missed out on the 17 percent group by one day because of Booker, a reserve infielder for Philadelphia .
The Phillies designated Booker for assignment on July 18. They sent him outright to their Scranton minor league team five days later. If they had waited one additional day, Booker would have emerged from the season with exactly three years of major league service, making him eligible for arbitration without being part of the 17 percent group.
Had Booker gained that day, Harnisch would have been the 15th and last player in the 17 percent group. Harnisch has 2 years and 135 days of service. Joe Girardi of the Chicago Cubs and Kirt Manwaring of San Francisco were the last players to make the group, each with 2 years and 140 days.
The others who qualified are Chico Walker and Dwight Smith of the Cubs, Greg Litton of the Giants, John Habyan of the Yankees, Bill Spiers of Milwaukee, David West of Minnesota, John Marzano of Boston, Greg Myers of Toronto, Junior Felix of California, Gary Thurman of Kansas City, Ken Hill of St. Louis and John Costello of San Diego.
In another development, the Cardinals picked up the option in Ozzie Smith's contract, meaning they will pay him $2 million next season.
The Twins gave Junior Ortiz a $50,000 buyout instead of a $520,000 salary in 1992. Toronto offered Candy Maldonado salary arbitration, meaning he cannot become a free agent.
Ten players filed for free agency, bringing the total to 67. Yesterday's filings included Orel Hershiser and Jay Howell of Los Angeles, Alejandro Pena of Atlanta, Glenn Davis of Baltimore and Tom Candiotti of Toronto.

HEADLINE: Auto Safety vs. Fuel Economy: Questions of Size and Design

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Big cars are usually safer in crashes than small cars, highway statistics indicate. But tests also suggest that the safety of any car, large or small, is a very relative affair. That may be the real issue in the current debate over car size and safety.
This week, some advocates of safer cars accused Federal Department of Transportation officials of unfairly manipulating a crash test that was subsequently seen in a television commercial. 
 The commerical, in which a large car smashes head-on into a small one and crushes it, was paid for by the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, an auto industry group. Car makers oppose a Senate bill that would raise average fuel economy standards from 27.5 miles per gallon today to 40 miles a gallon in 2001, contending that the move would result in smaller and more dangerous cars.
Some advocates of the fuel economy measure, which was introduced by Senator Richard A. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, accused Federal highway officials this week of suppressing, among other things, data that showed that the smaller car's driver would have survived the crash. Government officials deny they rigged the test or suppressed data.
 
Fundamental Questions
 "This is all a red herring and a game they are playing," said Jerry Ralph Curry, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
But histrionics aside, the debate does raise some fundamental questions. For example, just how important is a car's size to occupant safety? Are other factors like design and safety equipment just as vital? Can fuel economy be increased without causing more highway deaths?
It's a pretty elementary proposition that when you crash a 4,200-pound car into one weighing 2,400 pounds, as Mr. Curry ordered, that the bigger car is going to come out the winner. And predictably, that is just what happens on the highway: insurance industry records give large cars a higher safety rating.
The reasons are simple. A large car has more metal to crush, absorbing energy in a crash, and more interior space, shielding occupants, said Charles Hurley, a spokesman of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in Arlington, Va.
"The pattern is unmistakable," Mr. Hurley said. "Large cars offer more protection." But these days, large vehicles, with wheelbases of 110 inches or more, account for only 14 percent of all cars on the road. And Federal statistics show that as the large cars become smaller and small cars larger, the importance of size decreases sharply as a safety factor.
In 1990, for example, occupants were killed at the same rate -- 2.1 deaths per 10,000 vehicles -- in compact cars, with wheelbases of 95 to 99 inches, and in smaller midsize cars, with wheelbases of 100 to 104 inches.
Perhaps more important, accident reports collected by the insurance institute show a wide variance in the safety of different models within the midsize class and large midsize class, with wheelbases of 105 to 109 inches. In 1988 through 1990, for example, the Buick Century and Toyota Camry had the lowest rate of occupant injury claims relative to all other vehicles. But two other cars of similar size -- the Hyundai Sonata and Nissan Stanza -- were among those with the highest injury claims.
As a group, midsize cars were safer than smaller cars when insurance claims are used as a guide. But some small two-door sedans outperformed some larger two-doors. For example, during the 1988 through 1990 period, the Ford Probe and the Plymouth Colt and Dodge Colt had higher safety ratings than larger two-doors like the Chevrolet Beretta, Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbird.
William Gardner, the head of crashworthiness engineering for Transport Canada, a Government agency, said that among vehicles of similar size, a car's design is the critical factor.
"It could depend on how well a seat belt fits an occupant," Mr. Gardner said. Other important factors include the energy-absorbing characterictics of a vehicle's front end.
 
Seat Belts and Air Bags
 A part of the confusion surrounding the current debate is the changing nature of car safety. In the past few years, the overall rate of highway deaths has fallen, during a time when the presence of smaller cars has grown. A major reason for this improvement is the increased use of seat belts. And as more cars are equipped with air bags, highway safety is likely to improve even more.
The General Accounting Office issued a recent report that found that the trend toward smaller cars has had virtually no effect on highway safety. Even Mr. Curry, the Federal official, said that he was at a loss to predict what safety improvements would mean for highway safety.
"I couldn't in any way tell you what will be the final result on America's highways based on these changes to cars," he said.
Cars can get better gas mileage in two ways: through technological improvements or reductions in size. But just how far those changes can go without sacrificing safety remains the issue. And that is what is being overlooked as the debate over the Bryan bill grows more bitter.
"There is very little middle ground here right now," said Mr. Hurley of the insurance institute, which opposes the Bryan bill on safety grounds.

HEADLINE: With Allowances, Every Parent Differs

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Rina Pianko of Manhattan, a homemaker with three sons, believes that children should get an allowance because it teaches them what money is and how to manage it.
"But the allowance should be flexible from year to year as a child's needs change," she said. "This is really teaching them about themselves." 
 Ms. Pianko's views are similar to those of many parents, who give allowances for two basic reasons: to provide children with money for some of the things they want, and to help them learn about spending and budgeting.
Of course, not all families give regular allowances, preferring to give spending money to their children periodically, or not at all. But for many Americans, allowances are a part of family life.
A recent survey by Teen-Age Research Unlimited, a research company in Northbrook, Ill., showed that 33 percent of youngsters between age 12 and 19 receive a regular allowance. The younger the teen-ager, the greater the likelihood that he or she gets an allowance.
The Rand Youth Poll, a market research company in New York that does an annual survey of teen-agers, reported that boys aged 13 to 15 received an average allowance of $15.25 a week last year, while girls of the same age received $16.90. Boys age 16 to 19 averaged $27.20 and girls age 16 to 19 averaged $28.80.
 
Watch Your Symbolism
 The way an allowance is given may be as important as the dollars changing hands. As Kenneth O. Doyle, a professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, put it: "I think people have to look at money less for its market value and more for its symbolic value. If a parent gives grudgingly, that's conveying something to the kid."
Specialists in the field of children's finances say parents should decide whether the child must perform certain chores in order to get an allowance, whether the allowance will be given in advance in special situations and whether the child should be required to save part of the allowance.
"An allowance is a way to help a child become financially responsible," said Steven L. Sanders, who conducts financial education programs in schools for Citibank Mastercard and Visa. "And it can be done without beating someone over the head."
Some experts think that to give a child autonomy, an allowance should have no strings attached. Neale S. Godfrey, chairwoman of the Children's Financial Network, a New York company formed to teach children about money, sees value in linking an allowance to jobs around the house.
"It's essential for children to be able to see that you work for pay," she said. "And if children want to earn extra money by doing optional chores, like cleaning the TV screen or the windowsills, you should make that available to them."
On the other hand, Marsha Ann Miller, a trustee of the Fund for Economic Education, established by the American Bankers Association, said an allowance ought to be separated from chores, which children should be assigned to do regularly.
"I'm not going to withhold the money because you didn't make your bed, since the expectation is that you are going to make your bed," she said. "I don't see money as either a reward or a punishment, but rather a way to instill in a child a positive view of what money will do."
There is also a strong difference of opinion among the experts about giving advances to children who run short of money before the next allowance day. Some adamantly oppose letting a child borrow on the next week's allowance, while some say advances are permissible under certain conditions.
In the first camp is Harold Moe, an author of "Teach Your Child the Value of Money" (Harsand Financial Press, 1990).
"No advances," he said. "An allowance is the heart of teaching children about money and by its very nature is planned by parents to help children make decisions."
But Mr. Sanders of Citibank disagrees. An advance should be given, he said, as long as it is used as a learning experience.
"If a kid borrows a dollar, the kid should take on a small interest rate and give back $1.10 or $1.20," he said. "The concept is that money is not free when it is borrowed."
Many of those who study allowances say that a portion of the money should be saved for long-term goals. Dr. James U. McNeal, a professor of marketing at Texas A & M University, said that setting limits on how an allowance can be spent "not only teaches about money and money management, but also about marketplace behavior; children should be told to save a part of their allowance for high-ticket items."
Ms. Godfrey, who is also the author of "The Kids' Money Book" (Checkerboard Press, 1991), goes even further, asserting that once a child is 7 or 8, he or she ought to save part of the allowance, give some of it to charity and divert some of it to what she called taxes.
"You have to teach kids at a very young age the concept of taxes," she said. "The kids should pay taxes to the family and help the family save for something."
A key issue with allowances, of course, is the amount, but there is no consensus because of the wide variations among families and family income. The amount should depend not only on the child's age, the family's income and its philosophy concerning allowances, but also on the affluence of the community where the family lives. What's more, the amount can change if the rules change.
For example, Linda Barbanel, a New York psychotherapist, recommends that parents start giving an allowance of $1 or $1.50 a week when a child is 6 years old and raise it by a couple of dollars at every birthday.
"The needs are greater as the child gets older, so give a little extra as discretionary money," she said. "The allowance is the first step toward financial management."

HEADLINE: Soviet Upheaval Has Little Impact On Spending Bill for U.S. Military

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
House and Senate negotiators today approved a $291 billion military budget bill for the 1992 fiscal year, making few changes in the Pentagon's spending plans outlined a year ago before the collapse of Communism in the Soviet Union and the diminished Soviet military threat.
The compromise bill for the year that began Oct. 1 represents a 2 percent decline after inflation from last year's military budget and follows the path that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced last year to cut Pentagon spending by about 20 percent over five years. 
 The spending plan now advances to the full House and Senate, which are expected to approve it next week and pass it along to President Bush for his approval. Mr. Bush is expected to sign the measure.
 
Influence of Soviet Upheaval
 The dramatic upheaval in the Soviet Union had some influence on the compromise agreement that lawmakers hammered out in private meetings over the past two months. It prompted negotiators to adopt a plan to transfer up to $1 billion from the Pentagon's budget to humanitarian aid and economic assistance for the Soviet Union to help avert chaos there.
And it helped deal a crippling blow to the Stealth bomber, the radar-evading aircraft originally designed to defeat Soviet air defenses and bomb nuclear missile silos. Each plane costs $865 million -- another big drawback.
But lawmakers say the abortive Soviet coup along with Mr. Bush's plan to eliminate thousands of battlefield nuclear weapons and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's decision to reciprocate caught Congress near the end of a budget year, unwilling or unable to reopen last year's budget agreement to make deeper cuts in military spending.
The rallying cry of lawmakers now is, "Wait until next year!" Democrats and Republicans predict that the lessening Soviet threat, pressing domestic spending priorities and the political imperatives of a Presidential election year will force Congress and the Administration to renegotiate last year's budget agreement to permit the shifting of Pentagon funds to domestic needs. The agreement stipulated that through the 1993 fiscal year, money could not be shifted from military ledgers to other spending programs.
In the first stage of this reassessment, the House Armed Services Committee will soon begin hearings to gauge the impact of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and how that alters American military requirements.
 
Lingering Parochial Interests
 Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said today's action "continues an orderly, prudent build-down responding to a reduced threat in the world."
Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said that the compromise ushered in a "basic realignment in the way we think about defenses."
While the brokered agreement does demonstrate Congress's desire to adapt to changing threats, it also reflects lingering parochial interests and an institutional inertia to shift military strategies overnight.
Lawmakers endorsed ground-based defenses against accidental or limited ballistic missile strikes from hostile third-world countries. But they also agreed to buy four more F-117 warplanes the Air Force says it does not need, and lawmakers refused to cut reserve troops in their home districts as deeply as the Pentagon wanted.
"There's enough in this bill to keep everyone happy, but there's not yet strong evidence we've entered the new world," said Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan research organization here.
A spokesman for the Pentagon, Pete Williams, said that Mr. Cheney was reserving comment on the compromise pending a review over the weekend.
 
Abortion Provision Dropped
 Lawmakers dropped a provision that would allow abortions in United States military hospitals overseas after President Bush threatened to veto the entire military spending bill if it contained the measure.
The conference committee's report offers a detailed guide for military programs for coming fiscal year. Money will have to be appropriated for the programs in a separate bill. House and Senate negotiators are scheduled to begin the appropriations conference on Nov. 12.
Legislators lifted a 43-year-old ban on women flying combat aircraft. Navy officials said that female aviators could be flying carrier-based combat planes by next summer. Female pilots now fly several combat aircraft, including Navy A-6's and A-7's, but only in training roles.
The Soviet aid proposal, which would allow Air Force planes to transport food and medicine to the Soviet people this winter and offer economic incentives to private American companies to invest in Soviet businesses, touched off the only real disagreement in the conference's waning hours.
The plan's two main architects, Mr. Nunn and Mr. Aspin, argued that American security interests are served by preventing further economic turmoil in a nation with more than 30,000 nuclear weapons.
Some Republican senators expressed outrage today that the United States would send Pentagon savings to the Soviet Union when budget deficits and other domestic problems at home begged for more attention.
"If the Soviet Union needs money to clean up their environment and reform their military, let them stop producing the missiles and submarines that directly threaten us," said Senator Robert C. Smith, Republican of New Hampshire.
Mr. Cheney sent a letter today to Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, saying the Administration "would not oppose" the plan.
 
Fortunes of B-2 Damaged
 The changing Soviet threat clearly damaged the B-2's fortunes. The compromise effectively blocks the purchase of any new planes beyond the 15 Congress has already ordered and authorized the spending of $1.8 billion for new parts for aircraft that may never be built.
Negotiators set aside $1 billion for a single new B-2 this year, but the aircraft, built by the Northrop Corporation, would have to satisfy several technical milestones and then pass a second vote in Congress before the money would be released.
The Administration had much better luck with its other top military priority, the scaled-back version of the "Star Wars" missile defense system that President Ronald Reagan initially proposed in 1983.
The compromise calls for $4.15 billion to establish a single ground-based ballistic missile site near Grand Forks, N.D., by 1996 or whenever the technology is capable. The Senate had wanted $4.6 billion, $600 million lower than the Administration's request, but much higher than the House's $3.5 billion version.

HEADLINE: Martinelli in Yonkers, Halpin in Suffolk

 BODY:
Tuesday's elections offer two hotly contested suburban races.
For the first time in 50 years, residents of Yonkers, N.Y., having replaced the city manager form of government, will select a mayor with stronger powers. That's a chance to end years of political turmoil. 
 Since 1984, a state Emergency Financial Control Board has monitored the city's finances. The fiscal problems were compounded in 1988 when a majority of the seven-member City Council resisted a court order to build 1,000 units of moderate- and low-income housing to overcome racial segregation.
Construction of 200 units is finally under way. And Federal District Judge Leonard Sand will consider allowing Yonkers to build fewer than the remaining 800 units. Yonkers needs a mayor who can move various factions toward compromise.
The Republican-Conservative, Peter Chema, is a businessman who has served as Council majority leader and opposed the housing order. His efforts to appear more moderate ring hollow. The Democrat, Terence Zaleski, a lawyer and a former teacher, has been a conscientious State Assemblyman for four years but lacks political maturity.
We support Angelo Martinelli, a businessman running as an Independent after losing to Mr. Chema in the Republican primary. Mr. Martinelli, who served as Mayor of Yonkers for 12 years, lost office in 1987 when he urged compliance with Judge Sand's order. He has the stature and skills to pull people together.
In the contest for Suffolk County Executive, we recommend the incumbent, Patrick Halpin, over his opponent, Robert Gaffney. Mr. Halpin, a Democrat, has weakened his candidacy with offensive campaign tactics. But in a county saddled with an irresponsible legislature and a recession, he has provided level-headed leadership.
He is therefore preferable to Mr. Gaffney, the Republican and Right to Life candidate. Mr. Gaffney is an amiable but undistinguished State Assemblyman who offers few realistic ideas for coping with eastern Long Island's distressed economy.

HEADLINE: Coming Back;
The Business of Business

 BODY:
Political leadership alone can't do it. Managerial discipline alone can't do it. For New York City to work its way back from the present economic slump, it needs the help of business leaders, as leaders and as individuals.
The 1970's fiscal crisis was impossible for business leaders to ignore; the city faced bankruptcy. When Gov. Hugh Carey asked for help, he got it. The 1991 crisis is less acute yet no less a crisis. It presents itself in the form of troubled schools, crime and drugs, snarling panhandlers, pitiable homelessness, slipping services and, worst, in glib pessimism. 
 In fact, more business people are probably giving more public-spirited service than ever. And many businesses consider public participation to be a routine responsibility. But these are not routine times. They call for a greater commitment by more businesses and a greater willingness by the Dinkins administration to accept help and advice.
Much of today's civic involvement by businesses began in the last crisis. David Rockefeller, then chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, led in creating the New York City Partnership of 175 chief executives. A recent Partnership proposal, to consolidate economic development agencies, has been adopted; others are pending. The Partnership also urges predictability, arguing that business cannot flourish unless taxes are stabilized.
The Partnership helped create another private sector group last year -- the Mayor's Management Advisory Task Force -- that has already produced valuable proposals for managing Medicaid costs and East River bridge tolls, and has helped fill city management positions.
Individual corporations already provide much direct financial and volunteer aid. Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez invites business ties, not just dollar contributions. Some 60 companies provide mentors, tutors and equipment. Booz, Allen & Hamilton analyzed the Board of Education's operations, pro bono, and made proposals for saving $20 million a year. Volunteers from Coopers & Lybrand help out at three Bronx high schools; the accounting firm rates employees on community service.
Another boost comes from self-taxing Business Improvement Districts to clean up commercial neighborhoods, like the Grand Central Partnership and the one in Times Square. But smaller nonprofit neighborhood service agencies need support.
Alas, the pool of corporate talent has shrunk since the 1970's. Some giants like General Electric and Union Carbide have left for suburban headquarters, the daily lives of their executives and employees no longer ruffled by the city's distress. Out of sight, out of mind.
Those who remain could be doing much more. Public service could be built into the career ladder. Executives facing early retirement might be encouraged to donate time to the city. It would certainly help if one or more towering business figures rallied others to such involvement.
At the same time, the bridge between the public and private sectors runs two ways. The Dinkins administration has frustrated more than a few businessmen who feel they are talking to deaf ears. Business partners can help only if there is mutual willingness to hear, and act.

HEADLINE: Public & Private;
The Right Questions

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
From the public address system of the number 1 train came the voice of civility. "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen," said the voice, "and welcome to the Broadway local. I don't know whether you're interested in this sort of thing or not, but the number 2 and 3 trains may be boarded just across the platform. In fact, downtown transfers are on the house. Our final destination is South Ferry. This involves closing the doors." The woman to my left snapped out of her commuter fugue state and laughed.
A soothing voice of civility on the subway -- it was wonderful. And weird. Just a few stops south, four men were on trial, charged with another sort of subway story, the one that included the brutal murder of a tourist from Utah a year ago. The voice of civility continued to come over the P.A., faintly British, so at odds with the usual sullen crackle of the speakers. But it was difficult not to think of blood on the station floor. This is what it is like to be a New Yorker, to have to stop and constantly acknowledge pain. 
 Sometime in the coming week Mario Cuomo may decide whether he is running for President or not. The entire business of Presidential politics, so fitful and ill favored this time around, has ground to a screeching halt, waiting for Mario. If he Godots, if he never arrives on the stump, he will become somehow irrelevant in that way politicians become irrelevant when their time for the Presidency has passed, irrelevant in the way George McGovern and Teddy Kennedy are irrelevant.
This would be a waste. Mr. Cuomo has many liabilities, among them the fact that he is a son of the city that much of America thinks of as Depravity 'R' Us. This could be one of his great advantages. Pain 'R' Us, too. Mario Cuomo, the orator, the grocer's son, would be good at acknowledging pain, at asking feelingly, "Are you better off than you were four years ago?"
The voice on the national public address system says the economy is improving, but almost 1 in 10 Americans are relying on food stamps, a record number. When the President refused, between boating and golf at Kennebunkport in August, to declare the budget emergency that would have extended unemployment benefits, it seemed clear that he doesn't have a clue about what it's like living in America, the America without the rambling family vacation home. His fellow Americans were taking vacations in the above-ground pool bought with the '86 bonus, seeing chlorine as a luxury item. One sad story of depleted savings and downsized hopes after another -- that's what's happening outside the inner circle of the silver spoons.
There's a lot of talk going round about how Mr. Cuomo will face difficulties if he runs. He will have to answer for the budget deficits and cuts here in New York State, for his stands on capital punishment and abortion. He will say that the economy is in a mess, instead of trying to pretend that things are improving. He will not run from his unpopular positions, unlike George Bush, who tailored his stand on abortion to suit the prevailing winds.
The Governor will evoke, not deny, the fact that we have become a people who anticipate downward mobility for our children. That fear is a turning point in the American psyche. Some Republicans are gleeful about the ascendancy of Mr. Cuomo, the urban ethnic with the vocabulary of a theologian and the face of a mournful hound. The glee is premature. No one could better suggest that the two highest elected officials in this country are men who believe privilege is a christening gift.
Mr. Cuomo may be vulnerable to attack on everything from his ethnicity (now we may see how the Republicans really feel about our tired, our poor, our Italian-Americans) to New York's economy.
But let's not look at his vulnerability in a vacuum; let's not pretend he would be challenging Abe Lincoln. Clarence Thomas. Family leave. John Sununu. Unemployment benefits. Willie Horton. The gulf war. Iran-contra. Above all, the economy. The soothing voice is seductive, especially when things are as bad as they are today. But in George Bush's case, it is the voice of a man who knows no more about hard times than he does about hard questions. This election should encompass both. The President has plenty to answer for if only the right person asks. The right person is Mario Cuomo.

HEADLINE: Taxpayers Raising Banner of Revolt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It was refreshing to hear about groups like the New York City Chamber of Commerce calling for a four-year freeze on all taxes on businesses and property owners in the city (news article, Oct. 8). In Connecticut, the cry against a new state income tax is reminiscent of the Boston Tea Party two centuries ago. 
 The message sounded in New York City and Connecticut is not unique. Taxpayers all across the country, and especially elsewhere in New York State, are disgruntled.
Last year, the New York Farm Bureau pushed for state fiscal reform. Our farmer members believe that whether you are a farm family in rural New York or you are a someone in business in New York City, your overall tax burden is exorbitant, and reform is long overdue.
We also pushed for serious mandate relief and fair but equitable spending reform. In addition, we are working on the national front to reform a fiscal beast that is even more out of control.
Common sense needs to be brought back into governmental fiscal matters, at the local, state and national levels. The shift in taxpayer attention toward spending restraint and to saying no to more taxes should be a clear signal to government leaders that the old spend and tax days have reached their twilight.

HEADLINE: Land Swap on Ballot Helps Adirondacks Area

 BODY:
To the Editor:
On Nov. 5, New Yorkers will be asked to vote on an amendment to the State Constitution critical to safety at a small airport in the Adirondack region. The Piseco Airport, in Arietta in Hamilton County, is the only airport serving the southern Adirondacks, its permanent residents and more than 55,000 seasonal visitors. 
 Unfortunately, trees on state land near the runway are growing into the flight path, forcing aircraft to dodge and dangerously shortening the runway's usable length.
The amendment, Proposition 2, would authorize the state to convey 50 acres of forest land to the Town of Arietta in exchange for at least 53 acres of wild forest land of equal or greater value. If this exchange is approved by the voters, it would still require further approval of both the State Legislature and the Governor to insure that it is fair and equitable.
The Piseco Airport plays an important role in search and rescue missions, firefighting, acid-rain monitoring and providing emergency medical transportation that is vital to this remote and rural area, whose nearest resident doctor is 60 miles away. It is also vital to the region's economy, almost wholly based on tourism.
Proposition 2 is an important matter of safety and economic vitality to the residents of the southern Adirondacks.

HEADLINE: THE MIDDLE EAST TALKS;
Excerpts From Baker-Pankin Remarks: 'They Have to Turn a Page of War'

BYLINE: Reuter

DATELINE: MADIRD, Nov. 1 --

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a news conference today by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Boris D. Pankin of the Soviet Union about the Arab-Israeli peace talks. Mr. Pankin's comments were translated by his interpreter.
 
PANKIN'S STATEMENT
 It is a pleasure to be able to come here to share my views and impressions of the conclusion of the plenary session at the . . . Palace. The whole world has been following closely the developments in Madrid, which is quite understandable because Middle East means a lot from the point of view of human culture and, in terms of today's realities, also from the point of view of economics. 
 Over the last few decades we have heard -- we didn't hear much upbeat reporting from the Middle East. Rather, it was reporting on hostages and other bad things. But still today, despite all odds, I think that we can feel optimistic, because the convocation of this conference is good news, as it is good news that for the first time throughout the Middle East conflict, the main parties to that conflict have gathered in the same room. And it's good news that the main topic of discussion was peace, although the participating states have different views of how this movement toward peace is to be accomplished.
 They have various views as to the priorities, but still all of them, overall, have come to share the conclusion that they have to turn a page of war, and the Soviet Union and the United States, as co-chairmen, see their task in having this page of war turned as soon as possible. That was the logic that motivated our joint action during preparations for the conference and at the conference itself. And we decided to follow the same logic, following the conclusion of the plenary session that has just been completed.
 The task of the next phase is to develop, negotiate process in bilateral and multilateral groups. I thank you.

 
BAKER'S STATEMENT
 Let me make a quick statement . . . before we respond to your questions. Let me repeat what I said in my just-concluded speech to the conference that this conference, I think, represents a start, an important start, particularly because no peace is possible if the parties are unwilling to meet face to face.
 For the most part, I think what we've seen here in Madrid is what you might have expected in a public forum in advance of negotiations. We saw, I believe, some posturing. I know we saw the staking out of some maximalist positions. This is something that I have been saying for some time I thought you should expect.
But I also think we saw some of the emotions that are felt so keenly by all sides to this conflict. The bottom line is that now the real work of peace must begin. The direct bilateral negotiations, I have said before, I think are the forum for that work, and I think it's, as I said in my remarks to the conference, now up to the parties to begin that effort. . . .

 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. Mr. Secretary, you've also been saying in the days preceding the conference, and I think the President as well, that there might very well be interruptions. Well, we've just had an interruption of about two hours. Could you share with us please some sense of what you were doing in that period, who you were meeting with, who the -- the notion I suppose is either the Israelis, the Syrians or both are reluctant to moving ahead and causing you some logistical problems. Could you enlighten us a little?
 A. The problem, to the extent that there is one, Barry, relates to what again I said in my remarks, and that is the inability of the parties to agree on the venue or location for the bilateral negotiations. And I was working with the parties during that recess in one final effort to see if we could bring them together and see agreement reached. And I was working as well jointly with the minister here with a host of different people.
 It is the view of the co-sponsors, as we both expressed in the conference, that the bilateral negotiations should begin here in Madrid as soon as possible. That is our position. We are ready and we hope everybody else will be.
 
Site of Talks
 Q. Some of us understood that there really had been no dispute, certainly no complaint from Israel, about beginning here. We're interested in knowing where the actual face -- past the throat-clearing stage, where the true negotiations will take place. Is there an agreement to have real negotiations in Madrid or is that still open?
 A. I've told you what the position of the co-sponsors is. I think that there are some who are prepared to begin in Madrid rather quickly. I am going to continue to refuse to try and negotiate these things out in a public way.
 We are continuing, as I said in my remarks, to consult with the parties as we move forward here over the course of the next couple of days.
 
Aid for Progress
 Q. What are your ideas on linking development aid to progress achieved at the negotiating table? And what other options do you have to keep the process going? . . .
 A. . . . Linking development aid to progress in negotiations -- that is not something that we have taken a position on. We are in favor of seeing bilateral negotiations on the issue of peace, and multilateral negotiations on regional issues such as economic development and that sort of thing, arms control, economic development. We're not suggesting any formal linkage between those two processes.
 
2d Phase Dispute
 Q. (through a translator) . . . Mr. Shamir repeated his invitation to the Arab delegation to hold the second phase in the Near East. And then is Israel the main foe of having the second phase take place in Madrid, sir?
 A. Let me say that I'm not going to play the game out here, and I don't think my colleague is, of trying to negotiate this matter in public. It will serve no useful purpose for me to stand up here and say this is the position of X, that is the position of Y. What we are saying, we're telling you what our position is, which is that we think these bilateral discussions should begin here in Madrid as soon as possible. PANKIN: I agree with you.
 
Shamir's Departure
 Q. Secretary Baker, could you tell us please if the early departure of Prime Minister Shamir exacerbated the problem in determining where the bilaterals would be held? And can you tell us also when you knew that he would have to be leaving early on Friday?
 A. In no way did it exacerbate the problem. And we have known since before we left for Madrid that the Prime Minister wanted to return in time -- wanted to leave in time to get back to Israel for the Sabbath. We put out a statement here -- if I'm not mistaken, over the course of the past 48 hours -- that explained that, and this, that is why that we started as early as we did this morning at 8 o'clock.
 
Mideast Arms Deals
 Q. (through a translator) Can you tell us whether you consider the possibility of introducing . . . [inaudible] moratorium on arms supply to the region?
 PANKIN: Indeed, this was one of the items of the eventual agenda of multilateral negotiations, and we will have to agree on the start of these negotiations and the process of contacts between the delegations once we completed this stage in the conference.
 
U.N. Resolutions
 Q. Mr. Baker, the press has been very, very polite with regard to you, and they always say that you never start anything without finishing it. I've seen you in Geneva with the Iraqis, and you've told them that you have 12 U.N. resolutions that have to be put into effect, and they were put into effect. And now I ask you, are you actually going to achieve this phase? You're going to sit down with the Israelis and say, "I have hundreds of U.N. resolutions that must be put into effect"? This is my question for Mr. Baker. My other question for Mr. Pankin. In President Gorbachev's speech, he said the Israeli-Arab conflict is one of the hangovers or holdovers of the cold war. Do you think this is true? And also another question for Mr. Baker. Are you going to begin talks with the P.L.O. when there are no more reasons for such dialogue?
 BAKER: I'll answer the first question you asked me, and then the Minister will respond to the question you directed to him. I will sit down with any of the parties that wants us to sit down with them, and indeed the co-sponsors will sit down with any of the parties that want us to sit with them, including Israel, and work as hard as we know how for a comprehensive settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict on the basis of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. That happens to be the terms of reference of this process that we have initiated, and we will continue to do everything we can to serve as a catalyst to move that process forward, and that, of course, would involve implementation of those resolutions.
 PANKIN: I consider that all those things in the conflict, including the most severe things in the conflict, are really relics of the cold war that are brought forth in the very widest sense. In the period when people couldn't find or weren't able to find ways of finding dialogue and negotiations to protect the rights of each other and their peoples by fair means, equitable means . . . Here, for instance, between the Soviet Union and the United States right now we have new relations when we publicly stated that we are no longer in a state of confrontation but now in a mode of friendship. Look at how much has been done in the recent past. New processes of solving conflicts.
 We, for instance, signed on to very important documents vis-a-vis Cambodia. Now after decades we have begun a process, a peace process on the Middle East. This is what I wanted to answer in regard to this question, and that's, I think, what the President of the Soviet Union had in mind.
 
A Game of Chicken
 Q. . . . Without getting into the details of who wants what in this squabble over the venue, why do you think it's taking place? Do you think this indicates that the parties are somehow having second thoughts about going ahead, so they're just using the symbolism of this to hide behind? Or do you think they're just playing sort of a high-stakes game of chicken over it and it's going to get Settled?
 BAKER: Well, I don't know. I think I've said before that we anticipated from the very beginning that none of this would be easy, and it hadn't been for seven or eight months. And I don't think what we're now witnessing is a whole lot different, frankly, from some of the differences of opinion that existed in the past over modalities or procedural questions. But the fact of the matter is, and I said this in my remarks to the conference, I think it will be extremely difficult for people to understand if parties do not -- if they should decide not to participate in bilateral negotiations on the sole basis that they don't like the place where the negotiations would be conducted.

HEADLINE: Steven Soderbergh: The Sequel

BYLINE: By Trip Gabriel; Trip Gabriel is a frequent contributor to this magazine. His last article, "The Psychiatrist Who Pleaded Insanity," appeared in May.

 BODY:
JUST BEYOND THE SET, extras cast as office clerks circa 1919 come and go. Women sweep by in floor-length wool dresses, while men lumber out of costuming in stiff-front shirts and mutton chops. In the purposeful, hectic half-hour before filming begins, all the 100-odd members of the cast and crew appear seriously busy, save for the director, who stands, hands jammed in pockets, looking happily useless. Steven Soderbergh has never commanded such a large cast. In fact, he says, "I've never been into double digits before."
The $12 million budget for this film, "Kafka," although modest by Hollywood standards, is many times what was spent on "Sex, Lies and Videotape," Soderbergh's acclaimed 1989 debut, which a number of critics called the best first feature of the decade. Produced in obscurity in Soderbergh's hometown of Baton Rouge, La., it became a sacred text of the video-literate generation, its title entering the language and its success setting off a feeding frenzy for Soderbergh's talents. Shot for just $1.2 million, it recently passed the $100 million mark in worldwide earnings. 
 The result is that Soderbergh has been able to fly all the way to Prague to make "Kafka," as well as to attract a cast that includes Sir Alec Guinness and Joel Grey and is headed by the Oscar-winner Jeremy Irons, who says he came out of a showing of "Sex, Lies and Videotape" and declared, "I must work with that man."
This is what real money buys: a huge set recreating an insurance office where 54 clerks hunch over manual Remingtons. To enter the set is to step from a workaday sound stage into a cavernous, marble-columned room that seems to have stood for 100 years. Perched in a doorway, Soderbergh is like a toy maker who has set down a marvelous windup device and stepped back to observe. "The amazing thing is, I said, 'Let's do this' eight months ago, and then, whoops, they're serious. Somebody went to a lot of trouble to make this to my specifications."
There is something earnest and gee-whiz about Soderbergh. His wire-rim glasses, gangly frame and close-cropped hair suggest a precocious boy-mathematician with a Ph.D. He is dressed more conservatively than anyone on the set -- sport jacket, white oxford-cloth shirt, black penny loafers -- as if he were trying to look the part of someone older and more authoritative.
Yet there's no doubt Soderbergh is in control of his movie. Many around him remark on how little he equivocates when designing a shot or addressing actors. Based on the admittedly autobiographical "Sex, Lies and Videotape," with its alienated lead character, one might have expected a halting, neurotic director, unsure of what he wants. But Soderbergh is easygoing and natural. He betrays little hint of the extraordinary pressures placed on a young director with a previous hit, pressures that generally fall into two categories: the assumption that the director is a genuis and will easily duplicate the success, or the temptation to label the first film a fluke and its director an impostor. Soderbergh's manner indicates he has not succumbed to either. In spite of a pronounced streak of self-deprecation, he seems to have no doubt that he deserves all that has come his way, that it's absolutely right that he is making an eagerly awaited second film with an illustrious cast, while still only 27 years old.
SHOT PRINCIPALLY IN black and white, "Kafka" is a strange and unexpected movie, more reflective of Soderbergh the perfervid film buff than a thematic extension of "Sex, Lies and Videotape." Whereas the first film was a CAT scan of intense, up-to-the-minute relations between the sexes, "Kafka" is a period murder mystery with touches of horror. With its baroque Prague backdrops and expressionistic images, the film intentionally evokes old German horror movies, like F. W. Murnau's "Nosferatu." It was written by Lem Dobbs, something of a legend in Hollywood for his imaginative but often unfilmable scripts.
The title character is based less on the real Franz Kafka than on the confused and paranoid antiheroes he created. It's as if Kafka had awakened to find himself in one of his own nightmarish fictions. (To eliminate any vibes of undergraduate pretense, Soderbergh ruled that anyone on the set using the word "Kafkaesque" would be fined 10 Czech crowns.)
By day, Kafka works as a drone in a faceless insurance office; by night, he haunts Prague's famous Bohemian cafes, or holes up in his garret, scribbling short stories no one will publish and tortured letters to his father. When a co-worker is mysteriously murdered, he investigates and stumbles onto a conspiracy linking officials at the insurance company with a body-snatching enterprise operating out of Hradcany Castle, the seat of the Czech Government.
Pursuing the trail, Kafka encounters bomb-throwing anarchists and a man who has been transformed by Frankensteinian experiments into a human hyena. He is eventually led to the castle itself, where the movie takes a sudden leap into a brave new world presided over by a mad scientist. The movie might be described as a cross between "The Third Man" and "Brazil," with the eerie nighttime street scapes of one and the Orwellian overtones and retro-futuro look of the other.
All this represents so big a departure from the naked naturalism of "Sex, Lies and Videotape" that audiences may wonder if the same person directed both movies. And now, after a series of reshoots, "Kafka" bears even less resemblance to Soderbergh's first film. Working from Dobbs's original screenplay, which Soderbergh had read and admired years earlier, the director initially revised some scenes to show Kafka as incapable of connecting romantically with the woman he desires, played by Theresa Russell. Impotence was a major theme in "Sex, Lies and Videotape." "It became kind of a joke between us," says Dobbs, who also wrote the screenplay for "The Hard Way," starring Michael J. Fox. "He'd say, 'Leave the sexual anxiety scenes to me.' "
The material was duly filmed last autumn in Prague, but during the course of editing early this year, Soderbergh decided the romantic dysfunction scenes didn't work. They injected a confusing subtext into the story. In May, cast and crew reassembled in London for two weeks of reshooting, thus removing the last thematic traces of "Sex, Lies and Videotape." Soderbergh admits to having made a sophomore director's mistake. "I tried to force a relationship between Jeremy's character and Theresa's character the moviecould not support," he explains. "I'd made this one feature, and that approach was all I knew."
In the two years since the nearly unprecedented success of "Sex, Lies and Videotape," Soderbergh's career has not been without setbacks. The "Kafka" reshoots, almost 20 percent of the film, have delayed the film's release until the first week of December. Soderbergh had once planned to follow "Sex, Lies and Videotape" with a different film, "The Last Ship," a post-nuclear-war story set on a destroyer. But after several unsatisfactory screenplay drafts, he decided to abandon the project. Soderbergh is aware that audiences want to group him with Woody Allen, Barry Levinson or Spike Lee -- writer-directors given to semiautobiographical films that chronicle distinctive milieus. But he has been frustrated in his attempts to come up with a second personal film on contemporary relationships. "I guess after 'Sex, Lies,' I'm just not anxious to make films that are nakedly about my life or my experience," he says. "Right now, I have a desire to look outward instead of looking inward.
"You know, 'Sex, Lies' was the sum total of years of experience. It's only been two years since then. I'm not sure I know enough new things to generate another feature. I guess I'm not finding myself very interesting at the moment."
IT TOOK ONLY A SINGLE screening of "Sex, Lies and Videotape" to make Steven Soderbergh an overnight success. One day he was working as an anonymous van driver at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, where the film was first exhibited; then a rave review, the first of many, appeared in Variety, unleashing a fusillade of telephone calls from industry lights. Sydney Pollack and Robert Redford were on the phone, each wanting to produce his next movie. The actress Demi Moore took Soderbergh to lunch at the Ivy, a Hollywood hangout, and asked him to work on a film with her. Executives at Columbia, Universal, Warner and Paramount all encouraged him to bring future projects to their studios.
At the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, Soderbergh became the youngest director to win the Grand Prize. One jury member, the playwright Peter Handke, compared the film to the work of Chekhov. "They took me outside to shuttle me over to the press tent, and these photographers were pushing in and screaming," Soderbergh wrote in his journal. "It was like Elvis has left the building! Sometimes, it just hits me all of a sudden, what happened, and I can't believe it."
Cannes is notorious for hyping young film makers, but "Sex, Lies and Videotape" lived up to expectations upon opening, generating extraor-dinary word-of-mouth and celestial praise from critics. "I don't remember ever seeing such acclaim for a first film as he got," says Lem Dobbs, who suspects one reason may have been the dearth of serious new film makers in the 80's. "You used to have waves of talent, whether it was the Nouvelle Vague from France in the 60's or when you had the young Bogdanovich, Scorsese and Coppola all at once in the 70's. Now, there hasn't been a wave in so long that Steven Soderbergh became a one-man wave, and everyone went disproportionately crazy."
The assured camera work and the exceptional performances from unknown actors suggested a mature director in mid-career; it was as though Soderbergh had sprung fully formed from the head of Francois Truffaut or Yasujiro Ozu. But he hadn't really come out of nowhere. Despite his youth, Soderbergh had already logged years of experience making short films.
"The turning point was the summer of '75, when 'Jaws' came out," Soderbergh recalls. At the time he was 12. "It was the first time I started thinking: 'Somebody made  this! This didn't just appear spontaneously.' " He bought "The Jaws Log," a movie tie-in book that chronicled the director Steven Spielberg's five-month ordeal filming the movie in the waters off Martha's Vineyard. "I was just obsessed with it," Soderbergh says. "I had this dogeared copy, with certain passages marked, which I'd carry around in my back pocket. I began to understand you could have a job doing this."
While in high school, Soderbergh enrolled in an animation class at Louisiana State University, where his father was dean of the College of Education. There he was drawn into the orbit of several undergraduate film makers who were working out of an abandoned chemistry lab. "He had an amazing encyclopedic knowledge of film," says Paul Ledford, one of the older students. "Lots of people could name a film's star and director, but he knew the names of the cameraman and the writer, and he could recite lines."
In those days, Soderbergh wore his hair in a kind of blond Afro and was skinny enough to fit into the back seat of Ledford's Fiat Spider. Along with another friend, they haunted the movie houses of Baton Rouge. "Movie theater people got to know us," Ledford says. "We'd always sit as a threesome in the middle of the front row. Opening weekends in the summer, we'd figure out how to see all five films in town in one day. We were hungry to see everything. Steven saw 'Jaws' 27 times. He can recite 'Jaws.' "
Ask Soderbergh today, and he will tell you that his favorite movie is still the one that excited him as a 12-year-old. This claim may seem odd, coming from a writer-director who made his mark with a small, low-budget film about sexuality and deceit, bereft of bloodshed and mechanical monsters. Yet Soderbergh really does love "Jaws." An avatar of the generation of mall rats who viewed the Hollywood epics of the 70's over and over, he keeps a rough count of the number of times he's screened "Star Wars" (eight), "American Graffiti" (low teens) and "Apocalypse Now" (high teens).
"Sex, Lies and Videotape" demonstrated the precocious visual fluency of a young director who was already confident enough to ignore convention. "So many things in that movie go against the rules," says Walt Lloyd, the cinematographer who shot both "Kafka" and "Sex, Lies and Videotape." For example, Lloyd says Soderbergh is not afraid to "cross the line," that is, when shooting the reverse angle of a conversation, he'll place the camera on the opposite side of an imaginary line connecting two characters. "In film school, they tell you not to do that -- you can't cross the line," says Lloyd. "I've shot with a lot more experienced directors and said, 'This is a great opportunity to cross the line.' All of a sudden it's a 15-minute discussion about breaking the rules."
Yet Soderbergh's gifts are clearly more than technical. Unlike his hero, Spielberg, who seems unable to treat adult situations and themes without sentimentality, "Sex, Lies and Videotape" is a movie for grown-ups. The Oscar-nominated script portrays its characters with the dense specificity of a novel. Soderbergh, a self-taught writer who never took a screenwriting course, probably owes his talent to a voracious reading habit as a teen-ager, when he consumed novels, science fiction and The New Yorker. He also repeatedly saw such character-driven movies as "Carnal Knowledge," "Annie Hall" and "Manhattan." "Steven started doing short films about problems people were having," says Ledford, who has worked as a soundman on both of Soderbergh's features. "They'd make people laugh but dealt with situations we all faced, like talking to women at a young age."
Soderbergh graduated from high school in 1980, a uniquely focused 17-year-old. Possessed by the desire to make movies, he concluded that a college education would be a time-consuming detour, and headed for Southern California to plunge into the life. Once there, he encountered nothing but roadblocks. The only jobs he could find were nether-world-of-Hollywood menial -- a cue-card holder, a game-show scorekeeper. Discouraged, he returned to Baton Rouge, but had to settle for a job as a coin-changer in an arcade. In his spare time, he made a humorous short about waiting for his big Hollywood break called "Rapid Eye Movement."
He eventually landed a job with a video production house, and for the next two and a half years built his technical skills. Meanwhile, he wrote a half-dozen screenplays and searched for the financial backing to produce them. At one point, he took $7,500 of his own savings, gathered a small group of film-making friends and made "Winston," a short about sexual deception that clearly prefigured the future. Resolving to give Hollywood one more shot, he made plans in late 1987 to set off by car to the Coast. Then, in an eight-day burst -- in a bedroom of his parents' Baton Rouge house, on the road and in the Los Angeles home of a friend where he had crashed on the couch -- he wrote the first draft of "Sex, Lies and Videotape."
WITH ONLY minimal prodding, Soderbergh is willing to discuss the autobiographical origins of his first movie, tracing them to a year in his life when he was "behaving badly" -- just like his character, John, a callow lawyer cheating on his beautiful, repressed wife, Ann, with her lubricious sister, Cynthia. Although the director had a steady girlfriend, he was also seeing other women and lying to all concerned. "It was very complicated, very complicated," Soderbergh says. "I was spinning too many plates on sticks. I thought I would have a heart attack, that the amount of lying would catch up with me."
Eventually, Soderbergh confessed his transgressions to his girlfriend, and then, like his character Graham, he sold off most of his possessions and hit the road. In the movie, Graham is impotent, a condition he attributes to a time when he was a pathological liar. Disgusted with his past, he has commited himself to always telling the truth, which proves rather startling when the intimate details emerge. Graham's few worldly goods include a camcorder that he uses for a "personal project" -- taping women talking about their sex lives. What these women cannot, and will not, say to others, they freely confess to Graham's camera. In a highly erotic movie that contains no nudity, talk turns out to be the biggest turn-on of all.
It would seem that both of these male characters, John and Graham, are based on Soderbergh's experiences -- though he swears there was never a camcorder in his life. In fact, all four characters in the movie are autobiographical. "It was like cutting up my personality over a period of time into four parts and building a character based on each," he says. "I certainly went through a period like Cynthia, where I didn't really give a damn what anybody thought and left a trail of human wreckage behind me. And then there was also a period not long after that when, like Ann, I was very down on anybody who did that. And certainly for a long time I was in this Graham mode of trying to strip things down and simplify. I had too much stuff. I'd got involved with too many people. I had a desire to clean out."
Speaking in his hotel suite in Prague, Soderbergh lies stretched full-length on a couch. Though he has been living in these rooms for two months, they are almost bare of personal possessions. Just like his alter ego, Graham, here is Soderbergh, trailing few personal effects and camped out on a couch. The prone state he prefers is, of course, the position one assumes when talking to an analyst. Soderbergh says that during his period of philandering, he briefly visited a psychotherapist but quit after three sessions. "I just lied to the therapist," he says.
Instead, he seems to have designed his own treatment, one that requires him to speak as openly as he can, as often as he can, even to casual acquaintances. Like Graham, Soderbergh describes himself, in the language of Alcoholics Anonymous, as "a recovering liar." Despite the rush of celebrity following "Sex, Lies and Videotape" that included some 350 interviews, he has not adopted the studied blandness -- or retreated behind the mask of stock phrases -- so typical of Hollywood personalities. Jeremy Irons sounds almost alarmed when discussing this aspect of Soderbergh's nature. "He's terribly open," Irons says in his Oxbridge accent. "If you ask him, he'll tell you anything."
Indeed, it is all but impossible to make Soderbergh squeamish with a question. Asked what caused him to be unfaithful, he recalls the insecurity he feltabout his looks. "When you have profound feelings of self-consciousness, you want to prove that you can be attractive to somebody by force of your personality," he says. "But once you've done it, that person ceases to be interesting, and you move on."
Soderbergh's doubts about his physical appearance caused him, in part, to bail out of Hollywood as soon as he got the chance. "You walk down the street and see these amazing-looking people," he says. "I've always felt very out of place there physically." After "Sex, Lies and Videotape" became a hit, Soderbergh piled his possessions into a 1960 Rambler and drove cross-country to Charlottesville, Va., where he had lived for a few years as a boy. There, he bought a 40-acre farm and married Betsy Brantley, an actress he had met while doing preliminary casting for "The Last Ship." The couple had a daughter last winter, and Soderbergh is happy to be living with his new family thousands of miles from what he considers the superficialities of the film colony.
Looking to the future, he says his third movie will be another surprise -- a comedy about the founding of the National Football League, based on a script written by his brother-in-law, Duncan Brantley, and Rick Reilly, both writers for Sports Illustrated. "If I end up doing this movie," Soderbergh says, "based on the three films I will have made, no one will ever be able to predict what I'll do next."
 "TURNOVER!" BARKS the British assistant director.
"Kamera!" echoes the Czech translator for the benefit of local crew members.
The "Kafka" production has come this chilly night to old Prague, to a dark, twisting street lined with baroque houses whose facades are thick with scrolls and curlicues. The walls are sooty and crumbling from all the lignite coal that is burned to keep the city warm. High above Soderbergh, cast and crew looms Hradcany Castle, sitting atop a massive rock and bathed in green light. The castle is a maze of interconnected Government buildings, a city within a city that suggests corridors receding to infinity and spiral staircases out of an M. C. Escher print.
In tonight's scene, two short bowler-hatted men spring from a doorway to frisk Kafka and drag him away. The action is both sinister and comic. Soderbergh quickly sets up the scene so that the camera will cover the action in one continuous shot. He films economically, thanks to an ability to envision how each frame will fit into the finished whole.
Besides his technical virtuosity, Soderbergh also has a reputation for being an actor's director. "Sex, Lies and Videotape" made stars out of four previously little-known or lightly regarded actors: Andie MacDowell, James Spader, Laura San Giacomo and Peter Gallagher. "He loves actors, which is a very nice thing, because not all directors do," Jeremy Irons says. "Some directors consider actors nothing but things that get in the way before the editing happens."
Yet to be on a Soderbergh set is to discover a paradox: his work with actors is low-key and unassertive. He offers no drama coaching, demonstrates no line readings, engages in no lengthy discussions of characters' motives. Most of his instructions are technical, such as when to pause under a light.
Before the camera rolls, Irons and the two bowler-hatted officials (played by Simon McBurney and Keith Allen) rehearse their lines. When Irons is accosted and his pockets rifled, he plays it weary and put-upon. Discussing his motivation, he says to Soderbergh: "It's not so much my rights I want. I want some answers." Soderbergh nods laconically.
After a second run-through, the director says, "It just needs to go really fast."
Another run-through. Soderbergh asks that a phrase of dialogue be dropped. "One more time," he says quietly, standing a few feet away and listening with his head bowed in contemplation. The actors repeat their lines; the director nods noncommitally.
The camera rolls again and Soderbergh, almost invisible amid all the activity, watches through a small video monitor. At this point the scene is almost in hand. Soderbergh says little else until, six takes later, he has two he likes. "We're wrapping fools," he announces at 4 A.M., the night's work concluded.
HALF AN HOUR LATER, the "Kafka" cast and crew tumble in from the cold and take up seats at the too-bright lobby bar of the Hotel Forum. The director sets the tone of any movie shoot, and Soderbergh's lack of pretense has trickled down on this one. It has become routine for nearly the entire company, actors as well as grips, to drink together after the day's shooting. Since it is close to dawn, the hotel bar is otherwise empty. At the far end of the bar, Jeremy Irons, wearing a silk scarf and knee-high leather boots outside his pants, is talking to one of the English grips. Closer to Soderbergh, Stuart Cornfeld, one of the film's producers, holds forth about the night's subfreezing temperatures. Winter has arrived a month early in Prague. Every setup and takedown is requiring extra time, slowing the production schedule.
But with all the talk of of adversity, Soderbergh, whose nose is still red from the chill, perks up. He recalls an episode from "The Jaws Log," the battered book that became his film-making bible.
"Whenever things are going slowly, I think about Spielberg out on Martha's Vineyard," he says. "I just can't conceive of the pressure he was under -- a 55-day schedule that balloons to 155 days and a budget that goes from $3.5 million to $8 million. They're out there getting 30 seconds of usable footage every three days because Bruce kept breaking down. His eyes kept crossing. That must have been just gut-wrenching."
Bruce, of course, was Spielberg's mechanical shark. And suddenly Soderbergh realizes that, compared with directing a cross-eyed mechanical shark, he has it pretty good.

Introducing the Poor to the Middle Class

BYLINE: Vicki Goldberg's book "The Power of Photography: How Photographs Changed Our Lives" has just been published.

 BODY:
In the 30'S, when the documentary impulse ran rampant across the nation, the Federal Government compiled the largest photographic record ever made of rural -- and some urban -- life in America. From 1935 to 1943, the Historical Section of the Resettlement Administration and the Farm Security Administration produced something like 80,000 prints and 200,000 unprinted negatives.
These images, which influenced "The Grapes of Wrath" (both book and film), remain the chief source for the country's vision of the Depression. Dorothea Lange's "Migrant Mother" and Arthur Rothstein's "Dust Storm, Cimarron County" have achieved iconic status; much of Walker Evans's finest work was taken for the F.S.A. 
 The project left a legacy as significant as its enduring images: this was the first time an American administration had employed photography as a prime player in what was essentially a Government propaganda campaign. The Resettlement Administration was established to help the "submerged third" of the nation that was overwhelmed by rural blight. Congress resisted many New Deal measures because of their supposedly socialistic cast; F.D.R.'s Administration hoped to enlist popular support by showing urban Americans how urgent the need was.
 A new show at Neikrug Photographica, "Farm Security Administration . . . A Time for Celebration" (224 East 68th Street, through Nov. 16), approaches the F.S.A. from the photographers' point of view. The gallery asked Esther Bubley, John Collier, Jack Delano, Carl Mydans and Louise Rosskam to chose their own favorites; Mrs. Rosskam and Mrs. Arthur Rothstein selected work by their late husbands; the rest of the pictures were Neikrug's choice (open from 1 to 6 Friday and Saturday, and at other times by appointment: 288-7741 or 288-7742). The refreshing result is a parade of familiar subjects in less familiar guises, a useful reminder of how broad the archive is.
 Here are the families on the road with their life histories tied up in a sack, the unemployed men by the closed-up cafes, the old couples without a full set of teeth between them, the diners and gas stations and bargain stores, the houses crowded with children and peeling paint and little else, that the F.S.A. stamped on the national memory. Here too are the few shining, middle-class exemplars -- men with polished, high-laced shoes or spanking-clean children in little plaid fedoras -- that rounded out the F.S.A.'s presentation for the middle-class audience it was aimed at.
 But the migrating family is not by Lange but by Mydans, the gas station not by Evans but by Russell Lee (it looks like an Evans taken a few hundred feet back), and most of the familiar scenes are to some degree unexpected.
 Sadly, the show has no dates or titles for any work but Delano's. You might guess that Lee's picture of an Asian child with I.D. tags was taken during the 1942 Japanese relocation program, or that the elderly men snapped by Lange, one with his chin jutting out from his scrawny neck and a tight-lipped look of dogged defiance, were tenant farmers on relief, but it surely would help to know.
 During the 30's, photodocumentary was considered the most reliable and objective means of reporting; even literature tried to imitate the dispassionate thoroughness of the camera. But photographers are neither entirely objective nor always reliable, nor is there to this day any agreement on the role of esthetics in reporting. Clearly there was none then, and some of the F.S.A. photographers leaned hard on art.
 Delano favored slightly stagy setups for group portraits that suggest a notion of family disjunctions to match our own: two children stand close to the lens and regard it boldly while the other members of the family stand back, lost in the tedium of being photographed, contemplating the interiors of their own minds. Ed Rosskam has a strong formalist bent: in his picture of a black neighborhood in Chicago, the flat expanse of a brick wall takes up much of the surface, giving way to a slice of street where three boys at play punctuate the open space of the sidewalk.
 Walker Evans's picture of a sharecropper's kitchen, one of many instances in which Evans turned a poor wooden shanty into an interior by Vermeer, points up the way style affects perceptions of poverty. Scholars have determined that Evans cleared the kitchen table of all distracting objects, moved a crock onto the cupboard, and positioned his camera in such a way that it disguised the layout of the house.
 The result was a cool and affecting beauty that presumably mirrors not only a stylistic preference but Evans's own sanguine view that there was beauty even in these hard lives, and hope for a more orderly existence. The compassionate optimism of so many of the F.S.A. photographs was not created solely by Government decree.
 For the belief was abroad in the land that with sufficient will, technology and the proper kind of Government intervention, even the problems of the Depression could be licked. The New Deal was based on this assumption, and it in turn fostered the feeling that something was being done, that what was broken would be fixed. The F.S.A. photographs generally show people who are down but not out, penniless but still full of fight, because that was what Roy Stryker, director of the program, wanted to see, and what the photographers wanted to see, and what the audience wanted too. In a sense, the 30's was an age of faith.
 In images of abject misery, like Lange's woman with a dirty child by a tent or Delano's mother and child on a pallet resting on four chairs, there is no hint that the subjects have brought this on themselves by drink or bad character. They are victims who deserve sympathy. Congress was not altogether happy with the populist sentiments of the F.S.A. pictures, which some thought socialistic, even communistic. (Even two or three decades later, Congress briefly considered destroying the file because it did not put the country in a properly advantageous light.)
 At least by 1938, and increasingly after the war began, Stryker asked his photographers to show a more positive side of the program; some of the photographs at Neikrug may reflect that. But coded in all the images is a sense that everyone was in the Depression together and if luckier folks only knew about the plight of those less fortunate they would naturally be moved to help. Stryker said that the F.S.A. was meant to introduce Americans to Americans.
The Federal Government does not sponsor any such photographic programs today. Photographers do portray the contemporary "submerged third," sometimes for news organizations, sometimes with the assistance of nonprofit organizations, infrequently with local government support. Times have changed. New Deal programs are in disrepute, faith is in short supply, the sense of community is shaky, and Americans are much less willing to meet the Americans in this kind of picture.
A strong book like Stephen Shames's recent "Outside the Dream: Child Poverty in America" does not flinch from showing drug abuse, domestic violence, and interiors that more closely resemble a town dump than anything by Vermeer.
 But if the present Administration has not chosen to follow Roosevelt's lead in presenting the poor, it has improved upon his lessons in the uses of communication. It was Roosevelt who first harnessed radio to politics in his fireside chats, Roosevelt who first let a magazine photographer take "candid" rather than posed portraits of him, and Roosevelt who allowed the F.S.A. to link photography to political policy. The Bush Administration, which knows how to suborn images to its own purposes, took control of a large-scale visual documentary project and turned it into propaganda for the Presidency: the photographs and TV coverage of the gulf war.
 This time around the Government did not hire the photographers but co-opted them. This time the photographers may not have shared the Administration's sentiments but were restricted from recording anything else. And this time the Government seems to have used the visual record in part to distract attention from just the kinds of economic problems the F.S.A. photographers diligently recorded in hopes of curing them.
 F.D.R., who had many newspapers lined up against him, had to hope some of the media would use the F.S.A. images the way they were intended. Last month, as Saddam Hussein was resisting the peace provisions, ABC showed a film called "Heroes of Desert Storm," which mixed actual film of Patriots and Scuds with staged scenes of battle to recount America's triumph. It was introduced by none other than the President himself. Neither Roy Stryker nor Franklin D. Roosevelt understood the image game that well.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
New Flights To Caribbean

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
AIR fares to the Caribbean this winter will be little changed from last year, and airlines will offer almost the same number of seats. What has changed, however, are the many new flights to Caribbean destinations and greater accessibility for travelers who do not live near such traditional Caribbean gateways as New York and Miami.
Delta Air Lines will begin nonstop service from Atlanta to St. Thomas on Dec. 15, the start of the high season to the Caribbean. Continental Airlines has tripled, to 30, the number of cities -- including Denver and Cleveland -- that will feed passengers onto its 34 weekly Caribbean-bound flights from Newark. And Northwest's schedule this winter includes the Detroit-Boston-Bermuda flight that it inaugurated last May. 
 In addition, next month Key Air, which has long flown charter flights for Club Med and other tour operators, will inaugurate 10 scheduled charter flights a week from Savannah, Ga., to the Caribbean -- four to Jamaica and two each to Aruba, St. Maarten and Freeport. Savannah's city fathers are so pleased, according to Carlisle Vason, Key's director of sales and marketing, they are building a $1 million airport hub complete with Caribbean motif and its own customs and immigration facilities.
"I have a feeling that the increase in flights from 'off-line' cities may be the wave of the future for the Caribbean," said Marcella Martinez of the Caribbean Tourism Organization in New York. "If you want to increase tourism to the Caribbean, you cannot do it primarily out of the Northeast gateways."
Some airlines have realized as much for several years, as witness Northwest's four-year-old daily flight from Minneapolis to Montego Bay, Jamaica, for example, or T.W.A.'s longtime direct flight from St. Louis to San Juan. .
Even the financially troubled Pan American professes to see a potential savior in the Caribbean, a region it dominated for years. Since Delta recently bought 45 percent of Pan Am, along with most of its European routes, Pan Am has to concentrate on the Caribbean and Latin America.
"We'll continue to go to 16 Caribbean locations, mostly with nonstops from Miami and New York," said Jeff Kriendler, a Pan Am vice president. "But while we're selling the Caribbean along the Eastern Seaboard, Delta will be selling the region for their flights and ours in cities like Dallas, Cincinnati and Salt Lake City."
 
Deterrents to Visiting
 The Caribbean is already accessible to many Americans, of course. Almost 11.5 million people flew there from the United States last year, according to the Department of Transportation, up from 10.7 million in 1989 and almost 8.8 million in 1985. But airline officials say the increase would have been much greater had it not been for the Persian Gulf war, which gave many potential airline passengers the jitters, and the weak United States economy. Sixty-five percent of the Caribbean's visitors are Americans, Ms. Martinez said, so a weak American economy badly hurts the Caribbean.
As the weakness in the economy continues, airlines are not raising fares above last year's levels. T.W.A.this fall is offering a low fare of about $250 between New York and San Juan. Continental's autumn round-trip excursion fare from Newark to St. Maarten is $383. Key Air's New York to Aruba round-trip fare is $379. Delta's fare from La Guardia to Nassau is $344 round trip. All these fares require advance purchases, midweek departure and a Saturday overnight; generally they are nonrefundable. These fares rise after Dec. 15, the start of the high season.
The dominant carrier in the Caribbean these days is American Airlines, which flies 74 daily flights, including 36 nonstops. Next month the airline will inaugurate a daily nonstop from Miami to Aguadilla, P.R., but most of its flights from the mainland are to San Juan, which has been American's Caribbean hub since1986.
From San Juan, continuing passengers have a choice of several regional airlines, including American Airlines' affiliate, American Eagle, which has 94 flights a day to 14 Caribbean destinations. Another regional carrier, LIAT Ltd., owned by 11 Caribbean governments and based in Antigua, flies to 26 islands. Having overcome difficulties with its on-time record, the carrier is considered greatly improved of late by American travel officials. Last spring it opened its first United States sales office, in New York, in hopes of doubling the 150,000 North American passengers it carries each year. LIAT has two "explorer fares": $169 ($199 in July and August, December and January), with a maximum of three stopovers, valid for 21 days. And a $357 year-round fare, valid for 30 days, gives unlimited travel to any of its 26 destinations. The cheaper of the two fares must be purchased in the United States, the other can be purchased anywhere in the Caribbean.
With its ambitious schedule to Miami, Atlanta and Toronto, B.W.I.A., the carrier owned by Trinidad and Tobago, is much more than a regional airline. This winter it will inaugurate the only nonstop from New York to Trinidad, five times weekly, and direct service six times a week to Tobago, with stops in Barbados, Grenada and Trinidad. (Since Tobago enlarged its runway by 50 percent last spring, making it accessable to wide-body aircraft, visitors no longer have to change planes in Trinidad.) But with flights to more than a dozen islands, the 51-year-old carrier is the Caribbean-based airline best known to Americans by far. Other carriers include Windward Island Airways, Air B.V.I. and Air Guadeloupe.
 
New Flights
 Lots of new flights, in addition to those of B.W.I.A. and Delta, are scheduled for this winter. T.W.A. will add a fourth daily flight from New York to San Juan. Air Jamaica will have eight flights a week from Atlanta to Jamaica, up from five flights most of last year. And Minerve, the French airline, will begin charter flights next month between Kennedy Airport in New York and Martinique and Guadeloupe in the French West Indies.
ALM Antillean Airline pulled out of New York last spring, but now flies to Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao four times a week from Atlanta, as well as most days from Miami.
Air Jamaica has also modified its schedule from New York so passengers can arrive by midday.
Like European-bound passengers last summer, tourists are still waiting until the last minute before booking flights and packages. While that probably reflects economic uncertainty, some carriers say it also reflects the hope that air fares and Caribbean hotel rates will fall. But that is unlikely, they say, since air fares have already fallen over the past few years when adjusted for inflation.
Among the many package fares available are: Pan Am's all-inclusive three-night package from New York to Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic for $634 per person. Delta's "dream vacation" packages to St. Thomas (as low as $579 per person for three nights), St. Croix ($599) and St. John ($849). Air Jamaica's three-nights in Jamaica from $409 (without meals) to $755 per person (all-inclusive).
Many of those package fares are offered by travel agents, while some agents have put together outstanding packages of their own.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By Terrence P. Neilan

 BODY:

On the Trail of Ellis Peters
Q. We are big fans of Ellis Peters, the medieval mystery writer who bases her stories in Shropshire, England. Are there any tours of Shropshire with an Ellis Peters connection? -- Lisa and Kirk Werner, Morris Plains, N.J.
A. The British Tourist Authority in New York says it is not aware of any organized tours, although local travel agents may well put together tours of their own. 
 The authority does, however, offer something that would appeal to all Peters fans: a free brochure listing four driving tours of Shropshire based on the Peters works. The brochure, "Brother Cadfael Car Trails," is named for her books' main character, a medieval monk.
The first tour, "The Hermit of Eyton Forest Trail," covers 25 miles in the heart of Shropshire, passing through many of the places mentioned in "The Hermit of Eyton Forest." Peters fans will recognize such villages and hamlets as Atcham, Leighton and Wroxeter, as well as the market town of Much Wenlock.
The second tour, "The Marches Trail," covers 31 miles in the border country with Wales. Many of the scenes from "Dead Man's Ransom" are set there. The area is rich in such local crafts as pottery, jewelery and knitwear. The third tour, "The Hugh Beringar Trail," covers 30 miles of villages, parish churches and market towns in north Shropshire. It also features scenes from "Dead Man's Ransom" and is named for one of the book's characters, the Sheriff of Shropshire.
The fourth tour, "The Virgin in the Ice Trail," is the most scenic. It covers 54 miles and passes through the rollings hills of south Shropshire as well as the market towns of Ludlow and Bridgnorth. Much of the trail is featured in "The Virgin in the Ice."
The brochure is available from the British Tourist Authority, 40 West 57th Street, New York, N.Y. 10151; telephone (212) 581-4708. It can also be obtained in Shropshire at tourist information centers in Ludlow, Shrewsbury, Oswestry and Whitchurch. Included with the brochure is a four-page pamphlet listing accommodations in areas covered by the tours.
 
24 Hours in Seattle
 Q. My wife and I will be arriving at the Seattle airport in late November around 9 P.M. and will leave by ferry about 24 hours later. Without renting a car, what is the best way to spend about 24 hours in Seattle? -- W. P. Johnson Jr., Old Greenwich, Conn.
A. The heart of Seattle has trendy cafes, spectacular mountain views and a giant open-air farmers' market, all within easy walking distance in the downtown area. But be aware that many of Seattle's hills rival San Francisco's, especially in the areas most frequented by tourists. A bus that makes the 35-minute journey from the airport costs $1.
For sightseeing, a free bus rolls through downtown every 10 minutes, making stops at all the attractions. Among the most popular sites is the Pike Place Market, covering about three city blocks. The market, which is open every day, has 105 farm stands, 220 stands offerings crafts and about 300 selling clothing, antiques and foodstuffs. Pike Place is also famous for its fish market.
From the market you can hop a bus to Pioneer Square, the city's historic district. It has antique shops, art galleries, cafes, drugstores and nightclubs. You might also drink a latte (espresso with steamed milk, a popular Seattle beverage) at the popular Grand Central Bakery. The Elliott Bay Book Company is the place for browsing.
For a panoramic view of Seattle and the Olympic and Cascade Mountains and Mount Rainier, try the 520-foot observation deck at the Space Needle, built for the 1962 World's Fair.
To get to the needle, take the Monorail, which is also a leftover from the World's Fair. The Monorail can be boarded in the downtown shopping district. The less-than-a-minute ride costs 60 cents.
 
The Indianapolis 500
 Q. Could you please tell me how I can get tickets to the Indianapolis 500 next year and the names of agencies to contact for places to stay. -- Ginny Burke, Sayville, L.I.
A. Next year's Indianapolis 500, the 76th, will be held from May 22 through 25. The following tour operators are among those offering tickets and land packages:
Grayline of Indianapolis, 9075 North Meridian Street, Indianapolis, Ind. 46260, (317) 573-0699, offers three-day packages that include accommodations at Quality Inn Suites or the Radisson Plaza. Packages include reserved seats at the race, tickets to the race parade the day before, breakfast and a box lunch on race day and transfers. Rates range from $765 to $1,160 per person in double occupancy.
Tickets and Travel, 1099 North Meridian Street, Suite 155,Indianapolis, Ind. 46204, (317) 633-6406, sells a package with three nights at the Courtyards by Marriott, reserved seats at the race and parade, transfers and daily Continental breakfast. Prices are $725 per person.
Regal Sports Vacations, 3029 West 39th Street, Suite 3011, Indianapolis, Ind. 46208, (317) 291-9500, offers packages at luxury hotels (Westin or Hyatt Regency), first-class (Sheraton), business class (Signature Inn) or economy (Days Inn). Rates range from $595 to $1,095. Packages include a choice of reserved race seats and either a ticket to the parade or the drivers' meeting, which is held in Gasoline Alley.
 
Austro-Hungarian Expo
 Q. Where can I find information on the Austria-Hungary Expo for 1992-93? -- Magdi Biro Fischer, Anaheim Hills, Calif.
A. The Expo planned for two sites, one in Vienna and one in Budapest, was to have been held in 1994. But for two reasons -- one ecological, the other financial -- it was canceled. Budapest pulled out because of a lack of money. Vienna had a referendum on the fair and most voters objected to devoting open space to the venture.
 
Springtime in Bogota
 Q. My son will be attending the University of Bogota, Colombia, all next year. What information can you give me about the weather and the type of clothing he should take? -- R. Gillen, Warwick, Mass.
A. Bogota, in the words of The Times Books World Weather Guide, is truly the city of the perpetual spring. Nights are cool but never really cold and frost is unknown. Sunshine averages from three to five hours a day thoughout the year, with the days feeling warm but never really hot.
Remarkably, there is only a four-degree variation between the lowest average daily maximum temperature (64, in July) and the highest (68, in February). Precipitation is at its highest in October (6.3 inches).

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Livingston Plaza;
Designed for a Dozen, but One Tenant's Enough

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
DESIGNED for as many as a dozen tenants, Livingston Plaza, the newest office building in downtown Brooklyn, wound up with only one occupant, the New York City Transit Authority.
But that suited the developers, Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation and Starrett Housing Corporation. After all, the Transit Authority did more than take all 600,000 square feet; it bought the whole building, at a reported profit to the developers of $12 million. The agency is using Livingston Plaza to house some 2,500 workers who had been dispersed through downtown Brooklyn. Headquarters remains at 370 Jay Street. 
 Did the deal amount to a quasi-public body bailing out a private real estate enterprise?
"It was a case of something that wouldn't necessarily have happened without us," said Frederick S. Harris, director of real estate for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "But nobody said, 'Help these guys.' Quite the opposite. The city seemed interested in having us go to other projects.
"There is no question that our annual cost is more than if we had stayed in our various spaces, but it's quite clear that the annual cost will be better than it would have been if we had simply upgraded our leased space."
The building itself, core and shell, cost about $95 million, Mr. Harris said. To complete the interior work, another $25 million was needed. It amounted, he said, to an effective rent of less than $20 a square foot.
The argument for purchasing a building was that the Transit Authority, using tax-exempt bonds in the transaction, would ultimately be liable for lower debt service than it would be as a tenant absorbing the cost of the higher-interest conventional financing taken out by its landlord.
"The basic building and tenant package ended up at $200 to $210 per rentable square foot," Mr. Harris said.
"And that was for a fully equipped building -- everything up to the marker boards on the wall," added Robair A. Reichenstein, the deputy real estate director at the M.T.A.
The Permanent Citizen's Advisory Committee to the M.T.A. took no position on the project, said its associate director, JoAnn Katzban. Neither did the Straphangers' Campaign, another watchdog group.
But State Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat, criticized the deal as long ago as March 1989, when he said: "Acceptable cheaper space is available elsewhere to satisfy legitimate space demands. And there is absolutely no reason why the T.A. has to have a brand new building."
Many employees have already moved into the 12-story, trapezoidal structure, which has massive, turreted corners; gleaming, piston-like columns and alternating bands of dusty gray and charcoal gray tiles. The "plaza" of Livingston Plaza is a triangular apron filled with three- to four-foot-high islands that double as planters and seating coves.
Helmut Jahn of Chicago was the architect. The interiors were by the Manhattan architectural firm of Gruzen Samton Steinglass.
The story of Livingston Plaza is that of two initiatives in downtown Brooklyn, originally separate, that converged in the late 1980's.
In July 1985, Cohen and Starrett were designated developers of an office building on a city-owned block bounded by Livingston, Smith and Schermerhorn Streets and Boerum Place. They were to lease the parcel from the city for 99 years and the structure was to be completed in 1988.
"The original plan was to develop the site in such a way as to be attractive and economic for back-office users from the financial-services industry," said Charles Steven Cohen, president and chief executive officer of Cohen Brothers. With rents in the low to mid-$20's, the building was to position itself as an alternative to New Jersey, in particular.
Of course, as of October 1987, all bets were off that involved financial-service concerns.
At about the same time, Mr. Harris was moving to consolidate the authority's "significant tenancies" in downtown Brooklyn. This included 200,000 square feet in an old garment factory, 25 Chapel Street, at Flatbush Avenue Extension. Among its drawbacks, transit officials said, was that elevators would catch on fire, rain poured on to desk tops and pigeons roosted in unoccupied floors, all while four mortgage holders fought among themselves following the disappearance of the landlord.
THE M.T.A. issued a request for proposals, prepared by Gruzen Samton Steinglass and Pattison Partners. It stated that the Transit Authority needed more than 400,000 square feet of space near 370 Jay Street, and specified such criteria as floor sizes, ceiling heights, floor load capacities, column spacing and power requirements.
In November 1987, responses came from the Cohen-Starrett partnership, as well as the developers of the Metrotech complex, Albee Square Mall and two adjoining buildings on Jay Street that were to be renovated.
The Cohen-Starrett partnership was "aggressive on price from the beginning," Mr. Harris said, and its building was closest to 370 Jay Street. Since the overall project had already gone through the city's land-use review procedure, it was left pretty much intact. "We couldn't change a species of tree in the plaza," Mr. Harris said.
While the turreted layout created some problems for the interior architects, Michael A. Kazan of Gruzen Samton Steinglass said it was "by and large a very good building, ideally sized and located for the T.A."
But the partnership was not without problems, Mr. Harris noted. "The T.A. was having a long, drawn-out battle with the Cohens on the quality of their subway work in their building across from Bloomingdale's," he said, meaning 750 Lexington Avenue, between 59th and 60th Streets, which was also designed by Mr. Jahn. (Today, Mr. Cohen dismisses the incident as "a small thing that had to be worked out.")
MORE critically, the Livingston Plaza parcel was deemed too desirable by City Hall, Mr. Harris said, in that it would probably succeed on its own, without a large municipal tenant.
"They thought that this was the one building that would get built on spec," Mr. Harris recalled. "We got a year on hold where we went through a political interchange over the best site. The one site the city really wanted us to go to was Atlantic Terminal, which hadn't even submitted a proposal."
That debate lasted until the end of 1988, after which intense negotations began with the developers that led to an agreement in November 1989. The ground lease on the city-owned parcel was revised at this time.
In September 1990, $200 million in bonds were issued by the Transit Authority, with yields between 7 and 8 percent. Among the buyers was Cohen Brothers Realty. Under the agreement, Mr. Harris said, payment was not made until unfinished construction items amounted to $500,000. That was a powerful inducement to the developers to build the structure quickly.
"They had a conventional construction loan from Chase and their interest was roughly $30,000 a day," Mr. Reichenstein said. "That meant it wasn't really worth arguing a lot."
With the end in sight at Livingston Plaza, perhaps the biggest challenge faced today by Cohen Brothers is finding tenants for the 100,000 square feet at 3 Park Avenue that were abruptly vacated two months ago when the Family Media magazine publishing concern shut down without warning. The 41-story tower, between 33d and 34th Streets, has a total of 600,000 square feet.
At 750 Lexington Avenue, about 80,000 of 340,000 square feet are vacant, Mr. Cohen said. There are lesser vacancies at the Crystal Pavilion, 805 Third Avenue, a 550,000-square-foot building at 50th Street; 475 Park Avenue South, a 340,000-square-foot building at 32d Street and 3 East 54th Street, a 200,000-square-foot building.

HEADLINE: New York Ranks High in Housing Bias

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
IN the largest study of housing discrimination ever completed for the Federal Government, researchers have concluded that the problem is more prevalent in New York City and its suburbs than in any of 24 other major metropolitan areas across the United States, particularly for the Spanish-speaking minority.
The study coincides with a rapid increase in fair-housing complaints to regulatory agencies in the New York area. Taken together, the new findings from both Federal and city agencies suggest that housing discrimination has persisted, and perhaps become more common, despite a succession of laws enacted in the 1980's to prevent it. 
 In a small number of cases, the discrimination has come in its most virulent and obvious forms, involving harassment of minority tenants.
"I adjusted to this society long ago, and I never expected this," said Francisco Caballero, a 73-year-old native of Puerto Rico, who, according to court records, awoke to find the wall behind his three- room, $319-a-month apartment in Astoria, Queens, spray-painted with the images of a Ku Klux Klansman, a cross and a stick figure dangling from a noose.
In a case that has been appealed to the New York State Surpreme Court, he and three other tenants of the Astoria building in June were awarded $22,500 in damages from their landlords, a family of immigrants from Greece.
More often, according to civil rights lawyers and other experts, the techniques are more subtle.
"People no longer stand at the front door and say, 'Go away, I don't rent to blacks,' " said Phylliss Spiro, director of the Open Housing Center, a nonprofit New York City group that helps discrimination victims gather evidence against landlords, home sellers and real estate agents. "They smile very politely and say, 'What a shame, we've just taken a deposit from someone else.' " In the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development study, "testers" -- groups of three that included whites, blacks and Spanish-speaking people -- posed as prospective renters or buyers to see if they were treated differently when making similar requests.
IN the New York area, the testers found that Hispanic people experienced some form of discrimination 61 percent of the time when trying to buy and 53 percent of the time when trying to rent, houses or apartments. The problem was less severe for them in all other cities studied.
For New York-area blacks, discrimination was experienced 44 percent of the time when they tried to buy and 40 percent of the time when they attempted to rent. In only three other cities -- Chicago, Dayton, Ohio, and Macon, Ga., -- was the incidence of discrimination against blacks higher. "For blacks, the New York area is about as bad as any place in the country, and for Hispanics, it is easily the worst," said Margery Austin Turner, senior researcher for the Urban Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington, which conducted the study with analysts from Syracuse University.
In all, 3,800 visits were paid to real estate agents and rental brokers in 25 cities during the spring and summer of 1989 to measure various forms of discrimination ranging from outright rejection of minority applicants to unequal requirements for security deposits. The project was paid for with $2 million in Federal funds.
While their broadest conclusions were released in September, the researchers last month provided a more detailed analysis at the request of The New York Times, comparing the 25 metropolitan areas.
"New York came out the worst, or nearly the worst, more than any other place in the study," said John Yinger, a professor of economics at Syracuse University, who directed the project. He said there was no basis for historic comparison because the only similar study, conducted by H.U.D. in 1977, did not try to assess the problem of discrimination against Spanish-speaking people, and used different methods.
But regulators in New York City said their discrimination caseload has increased sharply.
The New York regional office of H.U.D., in an analysis separate from the Federal study, said its complaints of housing discrimination in New York and New Jersey nearly doubled in the fiscal year that ended last June 30, to 936 from 481.
The two states, with only 10 percent of the nation's population, now have 20 percent of its housing discrimination cases under investigation, the agency said.
In New York City, the Human Rights Commission, which is responsible for enforcing local fair-housing laws, said it brought 22 cases of discrimination before an administrative law judge in the last fiscal year, and reached judgments against landlords and home sellers in every one. During the 1980's, the agency typically brought about 10 cases a year.
The increase comes at a turbulent time for racial and ethnic relations, when memories of violent strife are fresh in neighborhoods like Crown Heights and Bensonhurst in Brooklyn and Howard Beach in Queens. City officials said that there was no proof of a link between these incidents and housing discrimination but that they were convinced it exists.
"The issue in these communities is turf -- who belongs and who doesn't -- and housing discrimination is at the core of the problem," said Rolando Acosta, deputy commissioner for law enforcement for New York City's Human Rights Commission.
Nor is the problem confined to neighborhoods that are poor, segregated or have a history of tension.
"This is the last place I expected this to happen," said Weldon Turner, a 31-year-old lawyer and stock trader for Salomon Brothers, the securities firm, whose case was resolved by the Human Rights Commission in June.
According to the court record, Mr. Turner, who is black, and his wife, Sharon Friedman, who is white, were denied a $1,895-a-month rental apartment on West 80th Street just off West End Avenue because of his race, even though they had offered the landlord two months' rent in advance and two additional months' rent as a security deposit. The building is in an integrated neighborhood that ranks among Manhattan's most expensive.
Their case, like that of Mr. Caballero, was ruled on by the Human Rights Commission, which ordered the building's landlord to pay them $10,500 in damages. The ruling is being appealed.
Housing analysts, attorneys and advocates of the poor point to a host of reasons why housing discrimination persisted in the 1980's and may be increasing in the 90's.
The economic boom and acute housing shortages of the 80's, while enriching landlords and home sellers, also made it easier for them to discriminate against some applicants, according the Craig Gurian, chief counsel of the Human Rights Commission's Law Enforcement Bureau. That was because demand was so strong that they were able to find other tenants or buyers quickly, he added.
Economic expansion in the last decade also meant that the incomes and aspirations of many minority families were rising, leading them to seek housing in neighborhoods previously dominated by white, middle-class and affluent residents, sometimes creating tension. Now, with the region's real estate market in a deep slump, discriminatory practices may be becoming more pervasive because black, Spanish-speaking and other minority people are finding bargains in more attractive neighborhoods.
Shifting immigration patterns may have also played a role. While New York and its suburbs have always attracted disparate ethnic groups and nationalities, the influx during the 80's was led by diverse and sometimes antagonistic groups -- Dominicans, Haitians, Koreans, Chinese, Iranians, Syrians, Greeks and Soviet Jews.
"Some of these groups came without the support networks and sources of capital that previous immigrants had developed," said Robert Lake, a housing analyst and associate professor at Rutgers University's Center for Urban Policy Research. As a result, he added, some of the new immigrants have been "particularly vulnerable."
The problem was underscored in June and July by a series of fire bombings of the Fillmore Real Estate agency in Canarsie, a predominantly Italian and Jewish neighborhood in southeast Brooklyn.
The agency, under a court order to stop "racial steering" -- the practice of showing minority applicants only those homes on blocks already dominated by minorities -- had been showing black applicants its full range of listings.
The case of Mr. Caballero attracted less notice, but also resulted in violence. Court records show that after the spray-painted figures appeared on his wall in October, 1986, a series of confrontations ensued with his landlords, Irene, Matheos and Steven Vizentinis, themselves recent immigrants from Greece.
Ultimately, in 1988, Mr. Caballero's 35-year-old nephew, Hector Rodriguez, who shared the Astoria apartment, was beaten bloody, and the two men moved out.
In their response to the Human Rights Commission investigation, the Vizentinis family said their disagreements with Mr. Caballero and his nephew did not involve racial or ethnic bias. According to the court record, they offered various intepretions of the painting on their tenants' wall -- that it represented a street lamp in Paris, a chandelier or a "silly puppet."
Some of the increased recent caseload before the government agencies results from broader and more vigorous laws against discrimination that were enacted in the 1980's. Lawyers say that the public is gradually learning its rights under the laws, and complaints are rising.
CHIEF among the recent laws are the 1988 amendments to the Federal Fair Housing Act, which accorded disabled people and families with children the same level of protection that had previously been provided racial, ethnic and religious minorities. The amendments came two years after New York City broadened its own local laws to prohibit discrimination against lesbians and gays, who are not covered by Federal statutes.
The city laws were amended further in September. Landlords with two-family houses, who had previously been exempt from most of the local fair-housing regulations, are now fully covered. All landlords and real estate agents named in discrimination cases must now respond in 30 days, faster than previously required.
To detect and combat discrimination, government agencies and nonprofit groups have crafted a powerful weapon through the expanding use of "testers" or "auditors." Typically, teams including a white, black and Hispanic tester, all of them neatly groomed, polite and articulate, visit real estate offices, landlords or mortgage lenders separately to see if they are shown the same properties, offered the same terms and treated equally.
Although the tactic has been used for more than a decade, it has become far more widespread since the late 80's.
TESTERS were also used in all 3,800 visits conducted by the Urban Institute and Syracuse University in its study for the Federal Government. By conducting such a large study, and applying statistical analysis to the results, the researchers said, they were able to document the incidence of subtle forms of discrimination and distinguish random episodes from those that are systemic across the nation.
Among the findings were that 8 percent of the black and Hispanic applicants across the nation who responded to advertisements of homes for sale were told they were no longer available, even though the same homes were later offered to white applicants. Among those applying for rentals, 12 percent of the Hispanic and 15 percent of the black applicants experienced similar discrimination.
The study also assessed the prevalence of more subtle forms of discrimination. It found, for example, that 23.9 percent of the black applicants and 24.6 percent of the Hispanic applicants received less favorable treatment than whites when they applied for rental housing, as measured by such variables as the amount of the security deposit required and whether an application fee was required.
Testers have also been used extensively by the New York City Human Rights Commission, which says it conducted more than 10 tests, each involving a large group of realtors or landlords, in Midwood, Kings Highway, Canarsie, Bay Shore and other Brooklyn neighborhoods in the late 1980's.
Officials of the commission declined to release the results in detail, but said that the tests, and a resulting suit, led to the court order against the Fillmore agency in Canarsie that prohibits it from racial steering. The commission said it is now conducting widespread testing of rental and sales practices in several neighborhoods, but it declined to say where.
One case that demonstrates the effectiveness of using testers in gathering evidence against an individual landlord is the one involving Mr. Turner and Ms. Friedman.
According to the court record, the couple said they responded to an advertisement in The Times for the apartment in October 1988 and made an appointment with Joan Green, who was then its tenant and was planning to move. After they inspected the apartment and decided they wanted it, they were repeatedly blocked by the landlord, Louis Schwartz, in their effort to sign a lease or even make out an application.
Despite repeated entreaties, in which Mr. Turner offered to pay two months' rent in advance and put down two months' additional rent as a security deposit, the court testimony showed, Mr. Schwartz continued to stall. A week after the couple's first visit to the building, the Human Rights Commission, which had been contacted by them, sent out testers to try to rent the apartment.
The testers, a white couple approximately the same age as Mr. Turner and Ms. Friedman, told Mr. Schwartz they had an 11-year-old son. They were offered the apartment. When Mr. Schwartz produced a lease for them to sign, they produced a subpoena for him to appear in court.
In his defense, Mr. Schwartz told the Human Rights Commission that he had not taken a rental application from Mr. Turner and Ms. Friedman because it was his policy not to use them. He also testified, according to the court record, that he did not accept security deposits in advance.

PAINTINGS ON DISPLAY
 William McCloy's paintings, on view at the Slater Memorial Museum in Norwich through Nov. 24, reflect the powerful influence of John Steuart Curry, whom he served as an assistant on major murals. Mr. McCloy's massive figures with meticulously drawn musculature and mythic faces, while reminiscent of Curry, are distinctive and arresting in their own right. The pieces on exhibition are portraits, self-portraits, still lifes and social commentary.
After a long career as an art teacher in several universities around the country Mr. McCloy retired from his last post as chairman of the art department at Connecticut College in 1978.

Rising Vacancy Rate Troubles Westport

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
ON Saturday afternoons the Jaguars and BMW's cruise Westport's busy Main Street, and seemingly recession-proof shoppers browse through Barney's, Laura Ashley and dozens of chic specialty shops where rents have retained their lofty levels of around $55 a square foot.
But along the Post Road a different story unfolds, a tale of empty stores and failing shopping plazas. 
 "It's a two-tiered system," said Marc Nevas, a commercial real estate agent. "Away from Main Street we have around 40 stores vacant compared to 12 in past years."
Far worse off is the office market: 40 percent of office space scattered around town -- 800,000 out of a total of 2.4 million square feet -- is empty. The vacancy rate is the highest in Fairfield County.
"We've never done anything to attract business," said Lois Schine, a Westport resident for 40 years and president of the local Chamber of Commerce. "We have always been a residential community. The quality of life is what brought companies here."
That kind of thinking, while still prevalent in some quarters, is challenged by the realization that prolonged commercial stagnation can lead to higher residential taxes. At a time when even affluent homeowners are economizing, residential property already is heavily taxed. Only 21.5 percent of the communty's taxable property is commercial, the rest is residential.
"Homeowners will not be affected until 1995," said Peter Wolgast, executive assistant to the First Selectman, "when a revaluation takes place. If we still have significant commercial property vacant, it will have a much lower value and therefore lower assessment. That will put a heavier burden on residences."
An effort to determine public support for filling empty offices was made by the Chamber of Commerce last month through a survey done by the Westport office of Yankelovich Clancy Shulman. It indicated that the tax mix could shift by 1995 to 84 percent residental and 17 percent commercial. A typical $500,000 home taxed currently at $5,219 could pay $7,793 by 1996, allowing for inflation and adjustments in assessments.
Mailed to 3,000 households with registered voters, the survey drew 1,000 responses. It contained statistics tracing a rise in commercial vacancies from 22 percent in 1987 to 40 percent, or 16 percentage points above the county average. Average office rents declined from $29.92 in 1987 to $18.21, and property values dropped from $200 a square foot to $93. In 1986, 21 buildings were sold; so far this year, three have been sold.
While 70 percent of the respondents supported the recruitment of businesses to fill vacancies, the absence of specific proposals for doing so generated some skepticism. "We are suffering from the same economic malaise that has beset the entire country," said the First Selectman, Douglas Wood. "I don't think we should try to predict four years into the future. The chamber survey did not ask whose problem it is, nor did it lead to any conclusions about what should be done."
THE town is receptive to business, he emphasized, but he added that "we will not offer financial incentives and we have no plans for any kind of tax abatement," a policy echoed by Ms. Schine at the Chamber of Commerce.
"People we surveyed want the tax base broadened by encouraging businesses to fill up the empty space," she said. "They are not willing to pay increased taxes or put up with reduced services resulting from buildings remaining empty."
The survey also created apprehension among those who believe that it paves the way for commercial tax breaks that would increase taxes for homeowners and encourage future development. Sidney Kramer, a lawyer who is president of a group called Save Westport, said, "We have been fighting commercialization for 10 years, and there is still plenty of room to do a lot of damage."
While town zoning has tightened to restrict commercial development mostly to the Post Road, an additional 280,000 square feet could be built. "The purpose of the survey," Mr. Kramer said, "was to ask for a tax break, to allow the chamber to state that public opinion favors concessions to entice businesses into town. We are overbuilt by 40 percent. That's the developers' problem, and the alternative to higher taxes is to lower rentals at the landlord's expense."
A shrunken daily work force has many retailers feeling threatened. Robert Hertzel, owner of Klein's Stationery on Main Street and president of the Downtown Merchants Association, complains that his office supply business has gone down by 20 to 30 percent in the last four years.
"There are fewer people coming into Westport," he said. "The barbers have fewer customers and there are fewer patrons in the restaurants. Fewer houses are being sold." He estimates that the number of employees coming into town weekdays has declined by 3,000 in the last four years.
COMPARED to the major office centers of Stamford, Norwalk and Greenwich, Westport's commercial market is viewed by many realtors as boutique in style.
"It's attractive only to smaller firms," said Al Remsen, executive vice president of William Pitt Real Estate in Stamford. "The typical corporate office tenant shies away from that type of location in favor of a full service office setup."
The 385,000-square-foot Stauffer complex on 54 acres off Exit 18 of Interstate 95 was vacant for three years, badly skewing Westport's vacancy rate. Last month leases were signed for 33,000 square feet by American International Group, a New York reinsurer, and for 113,000 square feet by Phibro Energy of Greenwich, a crude-oil trader. That will drop the vacancy rate to 34 percent.
Another positive sign is the impending renovation of an empty 36,000-square-foot building at 55 Post Road West. Stuart Longman, head of the DLM Construction Company in Norwalk, bought it in June from Mutual of New York for $3 million, a bargain at under $85 a square foot.
A block from Main Street, it is "on a site comparable to Fifth Avenue and 57th Street," Mr. Longman said. A skylighted atrium, a granite and onyx lobby and a new brick exterior in keeping with surrounding buildings are planned.
"We will make it into a triple-A building and rent it at $14 a foot, the bottom of the Westport scale," he said.

HEADLINE: Florio Counterattack Carries Risks

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
GOV. JIM FLORIO'S name isn't on the ballot in Tuesday's legislative elections, but if there were any doubts about his importance to the outcome of the voting, the Governor cleared them up during the last two weeks by joining the campaign debate.
The Governor's $2.8 billion tax program, enacted last year, has angered voters and raised the hopes of the Legislature's Republican minority, which is looking to wrest control of the State Senate and the Assembly from the Democrats for the first time in 20 years. Democrats currently have a 23-to-17 majority in the Senate and a 43-to-37 edge in the Assembly. 
 Since only Democrats voted for Mr. Florio's program, Republican candidates have been running under their party's banner, talking about the tax package and frequently mentioning the Governor by name. Many Democrats are running without their party's label and act as if they have never heard of taxes or anyone named Florio.
His aides deny that the Governor is angry about the way the campaign has played out, saying he understands the game of politics. But Mr. Florio has directed some of his sharpest comments at those Democrats who are trying to win election by distancing themselves from the decisions they made a few months ago.
In a speech at a Mercer County Democratic fund-raising event, the Governor told the Democrats to "get off their knees" and become "javelin throwers instead of javelin catchers." Mr. Florio pushed for a defense of his tax program, which was enacted in response to a growing budget deficit and which provided money for property tax relief and school aid.
Last week in Essex County, Mr. Florio said the Democrats were in danger of changing the party's symbol from a donkey to a chameleon by their apparent eagerness to look and sound like their Republican opponents.
The Governor told 800 Democrats who attended the county organization's annual pre-election rally that people who were suffering in the current recession should "send a message" to President Bush by voting against Republicans on Tuesday. He also pictured the Republicans as a party that encouraged bigotry by accepting David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader and a candidate for governor of Louisiana, as a member.
Mr. Floro's decision to step into the campaign so aggressively at a time when Democratic candidates were trying to avoid having to defend his, and their, program carries a certain amount of political risk, but it also changed the tenor of the campaign and took away the Republican advantage of being on the attack with no one firing back.
Stephen A. Salmore, professor of political science at Rutgers University and a Republican consultant, was delighted by Mr. Florio's decision. "I'd like to give him money to go on television," Mr. Salmore said.
But, while he said he believed that the Governor's lack of popularity would not enable him to rally his party's candidates in the election, Mr. Salmore said that "to try and write his political obituary would be ridiculous." Mr. Florio's term is not up until 1993 and, Mr. Salmore said, "Two years is a long, long time."
The members of the Legislature will be on the ballot in 1993 with the Governor, and if Republicans capture control on Tuesday, they, as well as Mr. Florio, will have to tell the voters what they have done. "Florio's a counterpuncher, and he'll have the Republicans to do battle with," Mr. Salmore said. "Right now he has no one to battle with."
Richard W. Roper, executive director of the Council on New Jersey Affairs at Princeton University, said Mr. Florio had made the right decision to stand up for his programs. "He doesn't have anything to lose," Mr. Roper said. "The Democrats aren't helped by being quiet since the public holds them largely responsible for what has happened anyway."
Mr. Roper said the public's anger over the tax program has stood in the way thus far of any broad acceptance of the need for new tax revenue. But, as time passes and the financial problems New Jersey faced last year are showing up elsewhere, Mr. Roper said, there is a chance for a greater level of understanding.
"Clearly, New Jersey is not alone in that boat, and fiscal problems are showing up in other states in the Northeast and around the country," he said. "It's likely that the public will conclude at some point that while the action taken by the administration was something they did not prefer, it may have been necessary."
 
'Typical Florio Aggressive Move'
 Jeff Michaels, executive director of the Republican State Committee, said Mr. Florio's decision to step out in front on the tax issue when most members of his party were running from it "is a typical Florio aggressive move that appears to be timed to try to reverse the momentum of our campaign."
Before he suddenly entered the fray, the Governor's recent public appearances had been devoted to publicizing law-enforcement initiatives, like promoting the rights of crime victims, Mr. Michaels said, indicating that Mr. Florio had been following advice to divert the public's attention from the tax issue.
Steve DeMicco, executive director of the Democratic State Committee, said the Governor was simply "standing up for something he feels very strongly about." He said Mr. Florio had obviously wanted Democrats to do what some candidates had already begun to do: talk about the benefits of the programs financed by the increases.
"I feel fine having the Governor reminding people of the benefits of the program," Mr. DeMicco said. "Something might happen from it, and it can only be good."
Jon Shure, Mr. Florio's spokesman, said, "The Governor felt the need to communicate strongly with the public about the reasons for the program." Mr. Shure said Mr. Florio believed that if the public wanted to elect Republicans it would do so without voting for Democrats who were trying to look like Republicans.
"This isn't about tax votes, since Republicans voted for tax increases in the 1980's," Mr. Shure said. "They saw the same problems we did in the 1990's, but they made a political decision to say to the Democrats, 'You provide every vote for the taxes' and we'll run against them." Thus far the Republicans have been getting "a free ride" by not being forced to say how they would have met the state's fiscal problems, he said.
 
Republican Attack on Tax Program
 The Republicans have been saying that the Governor's tax program was the wrong solution to a problem created in large part by the recession and that it has exacerbated the economic downturn by creating higher unemployment and business failures. The Republicans have promised to roll back the state sales tax to 6 cents from the 7 cents it was pegged at in the Governor's program and to make up the $500 million that the rollback would cost by cutting spending.
The Democrats argue that such economies do not exist and point out that a looming budget deficit next year makes the Republican promises unrealistic.
Both parties have concentrated much of their spending in 7 of the 40 state legislative districts where the resignations of incumbent lawmakers, a realignment dictated by the 1990 census or demographic changes have changed once strong districts for either party into virtually open seats.
 
Closely Watched Races
 Among the most closely watched races are those in the Fourth District in Camden County and some surrounding towns, where Senator Daniel J. Dalton, the Senate majority leader, decided not to seek re-election; the 10th District, chiefly in Ocean County, represented for 18 years by Senator John F. Russo, a former Senate president and Democratic gubernatorial candidate, who also decided to retire, and the 14th District in Mercer County, where Senator Francis J. McManimon, a 20-year Democratic veteran of the Legislature, the last 10 years in the Senate, is facing a strong challenge.
Others are the 13th District in Monmouth County, where Senator Richard Van Wagner, a Democratic Senator since 1983 and an Assemblyman for 10 years before that, decided not to seek another term, and the 18th District in Middlesex, where the Democratic incumbent, Senator Thomas H. Paterniti, was defeated in the Democratic primary in June.
Also, the 30th District, a new central New Jersey district created to reflect population changes noted in the census, and the 38th District in Bergen County, where the Democratic incumbent, Senator Paul J. Contillo, who has served six years in the Assembly and eight in the Senate, is campaigning on his refusal to vote for Mr. Florio's tax program.
Joan M. Haberle, the New Jersey Secretary of State, estimates that 48 percent of the state's 3,677,766 voters will go to the polls on Tuesday. This translates into a turnout of 1,765,326 voters.

HEADLINE: More Towns Regulating Yard Sales

BYLINE: By ALBERT J. PARISI

 BODY:
IN communities throughout the state, garage and yard sales are so numerous that traffic comes to a halt and sidewalks take on the appearance of a bazaar, with knickknacks, haggling customers and, for the more industrious, even refreshments.
But in recent years a growing number of municipalities have begun to regulate or to enforce existing regulations on such sales. The new regulations take a variety of approaches, often in combination with one another. Some require permits, others limit the number of sales a homeowner can hold in a year and still others restrict how many days they may last. 
 Officials say the new emphasis on regulation and enforcement is less a matter of raising revenue for municipalities than an attempt to keep residents from turning yard sales into a sideline business that creates hardships for neighbors.
"In recent years, because of the popularity of garage sales due to recessionary economic times, we've seen many towns adding to or dusting off existing ordinances and vigorously enforcing them," said William G. Dressel Jr., assistant executive director and chief lobbyist for the New Jersey State League of Municipalities. The league is a Trenton-based nonprofit lobbying agency that represents 562 of the state's 567 cities and towns.
Mr. Dressel said the league had monitored some 50 towns where regulations were currently in place.
"The pressure is on many towns to get after those who are using garage sales as a means of carrying on an unreported business, and the best tool at a municipality's disposal to protect its safety concerns are such regulations," whether extensive or minute, he said.
Valerie G. Thompson, the clerk of Highland Park Borough in Middlesex County, offered an explanation for the tougher stance on yard sales that was also expressed by other officials. "Here there was a great concern that it was getting out of hand and that something needed to be done,"she said.
She said some people were "taking advantage of the popularity of garage sales" and holding them on weekends regularly, prompting complaints from neighbors who were fearful of either strangers' roving the neighborhood or traffic congestion. The borough limits households to no more than two garage sales a year, and each requires a permit with an accompanying $10 fee.
 
Blocking of Driveways Prohibited
 Ms. Thompson said applicants were responsible for making certain that sidewalks and neighbors' driveways were not blocked by those attending the sales. 
"We strictly enforce it to the extent that if a police officer sees the sale going on, he'll ask to see their permit," she said. "If they don't have one, we'll ask that they get one and pay the fee after the fact. You have to allow for a little leeway."
Noncompliance is punishable by fines ranging from $25 to $100 or 10 days in jail.
In Passaic, permits were adopted for similar reasons. "It just got to the point where we were getting so many complaints that we needed to have some kind of regulations," said Joan A. Koterba, the assistant city clerk.
The city generates little in permit fees; licenses are $5 an applicant, with a surcharge of $2 a person for those contributing items to a sale who are not family members. Passaic's main thrust in the passage of the 1985 permit law "was to get a handle on those who wanted to turn garage sales into an ongoing business," Ms. Koterba said.
In Passaic, residents are limited to two sales a year and are not permitted to post sale signs on utility poles or trees other than those on their own property. Even at that, they must remove such signs within 48 hours of the sale's end.
In Princeton Borough, residents are forbidden to post signs on utility poles, and signs put on trees must be promptly removed at the completion of the sale.
In Hackensack, the Bergen County seat, yard sales have become a common sight from the early spring through late fall for those seeking to clear out basements and attics of duplicate anniversary presents or old and worn items taking up needed space. Eugene Duffy, the city's director of community affairs, said that permits for garage sales were not required but that city ordinances limited residents to no more than one garage sale a year.
 
'Kind of Tough to Enforce'
 "It's kind of tough to enforce, and we've really had no need over the years," Mr. Duffy said. "If we charge, say, $15 a permit per sale, then we have to assign someone in City Hall to keep track of it all, pull that person away from other duties and who knows what else."
He said that in recent years a "few complaints have been raised" by neighbors against neighbors over repetitive sales and "we've had to have a word with people to remind them that there is a law."
"The most complaints we've gotten really concern traffic tieups when your next-door neighbor holds a sale and someone winds up parking and blocking your driveway," Mr. Duffy said. Sometimes, he said, those who complain hold a garage sale the next week to "get even."
In some towns, permits are viewed as a deterrent to a neighborhood's taking on the character of a flea market.
In Hopewell Borough, in Mercer County, local officials became concerned in 1986 when some families began holding garage sales regularly on weekends.
"We noticed that a few people would buy stuff in bulk at other garage sales and then pretend that they were holding their own yard sale," said Hilary R. Fortenbaugh, the borough clerk. "A yard sale is one thing; a private business is another."
 
Limit of Two Sales a Year
 She said the borough passed a law requiring a $15 permit and a limit of two sales a year for a family. "For the most part, it solved the problem," she said.
But some of the borough's 1,968 residents chose to hold sales without permits because they felt the fee was too high, she said. Since enforcement might have been difficult at best and stood the chance of creating animosity among neighbors, "we chose to keep the limit and lower the fee to $3 for the first sale and $5 for the second," Ms. Fortenbaugh said.
Since the fee was reduced in 1989, "we're issuing more permits than ever and people are actually paying for them instead of ignoring them," she said. The money from the fees, she said, is put into the borough's general fund.
"If we make $100 a year, that's a lot," she said.
While the state's Office of Taxation is clearly aware of the concerns that have prompted permit requirements, it is bound to the understanding that garage sales are run under a tax-exempt status known as "casual sales."
"Receipts for casual sales by law are tax exempt and it is assumed that garage sales" are run occasionally and not as an ongoing business, said Kenneth D. Munn, an office spokesman. "That's not to say that if someone privately sells a car or a boat that it's not taxable, but garage sales are not considered in the same category as, say, a vendor in a flea market who has a permanent space on a regular basis and must be registered to collect sales taxes."
 
An Annual Townwide Sale
 Instead of regulation, officials in New Milford, a middle-class Bergen County community of 16,000, have favored a different tack on garage sales. They have unofficially approved that residents take part in a once-a-year, townwide lawn sale that is sponsored by a local charitable group. The event involves hundreds of families throughout the town.
Dianne Rothweiler, the borough clerk, said there had been few or no complaints in recent years of any one family's holding multiple sales or taking advantage of the lack of regulations.
Some merchants who have benefited from the increase in yard sales are less than enthusiastic about increased regulation.
Elliott Hulick of Dayton, who runs an antiques business in town, says permits are nothing more than a municipality's capitalizing on a family's effort to generate added income.
"Fees and permits are ridiculous, and as far as I'm concerned, it's just the town's way of holding out its hand and demanding a piece of the action," he said. "We pay enough taxes, whether we live here or do business here. To demand more is absurd."
 
Keeping the 'Glut' Down
 But David Dutch of Hopewell, who also operates an antiques shop, says permits are a "good idea which I have no problem with because it keeps the glut down in the area when it comes to these kinds of sales."
He said an occasional yard sale of his merchandise in front of his home enabled him to move merchandise that might not get the same kind of exposure in his shop.
"People are looking for bargains and I price them accordingly; otherwise I'd need a warehouse to store stuff that might accumulate," he said.
Regulation or no, Ulrich C. Knoepflmacher, a professor of English literature at Princeton University who is an avid garage sale shopper, said the lure of the sales would continue to be the occasional bargain, particularly in tough economic times.
"A while back at a sale, I found a Victorian-style china bowl at a wonderful price, still in its original box," he said. "It looked like the owner had gotten it as a Christmas gift and left it unopened, so for a few dollars someone got rid of some clutter and I got a great deal."

Provocative Quilts Stand Out in a Dignified Show

BYLINE: By BETTY FREUDENHEIM

DATELINE: MORRISTOWN

 BODY:
THE craft exhibition of the New Jersey Arts Annual looks spectacular in the spacious new gallery of the Morris Museum. At last, individual works are given ample room. Strong pieces do not intrude on the message or style of subtler works; some large works have an entire wall to themselves.
There is a strength and dignity to this show that should silence forever that tired old question, "Is it art or is it craft?" Who cares about picayune semantics? Here are artistic expressions in wood, fiber, metal, glass or clay, well made and well displayed. 
 In a time of economic uncertainties, it is reassuring to find harmonies in the crafts of the 90's. Some set forth shapes and hues adopted from nature. Other works are rendered in pure black and white, using this stark contrast to emphasize patterns rather than to dazzle the eye.
And the brightly colored items no longer feature those glaring Day-Glo tones that were so common in the 80's. Here vivid coloration sings out with joy, while muted tones express deeper chords.
The artists in the show all live or work in New Jersey. A juror selected work by 39 craft artists; 26 others were invited to participate. Michael W. Monroe, curator in charge at the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, was the juror.
"The works that I have included are ones that have strong visual qualities combined with the technical skills necessary to the realization of those creative ideas," he said. "The exhibition reflects a wide diversity of expressions."
How true. Only the specified geographic requirements make this a regional show. There are no set styles or techniques to identify local origins.
The quilts are truly provocative. Leah Kaspar's "Cathedral" has the lyricism of a stained-glass window at Chartres. The underlying architectural structure is there, but instead of leaded lines and Gothic glass in vivid hues of scarlet or blue, this Burlington artist has stitched together bits of cloth that were printed with violet and mossy green patterns. Somehow this translation from one medium to another is successful. Her hues present the quiet luminosity of a church window on a misty day.
The eight-pointed stars in "Shades of Night" echo a traditional quilt pattern, but Judy Dales of Boonton Township has turned the regular repeat into a sparkling sky. Her stars become scintillating explosions of color, like fireworks sending out particles of brilliant lights.
"Chromium Web," by Merrill Mason of Jersey City, is composed of square-cut pieces of cloth, sewn together in checkerboard fashion. The seams are barely visible because the fabric is covered with phototransfers that could have come from black-and-white snapshots of a trash dump.
The overall pattern is as helter-skelter as its source. Here and there, lines of a Venetian blind or round cooking pots provide rhythmic repeats. Textures predominate in the broken bits of steel, rags and a broken umbrella. Surprisingly, the artist added small green patches woven with metallic threads. They introduce the only color on this quilt.
"Memoirs of Certain Mountains," a quilt by Rita Erickson of Montclair, looks like a Japanese woodblock print of a volcano with lava flowing down one side and fiery smoke issuing from the top. The exact motif recurs nine times in regimented rows. Close examination reveals tiny blossoms on the pale green background and rocky hillsides. What an intriguing balance of precise design, flowery fabrics and implications of disaster.
A master potter, Albert Green of Westfield, is represented by a square platter, a tall jar and a tea bowl. His distinctive sea green glazes are crisscrossed with two or three calligraphic black lines. This work speaks of an Oriental approach that combines a meticulously planned creation with a touch of the unexpected. A seemingly casual drip of glaze or a few scattered dots unify all the other elements.
"Neck Pot," by Carol Townsend of Burlington, has the grace of a well-thrown pot, while its surface becomes an abstract desert scene. There are hints of a river's passing through mountains and deep ravines. At the top, encircling the neck, are the dark clouds of an impending storm. Broad swaths of gold may be reflected light on the still waters.
Sy Shames's porcelain vessel is paper thin and pure white. The gently undulating curves suggest a female torso: a breast, maybe two, perhaps the whole rib cage. His works have subtle curves, but his hints are few. This Basking Ridge artist turns vessels into sculpture. If they were used to contain bouquets of flowers, the work would take on a decidedly surrealistic air.
"Chrysalis," by Steven B. Levine of Dayton, is named after the pupa stage of a butterfly, but the shape also parallels the sleek lines of a jet airliner. This work is an amalgam of walnut and cherry blocks, turned on a lathe; the surface has a sensuously smooth polish. How to display a pointed cylinder so that it maintains its upward thrust? Mr. Levine's solution was a wooden stand reminiscent of an old-fashioned umbrella holder.
Carol Rosen of Califon creates assemblages from bits of wood that formerly served as parts of machines or tools. Her "Gestural Construction VII" is a disk with nail holes, scratches and screws still intact. These details add to rather than distract from the peppered surface. Hung alone on a stark white wall, the piece seems to revolve in place with its inner circles suggesting a secondary turning motion.
Perhaps Renaissance nobles once sported daggers in the shape of Jan Palombo's small pins. The three by this Paterson jewelry maker are gold and silver; the "handles" are encrusted with bright stones.
"House Key Pin," by Marjorie Simon of Highland Park, mocks practical key chains. Her "keys" take the forms of miniature monoliths and Noguchi-like sculptures. The holder looks like a Viking cap with a keyhole smack in the center. Don't try to figure out the symbolism; it's fun to wear jewelry that invites questions.
Overcrowded display cases are the one shortcoming of this show. One contains 13 objects, including jewelry and other media juxtaposed with three long wooden "Strumstick" instruments by Bob McNally of Rockaway. This confused melange conflicts with the delicate intimacy of "Pine Barrens Botanical" by a Mantua artist, Paul Stankard. In the center of his small glass block floats a miniature re-creation of a botanically correct wild plant, complete with blooms and roots.
The show runs through Nov. 24. The Morris Museum, at 6 Normandy Heights Road in Morristown, is open Monday through Saturday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sunday from 1 to 5 P.M. Admission is $2 for adults and $1 for children and the elderly.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
A British Play Called ECC Group

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Andrew H. Teare, the group chief executive of Britain's ECC Group, is a solid kind of gentleman, a burly veteran of the building materials industry. Since taking over in 1990 at the flabby ECC, formerly English China Clays, he has put the company through a rigorous slimming that caught the eye of the investing community. The stock of ECC, the world's largest producer of kaolin, the white clay used to coat and brighten paper, has risen 38 percent since the beginning of the year.
Mr. Teare won many hearts after he arrived from the Rugby Group with his move to keep ECC's dividend steady, using both savings from the restructuring and a reduction in capital spending. He also promised, despite a fall in demand, not to cut prices. In paper coatings and fillers, ECC seems to have the product quality and market dominance to hold or push up prices. 
 He has cut employment, especially in England, where he said ECC "was run on Colonial lines." He has shed unprofitable divisions and is phasing the company out of the housing business. ECC is now concentrating on clay and other industrial minerals with a minor in building materials.
The question is whether the stock has any growth left in it, in light of the doubts about the economic recovery in the United States and the slowdowns in Europe and Japan, all leading markets for ECC.
The stock closed on Friday at 480 pence in London and at $24.50 for its American depository receipt, which represents three ordinary shares and which is traded over the counter. Those prices are just 100 pence and $4 below the company's record highs.
Some analysts in both England and the United States are still enamored with ECC and Mr. Teare's leadership. They see a company that has cut costs and is ready to rebound when sales pick up with the economy. Even some who would not buy the stock now still applaud the changes in structure and culture at ECC and the savvy purchase of the Georgia Kaolin Company last year for $353 million.
But these analysts fear that the stock's high price, combined with a uncertain outlook for paper and advertising and the dismal state of construction, puts the company off limits for now. Advertisers are major users of the paper ECC coats with clay from Cornwall and Georgia.
The analysts are worried that price increases for kaolin and other paper-coating materials will be delayed further into 1992 or 1993, a possibility even some of those buying ECC acknowledge. With the recession and the cost of restructuring, ECC's earnings per share have plummeted two-thirds and even optimists do not expect ECC to retake those heights before 1993.
"We are still buyers both short- and long-term," said David Taylor of Robert Fleming Securities in London. "But it is harder to suggest to people that the stock is going to put on another pound."
Donald A. Pattison, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence in New York, countered: "The paper industry business here and abroad stinks. They are a long way from showing record earnings again."
ECC can be an interesting opportunity for American investors. It is a foreign stock, which adds diversity to a portfolio. But it is also a company with a significant stake in the United States with its purchase of Georgia Kaolin. The company's production of kaolin is now about 60 percent in Britain and 40 percent in the United States. "Within 10 years it will be 40-60," Mr. Teare said. "We are turning this more and more into an American-based company."
But in the United States the A.D.R. is very thinly traded. There are days when there are no trades, and this means it can be difficult and expensive to trade. The A.D.R. has risen only 25 percent this year because the rally of the United States dollar relative to the British pound cut the gains.
The debate over the stock centers on the outlook for the economic recovery in Europe and the United States and the health of the paper and advertising industries. If one is confident about this outlook, then the company could close in on its former level of profitability in 1992.
But if the confidence is not there, then the stock may have had its run for now. If earnings fall short of the most optimistic projections, the price-to-earnings ratio is higher than the averages of the market as a whole and the industrial-materials sector. This makes other recovery-play stocks look more attractive.
Mr. Teare himself still expects the recovery but thinks it is six months off. "There is no real pattern to it at the moment," he said.
But this apparently has not dampened the enthusiasm for the stock. Even as the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, last week called the recovery here "demonstrably sluggish" and the October employment data showed more weakness, ECC's stock in London and the A.D.R. in New York both rose about 5 percent.
Richard Rae of Hoare Govett in London is a fan of the stock for both the short and long term. But he does concede that if ECC jumped to 510 pence a share in a hurry, he "would not be surprised to see a lot of sellers" taking profits.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
For the Bond Market, Heaven Can Wait

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson

 BODY:
As Dante saw it, purgatory was no vacation spot. There, the greedy were consigned to a mountain ledge, with "weeping people everywhere, lying outstretched and face-down on the ground."
Many lost souls are paying a price for the avarice of the 1980's. No one -- not the banks, the Government or the Federal Reserve -- is able to recharge the economy. A fading recovery and Fed easing have failed to make long-term capital much cheaper, an essential for strong growth. But many bond investors and analysts are optimistic that this will happen, ignoring the sizeable risks. 
 Last week, the Fed's bard, Alan Greenspan, tried talking long-term rates down. He chose his own poetic image, "a 50-mile-an-hour head wind," to decry bank stinginess and account for an economy that is going nowhere. The voracious credit demands of the financially prostrate Government help explain why, even after the Fed nudged short-term rates down again on Wednesday, the yield on 30-year Treasuries has gone to 7.93 on Friday from 7.79 percent on Oct. 1.
And who is buying the Treasury's wares these days? The bankers. Of $194.4 billion in Treasury borrowing from January through September, the banks bought about a third, perhaps double the typical ratio. Uncle Sam, it seems, is practically the only guy who can satisfy the banks' flinty credit committees.
Individual investors are also rushing into bonds, with brokerage firms coaxing them to seek higher yields than C.D.'s or money market funds offer.
But bond buyers are jittery. Two weeks ago, mere talk of tax cuts, potentially inflationary, immediately added 30 basis points to yields.
And bond investors are paying more to hedge their positions. Over the last two weeks, options prices have reflected a 10 percent rise in the expected volatility of 30-year bond yields through April.
Those ready to have a party any time yields slip below 8 percent forget what happened when a slowing economy brought the long bond below 7.6 percent in March 1987. "People were chasing yield without any insight into the downside of bonds," said Ian A. MacKinnon, who heads Vanguard's fixed-income funds. A flare-up of inflation propelled the rate to 8.7 percent a month later, as buyers stampeded into shorter maturities. "They all blew out the door at the first sign of a rise in rates," he said. The next significant drop in bond yields came in October, when the stock market crash made a recession seem certain. 
Now, lower interest rates are giving stock market investors the courage to ride the high, foaming surf of an expected recovery in earnings -- the same recovery they have been betting on since the winter. But now even some bond market bulls are beginning to fear that their slow- or no-growth case for lower interest rates conflicts with the case for a recovery strong enough to revive earnings. Souls in purgatory may be bound for paradise, but few know how soon.

HEADLINE: Retailing's Wistful Christmas Dream

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The 20-odd days between Thanksgiving and Christmas were once a magic time for America's retailers. Merchants could count on selling most of their goods at the full retail price and producing as much as half of their profits for the entire year. The pre-Christmas sale was anathema. Shoppers so improvident as to have waited until the last minute were punished with empty shelves. Absolutely no markdowns until December 26. And measured year to year -- with an occasional blip from a recession -- revenues marched ever upward, often posting double-digit growth.
It's been at least four years since retailers enjoyed such a traditional Christmas. Some in the industry contend the glory days ended back as far as '84. 
 Data are inconclusive about exactly when the problems began, but merchants are certain that their Christmas experience is growing steadily bleaker. This year will be no exception. In fact, it could be even worse because of a triple whammy: a short selling season, the dregs of a recession and a debt-ridden consumer.
The real pessimists say things may be even worse than that. Some merchants and retailing analysts have begun to wonder whether the very nature of Christmas as a commercial enterprise may be changing. If they are right, merchants of all stripes, particularly the big department stores, will have to alter their approach to the holidays in years to come. What changes might be involved, however, no one seems to know.
Retailing experts blame their woes on the confluence of two trends.
One is the changed mood of the 1990's, a sort of minimalist backlash to the excesses of the 1980's. Many people simply intend to spend less on gifts for the holidays, and studies of buying habits indicate this shift has been underway since at least 1989. If anything, consumer torpor could accelerate the trend this holiday season.
The other trend is the rise of the mass merchandisers, discounters and outlet stores. They have forced department stores to monkey with their pricing schemes, thus teaching buyers that there is no such thing as paying full price -- just wait and the item will soon be on sale.
 
Who Fills the Stockings?
 "It's not that consumers' stockings will be empty," said Philip Johnson, president of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a consumer research company based in Chicago. "They'll be filled by Wal-mart and Toys 'R Us instead of Bloomingdale's and Marshall Fields."
Patrick M. Dunne, who teaches retailing at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, says merchants have trained the consumer to expect sales every day. "So why should they expect anything different at Christmas?" he asks.
Carl Steidtmann, vice president and chief economist of Management Horizons Inc., a consulting firm in Columbus, Ohio, likens consumers' fondness for product promotions and markdowns to addictions in general. "It's very difficult to break them of that habit," he said. "Promotional activity is like a drug."
As consumers have learned to extend the price waiting game, the result in the last two or three years has been nervous merchants ever quicker to cave in on prices, enshrining the pre-Christmas sale as a means to entice consumers into the store before the last moment and persuade them to open their wallets. Last year, for example, Sears, Roebuck and Company began its traditional post-Christmas clearance sales in early December, forcing other merchants to slash their prices. And the year before, highly leveraged retailers, worried about cash flow and the need to service their debts, began cutting prices in late November.
"For the consumer, this only came to reinforce and more deeply instill the notion that they should expect discounting, early discounting and deep discounting," said Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Research Center.
"It's possible that Christmas from now on will be like this, with lots and lots of sales," said Mr. Johnson of Shapiro & Associates. "And there's no reason for the consumer to think that's a bad thing -- they spend less money and still get what they want."
But something more than mere bargain hunting may be afoot.
Alice Bird McCord, senior vice president of the National Retail Federation, a trade group in New York, sees a linkage between Christmas shopping changes and population shifts, such things as time constraints on the individual and the growth in the number of working women. But the most important factor, she said, is changing consumer values.
Shoppers are older and better informed, Ms. McCord said, and they're applying their knowledge and experience to purchasing. "They tend to be more practical. They are less easily convinced by promotional devices, and they are more likely to buy fewer, better quality items," she said. "The Christmases when you saw an item like a Pet Rock or something frivolous or outrageously expensive selling out are over."
A monthly study of consumer sentiment by Shapiro & Associates found that 44 percent of those surveyed in September said they planned to spend less on Christmas this year than last. By last month, the figure had risen to 47 percent. Although Shapiro & Associates won't release data from all their sentiment surveys, which run back to the early 80's, they say the Christmas spending sentiment trend has generally been bleak since 1989.
Some analysts think the American public's movement toward quality and value and a turning away from conspicuous consumption is related to the growing awareness of environmental issues and other concerns, like unemployment, corporate downsizing and an increasing focus on family rather than self.
"As it is in every business cycle, you're talking about an aversion to past values, in this case away from the flashy, Rodeo Drive, labels-as-status values of the 80's," said Isaac Lagnado, president of Tactical Retail Solutions, a New York consulting firm. "Skepticism as a value is getting to be very acceptable."
Analysts say the booming business cycle in the 80's masked the development of this new breed of consumer, which caught retailers unaware. Cynthia Cohen Turk, president of Marketplace 2000, a consulting firm in Coral Gables, Fla., said consumers will loosen their grip on their pocketbooks once the economy improves -- but not to the point they did in the 80's.
"This is a very discriminating consumer, and that is not going to change when the business cycle picks up again," Ms. Turk said. "They won't tolerate lousy service, old stores, and shoddy merchandise, no matter what it's price is."
Pleasing this new consumer at Christmastime has puzzled many retailers; some even confess to being bereft of bright ideas.
"You have so many people selling the same merchandise that price is almost the only thing that drives sales," said Frank Doroff, executive vice president and general merchandise manager of Bloomingdale's. "It becomes a matter of who has the cheaper price."
The extent this has become a problem for department stores is evident in a survey of 1,000 people by Tactical Retail Solutions. The firm found that 75 percent of those questioned felt department stores put high prices on merchandise just so they could mark them down and advertise a sale. And 80 percent said that although they might be unable to find the same merchandise in a discount store like Syms or Dress Barn, they nevertheless could find a satisfactory alternative at a lower price.
Such attitudes have caught department stores like Macy's, Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's between the high costs of offering ambiance, presentation, service and inventory and the necessity of competing with discounters. Many of these chains are still struggling under heavy debt loads they assumed in buyouts or to fend off takeovers. The unfortunate result, many retail analysts say, is that store executives have had to focus on the financial aspects of the business and neglected to cultivate its theatrical elements, which have traditionally driven retail operations, particularly at Christmas. Instead of striving to stock merchandise sold by no one else or generate clever promotions to draw shoppers, stores began relying on markdowns to generate cash flow.
But, paradoxically, though they aren't struggling under massive debt, discounters see plenty of difficulties ahead. Most, like K Mart and Toys 'R Us, are counting mostly on price and volume to save their Christmas season. Toys 'R Us, for example, is bringing out a catalogue for the first time this year, and it is filled with discount coupons worth $173. (To obtain one, a customer must visit the store.)
K Mart is placing its bets on cordless ratchets, drills and screwdrivers; home security devices, and in-line rollerskates (better known as Rollerblades), but the company will be happy with Christmas sales only "moderately better" than last year, said Orren F. Knauer, vice president for investor relations.
A few brave souls are experimenting with new approaches.
The Hartmarx Corporation, which operates Wallach's, Barrie Pace and Hart, Schaffner & Marx, among others, mailed a video Christmas catalogue to 150,000 of its best customers. The company hopes the video will stand out from the mass of catalogues in the mail and capture weary shoppers' attention.
"We think the real risk in our business is staying static," said John Eyler, chairman and chief executive of Hartmarx's specialty stores division.
Other retailers have sought to soften their image of pricey exclusivity. For the first time since its founding in 1978, the Sharper Image, which specializes in glitzy high-tech items, is stocking items costing less than $50. "What I realized was that we had tremendous foot traffic in the stores but most items were too expensive for the people coming in," said Richard Thalheimer, founder and chairman of the company. "So we went looking for innovative, unusual, fun items priced between $16 and $29."
Neiman Marcus began two years ago to devote some of its catalogue pages to gifts for less than $50 and less than $100. The strategy is to attract cost-conscious customers who might have thought Neiman's was out of their range.
Neiman's hasn't moved away from big ticket items, but some of the whimsical glamour is absent. The premier "his and her" item in their catalogue this year is not a Chinese junk or a pair of camels, as in the past. Instead, it is the civilian version of the military's LTV Hummer, the boxy vehicle used in the Persian Gulf war to replace the Jeep. The price: $50,000. Neiman executives are quick to point out the gift's utilitarian nature as a recreational vehicle.
"In the past, the more outrageous the idea for a his-and-hers gift was, the better," said Bernie Feiwus, president of Neiman Marcus's mail order division. "Utility wasn't part of the equation. This year it was."
But most merchants seem wary of making bold new efforts, preferring to rely on the tried and, until recently, true. Many will try to outdo one another with lavish window decorations, install a Santa Claus somewhere on the ground floor surrounded by fake snow and mount Christmas trees festooned with thousands of gilded ornaments and glimmering lights.
"I think the whole industry could probably use some innovation and creativity," said Mr. Doroff of Bloomingdale's. "The Christmas business has become so promotional that you don't focus on unique and different offerings because you can't afford to take markdowns on that sort of merchandise."
Many retailers and industry consultants admit to a lack of ideas about how to get the industry out of the box it has pushed itself into. Those that do have a prescription offer a straightforward approach: stick to your guns on price or else find a way to offer goods that no one else has and provide some other exclusivity, like selection or service or high quality. "Instead of giving the customer what he wants at the right price the first time, they give the customer something that may not be exactly what he wants -- maybe it's not the right size or the right color because they don't have it in stock -- but it's cheap," said Marvin J. Rothenberg, president of Marvin J. Rothenberg Inc., a retail consulting firm based in New Jersey.
"They fail to understand that these value-conscious customers are not just looking for low prices, that they'll pay full price as long as they have the goods they want."
But many of the large department stores now lack the financial stability to gamble on the exclusive merchandise that might become the next Cabbage Patch doll and rack up large profits -- but might equally well flop.
They also are reluctant to risk funds on deep inventories. Indeed, this year many stores are carrying tight inventories, hoping to reduce the need to take pre-Christmas markdowns if stock isn't moving fast enough. They have learned that once one store chain begins a pre-Christmas sale, the stampede is on. But reduced inventory, of course, further reduces the stores' ability to immediately offer a customer exactly what he wants -- at a higher price.
"What retailers need to do is get back to a more traditional pricing structure," said Ms. McCord of the National Retail Federation. "But once you've gotten on the sales train -- and we've been on it for a while now -- it's very, very hard to get off."
Even Mr. Curtin of the Consumer Survey Research Center, who is generally more optimistic about merchants' prospects than the merchants themselves, said an attempt to hold the line on holiday markdowns would most likely lead to a showdown with customers that few retailers have the fortitude to weather.
"It will only take one retailer in a region to break the ranks, and then the consumer will win," he said.
 
 
 
LEARNING A LITTLE DISCIPLINE
 Retailers are counting on lean inventories to save them from the markdown malady that has afflicted recent holiday selling seasons.
Federated Department Stores Inc., for example, plans to stage roughly the same number of discretionary promotions -- sales designed to build traffic in stores -- as it has in the last three Christmas seasons. But the company's president, James M. Zimmerman, warned that inventories are so tight that stores are likely to sell out of merchandise before markdowns are needed.
K Mart is also practicing inventory discipline, said Orren F. Knauer, vice president for investor relations, holding open options to buy merchandise from suppliers without actually committing itself to taking delivery.
"Inventory plans throughout the industry are so conservative that if sales go better than planned, they'll be sold out awhile before Christmas," said Daniel D. Barry, a retail analyst at Kidder, Peabody. "I think you'll see an unusually low level of markdowns."
Recent history, however, has demonstrated that tight inventories do not guarantee against panic sales. In the months before the 1986 holiday season, stores were also bragging about inventory control. But by Dec. 20, with few shoppers showing a willingness to spend, many stores started slashing prices. "Hopefully there will be a little better discipline this year," Mr. Knauer said.
 
 
 
GIDGETS AND GADGETS TO TEMPT THE SHY CONSUMER
 The Sharper Image, a chain of gadgetry emporiums, has spent all year preparing for this Christmas. Richard Thalheimer, the company's founder and chairman, took one look at last year's abysmal holiday sales and decided something had to be done. "People were tired of looking at the third-generation answering machine," he said. "We had to get out of that rut."
But getting out of the rut is what so many merchants seem to fear. "Most merchants nowadays want to wait to see somebody else prove an item will sell," Mr. Thalheimer said. "I couldn't afford to do that."
So he sent his buyers in search of unusual items. They came back with liquid gel insoles for shoes that sell for $19.95 and a $119 thermometer that takes a person's temperature in one second after it is touched to an ear. And he started selling some clothing, like a quilted silk bomber jacket for $139.95 and handknit woolen fisherman's sweaters for $149.95.
Mr. Thalheimer knows that next season other retailers will use the results of his retail experiments. This year, he sold more than 200,000 mugs filled with a liquid gel insulator that freezes to keep drinks cool. Mass merchandisers like Walmart and K Mart soon introduced the same mug at prices lower than the Sharper Image's $12.95.
The mass merchants' action will eventually force him to eliminate the mugs from his shelves, Mr. Thalheimer said, at which point he will try to entice the consumer with some other must-have gadget.
"Specialty stores have that kind of responsibility to experiment and try new things, but when times are tough, everybody just pulls in their wagons and plays it safe," he said. "Fortunately for us, we couldn't even afford to do that. If we had, I believe we would have gone out of business."

Getting Salomon Managers to Think of the Shareholders 

If Warren E. Buffett, the interim chairman of Salomon Brothers Inc., is right, the firm's problems are due to an overly generous compensation scheme. In a letter to shareholders, Mr. Buffett said the securities unit, which illegally bought too many Treasury bonds, earned only about 10 percent on its equity capital, not a stellar showing. But "106 individuals who worked for the unit earned $1 million or more," he wrote. He told shareholders bonuses would be scaled back when the current plan runs out. The firm will offer stock, not just cash. That would encourage executives to think of the shareholder. Other firms might copy that. But some others think the plan is dubious. "When the current bonus plan pays out on Dec. 31," said Graef S. Crystal, author of "In Search of Excess," "Unless there is recession on the Street, there is likely to be a hemorrhage of talent." A few defections may be part of the plan.
 
 
Chrysler Starts to Look Better
 
When a car company loses $82 million in the third quarter, it usually signals that something big -- like sales -- has fizzled. Investors walk away. But this is no ordinary quarter. In fact, it is no ordinary year. Analysts predict Detroit's Big Three will lose $5 billion before it's over. That made the Chrysler Corporation's bleak numbers look good last week -- at least by comparison. "In the market we're in today, holding losses to $82 million is an outstanding performance and clearly reflects the efficiencies we've gained by restructuring Chrysler," said Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman. Wall Street agreed. Part of Chrysler's performance came when it sold its half interest in Diamond Star Motors to the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation of Japan for $99.75 million. Its stock -- which had been languishing -- rose $1.625 to $12.75 on the announcements and closed the week at $12.50.
 
 
Time Warner's Japan Connection
 
Last week, Steven J. Ross, the chairman of Time Warner Inc., made good on a promise to find foreign partners. The Toshiba Corporation and C. Itoh & Company of Japan said they will invest $1 billion in Time Warner. That gives the companies a 12.5 percent stake in a limited partnership called Time Warner Entertainment and cuts some of Time Warner's $8.8 billion in debt. Perhaps most important, the deal gives Time Warner opportunities in Japan. "Beyond valuation, the goal is to create a strategic partnership to get distribution in Japan," said Harold J. Levy, vice president of Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder Inc., an investment bank in New York.
 
 
Boeing Has a Hit on Its Hands
 
Although it has never flown, the Boeing Company's mid-sized 777 is already a hit with the airlines. Last week Japan Airlines ordered 20 of the new twin-engine jets. The order is valued at $2 billion and comes two months after a $3.6 billion order from British Airways. Six airlines have now signed up to fly the plane.
 
 
A Computer That's Still Growing
 
Last week the Thinking Machines Corporation unveiled its latest number-crunching supercomputer. It's a monster. The massively parallel machine -- so called because it divides up problems among a number of simple processors -- snaps together like a set of Legos. It can stroll along with 32 processors, or roar with 16,000. Each chip can be connected to four math-processor chips. That makes the CM-5 one of the few supercomputers that can grow. Although most customers are research labs, the American Express Company said it would take two CM-5's, but was mum about what it would do with all that power.


Burying the B-2
 
The Northrop Corporation received a blow from Congress last week. Northrop makes the B-2 Stealth bomber. The B-2's mission is now moot since it was designed to sneak past Soviet radar defense with its load of bombs. Congress made it difficult for the Pentagon to order any more B-2's this fiscal year beyond the 15 being built. Each plane costs $865 million.


Extra Innings, but Not Revenues
 
Two years ago, CBS bet heavily on baseball. It paid $1.06 billion for the right to show major league games. But it still lost money last year. This year (aside from the weekend of the Clarence Thomas saga) the fans tuned in to the World Series as never before. Minnesota and Atlanta cooperated by going seven games, three with extra innings. That brought CBS $35 million in extra revenue since more commercials could be shown. Game seven scored 32.1 ratings points -- impressive since each point represents 921,000 homes. But CBS still lost $169.1 million in the third quarter, its worst ever.
 
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Moscow's Man of Action
 
When he addressed the Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow, Boris N. Yeltsin, President of the Russian Republic, said it was time to act "decisively, sternly, without hesitation." He told the highest assembly in the Russian Republic that he intended to lift most price controls (not vodka) at the end of the year. He also said he would accelerate the privatization of agriculture and some light industries and that he would stop financing the central Government's ministries -- excluding the military, transportation and energy. The central Government is what President Mikhail S. Gorbachev runs. It sounded as if Mr. Yeltsin had a plan. It also sounded as if he recognized how much disruption the leap into a market economy would cause. The Congress approved the proposals 876 to 16.


Trading Barbs
 
Last week Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, talked tough to the European Community. She admonished it for the generous way it continues to subsidize its farmers. She said Europe's farmers were "killing the land." That part -- killing the land -- was in response to assertions by European officials that the Bush Administration does not care about the environment. The Europeans want rules banning trade that harms the environment, something Ms. Hills would rather not see.


A New Leader for Japan
 
1Last week it became official. Kiichi Miyazawa was chosen as Japan's next Prime Minister. Mr. Miyazawa is more than an adept politician. He once was Finance Minister and before that represented Japan in important trade negotiations with the United States. Though he is thought to want better relations with Washington, when it comes to trade he still must wrestle with powerful interest groups at home. "He is superbly qualified," said Jeffrey E. Garten, managing director of the Blackstone Group. "But it is still not clear what freedom of action he will have."
 
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
The Littlest Rebound
 
Economists are still puzzling over the results. The economy expanded by an estimated 2.4 percent in the third quarter, according to the Commerce Department. That increase, though meager, was the first positive showing in a year. But those gains did not come from the sectors economists are very fond of; they came from shifts in inventories. "Inventory changes up or down are no basis for sustained growth," said Robert Ortner, the author of "Voodoo Deficits." Sustained growth comes from capital spending. "As rebounds go, this is puny," he said.


Sheepish Consumers
 
Right now, the consumer is more lamb than lion. The Conference Board's Index of Consumer Confidence tumbled in October to a nervous 60.4, down from 72.9 in September. The index was a self-confident 100 in 1985. The fall in confidence is important since jittery consumers don't spend. Last month's reading was the worst since the 1981-82 recession.


Negative Foreshadowing
 
It wasn't exactly a leap, but it was worrisome just the same. Unemployment rose to 6.8 percent in October, up from 6.7 in September, the Labor Department said last week. "That suggests a negative fourth quarter," said Alan Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. There was also a fall in the Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators. The index, which is used to forecast the economy six to nine months in the future, fell 0.1 percent in September, the first drop since February. "That suggests a negative prognosis for the first quarter," he said. "I read these numbers as recession threatening," he said.


The Price of Pot-Smoking
 
Economists are fond of building mental models of how the world works. If demand falls, they say, prices usually tumble. But if demand stays down, prices often rise to compensate for lost economies of scale as sellers go out of business. That is the way the market works. But what about the underground market? Demand for marijuana is down sharply, according to a report from the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Washington. Yet prices are higher than ever. What cost $20 an ounce a decade ago, sells for $800. The high prices suggest pot has lost its allure. "If it goes up much more I'm going to stop smoking," one smoker told The Times.
 
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly survey showed the pace of growth slackened in October. The survey fell to 53.5 from 55 in September.

HEADLINE: Technology;
Mining Deep Underground for Energy

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Across vast areas of the world, Government scientists say, it should soon be possible to drill a hole in the ground and harvest energy that is abundant and environmentally benign. This is not oil or gas, but heat.
Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico are seeking to tap the heat within the earth, which comes from earth's molten core or from radioactive decay and which geologists say dwarfs the energy content of oil, coal or natural gas. 
 By the end of this month, after a decade of work, they hope to begin producing usable quantities of heat in the form of hot water, from the bedrock 12,000 feet under Fenton Hill, N.M. Water heated deep within the earth will be brought to the surface and used to make steam.
One enthusiastic backer, Stewart Udall, a former Secretary of the Interior, said in a recent letter inviting energy specialists to a conference on geothermal heat that the technology is so promising that "at first blush, it might seem to be a product of science fiction speculation."
The energy to be harvested in New Mexico is from hot dry rock, which is different from a technology already in commercial use using heat from underground. Several companies take heat from the wet rock in Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast states to make electricity, by tapping into water that has seeped into rock that holds heat from the earth's core. But that water exists in only a few places.
By contrast, after spending more than $160 million in Federal money on research and tests, Los Alamos researchers are convinced that hot dry rock is found almost everywhere, if the well is deep enough.
In many places, they say, the temperature gradient between the surface and the rock below is large enough so the depth of the wells is easily within the ability of existing drilling technology. In about 2 percent of the land mass of the United States, according to Los Alamos scientists, the gradient per kilometer is greater than 45 degrees centigrade (or about 125 degrees Fahrenheit per mile), making hot dry rock practical if the electricity can be sold wholesale for 9 to 10 cents a kilowatt-hour.
That price is not currently competitive with natural gas or coal plants, but it might be if credit were given for the fact that the generating system creates no carbon dioxide, the combustion product believed to cause climate change, or other pollutants. The New Mexico test site has a slightly higher thermal gradient -- 65 degrees centigrade per kilometer -- and will bring up water at 240 degrees centigrade. Getting water that hot from a site with a smaller gradient would simply mean drilling deeper. Water not hot enough to make steam for electricity would still work well for heating homes, running factories and for meeting some needs in an electric plant.
Even if a gradient of 60 to 70 degrees is required, vast parts of the western United States qualify, according to researchers.
If the energy of the earth's crust could be economically tapped, the resource base would be hundreds of times larger than any now in use, according to a study published by Los Alamos in 1989.
The standard measure of energy consumption from all sources is one quadrillion British thermal units. A B.T.U. is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by 1 degree Fahrenheit, and a quadrillion is a "1" with 15 zeroes. The United States consumes about 80 quadrillion B.T.U.'s annually, from coal, oil, gas, nuclear power and all other sources, but the estimated energy potential of hot dry rock nationwide is 10 million quads, the study found, more energy than this country uses in thousands of years.
The Los Alamos study, which referred to the process as "mining heat," noted that many underground resources are not fully recoverable. "However, even if only 0.1 percent or 0.01 percent of the accessible hot dry rock resource base is ultimately extracted, the impact on the U.S. energy supply would be far-reaching," it said.
Mr. Udall, who is chairman of the Center for Resource Management, a nonprofit organization in Salt Lake City that studies energy and environment issues, is organizing a conference next month to share information with government officials, utility officials, environmentalists and others on the potential of hot dry rock, with Los Alamos as a co-sponsor. Among the benefits he points out is that the system has no waste. The water that carries the heat from underground is re-injected through the other well, forming a closed loop.
The Los Alamos test involves twin 12,000-foot wells, one for injecting water, the other for retrieving the hot water for steam. Drilling is a challenge, because by definition the rock is hot. Also, the target material is hard rock, not the softer sedimentary rock oil drillers go after. This makes the work cumbersome and costly.
The reward at the bottom is rock that is very hot but also very solid. Technicians inject water at very high pressure, to open up fractures in the rock, through which the water flows. "People tell me they're less than a millimeter," said David V. Duchane, the program manager for the Los Alamos geothermal energy program. But no one is sure. "Remember," he said, "no one has ever been down there."
So far the rock has not behaved exactly as expected. The original plan was to drill the ends of the two wells near each other, pump water into one and wait for it to flow to the other. But when the water was pumped in at pressure high enough to open fissures in the rock, at 2,700 pounds per square inch, the water went off in its own direction, probably following natural stress lines. Drillers had to move the bottom of the second well to find the water. Next time, said Mr. Duchane, they will drill the first hole, create the reservoir, locate it through micro-seismic tests and then drill the second well into it.
Another problem, especially in the arid West, is that in an earlier test the system seemed to lose excessive amounts of water. Some of the water seemed to bleed away, but most, Mr. Duchane said, was probably absorbed by microcracks in the rock. "That can't go on forever," he said, predicting that at some point losses would drop to a small amount.
Hot dry rock plants could be useful in balancing electric systems through the hours of the day, say backers. In years to come, many analysts expect windmills and solar cells to provide an increasing portion of electric power, but those sources are notoriously intermittent and must be complemented with plants that can start or stop quickly, a capability nuclear plants and most coal plants lack. Hot dry rock plants could alter output quickly.
Outsiders are watching the experiment carefully. "It's not a sure thing, but it does have potential," saidDr. Evan E. Hughes, a project manager at the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility consortium in Palo Alto, Calif. "Hot dry rock could be big enough to supply virtually all the electricity we need."
But the price must be competitive, he said, and "no one's going to believe it until they've seen it done." It will probably take more than a single test to demonstrate, Dr. Hughes added.
John R. Bailey, a geologist in Tulsa, Okla., who is a consultant to O'Brien Energy Systems, a geothermal company, also believes hot dry rock has large-scale potential. Existing geothermal plants already produce energy for electricity and for everything from heating greenhouses to drying potato chips, he said, and hot dry rock is far more widespread.
Successful fields at the moment, said Mr. Bailey and other experts, rely on having several production wells and a single well for re-injection. Thus the pair of wells at Fenton Hill will not represent the economic questions fairly.
With natural gas at historic low prices, any new technologies face a stiff hurdle. But "if there were another energy crisis, this would be economically possible in the East," Mr. Bailey said.
For example, he said, the Adirondack mountains in New York could be suitable, and lots of water is available there. "Ultimately, you can get hot dry rock almost anywhere, if you're willing to drill deep enough," he said.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Nobody Loves an Equity

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
IndividuaL investors' equity holdings, including both common stocks and mutual funds, have dropped as a percentage of total assets in the last 20-plus years.
Experts say the trend is fueled by several forces: the stock market collapses of 1969-70, 1973-1974 and 1987; high yields on money market funds and bonds in the late 1970's to early 1980's; soaring real estate values that competed for dollars, and the growing domination of institutional investors. 
 But the withdrawal by investors has been overdone, advisers say. Investors who shy away from stocks get "only limited exposure to the form of investment which has provided the best total return over long periods of time," said H. Bradlee Perry, chairman of David L. Babson & Company, a mutual fund and investment advisory group in Cambridge, Mass. Indeed, with interest rates plummeting and the stock market rising, there was a modest gain in equity holdings in the first half of this year.

Asian Americans Organize Against 'Silent' Stereotype

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.

 BODY:
Though the 5,100 Asian and Pacific Islander students at Rutgers University constitute, at 11 percent, the largest minority group, they are often referred to on campus as the silent minority.
"It's the Confucian ethic of restraint," said Bertrand Wang, a senior in Asian Studies from East Brunswick, N.J. "Mind your own shop, and never speak out against your elders." 
 But now, Rutgers' 12 Asian interest organizations are trying to convince members to speak out -- and with a single voice.
"Many Asians on the college campus are lulled into thinking that racism, because it exists mostly in the subtle form of stereotypes, doesn't need to be battled," Mr. Wang said. "Letting people get away with it is saying it's all right."
In interviews, Asian students also recounted a handful of incidents in which they or their classmates had been verbally or physically assaulted; few of these incidents, they said, have been reported to the Rutgers administration.
 
'Just Want to Communicate'
 "All we want is a voice," Mayank Gupta, a senior from Dayton, N.J., studying computer science and mathematics. "We're not militant. We're not gangs. We just want to communicate." Mr. Gupta is president of the 300-member Association of Indians at Rutgers.
For Asian students, the new vehicles of communication on campus are the Rutgers Asian American Coalition for Equality and a campus newspaper, Common Interest.
"I really wish more Asians would voice their opinions, admit to discrimination," said Ellen Keng, a sophomore in business from Morristown. "This paper is their vehicle."
But speaking as one will not be easy for a community that has rarely acted in its own behalf, a community comprising Asian Indians, Japanese, Chinese, Pakistani, Filipinos, Koreans, Cambodians, Vietnamese, Hmong, Laotian, Thai and other ethnic groups.
"Many join the Asian student groups for their active social agendas," said graphics editor Edward Chao, a senior from West Windsor who is majoring in electrical engineering.
 
Soul Searching and Cliques
 Peter Li, a professor of Chinese who is also author of the book "Understanding Asian Americans: A Curriculum Resource Guide," noted a tendency for Asian Americans to form cliques in college. "In high school, we try to be as American as possible," Professor Li said. "We adopt the slang, mimic the hair." But in universities, he said, "For Asian Americans, the soul searching that often accompanies the college years causes them to grapple with feelings of ambivalence about their origins."
Asian students for whom English is a second language are "ostracized by the English-speaking majority -- white, black or Hispanic," said Chi-Lin Shih, a professor of Chinese, who said that the feeling of exclusion further encourages them to isolate themselves from other students.
Ching-I Tu, a professor of Chinese and department chairman of East Asian languages and cultures, said he felt "the bond is there for students; otherwise, they wouldn't seek to learn their cultural origins, their heritage, through college classes."
There is a year-old East Asian languages and cultures department at Rutgers. But the department offers only Chinese and Japanese language and culture courses, leaving many Asian students feeling forgotten.
 
Competing Ethnic Groups
 And though membership flourishes for the various student groups, Siraj Hasan, a junior in accounting from Karachi, Pakistan, said it is difficult to attract attention when "all the cultural events tend to run together, and each group tries to outdo the other." Mr. Hasan belongs to the 68-member Pakistan Students Association.
Ethnic groups themselves must contend with internal divisions, said Ada Chiu, a senior in economics from Kowloon, Hong Kong. Ms. Chiu, who is president of the 300-member Chinese Students Organization, noted, for example, that among Chinese students, many different dialects are spoken and many different regions of China are represented.
Mr. Gupta said he perceived a similar problem within the Indian organization. "But we find a common language," he said.

Campus Outgrows Its Need for Dairy But Not for Milk

DATELINE: STORRS, Conn.

 BODY:
University of Connecticut students will no longer be drinking milk from the university's own dairy herd come the middle of this month, when the creamery is due to close.
UConn announced on Tuesday that it will close the only milk processing plant at a New England university. Karen Grava Williams, a university spokeswoman, said the plant would be closed because it no longer serves as a laboratory for agricultural students and is in financial difficulties. 
 Closing the creamery, which processes the milk from UConn's herd of 80 cows, has been debated since April 1989, when state inspectors cited 50 health code violations. Inspectors criticized unsanitary conditions in the dairy and the antiquated equipment used in a process that has become far more automated.
But Thomas J. Tighe, university provost, finally decided to close the dairy because it had accumulated a $500,000 deficit, and to keep it open would require renovations and new equipment totaling more than $2 million, Ms. Williams said.
"If there was an academic need, we would have tried to find resources elsewhere," she added.
 
Building to Be Renovated
 The State Legislature had approved $2.8 million for renovations to the building that housed the creamery in the budget for the fiscal year ending next June. University officials said the money would still be used to renovate the building, which also houses classrooms, laboratories and the Dairy Bar, a shop famous statewide for its homemade ice cream and a popular attraction for visitors to campus. The Dairy Bar will remain open.
The creamery delivers milk and other dairy products, like butter and sour cream, to UConn's cafeterias and other state buildings, including prisons and training schools for the mentally retarded.
UConn students say they are worried that closing the dairy may mean that the university and they will pay higher prices for milk. "I would think it would be more expensive getting it off campus," said Timothy S. Paris, a sophomore mathematics major from Shelton, Conn.
Gerald N. Weller, head of the student commissaries, said he was unsure if having to go to dairies outside the university would result in price increases, but that he would begin talking with local milk vendors.
The concern for price increases stems in part from the economic troubles that have plagued the state and the university recently. Students felt the creamery's closing was another signal of decline at a university that has been forced to lay off employees and reduce services because of cuts in state financing.
"Generally it's a sign that the university is underfunded," said Gregory P. Jack, a senior psychology major from Hamden, Conn.
 
Will Still Get Ice Cream
 Melissa K. Labbe, a junior music education major from Ellington, Conn., said, "Basically, we're going very downhill." She added: "There's not a whole lot we can do about it, as long as we still get ice cream."
Students will still get ice cream because the ice cream from the Dairy Bar is not made with cream from the milk processing operation. Indeed, the bar will be expanded with a larger sales room that will offer student-made and student-grown products, like sausages from the university farm and apples from its orchard, when they are available, Ms. Williams said. UConn, which was founded as an agricultural school in 1881, will maintain its herd of 80 cows and will sell their milk to another processor, Ms. Williams said.

HEADLINE: Earning One's Keep

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In response to my letter ("Keeping the Government Out of Housing," Oct. 6) Muriel C. Hayman correctly points out that I am "not old enough to remember the G.I. Bill" ("Low-Interest Loans to Lower-Income People," Letters, Oct. 20). I am a senior economics major at the University of Maryland at College Park and came to the United States from Somalia barely seven years ago. 
 However, the G.I. Bill wasn't an earlier version of the current welfare system; it was a program to reward men and women who fought to save Western democracies.
There are now attempts to bring back some form of paid volunteerism, such as the bill offered by two Democrats, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and Representative David McCurdy of Oklahoma. It would send high school graduates to do public service helping the elderly, participating in literacy programs and tutoring inner-city children. Upon completion of the service, the students would be given $20,000 in vouchers -- not cash -- for college tuition or a down payment on a house. Although attacked by free-marketeers, it still has advocates in some conservative circles.
There is a difference between government paying those who earned a reward by serving their country and those who feel entitled to aid without doing public service.
It is time that America does away with the culture that promotes free lunches.

HEADLINE: Look Inward, World Bank

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Running Aid in Tandem With Reform" (Forum, Oct. 20) rightly emphasizes the need for reforms involving market incentives and development of "market-friendly" institutions supported by foreign finance. 
 But Vinod Thomas, the author, also admits that "when aid programs are poorly designed, they allow recipients to postpone -- or totally avoid -- difficult policy changes." Yet the reasons for what might be called the past preponderance of non-success -- and the relatively few success cases -- are never dealt with. I suppose the reader is to conclude that if the symbiosis between reforms and financing doesn't work out, it must be due to the failure of the recipient country to treat the program "as its own, rather than as a foreign imposition."
Surely there is more to it. One possible cause of failure extends to the behavior of the donor/creditor agencies, including Mr. Thomas's own World Bank. At least part of the problem resides with such agencies' felt need to keep lending even when recipients' actions don't warrant it. Bluntly put, as long as meeting some sort of informal lending levels overcomes the insistence on high quality, donors may undermine their own objectives by permitting recipients to pursue inappropriate policies.
The World Bank is all too often unwilling to act like a bank at the outset -- to wait until the recipient proposes a serious, long-term program of reform. It is also not often prepared to cease lending if mutual understandings are violated. This is, of course, not lost on would-be recipients and is a major reason why structural adjustment packages have often deteriorated into ritual dances while the money kept flowing.
While donors are asking for policy reforms in the third world and Eastern Europe, little attention is paid to the sociology and operating behavior of their own institutions.
Achieving success in linking policy change with foreign financing may require institutional and policy reforms from donors as well as recipients.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
By Definition, an Automobile Is . . .

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
WE were having our usual disconnected conversation the other night. About birds and bushes, about people we knew and computers. And, of course, about cars. We talked technology, and I remembered a friend who is generally a smart fellow but who knows NOTHING.
This is a guy with a doctorate in psychology. And, listening to him some time back, he allowed as how his car was driven by only one wheel. Huh? Well, sure, he said. Has to be. Because the outside wheel goes faster in a turn. 
 I stayed calm and sort of alluded to differentials and how those simple devices allow driven wheels to travel at different speeds on the same axle, but I don't think he got it. And I knew then that people, even very savvy people, often are buffaloed by fairly low technology.
So we set out, the other night, to come up with a sort of glossary, and I offer it here, as is and thoroughly incomplete. If you have your own puzzlements, though, you can join the conversation by dropping me a line at 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036. Maybe we can do more of this:
Analog/Digital -- The difference between a vague round clock and one that wakes you at exactly 7:14 A.M. In car terms, it generally means the difference between a dash with real needle-instrument gauges and one that shouts at you in ice-blue numbers. Right-thinking people prefer analog.
Antilock brakes -- Forget airbags. Antilock braking systems are the most important safety advance since seatbelts. Wheel sensors send a message of impending lockup to the car's on-board computer, which then pumps the brakes faster than the fastest foot. The result is quicker stops without skids, and the major advantage of ABS is that the wheels do not lock and a driver retains steering control.
Breakerless ignition -- Also known as electronic ignition, it does away with the adjustable and perishable breaker points in the old-fashioned distributor. Means lots less expense for tuneups and extends the life of sparkplugs.
Climate control -- Pioneered by General Motors, the system uses a thermostat to combine heat and air-conditioning to maintain a preset interior temperature.
Coefficient of drag -- Streamlining has become more important with the need for better fuel efficiency. An important measure of any car's ability to slip through the air is its drag coefficient, which takes into account its frontal area and overall smoothness. Today's average car has a Cd. of about .32. Experimental vehicles are much lower.
Displacement -- Formerly measured in cubic inches, now expressed in liters. It is the total volume of the space inside the engine's cylinders that is available for combustion. A liter represents 61.025 cubic inches.
Electronic suspension -- A system that changes the ride and handling qualities of a car. Generally, there are two settings, normal or "touring," and "sport." The normal setting is good for cities and potholed streets. "Sport" makes the car stiffer and better on twisty roads. Some cars push the electronic envelope by using sonar waves to "read" the road and instantaneously readjust suspension settings.
Fuel injection -- You know about this. But, for the record, it replaces carburetion as the way to get gasoline into the cylinders. Generally, a microprocessor reads the accelerator angle and the needs of the engine and adjusts the spray of fuel to create an optimum fuel mixture. Also known as EFI, or electronic fuel injection.
Intercooler -- Generally used in conjunction with turbocharging. The idea is to cool intake air with a separate radiator, because cooler air is denser air. And the denser the oxygen charge in the combustion chamber, the more power there is in the explosion of the fuel mixture.
Load leveling -- When Cadillac tried this in the late 50's, there was a serious glitch: Put the car on a lift, and it went crazy trying to find the ground. Modern technology has fixed the problem, and today's luxury cars use their computers to determine load and readjust their springs.
Multivalve technology -- Conventional powerplants breathe through one exhaust valve and one intake valve per cylinder. In the 1950's, hot rodders "ported" their engines to increase the area around the valves and alleviate the natural emphysema. But modern engineers have gone the hot rodders one better by using two valves for intake and two for exhaust, simultaneously increasing power and efficiency.
Overdrive -- High gear has traditionally been 1:1, which is to say that a transmission output shaft turns one time for each turn of the crankshaft. Overdrive, which decreases power but is suitable for highway cruising, means even higher gearing, providing increased fuel economy.
Rack and Pinion -- A steering system that moves a toothed bar with a gear on the end of the steering shaft. More precise than conventional recirculating-ball systems, in which steering motion is transmitted by steel balls placed between a worm gear and a nut.
Supercharger -- A windmill, driven by a chain or belt hooked to the crankshaft, that packs more air and thus a denser charge into the combustion chamber. This is old technology, picked up and improved today by Ford and Buick. Turbocharging increases power in the same way, although the air pump is driven by the flow of exhaust gases.
Traction control -- The reverse, in a sense, of antilock brakes. The same wheel sensors note imminent slip, and the computer cuts power from the engine.
Zero-to-60 -- You know about this, too, but it is one of the standard measures of acceleration and never mind the Double Nickel. These days, 10 seconds is average to slow, and a leisurely diesel will reach 60 miles an hour in the mid-teens. Probably the fastest production cars were the muscular Corvettes and Carroll Shelby's 427 Cobra, which hit 60 m.p.h. in just over 4 seconds. Try that with power to one wheel.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dinner;
Spots Where the Wine List Is a Good Match for the Food

 BODY:
In today's economy it is difficult for restaurants to stock large inventories of wine. This may not be a bad turn of events, because it has forced many restaurants to rethink wine in relation to food. The result has been smaller but more thoughtful lists. Here are three restaurants in Manhattan where both the food and the wine lists are good.
 
Chin Chin
 216 East 49th Street, (212) 888-4555 -- This may be the best-looking Chinese restaurant in town. It is near the summit when it comes to food, too. The cooking cuts across various ethnic borders, and while most dishes are full-flavored, few are seriously spicy. If you like wine with Chinese food, the selection here is impressive and exceptionally well chosen. Prices are more than fair, starting at $14. 
 Among appetizers on the current menu are crispy fried squid, vegetable duck pie with crepes, chicken soong in lettuce pocket and cold noodles tossed in a hot sesame sauce. Main courses include Peking duck, shredded chicken with garlic sauce, crispy sea bass and crispy orange beef.
Appetizers are $4 to $12, entrees, $13.50 to $19.50. Sunday dinner is served from 5 to 11 P.M. (Review, May 3, 1991.)
 
Les Halles
 411 Park Avenue South, between 28th and 29th Streets, (212) 679-4111 -- It is not easy to absorb all the interior details at Les Halles. A little tiled butcher shop is up front, and just behind is the bar. The lofty space here has a Parisian feel with elaborate wood molding, off-white walls, tulip sconces that cast soft light and tables draped in butcher paper. Charcuterie posters and black and white photos adorn the walls.
Patrons come here for the gutsy French cooking. As for the wine list, it is a delight, not only for its sensible prices but also for delectable little-known country wines like Bourgueil ($16), Chateau Aiguilloux from Cahors ($15) and Vidal-Fleury from Vacqueyras ($21).
For appetizers, you might start with the frisee aux lardons (chicory salad with bacon and Roquefort croutons), onion soup or warm sausage served with lentils. For entrees there are grilled flank steak with a shallot sauce, lamb shank with couscous, pigs' feet and moules mariniere (steamed mussels with white wine).
Appetizers are $5 to $7.50; entrees, $12.50 to $22. Sunday hours are noon to midnight. (Review, Feb. 15, 1991.)
 
Sarabeth's
 1295 Madison Avenue, near 92d Street, (212) 410-7335 -- This cheerful spot is almost too cute to be taken seriously as a restaurant, with its country cupboard at the entrance, cream-toned wallpaper, pastoral American paintings on the walls and capacious baskets of dried flowers. Yet there is nothing juvenile about the food.
The American menu is sophisticated and well focused. Sarabeth's also offers a limited but quality American wine selection that is well matched to the food and reasonably priced.
Starters on the current menu include cream of tomato soup; marinated goat cheese with roasted sweet peppers, black olives and toasted nut-raisin bread; Caesar salad and rigatoni with grilled tomatoes, chicken sausage, zucchini and arugula.
Among main courses are grilled salmon with lentils, caramelized endive and a warm ginger vinaigrette; grilled tuna caponata with roasted potatoes; herbed linguine topped with a stew of squash, tomato, ginger and fried ricotta cheese; chicken potpie and seared duck breast served with duck tortillas, green rice and avocado.
Appetizers are $4 to $6.75; entrees, $14.75 to $20. Sunday dinner is from 6 to 10 P.M. (Review, Aug. 24, 1990.)
This listing is compiled by Bryan Miller from his restaurant visits, his reviews and articles in The Times, and entries in his Diner's Journal column. Review and article dates are in parentheses. Prices are current.

HEADLINE: Military Spending Binge Got Us Into This Mess

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Republican Party line points proudly to the country's "longest peacetime expansion" during the Reagan-Bush decade of the 1980's. The intended point is that the second longest economic expansion of the post-World War II period was achieved without the stimulus of a wartime buildup, as occurred during the Vietnam War era, when the longest expansion was recorded. 
 But a graph of United States military spending in dollars of constant purchasing power, published in the Sept. 28 issue of The Economist, and based on Commerce Department and Office of Management and Budget figures, makes it clear to anyone not wearing Republican-tinted glasses that the spending bulge above the trend line for 1980-90 is about twice that for 1965-75.
Moreover, since real gross national product did not double between 1970 and 1985, the relative-size argument doesn't wash either.
Of course, it is a blessing that there was no shooting war in the later period, but does that matter to the economy? If the Republicans are going to claim that spending on shooting wars imparts a greater economic stimulus than spending for military hardware that doesn't fire any shots in anger, how do they explain why the outbreak of the Persian Gulf war brought about our recession? Because it was fought at nearly zero marginal capital cost and expenses were covered by passing the hat among our allies?
As the most significant events of the last 45 years are taking place in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, about all the United States can do, because of the debt piled up during the Reagan years, is offer advice on how to privatize industry and pray for market miracles.

HEADLINE: Wearing Thin;
Facing a Tide of Voter Anger, Politicians Look to Channel It

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AMERICA is in a sour mood. The unemployment rate is rising, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators is slipping, and everyone seems to be thoroughly disgusted with the powers that be, including Congress and, increasingly, the White House.
It should be a dream scenario for Democrats, who have been shut out of the Presidency for more than a decade and who, until recently, had been all but counted out of the race again in 1992. Instead, there is a sort of low-grade policy panic setting in as elected officials of both parties seek to gauge the depth of the public's anger and formulate a palatable and convincing set of solutions. 
 Both parties are struggling under the weight of the recession, which has added a slate of economic woes to the general disenchantment with Washington's brand of insider politics that first began to make itself felt during the 1990 midterm elections.
But the discontent is more complex than the polls can convey. Across the country, the sense that the nation is on the edge of bad times colors daily life.
In the Midwest, farmers who have saved and worked hard for years remain uneasy that everything they have gained could slip away at any moment. In New Hampshire, the first primary state, workers are striking at paper mills and knitwear factories. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation recently seized five failed banks.
And even in relatively affluent areas like Montgomery County, Md. which has come to depend on white-collar Government-related jobs, middle-class county workers staged a sit-in last week to protest imminent layoffs and other budget cuts.
Such are the scenes of frustration among American voters, further fueled by a nagging feeling that the last people who can be trusted to fix their problems are the very politicians they have elected to office.
"People are unhappy," said Alan Rosenthal, the director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. "The political system has gotten a bad rap with the S. &L.'s and the problems with the states, and people feel insecure. The American idea that progress is inevitable is being challenged."
As a result, voters are weighing extreme alternatives. Witness the Louisiana electorate, which has given David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, the chance to become its next governor in a runoff election on Nov. 16.
On another front, the movement to limit terms of elected officials, which first surfaced in 1990, has caught fire again. Term-limitation legislation covering state and local offices has been introduced in 45 states this year, and probably a dozen states will consider measures next year that would specifically limit the terms of members of Congress.
A big test comes Tuesday, when the voters of Washington State decide on a measure that would apply term limitations retroactively. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington, who would be affected, has said such a law would be unconstitutional.
But it would certainly send its message. It matters little that many of those joining the new "populist" bandwagon include corporate interests like those that are financing the Washington term-limitation initiative, or politicians like Edmund G. Brown, who opposed term limits when he was California state party chairman but now, as a Presidential candidate, favors them.
Clearly, when the public is in a rotten mood, it can only help a politician to be an outsider, or to profess to be one. This is a tougher sell for the three candidates -- President Bush and Senators Bob Kerrey and Tom Harkin -- who work in Washington.
"Being outraged does help, but only as long as you channel that anger," said an aide to Mr. Harkin. "People don't want someone up there just shaking their fist."
Mr. Bush has chosen to be the insider's outsider, battering away at Congress and blaming it for the worst of the country's ills. Some members of Congress have helped to make it an easy target for Presidential barbs and for general resentment as a privileged group. By abusing special checking priviledges and practically institutionalizing the free lunch for themselves, legislators have called attention to the rarified level of special treatment that they enjoy.
But some in the White House understand that blaming Congress is only the political half of what must ultimately be an economic solution. The trouble is, the Republican leaders in Congress and President Bush's advisers cannot yet agree on how best to reverse their slipping fortunes. Some advisers would have Mr. Bush tough it out and depend on the economy to rebound. Others have said he must present his own economic package, starting with a capital gains tax cut.
Another insider-outsider is Mr. Harkin, who, as the chairman of an Appropriations subcommittee, is a Senate leader. But he has traveled the country crafting a "populist" insurgency, announcing his candidacy in an Iowa cornfield in his shirt-sleeves and denouncing traditional leadership and Mr. Bush by using a common barnyard epithet.
But the battles are being fought this year on several other fronts that are far distant from the traditional Presidential fields of Iowa and New Hampshire. The National Conference of State Legislatures has found that states were forced to raise taxes to balance their budgets to the tune of $16.2 billion in the 1992 fiscal year, the largest dollar increase ever and the largest increase as a percentage of state budgets in 20 years.
A veteran Republican member of the Maryland State Senate, Howard Denis, said he has never seen it this bad. And his consituents are hurting. "People are in the doldrums," he said. "Whether they're planning a vacation or going out to dinner or buying a house, I think people are in a deep depression not only about the state of the economy now, but the prognosis for the future."
Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, whose popularity plummeted when he raised taxes immediately upon taking office last year, is among the governors who have sought to link the behavior of the insiders in Washington and painful steps taken by state officials at home.
 
Blaming Bush
 In a speech intended as an effort to keep the legislature in Democratic hands -- a prospect that appeared to be fading by the minute -- he urged New Jersey Democrats to get up off their knees and blame Mr. Bush for the state's economic troubles.
But other state officials see appeals for Federal help as futile. Gov. Michael J. Sullivan of Wyoming offered a common plaint at a Washington forum on health care costs last week. "We are a bit like a swimmer being washed down the river with no boat," he said of declining Federal support for state-run programs.
And Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, who is president of the United States Conference of Mayors, has mounted an offensive along similar lines. In a letter mailed to each of the announced Presidential candidates on Friday, he chastised the entire political establishment for failing the suffering cities. "Frankly, I am stunned by the lack of urgency that the Washington Democrats and Washington Republicans have toward our national recession and its impact on working families," wrote Mr. Flynn, who is a Democrat.
With his comments, Mr. Flynn joined the dizzying circle of what Mr. Rosenthal of the Eagleton Institute calls the "politics of blame."
"I think voters are ready to blame everybody who comes into their sights," he said.
Mr. Duke in Louisiana has touched the chord of discontent and, in the process, rattled the national Republican Party by seizing on their best themes to do so.
By contrast, Senator Harris Wofford, a Democrat who was appointed to serve out the term of the late Senator John Heinz, a Republican, has staged a remarkable comeback in Pennsylvania. He has used outsider politics to tar his Republican opponent, former Gov. Dick Thornburgh, who was until recently President Bush's Attorney General. In the process, Mr. Wofford has closed a 40-point gap in the polls.
Such strategies are not entirely without substance. To their credit, some candidates have also promoted issues that appear to be uppermost on voters' minds, including welfare dependency and health care costs.
"Some people have an image of voters as a group of mad dogs foaming at the mouth," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic consultant. "That's not what this is about. People are frustrated. They want people to pay attention to them, and they want a lot of help."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Amid Histrionics, Arabs and Israelis Team Up to Lose An Opportunity

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: MADRID

 BODY:
After three days of talks, the first ever between the leaders of Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians, a question mark still hangs over the Madrid peace conference: Was it history in the making, or just histrionics? The early assessment is that it may have been a little bit of both.
First, the bad news. The conference itself -- the speeches delivered by the parties -- became an incredible lost opportunity. This was the first peace conference broadcast live, around the world, and most importantly, to the countries involved. It was an ideal chance for Arab and Israeli leaders to reach out to their opponents' publics and try to reshape attitudes. Instead, they mostly reached out and poked one another in the eye, proving that they were not ready for prime time. 
 Even worse were the exchanges between the Syrians and the Israelis. This peace conference may have actually set back their relations. The public remarks by Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria were seen by many as anti-Semitic and demonstrated what a closed, dark room Syrian society really is. In his speech, Mr. Sharaa dwelled upon what he saw as the dual loyalties of American Jews and on the lovely life of Syria's decimated Jewish community, and he offered the most skewed interpretation of Zionism.
"The claims invoked by Israel for the migration of world Jewry are not sanctioned by any legal or humanitarian principle," he declared in a speech broadcast live in Israel. "If the entire world were to adopt such claims it would have to encourage all Christians to emigrate to the Vatican and all Muslims to Holy Mecca."
 
'A Regular Day'
 Watching Mr. Sharaa's spokesman carefully pick out non-Israeli reporters to ask questions at a news conference was chilling. Any notion that Syria had come to Madrid because of "new thinking," or for any other purpose than to make peace with Washington, was dispelled by his performance.
Yitzhak Shamir was scarcely better. His opening address was larded with the sort of propagandistic, anti-Palestinian, cliche-ridden lines normally reserved for late-night radio debates between Israelis and Arabs. Mr. Shamir's performance raised serious questions about whether he or his generation of the Likud party can ever bring themselves to reach a lasting accommodation with the Palestinians. After the first day of talks, a reporter asked Mr. Shamir how it felt to finally sit down face to face with all of Israel's Arab adversaries. He answered: "It was a regular day."
Nor was the conference uplifted by the performance of the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa. To put this conference together the United States had to reunite the Arab world, with its lowest common denominator politics, after it was fractured by the gulf war. Egypt demonstrated at this conference that it is much more interested in reasserting its leadership over this reunited Arab world, by hewing closely to the cautious Arab consensus, than it is in really being a bridge between Arabs and Israelis.
 
No Mention of Sadat
 Mr. Moussa did not miss an opportunity to bash Israel and did not take a single opportunity to tell his fellow Arabs in public that it was time for them to reach out to Israel the way President Anwar Sadat had. In fact, Mr. Moussa did not once mention the name of the Egyptian President who made peace with Israel. Instead, after a day of Arab speeches which heaped vitriol on Israel, and Mr. Shamir's speech which heaped it right back, Mr. Moussa declared: "We have listened to some passionate speeches which manifest how a change in attitudes is badly needed. I address Israel mainly. . ." More than a few Israelis at the conference remarked that if that is the sort of fairness Israel can expect from an Arab country it already has peace with, why bother with the others?
So much for the bad news. Perhaps the conference's most important achievement was forcing the Palestinians to finally get their act together. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d -- by telling the Palestinians that they could not be represented in Madrid by Yasir Arafat and the usual Palestine Liberation Organization officials, and by telling them that they could not come without agreeing to discuss with Israel only self-rule in the occupied territories -- compelled the Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza to develop their first coherent peace strategy addressed directly to Israelis.
Of all the conference participants, the Palestinian representatives, Hanan Ashrawi, Faisal Husseini and Haidar Abdel-Shafi, offered the only discernible signs of new thinking. Dr. Abdel-Shafi called on Israelis "to abandon mutal fear and mistrust, approach us as equals within a two-state solution and let us work for mutual benefit and well-being." The P.L.O. has never been able to articulate such clear-cut peace overtures to Israel, because of its internal divisions and its preoccupation with how it will look in inter-Arab politics. Only Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, who live with Israelis, could have carried such a message. A joke going around the conference hall was that the note Mr. Shamir slipped to an aide as Dr. Abdel-Shafi spoke on Friday, read: "We made a big mistake. We should have let the P.L.O. come."
It was striking that at the Palestinians' news conference, their spokesman, Albert Aghazarian, pointedly called on Israeli reporters, and he did so by name: "Dan Avidan, Israel Davar newspaper, you have the next question." Whether the Israelis and Palestinian representatives hold bilateral negotiations in Madrid or Washington, in public or in secret, it seems that they will find each other, and they will start to talk.
Intra-Palestinian politics may never be the same after this meeting. The West Bank Palestinian representatives here have had too much international news media attention, too many meetings on their own with the American Secretary of State and taken too many personal risks to come, to ever go back to the old days of taking a back seat to the P.L.O. But as the Palestinian saying goes: "One day honey, one day onions." When the spotlight is gone, they will have to face that the balance of power is so much in Israel's favor that the Government -- particularly this Israeli Government -- will offer them little. The Palestinian delegation here had lots of internal divisions and it is not clear they will be able to maintain their coherence in the more mundane, difficult days of negotiating alone with Israel and making real concessions. The conference raised expectations that are unlikely to be met soon -- if at all. There will be days of onion aplenty down the road.
Finally, the Soviets' behavior at this conference highlighted what everyone already knows: they are no longer a superpower. Mikhail S. Gorbachev, supposedly a conference co-sponsor, used his speech not to exort Israelis and Arabs to make peace, but to appeal that the world pay more attention to his economic problems. It is something that Israelis and Arabs should note. The end of the cold war made this conference possible, but also irrelevant, in the global strategic sense. Without the competition with the Soviets in the Middle East, and with no oil shortages, American interests there are minimal. The Arabs might be wise not to mistake the energy Washington put into this conference -- a spillover from the gulf war -- for a permanent committment of energy.
But therein lies Mr. Baker's dilemma. If this conference demonstrated anything, it was that these parties, when left alone, will accomplish nothing. The only way Mr. Baker could get agreement on even the shape of the table was by simply deciding what he thought was fair and imposing it. So it will be when it comes to making peace as well.
Mr. Baker is caught between American strategic interests, which will draw him away from the Middle East, and Arab-Israeli habits, which will demand his constant involvement in the Middle East.
These conflicting impulses were evident in Mr. Baker's closing remarks, in which he wavered between vowing that the United States will "provide encouragement, advice, recommendations, proposals to help the peace process," and his last word to the parties: "If you do not seize this historic opportunity, no one will blame anyone outside your region. The continuation and success of this process is in your hands."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Poland's Politicians Gather Few Votes And Less Trust

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
Through the 45 years the Communists held power in Poland, people survived by divorcing themselves from what happened in public life. What they read in the censored newspapers, what they watched on the state-controlled television, or what they heard from their national leaders all belonged to the sham reality of "Oni" -- "Them.". Everything that really mattered, from personal life to political agitation, happened outside the established political system -- in the home, the Roman Catholic Church or the clandestine Solidarity movement.
The resulting cynicism toward politicians has proven more pervasive than the cathartic enthusiasm that swept away the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe in 1989. The idea of "Oni" lives on, and many people have come to view their elected government with the disdain once reserved for the Communists. Consider the results of Poland's parliamentary elections last week. Just two years ago, this country turned out to chase the Communists from power in elections overwhelmingly won by candidates from Solidarity. This time nearly 58 percent of the electorate stayed at home, and of the more than 100 parties that competed, none won more than 12 percent of the vote. The prospect of forming a governing coalition proved so insurmountable that President Lech Walesa offered himself as prime minister. 
 As leaders of the half dozen major parties began negotiating to build a coalition and choose someone other than Mr. Walesa as prime minister, many said the most worrisome development was that so many people hadn't bothered to vote. They took no comfort from comparisons with the United States, where a voter turnout of less than 50 percent in a legislative election is no surprise; here, it is widely agreed that Poland's pioneering economic reforms require the broadest possible social consensus.
 
'They Have No Hope'
 "People are very disappointed, they have no hope, and they don't believe any kind of politicians," said Jan Litynski, a member of the Democratic Union, a center-left party emerging from Solidarity. The party won 12 percent of the vote, narrowly outperforming the former Communists and a parade of parties representing peasants, Catholics, nationalists, and a center-right faction stemming from the Solidarity movement.
Public opinion surveys indicate that the nationwide angst stems mainly from the country's economic reform program, which has filled the stores with goods and stirred vigorous growth in the private sector but has also led to an unemployment rate of 10.5 percent, and the threat of further layoffs in collapsing state-run industries, in a land where jobs had been a constitutional right.
The endless hours of waiting in line for bread or meat that characterized the Communist years is gone, but so too is the web of subsidies that kept prices artificially low. Although standards of living have dropped less than 7 percent, a majority of people believe their family's economic situation will worsen in the next 12 months, according to public opinion polls. In an October poll by the Public Opinion Research Center, only 20 percent expressed unqualified support for the Government's economic approach.
This roughly matches the election results, in which the Liberals led by Prime Minister Jan Krysztof Bielecki and the Democratic Union, headed by former Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, together won 20 percent of the vote. Their parties were most closely associated with continuing the current approach.

 
Little Explaining
 One explanation for the dissatisfaction with politicians is that the first two post-Communist Governments, those led by Mr. Mazowiecki and Mr. Bielecki, did little to explain to the public exactly why dismantling the Communist economy was proving so painful.
At the giant Ursus tractor works, for example, the election last Sunday was followed by a meeting at which layoffs were announced. More than a dozen interviews on election day with workers at this former Solidarity stronghold revealed frustration and anger, even though the Government has intervened to keep most of the factory alive. Few felt their votes would make a difference.
The old habit of seeing the country's established government or industrial institutions as "Oni" has left a considerable legacy. Millions of Poles still feel a sense of entitlement to steal from the company or to work at half speed.
And in the Communist system, success was not in any way correlated to hard work or ability; it was based exclusively on who you knew, and getting rich was simply a matter of finding the right "uklad," or scheme. The few who got ahead through these strategems were deeply resented by the "masses."
These days, both foreign investors and the emerging new class of entrepeneurs are viewed with suspicion. Many see capitalism as a more efficient form of "uklad" in which a privileged few earn obscene amounts of money. The fact that some of Poland's new rich are former Communists who started their businesses by stealing state property has not helped. Nor has a spate of financial scandals, which earlier this year included the arrest of several senior banking officials, including the president of Poland's national bank.
Despite their grumbling, however, Poles have generally tolerated the economic reforms and Mr. Walesa said this week it was up to the Government to keep them going by energizing the apathetic voters. "This 60 percent of the electorate also supports reform, but they do not like our political involvement," Mr. Walesa said in an interview with the Warsaw daily Rzeczpospolita. "By not voting, they called upon us: Take up our problems, the problems we live with; otherwise we are not in this game."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
From Japan, New Ways To Sell Yet More Cars

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Not long ago some of America's top trade negotiators tracked down the head of General Motors Corporation's Saturn project -- the high-tech car that was supposed to undo Detroit's bad habits and take the Japanese down a notch -- and asked a loaded question: Why wasn't G.M. selling its sporty, low-cost car in Tokyo?
After all, they pointed out, the United States, under pressure from the Big Three car makers, has turned autos into the season's No. 1 trade issue with Japan. Cars and car parts, more than two-thirds of the swelling trade deficit, will be high on the agenda when President Bush arrives here later this month. The Saturn would be a great way to reverse the image of American car makers in Japan, they said. 
 "What we ran into was an attitude that we hear all the time from our own manufacturers," one frustrated trade negotiator said. "You know, 'We'll export when we are done filling the American market.' Only by then, it will be a four-year-old car. And the Japanese will laugh."
More than a decade after Japan and the United States began wrestling over cars -- after tens of thousands of American auto workers have lost their jobs, after Japanese plants have sprouted throughout the Midwest, after the utilitarian, $10,000 Toyota Corolla has given way to the luxurious, $45,000 Lexus -- Tokyo and Detroit are talking past each other more than ever. Nowhere is that clearer than at the world's premiere car exhibition, the Tokyo Motor Show, held every two years. And the 1.5 million visitors streaming through -- most take the train, because you have to be crazy to drive in Tokyo -- are learning that the visions of the automobile emerging from Japan and America are dramatically different.
 
Imagining the Future
 The Japanese makers have used the show to fantasize about the "personal car," centerpiece of an anticipated era in which the roads will be filled with an array of distinctive autos -- futuristic Batmobiles, back-to-the-40's coupes, hydrogen-powered getabouts. Many of these cars, now just prototypes, will not make it to the highways for years, if ever. But they point in a direction that is unmistakable. "If we have learned anything in the past few years," said Yoshio Nakatani, the general manager of Toyota's Americas Planning Division, "it is that people do not want to drive a car just like their neighbor's."
Rightly or wrongly, Detroit is still driving in a different direction -- still aiming at Henry Ford's ideal of mass production of family cars. A G.M. executive, walking through the Tokyo show on the day after the company announced a $1.1 billion third-quarter loss, said the Japanese technology was impressive, but he dismissed the cars as "very much made for niche markets."
To the Japanese, that is exactly the point: In coming decades, the whole auto market will be a series of niches. And they are already organizing themselves that way. At Mazda's plant in Hiroshima, three or four wholly different models come down a single production line; the robots select different parts depending on what car is being built next. Such "lean production" allows even low-volume cars to be profitable, but it is still not the way Detroit does things.
In addition, no American car makers have yet to build a full design center in Japan, where many believe the center of auto design has moved. The Japanese, however, are deliberately moving their design activities out of Japan. "What we want to do is create a series of largely independent companies that design and develop cars for different regions and cultures," said Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president.
The day is not far off. Honda designed its station wagon in America for Americans (it has been a disappointment so far), and next year it plans its first all-European model. Nissan turned a series of "retro cars" -- specialty models reminiscent of America in the 50's -- into a huge hit in Japan, but so far it has not tried to sell them elsewhere. This year Toyota has a wide Camry for Americans, a narrower one for Japanese. Its Avalon was designed in California. The industrial irony is clear: Buyers seem to want an American look wrapped around a Japanese chassis.
 
Electric Cars?
 Japan's auto makers, though, have an Achilles' wheel or two of their own. Their move to big luxury models has eroded their fuel economy ratings. It has also begun to undercut one of their own favorite myths: That their luxury models are aimed at taking market share from German, not American, auto makers. With Japan's share of the American market now just short of 30 percent, such claims look ridiculous.
Moreover, Japanese auto companies are not yet the environmental visionaries that their public relations staffs insist they are. While a few are working on recyclable car parts, they have been slow to develop electric cars. "We will beat them to the market," said Gary W. Dickinson, who heads some of G.M.'s big technology projects, referring to its forthcoming electric car.
Such victories for G.M. may be hollow if the world's biggest auto maker doesn't begin to take the world's second biggest auto market seriously. Which takes one back to the Saturn. The problem with fulfilling the American market first is that it perpetuates a mind set in American factories that exporting is what one does with cars that are left over. More important, by not challenging the Japanese in their own market, G.M. loses a chance to determine how competitive the Saturn really is, against the best players on the block. If it did, Detroit might see a lot of things happening here -- new designs, new consumer tastes -- before the Japanese take it by surprise, once again, in America.

Why Older People Are Richer Than Other Americans

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
The cherished idea that life gets a little better for each succeeding generation of Americans is being challenged anew by economic research suggesting that if present trends persist, only the best trained will continue to prosper while other Americans remain stuck at current standards of living or fall behind.
The notion that some Americans will be the first generation to live at a lower level than their parents has emerged as a campaign theme for some Democratic presidential candidates. More important, it seems to be gaining ground as an issue in public opinion polls. In a New York Times/CBS News poll taken last month, 52 percent of respondents said the next generation will be worse off than today's. In March, the number was half that, 26 percent. 
 "When you ask about generations coming up, it depends on who in that generation you are asking about," said Claudia Golden, a Harvard economist, "and at no time in our history has that 'who' question mattered more. The college-educated person is doing better than before, and is also in a position to do extraordinarily well. But if you are looking at a high-school graduate not going on to college, entering the job market for the first time, particularly if he is African-American, his future is not very good."
Although intergenerational wealth issues are a relatively new field for researchers, there is some evidence that this economic generation gap is rooted in two trends: the inability of many young families to buy a home -- often the primary means of amassing and retaining wealth -- and flat or declining incomes for a broad range of workers.
As a result, wealth, which is defined as assets after debt has been subtracted, has been accruing mostly in the hands of those middle-aged and older. Figures from a 1986 Federal Reserve Bank survey, published last May by Robert B. Avery of Cornell University and Arthur B. Kennickell of the Federal Reserve in Washington, show that in 1983 households headed by someone under 35 had an average net worth of $45,700; three years later that figure had slipped to $38,600. At the same time, households headed by those 65 and older increased on average from $208,000 to $218,000. All age groups under 55 grew poorer on average; all groups over 55 grew richer.
In 1963, according to the same survey, households headed by those over 65 made up 19 percent of the population and owned 26 percent of the wealth; in 1986, that group represented roughly 21 percent but its share of wealth had grown to 33 percent, while that under 35 -- the baby-boomers -- had increased from 18 percent to 23 percent, yet remained at 6 percent for its share of the wealth.
Private homes represent a large part of each generation's net worth. For older Americans, who bought their first homes in the 1950's and 60's, long ownership equals equity. Today 85 percent of homeowners 65 or older own their homes outright, debt free, according to David Weil, a Brown University economist.
But ownership rates among young adults are falling. Those rates have increased since 1973 only among households headed by those 55 or older, from 76 percent to 80 percent in 1990, according to a recent survey by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. They stayed even over that period for those 45 to 54, but slipped from 51 percent to 44 percent for 25 to 34 and from 23 percent to 15 percent for people under 25.
 
'Losing Absolutely'
 The problem is that housing prices have sharply risen above the rate of inflation, while incomes, in constant dollars, have not kept pace for many people. Frank Levy, a University of Maryland economist whose study, "The Economic Future of American Families," did much to spark the economic generation-gap debate, has shown how incomes spiraled for men ages 45 to 54, working full time, from 1948 onward.
In 1948, this group had a median income of $16,702 in 1989 dollars. By 1958, incomes had risen to $23,400, an increase of 20.7 percent. Ten years later, in 1968, their wages had climbed to $28,400, a 40 percent increase over the decade, and by 1978, to $32,500, up another 14.4 percent. Yet by 1988, this group's wages had stagnated. Productivity per worker had also stalled, Dr. Levy said.
When the broad range of incomes was rising, even those who at the lower end of the scale improved their lives, Dr. Levy said. "If the underlying trend in wages is rising, then you can lose relative to other people but still be better off than you were," he said. "But if the underlying trend is flat, as it is now, then when you lose relative to other people, you are also losing absolutely."
The losers are those with marginal educations in a specialized work force. Dr. Levy, whose work has been picked up by the Presidential campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, pointed to research showing that wages and employment have risen for college-educated production workers while falling for the semi-skilled and unskilled. But if the future belongs to the college-educated, as Dr. Golden of Harvard suggested, it belongs to relatively few: the proportion of high school graduates who earned bachelors degrees has been constant at about 25 percent for years.

Many of the last ancient trees have been spared only by a celebrated diversion, the Fish and Wildlife Service's decision in 1990 to protect a little bird called the northern spotted owl.
That ruling infuriates Washington and Oregon loggers whose jobs are threatened -- the bodies of spotted owls have been found nailed to road signs. But like the snail darter in Tennessee and the delta smelt in California, the last 3,000 pairs of owls were fading bit players in world ecology until they became the symbol of their habitat and the legal tripwire for rescuing it. They can only survive in the mix of 300- to 1,000-year-old trees, fallen logs, dead snags, new seedlings and rich forest floor that characterizes old-growth forest. 
 Some feel that relying on cute or exotic animals to save the day obscures the huge environmental and economic stakes involved in the old-growth battles. The real issue, environmentalists say, is that an irreplaceable treasure is being sawn down for the short-term gain of timber companies and the politicians who support them in the name of saving jobs, and that thinly disguised Government subsidies to the timber industry are encouraging this.
"We're trying to avoid this 'endangered species of the month' parade -- we can't expect the Endangered Species act to carry all the weight," said Representative Jim Jontz, an Indiana Democrat who has introduced bills to ban selling Federal timber below cost and to protect old forests. "We need an 'endangered ecosystems' approach."
Ancient forests were cut in the 1980's at the rate of 70,000 acres a year. They cannot be recreated simply by replanting and waiting.
Harvesting now commonly means clearcutting patches of 40 to 640 acres, burning the cut limbs and debris and reseeding. This practice eliminates decaying trees, a fertilizer source. Unshaded soil heats up, killing microbes that help new trees take root. Replanting with rows of prime lumber conifers then produces not a replacement forest but a mere tree farm, which supports few species. One hard storm can wash off generations of topsoil, wiping out seedlings, smothering fish eggs in spawning streams and making the water too shallow and warm for the 20-pound trout of the Northwest.
Almost all the old-growth forests that remain are in the hands of the Forest Service, the Federal Bureau of Land Management, the states of Washington and Oregon or small timber lot owners.
It is these forests that produce the highest profits for timber companies. Lodgepole pine in the dry eastern Rockies may sell for $25 per 1,000 board feet, but Japanese buyers are paying nearly $750 for the same amount of Douglas fir from the rainy Cascades if it's fine enough for the exposed-beam construction of traditional houses. Largely for that reason, a quarter of the logs cut in the Pacific Northwest are exported.
 
The Beauty of the Wood
 The price difference is in the wood's strength and beauty. The grain of thick old trees is knot-free and as compelling to stare at as fire is. The beams made from spruces, ponderosa and sugar pines, and silver and Douglas firs will dry without warping and carry heavy loads. But exporting raw logs from Federal land is illegal, and there are many domestic buyers. Sitka spruces become guitars. Rot-resistant redwoods become decks and picnic tables. Incense cedars, whose smell repels moths, become closet lining, fenceposts and pencils. Seven-foot-thick red cedars are split into shingles.
For decades, timber companies fought to keep the public trees from being cut because it depressed the price of their own timberland. But by the late 1980's, the companies had cut virtually all their old growth, and regional Forest Service administrators now say that timber state Congressmen are pressing them to sell trees faster than the public lands can sustain.
The companies argue that people want high-quality lumber, and remind environmentalists that the national forests were set aside, like Europe's, to be harvested regularly. Some timbermen refer to the old forests as overmature thickets where fine trees are allowed to rot and jobs could be created instead.
Another push to cut has come from Wall Street. Corporate raiders spotted undervalued forests acquired in railroad-building days. The Maxxam Group of Houston, for example, bought the Pacific Lumber Company of California and logged its redwoods to pay off the debt.
But the most economically irrational attack on ancient forests is not in the Northwest, but in Alaska. There, environmentalists say, despite the Tongass Timber Reform Act of 1990, two mills owned by the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation and a Japanese consortium are paying as little as $3 for 500-year-old sitka spruces -- a wood so light and strong that Howard Hughes used it in his gigantic Spruce Goose airplane -- and grinding them into pulp, something that can be made from any ten-inch tree farm specimen. The Forest Service is losing 75 to 95 cents on every dollar it spends for forest upkeep.
Meanwhile, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. is planning to convene the "God Squad," a panel of Federal officials empowered to grant exemptions to the Endangered Species Act and to ask it to allow 44 sales of old-growth Oregon timber halted by the spotted owl ruling.
But companies, fearing that the future will get bleaker, are aggressively developing wood substitutes. Oriented-strand board, a new plywood, can be made by fusing glue-covered strips of sawmill waste or trees like aspen. More walls are being built of thin steel 2-by-4s, not pine ones. And companies are even importing the Japanese technology that helps foreign sawmills pay so much more for exported American old-growth -- thin, laser-guided saw blades that get more planks from a log.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
How Most of the Public Forests Are Sold to Loggers at a Loss

BYLINE: By Donald G. McNeil Jr.

 BODY:
In 1905 Gifford Pinchot, America's first national forester, assured Congress that if it would place the national forest reserves under his direction in the Department of Agriculture he would have them running at a profit within five years. He went so far as to say that he would not even need the $1 million a year he was given for research and promotion.
The National Forest Service has never made good on Mr. Pinchot's promise. Last year, Congress gave it $550 million to pay for growing and selling timber. F. Dale Robertson, the present chief, reported that its "net revenues" from timber sales for 1990 were $629 million. 
 But a growing chorus of tree-smart economists are challenging timber policy, not on environmental grounds but as business propositions. They are producing cash-flow analyses that conclude that the Treasury is losing up to $200 million a year on timber and, by conventional business wisdom, ought to stop.
Congress held hearings last week on a bill introduced by Representative Jim Jontz, an Indiana Democrat, that would phase out all money-losing sales over five years and aid towns whose sawmills were forced to close.
But the question remains: why sell the national forests at all? There is no timber shortage. There are more trees in the United States than there were in 1920.
Three historic changes are responsible. Oil and gas heat replaced fireplaces and stoves that used to burn 400 cubic feet of wood per American per year; cars, trucks and tractors replaced the nation's 50 million horses and the one-third of all agricultural lands that fed them; advances in seeds and fertilizers mean the nation's crops are being grown on about 400 million acres, the same amount under cultivation in 1920. On the rest, trees grew again.
The national forests have no lock on the timber market. About 72 percent of United States timberland is privately owned.
Trees, like most other crops, grow best on land that is warm, wet and flat. Most Forest Service land, by contrast, is mountainous, dry and cold, the land neither homesteaders nor railroads wanted. It is nearly as impractical to farm timber there as it would be to farm tomatoes. Trees grow slowly, roads are expensive, fires are hard to fight and small towns may lose their watersheds or tourist trade when the forests are logged.
But publicly owned trees are cut because the Forest Service sells them so cheaply that loggers would be foolish to say no. It builds roads, pays rangers, absorbs the risks of fires and insects, then sells at a loss.
Historically, the Forest Service has set minimum bids without figuring in its own costs -- a normal part of a business's profit calculation. When loggers compete, their bids are often twice the minimums, suggesting that the many one-bid sales are underpriced.
There are 122 national forests, and the Forest Service admits that 65 lost money on timber in 1990. Economists for Congress, the Wilderness Society and Cascade Holistic Economic Consultants calculate instead that between 98 and 108 lost money. All but one of the money-makers are in the Northwest; the exception is the Allegheny in Pennsylvania, which is full of valuable black cherry used in furniture.
Robert E. Wolf, a forester and retired Congressional Research Service economist, contends that the Treasury has lost $5.6 billion on national forest trees over the last decade.
Critics like Mr. Wolf say Forest Service accounting conceals costs several ways:
While dirt and gravel logging roads normally last about 25 years, the Service amortizes them with "cut rotation per forest" formulas that spread the cost over at least 100 years. In the Chugach Forest in Alaska, they were spread out over 1,800 years. "It's as if the current Italian Government was still paying for the Appian Way," said Steve Richardson, a staff member for Representative Mike Synar, an Oklahoma Democrat whose committee commissioned Mr. Wolf's study.
In profit-per-forest breakdowns, $110 million for the 4,000 people in the Service's Washington and regional offices is simply left out. Land surveys and road work paid for by Congress are left out, even if they are for timber. The 25 percent of sales paid in lieu of taxes to counties where the trees are logged is not counted, though any business subtracts taxes from profits.
In separate analyses of other benefits of logging, the Forest Service says 91 of its 122 forests produce "positive returns," when the value of creating wildlife habitat, pastureland, increasing water runoff and adding roads for recreation are calculated. But the critics say these analyses inflate benefits. Increased runoff, for example, is disastrous in spring floods. Clearcut patches of mountain are not easily reached by grazing cattle. Benefits to wildlife are negated if some species disappear or if new roads into deep woods invite poachers in.
"They make the savings and loan business look like an angel," said Mr Wolf. "If a private business did this, they wouldn't just end up bankrupt -- they'd end up in court."
Another quirk in Forest Service budgeting is a provision that lets regional administrators sell timber for cash to manage forests with. This has led to contradictions like timber cuts in grizzly bear habitat and Indian archaeological sites to pay for saving similar sites.
The Forest Service has argued that thousands of jobs will be lost if below-cost sales are stopped. There is no doubt that whole communities have come to depend on those sales. The number of jobs is disputed; but environmentalists reply that the demand for wood is steady, so new jobs are appearing on private lands.
In any case, timber jobs are falling on their own. New mills use fewer workers, logs exported are jobs lost. Over 200 sawmills in the Northwest closed in the 1980's. In Oregon, the number of loggers and sawmill workers dropped from 42,000 in 1979 to 33,000 last year, but the state's economy added 100,000 jobs.
Economists differ on solutions. Some would ban money-losing sales. Some would use them only to save jobs. Others say forests could make up the loss with fees for hiking, hunting and fishing. The Forest Service has said it does not want new laws banning sales, but says it will modify parts of its accounting.

HEADLINE: IRAQ IS BLOCKING AID DISTRIBUTION

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Nov. 2

 BODY:
The Iraqi Government is blocking attempts by international relief organizations to distribute food and medicine directly to hundreds of thousands of Iraqis suffering from poor health and malnutrition in the aftermath of a war and a trade embargo, relief officials and Iraqi authorities say.
Iraq's Minister of Health, Abdul Salam M. Saaid, said in an interview he would not allow food distribution by relief agencies except through the Government's distribution and rationing system. He accused the relief agencies of food distribution "gimmicks" that he said were "designed to keep quiet the good people in the United States who don't like to see others suffer." 
 The minister indicated that if the people of Europe and the United States saw a vast and direct food distribution effort under way in Iraq, it would quiet their consciences and "shut up" their opposition to continuing United Nations sanctions. These, he said, are the ultimate cause of suffering in Iraq.
Mr. Saaid's remarks, made in an interview this week, reflect how much the struggle to provide emergency care to Iraq's 18 million people has become politicized in the wake of the Persian Gulf war. The United States and its allies are seeking to maintain tight economic sanctions until the Government of President Saddam Hussein fully complies with all of the terms of the cease-fire resolution that ended formal hostilities last winter.
 
Food Stays in Warehouses
 As a consequence of the Iraqi Government's policy against third-party food distribution, food worth about $4 million, including infant formula and high-protein food packages specially prepared for children under 5, has been sitting in warehouses in Baghdad and Jordan for weeks, relief officials said.
Most of the food belongs to the United Nations Children's Fund, which in August proposed the idea of setting up special nutrition centers across the country to help about 340,000 Iraqi children who are believed to be most vulnerable to dying of malnutrition or infectious disease. The Government rationing system provides only one-quarter of what is generally acknowledged to be an infant's requirement of powdered infant formula.
Douglas Broderick, the representative here of Catholic Relief Services, a private American group, said the Iraqi authorities in recent weeks had shut down a food distribution program that was using churches and mosques in Mosul and Baghdad to serve 60,000 people.
Then, Mr. Broderick said, Health Ministry officials in southern Iraq blocked the direct distribution of 250 tons of food that he had brought into the country to help feed 23,000 families in the Amarra area north of Basra. Mr. Broderick said the food has been sitting in a warehouse for several weeks.
 
'Very Well Focused Effort'
 In Amarra, he said, "there are 3,000 pregnant women and this was a very well focused program in a population that is at risk." Iraqi authorities have suggested that the food be turned over to Iraqi Government groups, but so far Mr. Broderick has declined.
Only in Kurdistan, where the Baghdad Government has lost its authority over territory and local government, are United Nations agencies giving food aid directly to the people, officials said.
Mr. Saaid has told relief agency officials that Iraq fears rioting and demeaning scenes of people grasping for food at distribution centers if agencies are allowed to set up their own distribution centers.
"Are we a nation of beggars?" the minister asked.
"The system is there," he said. "Just open the tap for us."
He asked that the United States release some of the $1.4 billion in Iraqi funds still frozen in American banks for the purchase of food and medicine.
 
'Political Game' Cited
 A critical battleground in the war of oratory that continues between Baghdad and Washington is the effect of economic sanctions on public health in Iraq. A number of studies have tried to document increased mortality among children under 5 years of age from disease, malnutrition and the destructive effects of inflation, which has left most Iraqi families unable to afford adequate supplies of food.
Mr. Saaid said his ministry was reluctant to release figures on child mortality "because health has become part of a political game designed to undermine a political stand."
But Mr. Saaid's Under Secretary, Dr. Shawki Murqus, disclosed during the interview that projections last May by a Harvard University study team about the war's devastating impact on public health had not been borne out by official Government figures.
The Harvard team's report said increases in infectious disease compounded by poor nutrition could cause 170,000 deaths among children beyond the normal mortality rate. But Dr. Murqus said that the total deaths of children under 5 in Iraq since August 1990 was 19,863. This figure, he said, includes normal mortality as well as excess deaths caused by disease and malnutrition.
The figure is far lower than any projection developed by outside experts. It does not reflect thousands of deaths that occurred "outside" the public health system during the flight of two million Kurds last winter to the Turkish and Iranian borders and during a rebellion in southern Iraq among Shiite Muslims.

HEADLINE: CHINA CHIEFS SEEM EDGY AND DIVIDED

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Two months after the collapse of Soviet Communism, China's leaders seem increasingly edgy and divided, and there are signs that they have responded to the events in the Soviet Union by deciding to tighten their grip on the nation further.
Chinese newspapers have carried more statements about "class struggle," there are calls for intensifying Marxist education, leaders of many work units have recently warned employees not to meet foreigners without permission, and officials at one Beijing university even called on staff members to report on colleagues who have contacts with foreigners. The officials insisted that even private correspondence with Westerners should be reported to the authorities, a Chinese who was present said. 
 That person, and many others, characterize the situation as "nei jin, wai song" -- tranquillity on the surface, repression within.
The tighter controls are imperceptible at first glance, for the streets of Beijing abound these days with mountains of cabbages rather than crowds of police, and the free markets spill out as much as ever with bright jackets and lacy underwear and other emblems of free enterprise. But members of the urban middle class, especially those in sensitive work places or with foreign friends, are feeling the political cold front.
"I can't help worrying if my leader is going to call me aside this afternoon for seeing you," a scholar in his 30's said, laughing nervously as he bid a foreigner goodbye. He said the staff members of his work unit had been banned from seeing foreigners and had been warned that the Central Intelligence Agency was trying to step up spying in China.
 
Gates Statement Cited
 The talk of the C.I.A. stems from a statement by Robert M. Gates, President Bush's nominee to be Director of Central Intelligence, in his Senate confirmation hearings. In answer to a question about China on Sept. 17, Mr. Gates said, "I think more can be done through expanded human intelligence collection."
The statement was scarcely noticed in the United States, but it has been published in secret news summaries for Chinese officials. Already nervous after the Soviet events, some hard-liners are taking it as proof of their fears of a secret American conspiracy of "peaceful evolution" that would lead to replacing the Communist Government. The leadership takes this supposed plot so seriously that it is said to have formed an "Anti-Peaceful Evolution Working Group."
Another indication that the leaders are jittery, according to one knowledgeable Chinese, is a shuffle in the command of the Chengdu Military Region. Zhang Taiheng, the commander of the region, is said to have been summoned to Beijing for "study" and retirement, and will be replaced by an officer from the General Logistics Department in Beijing.
The reason for the shuffle apparently is a helicopter crash last spring in Tibet in which a number of senior military officials died. The central authorities reportedly complained that General Zhang had led three helicopters to inspect the border area with India, even though he had been told not to take so many top generals to the area.
"Normally it would be a minor matter, but the center is very fearful now of generals who don't obey orders, and so it wants to take a very stern action," said the Chinese who recounted the episode. Government spokesmen in Chengdu could not confirm whether there had been a change in the command.
It is difficult to gauge the tension in cities outside Beijing -- partly because the authorities are so tense that they are denying permission for American correspondents to travel virtually anywhere outside the capital. The Government has refused permission lately to visit even innocuous places such as Jilin and Hebei Provinces, where there are no known political problems.
 
Official Press Is Split
 One sign of a split in the leadership lately is the divided nature of the official press. One line of articles recently has focused on the financial problems of state-owned enterprises and has emphasized that the main task in China is to boost economic reform and raise the standard of living. This line of reasoning appears to have the backing of the nation's patriarch, Deng Xiaoping.
The other line of articles in the official press argues that the most serious threat comes not from economic problems but from political enemies at home and abroad.
In a recent People's Daily article, a patron of the hard-liners, Deng Liqun, called for more "class struggle" -- a term that for many intellectuals has frightening associations with the brutality of the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976. Meanwhile, the People's Liberation Army Daily revived another old expression with similar connotations: "You must beat a dog even when it is drowning."
The phrase was often used to justify further attacks on "counterrevolutionaries" who had already been persecuted. The newspaper warned that showing mercy to such a drowning "dog" is a mistake because it may swim ashore and bite people again. "Therefore," it said, "it should be bitterly beaten."

HEADLINE: THE MIDDLE EAST TALKS;
Syria's Tough Choice

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Despite Syria's serious hesitation in the last two days over joining the next stage of the Middle East peace conference here, Arab delegates say neither Syria, nor any other participant, can afford to stay out of the process indefinitely.
Most of those attending the talks, including the Israelis, say they view the Syrian position as part of what they predict will be years of exhaustive negotiations. The general sentiment here is that the Syrians will eventually take up a role in the talks, if not Sunday, then in a few days or a few weeks. 
 Otherwise, according to this line of thought, they will face an intolerable isolation in a fast-changing world, especially since the Palestinians, Jordanians and Israelis have agreed to talk whether the Syrians come or not.
Lotfy al-Khouli, a well-known Arab columnist and expert on Arab and Palestinian affairs who is a member of the Egyptian delegation, summed up the general opinion when he said today that the Syrians would come back because the country that issued the invitation for the talks was the United States -- now the world's solitary superpower and, he added, a nation none of the participants could afford to alienate.
 
Fear of Being Left Out
 "Everyone is inside the peace cage and the door has been closed," Mr. Khouli said. "It's an American cage from which Syrians, just like Israelis and Palestinians, cannot really get out. Anyone who thinks otherwise is engaged in wishful thinking."
There are other factors in the assessments here of Syria's future role. Several Arab delegates here said the Syrians were also concerned that talks between Palestinians and Israelis might move much faster than talks between the Syrians and the Israelis, leaving Syria stranded as other Arabs settle with Israel.
Experts here say Syria is maneuvering with its traditional politics in a different Arab world from the one it used to inhabit. The Persian Gulf states have been freed from Syrian and Iraqi intimidation by the gulf crisis. Palestinians, who never had much affection for Syria, have appeared to win publicity points here, and they see these talks as their last chance to win a measure of autonomy. Iraq, because of the gulf war, has been wiped out as an Arab force for years to come. All these changes affect the mix.
Among the sea changes of the last few years is a fundamental and revolutionary transformation in the Arab mindset, a diminution of Israel's role as the foremost regional ally of the United States and the emergence of the United States as the world power.
 
Changing Old Patterns
 Together, these factors have deeply affected the nature of the discourse among Arabs and with the rest of the world. They have also swept up both Israel and the Arabs in a process that many here regard as one made in the United States.
The process is annihilating stereotypes of the past and forcing changes in old patterns of action. Among Palestinians, this evolution has been starkly expressed by the chief Palestinian spokeswoman at the Madrid talks, Hanan Ashrawi, when she proclaimed the other day that "40 years of violence have got us nowhwere."
For Syria, far beyond any concern over the surface issue of the venue of the talks, there is a deep concern about forging ahead with the talks and thus giving the appearance that it is too quickly abandoning the hard-line public statements it has endorsed for a quarter of century on the topic of the Israeli-occupied territories.
Between the Arabs themselves, the new attitudes are illustrated by what the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, calls the "civilized modalities of dealing with each other."

 
Themes From Sadat
 These themes began to evolve more than a decade ago, when President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt visited Israel and called for peace between Arabs and Jews from the podium of the Parliament. Faced at first with utter Arab rejection, the themes Mr. Sadat advocated have now found their way to the Arab mainstream.
The Madrid negotiations are in fact picking up after the Camp David accords, which brought peace between Egypt and Israel. They have emerged as an acceptable Arab choice as a consequence of the gulf crisis and the gulf war.
The war also emboldened Arab moderates in other respects too. Many are openly stating now what they have always whispered in private: that their vital interests are firmly attached to an enduring alliance with the West.
 
Support From Saudis
 King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, whose country hardly uttered the word "Israel" a few years ago, is declaring almost weekly now his support of the American peace initiative, vowing to support it, and pouring lavish praise on President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
For its part, the United States has framed the parameters of the "red line" of which it is the author by adopting an increasingly firm tone with Israel.
The word "evenhanded" has been pronounced repeatedly by American officials to describe their shifting approach to the Middle East peace process.
To get Israel to attend the peace conference, Mr. Bush used the carrot of $10 billion in loan guarantees for helping settle Soviet Jewish immigrants. Moreover, the United States leaned on Israel to swallow the presence of Palestinian delegates who are demonstrably affiliated with the Palestine Liberation Organization -- although the Israelis have vowed never to do business with the P.L.O.
Arab gulf countries have advanced a proposition to end their economic boycott of Israel if it were to stop Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza strip.
 
Egypt's Leadership
 President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, heir to Mr. Sadat's legacy, treated as a pariah for having supported the peace treaty with Israel, has recaptured much of Egypt's traditional leadership in the region. Almost every week Arab diginitaries travel to Cairo, and the League of Arab States moved back there this year, to a home not far from where the Israeli flag flutters over the country's embassy in downtown Cairo.
After the Persian Gulf war, a sort of stampede has been under way among Arab leaders, including President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, to fashion a political and strategic relationship with the United States after its emergence as the world's only superpower. In this, many of them hope to emulate the special relationship that the Israelis cultivated over the last three decades in their ties to the United States.
This new mindset is buttressed by the continuing collapse of the Communist empire, leaving intransigent Mideast regimes, like Iraq, Libya, Syria and Iran, with poor alternatives and even poorer arguments to justify their stands.
 
Pressures on Syria
 Over the last few weeks, a conference held in Teheran to inveigh against the peace process went largely unremarked in many Arab capitals. And in yet another sign of the new era that is affecting the Syrians' situation, Palestinian youths poured out into the streets of the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Wednesday to place olive branches on Israeli armored cars patrolling their cities.
These and other events have added to the pressures on the Syrians to come to the table, delegates here agree. As Mr. Moussa of Egypt said in a conversation today: "There is a red line no one can cross. Time and the evolution of things in the region make it imperative to change the way we think. There is a new order being fashioned with the good offices of the United States and no one can be excepted from it."

HEADLINE: With Pride Now and Economic Pain Ahead, Zambia Swears In New Leader

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUSAKA, Zambia, Nov. 2

 BODY:
In a rare democratic transition, Frederick Chiluba, a trade union leader, was sworn in here today as President of Zambia. Tens of thousands of people walked miles in the hot sun to a grassy square in the front of the nation's High Court to witness the inauguration.
They listened to the new President pledge that "freedom to work and freedom of speech" would replace the "corruption, repression and dictatorship" of the past. 
 Earlier in the day, the only other President Zambia has known, Kenneth D. Kaunda, conceded defeat by a landslide at the polls on Thursday.
In a televised speech, the 67-year-old Mr. Kaunda, an often-emotional man who clutched his signature white linen handkerchief in his left hand, offered an apology to the people of his south-central African nation, saying, "I tried to do my very best."
 
Comeback Seen as Unlikely
 He said he would work to pick up the pieces of his shattered political organization, the United National Independence Party, which had virtually run the country. But few took the idea seriously. Zambians seemed to agree with former President Jimmy Carter, leader of an election observer team, that Mr. Kaunda now deserved a role as a "respected senior statesman."
The ousted President, well known in Africa and internationally, achieved far less success with the Zambian economy. He has bequeathed to the 48-year-old Chiluba a bankrupt country.
This is a comedown from Zambia's position as one of the richest nations on the continent after its first decade of independence from Britain, beginning in 1964. In colonial days, what is now Zambia was known as Northern Rhodesia.
In Thursday's voting, widespread disgust with the decrepit state of the economy and the low esteem in which many had come to hold Mr. Kaunda helped provide Mr. Chiluba's stunning majority.
Although the returns were still incomplete 48 hours after the polls closed, Larry Garber, a senior consultant with the National Democratic Institute in Washington who came here with Mr. Carter, said he believed that final counting would give Mr. Chiluba about 80 percent of the vote.
Officials of Mr. Chiluba's party, the Movement for Multiparty Democracy, said partial results showed they had won more than 100 of the 150 seats in Parliament.
 
Dissent Had a Price
 For many members and supporters of Mr. Chiluba's party, today's swearing-in represented a hard-earned victory. Sitting on the stage behind him were several civilians who had gone to jail for plotting a coup against Mr. Kaunda in the early 1980's.
Zambians seemed proud that, in contrast with much of Africa, their country was able to carry out multiparty elections without violence. "It was good Kaunda had to stay and face it," said Masiye Nyirenda, 26, a bank clerk. "We helped him pack his things and leave by voting. No shots have been fired. The people have rejected him."
Many voters credited the relatively smooth running of the elections to the presence of international monitoring teams including Mr. Carter's, as well as two Zambian teams, which fielded more than 3,000 observers.
Mr. Chiluba, as leader since 1974 of the nation's robust labor union movement, the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions, was a clear choice to lead the country's newly invigorated political opposition in the election.
But some now question whether he has the political acumen to carry through the promise of democracy and the economic skills to straighten out the troubled economy. Senior supporters say Mr. Chiluba was chosen for his vote-getting ability rather than experience in government.
 
Austerity Will Be Needed
 Those views notwithstanding, Mr. Chiluba, who describes himself as a believer in free enterprise, faces the need to make some unpopular moves. He tried to prepare the way during the campaign by telling voters that Government-subsidized food -- one of Mr. Kaunda's methods of keeping city dwellers happy -- was not a viable economic policy.
He has pledged to remove the subsidies in stages. When Mr. Kaunda reduced subsidies last year, there were riots, and out of fear of violence just before the election, he broke a commitment with the World Bank to reduce the subsidies again in September.
Mr. Chiluba has argued that the subsidies have helped break the nation -- huge amounts of state revenue has been spent on keeping grain prices artificially low for the consumer -- leaving little to pay the farmers who grow it. Thus, many farmers did not grow corn this year, leaving the country with a substantial shortage and predictions of famine in some regions.
 
Avid Reader
 Frederick Jacob Titus Chiluba was born the son of a miner in Kitwe, a major city in the northern copper belt, on April 30, 1943. He dropped out of school because of lack of money and completed his secondary education in 1971 through a correspondence course from London. Since then, he has continued to read political science and history, often quoting from the biographies of world figures.
As a young man, he went to Tanzania to work as a clerk on a sisal plantation, where, he has said, he developed his interest in the labor movement.
In 1966, he joined Atlas Copco, a Swedish mining-equipment company in the city of Ndola as an accounts assistant, and stayed at the company, rising to credit manager, until last year, when he took a leave of absence.
He started in the labor movement as a shop steward for the National Union of Building, Engineering and General Workers and became its president in 1971. In 1987, he left the union, the loser in an intramural political struggle, but soon established a new organization so he could retain his leadership of the national trade union congress.
Eight months after a coalition of politicians, students and businessmen pressed hard for multiparty elections, the Government legalized the opposition, and he was elected chairman of a new political party.
 
Jailed and Born Again
 Unlike many other union leaders in Africa, Mr. Chiluba refused to be co-opted, declining Government job offers from President Kaunda. Instead, he used his position to criticize economic policies.
Angered by such criticism, Mr. Kaunda arrested Mr. Chiluba in 1981 on charges of trying to overthrow the Government.
In three months in prison, Mr. Chiluba has said, he became a born-again Christian.
The new Zambian President is very short by the standard of most Africans -- just under five feet tall.
He is said to be an effective negotiator, yet has caused concern among some supporters for what a newspaper, The Weekly Post, called his authoritarian style as a labor leader.
"He surrounded himself with loyal followers and did not take criticism easily," the paper wrote in a profile of him last week. The same pattern, it said, was occurring in his party.
"Chiluba has already found himself surrounded by many people who are little more than professional praise singers and are looking for jobs," the paper said. "They already call him Your Excellency; some even get down on their knees to talk to him."

HEADLINE: Jackson Says He Won't Run But Seeks to Keep Coalition

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Declaring to his supporters that "we are free agents in a political market," Jesse Jackson announced as expected today that he would not mount a third try for the Democratic Presidential nomination, and he asked his backers to withhold their support for other candidates.
In calling for the mobilization of a "new democratic majority" in a speech to about 100 people at a housing project near the Capitol, Mr. Jackson, 50 years old, sought to signal that he was not ready to have others write his political obituary. 
 But several of Mr. Jackson's advisers have already begun to worry that voters who came to the polls in 1984 and 1988 in response to Mr. Jackson's personal appeal will scatter this year or, more likely, not vote at all.
 
A Fragile Coalition
 Holding together the already fragile Rainbow Coalition that Mr. Jackson used as a framework for his previous campaigns should prove to be a daunting task. The coalition, which operates out of Washington office, has only carried political clout in the years when Mr. Jackson has run for President.
And Mr. Jackson's plan to use his supporters as leverage with the candidates seeking the nomination is an untested theory that would require a loyal, committed band of voters who could be relied upon to vote as a bloc.
"The prospect is that his political constituency could split very badly unless he moves very quickly" to throw his support to another candidate, said Ronald Walters, a former Jackson adviser who is chairman of the political science department at Howard University.
Mr. Walters said that some black political professionals who are looking for a campaign to join might be attracted to Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who is black. Other Jackson liberals, he speculated, might be attracted to Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who appeals to organized labor and was warmly received at a Congressional Black Caucus reception in September.
Dennis Rivera, the president of Local 1199, the New York City health care workers' union, and a prominent Jackson supporter who attended today's announcement, said he would probably support Mr. Harkin, if Gov. Mario M. Cuomo did not enter the race.
 
Voters May Stay Home
 It is equally likely, Mr. Walters and other Jackson supporters worry, that many of the newly registered voters who joined the Democratic party in 1984 and 1988 will simply stay home on Election Day in 1992.
"I'm afraid there will be confusion no matter what happens," Mr. Walters said.
Mr. Jackson stopped short of calling for the formation of a third political party today, but he criticized Republicans as well as Democrats for failing to address the needs of the "real middle classes, those caught up in the middle."
"Too often the parties become alter egos and not alternatives," Mr. Jackson said in his speech. "They appear too close to one another and too far from the new majority. There has been too much of an unholy alliance between the two parties --leaving the electorate with two names but one party, one set of assumptions and no options."
In responding to questions, Mr. Jackson refused to criticize any of the six major Democratic candidates now in the race and took special pains to avoid offering any opinion of Governor Wilder.
Mr. Wilder, who was campaigning in New Hampshire this week, said he had already received some backing from Jackson supporters and expected to get more.
"It's not a down side for me at all," he told reporters. "If it does anything, it will free people who may have been holding back to see what Reverend Jackson would do. It has to be considered good."
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska praised Mr. Jackson as an important voice for economic and social justice. "You don't have to run for office to make a contribution," he said. "Reverend Jackson understands that."
And Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said that Mr. Jackson would remain "a leader of our party" and that his intention to remain involved in the campaign would help Democrats "to change priorities nationwide and defeat George Bush."
Four years ago, Mr. Jackson announced he would run for President a second time before 5,000 supporters in Raleigh, N.C., in a ceremony that was replete with balloons and red-white-and-blue political signs. This time, he chose a public housing project that has been plagued with drugs and violence. Local teen-agers continued to play basketball on a court behind him as he spoke, and the crowd of was swelled by photographers and reporters. His wife, Jackie, joined him, but his five children were absent.
"Look around you," said Representative Kweisi Mfume, Democrat of Maryland. "This is not Kennebunkport. Look around you; these people are Americans."
 
Taking a Risk
 By shifting his focus from what Mr. Jackson called the "political center" to the "moral center," he is taking a risk of being counted out of the political formula entirely in 1992. He is still expected to host a weekly talk show for Cable News Network, a deal that would have fallen through if he had decided to run.
But Mr. Jackson said he would force Democrats to address a Rainbow Coalition agenda that includes support of statehood for the District of Columbia, the repeal of right-to-work laws, same-day voter registration, national health care, affordable housing and equal financing for education.
"As a Democrat, I hope that the party leadership will expand and reach out with hope and vision," Mr. Jackson said. "George Bush should be and must be beaten, and he will be beaten by Democrats if they speak with authenticity."

HEADLINE: 5 Democratic Hopefuls Mount Attack on Bush

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Nov. 2

 BODY:
Five of the major Democratic candidates for President mounted a fierce assault on President Bush here today, assailing his economic stewardship and asserting that the human cost of the recession was a direct result of Republican neglect.
One after another, the Democrats took the stage and spoke of the suffering of the jobless, the economically insecure, the parents who are working now but fear for their children's future. "These are the forgotten middle class," said Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. "George Bush took their votes and walked away from them." 
 The New Hampshire Democratic midterm convention gave more than 2,500 of the party faithful a chance to look at a Presidential field that is still little known, even now, less than four months before the New Hampshire Primary. Today's event was the first candidates' cattle show in a state whose Feb. 18 primary, the first in the nation, is always important but is especially crucial in the closely packed race of 1992.
For the candidates, it was an opportunity to seize on the issue now considered to be President Bush's greatest political anxiety. This message was easy to tailor to New Hampshire, where the economy dominates the front pages and the political debate.
 
Message Plays Well
 Paul E. Tsongas, a former senator from Massachusetts, drew waves of cheers today when he declared: "George Bush, come to New Hampshire. There are 43,000 people in New Hampshire who are out of work because of your Presidency."
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa set the tone when he assailed Mr. Bush as the "Herbert Hoover of the 1990's," whose economic recovery program "can be summed up in three words: cut capital gains."
And Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska asserted that Mr. Bush had built his political coalition on fear and division. "They see us as people to be used," Mr. Kerrey said, "and they use us time and again."
While Republicans worry about requiring children to say the Pledge of Allegiance each day, Mr. Kerrey asserted, the nation should be making a pledge of its own to its children, one of housing and health care and a healthy economy.
 
'Frequent-Flier Presidency'
 Mr. Harkin, whose political oratory is rarely cool, was particularly hot today, resurrecting an old attack on Mr. Bush as a man "who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple." Again and again, he drew a biting portrait of a President traveling the world, conducting a "frequent-flier Presidency" consumed with diplomacy and out of touch with the suffering at home.
Mr. Harkin said that rather than visiting the Presidential vacation home in Kennebunkport, Me., to inspect storm damage, it was time for Mr. Bush to travel the nation "and see the damage your policies are causing America."
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia accused Mr. Bush of dividing the nation with issues like racial quotas and asserted that this kind of politics "has produced a climate conducive to Republicans like David Duke." Mr. Duke, the Louisiana State Representative and former Klansman who has been repeatedly disavowed by the White House, is in a tight race for governor in Louisiana.
Mr. Kerrey also tied Mr. Bush directly to Mr. Duke, asserting that "for 24 years the Republican Party has watered the tree of racism" and Mr. Duke was the result. Mr. Kerrey, whose campaign seems aimed at the voters of the baby boom, devoted much of his speech today to an angry attack on Mr. Bush's use of social issues, like abortion rights.
 
Brown Doesn't Attend
 Most of the campaigns tried to put on a show of support at today's convention, with Mr. Tsongas, who has a neighboring-state advantage and began his campaign back in April, greeted with a particularly vocal demonstration on the floor. But veteran organizers said here that most of the campaigns were in their earliest stages.
Former Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California was the only one of the six major candidates for the Democratic nomination who did not appear today, citing previous commitments.
Three candidates mixed it up Friday night in a televised debate that featured some edgy exchanges between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Wilder, while Mr. Tsongas sought to position himself as a truth-teller holding his Democratic colleagues to account.
Both Friday night and today, Mr. Tsongas said it was time for the Democratic Party to "liberate" itself from political action committee money and argued that the 1992 Presidential election was the place to start. He called on Mr. Harkin to renounce PAC money and return the contributions he had accepted. "Tom, give the money back," Mr. Tsongas said, in a debate sponsored by the New Hampshire Democratic Party and televised by WMUR in Manchester. "Give the money back."
 
Others Join In
 Mr. Clinton and Mr. Wilder cheerfully agreed with the demand, saying they were not accepting such contributions themselves. The exchange was one more reflection of how politicians are trying to respond to the public anger toward politics as usual.
But Mr. Harkin brushed aside the demand today. "That's a Republican argument and I'm not going to swim in those waters," he said. Lorraine Voles, his press secretary, said that less than 10 percent of Mr. Harkin's presidential campaign money has come from political action committees.
"Bush raised $2 million in Houston this week," Ms. Voles said. "And we're going to be competitive. We're not going to play touch when they're playing tackle."
The economy also dominated Friday night's debate. "Look at New Hampshire," Mr. Clinton said. "First in bankruptcies, first in welfare growth, 800 people a week exhausting their unemployment benefits. And we have a President who last month met with the leaders of 21 nations, including Micronesia and Lichtenstein, and wouldn't even meet with Republicans to discuss the economy."
 
Criticism of Tax Movement
 But Mr. Tsongas, who seemed delighted to finally have televised debates as a forum for his underdog campaign, was critical of the widespread Democratic movement for middle class tax relief as a means of jump-starting the economy.
Referring to the continued problem of the deficit, Mr. Tsongas asked: "How can we talk about middle-class tax cuts that are going to be paid for by their children? People are not foolish."
One of the sharpest exchanges came between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Wilder. Mr. Wilder said he would "not engage in negative campaigning, period," but only intervene to "set the record straight."
Mr. Clinton asked why, then, Mr. Wilder was recently quoted as saying that Mr. Clinton put a new emphasis to welfare reform after seeing Mr. Duke's success in Louisiana.
Mr. Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, is in the runoff election in Louisiana for governor and has campaigned hard against affirmative action and the welfare system.
Mr. Wilder flatly and repeatedly denied making those statements. An Associated Press reporter said the statements were made in a telephone interview with Mr. Wilder and said she stood by the story. Later, Mr. Wilder's press secretary said the Governor recalled the conversation with the reporter but did not recall making such comments.

HEADLINE: Fathoming the Gaps

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
New York City and New York State both announced last week that big gaps had opened in the budgets they had balanced just a few months ago. But while the gaps may be equally difficult to fill, they have very different causes.
State officials put much of the blame on a poor economy. But a close look at the numbers indicates that the recession's role in the budget gap lies not so much in how poorly the economy has performed but in how much better budget-makers had expected it to be. 
 The city, meanwhile, appears to have been more conservative in its expectations. But its budget fell victim to unanticipated needs as well as decisions to restore money that had been cut.
The city's budget director, Philip R. Michael, has also attributed the $200 million to $250 million shortfall, in part, to reduced revenues. But tax revenues for the city are actually more or less on target; the city expects to come up short this year by about only $50 million out of a total tax revenue base of $17 billion.
The state budget director, Patrick J. Bulgaro, attributed much of the $689 million gap in his budget to growing demands for welfare, Medicaid and other forms of public assistance -- a natural product of a recession. But the city has found that its cost of providing the same services is actually slightly below what the budget had projected.
"On the state front, it's pretty clear that everybody had too rose-colored a view of the economy," says Raymond Horton, head of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group. "The city guessed it better than the state."
That is not to say that the city is not having problems. But its budget gap has been caused primarily by the decisions to restore services -- some because it wanted to and others because it was forced to do so by the courts. The city has to pay $32 million, for instance, to settle a lawsuit over its education spending. When certain state financing was not forthcoming, the city invested $19 million more of its own money in two City University colleges. It also restored its recycling program, certain Parks Department positions and, when sued, some health programs.
There have also been some unwelcome surprises, like a large, $22 million increase in overtime expenditures, largely because of a series of emergencies, including the racial unrest in Crown Heights in Brooklyn, the subway crash on the East Side of Manhattan and the fire at the Staten Island Ferry terminal. Those expenditures may not be offset by later cuts in overtime.
But the city's tax collections from individuals and companies -- often seen as a measure of how the economy is performing in relation to expectations -- are holding up well. Personal income-tax revenues through mid-October were on target and up 12 percent compared with the same period last year. That increase came about largely because the city had raised its tax rates for this fiscal year. But even if that effect is excluded, personal income-tax receipts would be about the same as last year, the city's Department of Finance said.
At the state level, personal income-tax receipts through September fell $128 million short of expectations out of a tax base of $15 billion. That gap is expected to widen to $311 million for the year.
On another front, business income taxes for the city through September have "met or exceeded expectations," a state report says. The report, by Elinor Bachrach, the State Deputy Comptroller for the City of New York, said the only disappointing tax was the city's sales tax. It was off target by about $4 million in the first quarter of this fiscal year, which began July 1.
Mr. Michael, the city's budget director, has decided to assume that sale-tax revenues will fall about $50 million short of the previous estimate. The reason is that the budget office had been anticipating that retail sales would be showing some improvement by now. Instead they have declined.
The $50 million gap is "very modest in terms of the overall budget," Mr. Michael said. Ms. Bachrach agrees. "The city's revenues are holding up pretty well because their estimates were conservative," she said.
The state's budget gap, on the other hand, reflects the overly optimistic assumptions that were made about how fast the economy would improve. The lingering recession has resulted in lower tax revenues and forced the state to spend more than expected on social services. Not only is the estimate for personal income tax proving to be too high, but a number of business taxes are coming in below expectations.
Mr. Bulgaro, the budget chief, defended the forecast on which the state based its budget. The consensus among economists was that a national recovery had begun in the second quarter, and the state had assumed that while employment in New York would continue to shrink, by 2.1 percent, wages would grow by 1.1 percent. "I think our projections were very prudent and sound, based on the data we had available at the time," Mr. Bulgaro said.
But now, with employment prospects much dimmer than had been expected, Mr. Bulgaro said his office would use a more pessimistic forecast for the rest of the year -- that employment will decline by 3.1 percent and that wages will grow by only 0.5 percent.
 
More School, Higher Costs
 The ripple effects of the mistaken estimates can be found on both the revenue and spending sides of the budget. Because jobs are so hard to find, many people have decided to go back to school, raising attendance at the state and city's community colleges and university systems above expectations. Since so few students are able to find work, the state is having to pay more tuition assistance.
The number of individuals seeking home relief assistance has also risen sharply. Home relief is given to people whose six-month unemployment insurance has expired but whose income is too high to make them eligible for welfare or Medicaid. Last year, the number of people applying for home relief in New York State rose by 49.4 percent over the previous year.
 
Behind Medicaid Costs
 Although the state repeatedly cites an increase in Medicaid costs in describing its budget problems, and links that to the unexpected severity of the recession, much of that increase, in fact, is attributable to other factors. Mr. Bulgaro said that about 25 percent of increased state expenses can be explained by changes in the billing practices of its health-care providers, who want their money sooner.
Further, $40 million to $50 million of an anticipated $335 million shortfall for the year is due to higher rates that the state has been forced to pay as a result of lawsuits against it. The state is still expecting to offset its higher expenses with about $103 million in cost-saving measures.
In the end, the effect of the weak economy on the Medicaid expenses can be detected only by the state's caseload estimate. Instead of a 7 percent increase, the state now expects it to be 8 percent.
What remains to be seen is how the city and state try to plug their gaps. City officials are already girding against any solution that might come at their expense. "If the state did underestimate its expenses, it's hardly fair to lay that problem on any of its municipalities," Mr. Michael argued on his way to Albany on Friday. "We can't be expected to pick that up."

HEADLINE: Voters in Maine to Decide Fate of Highway Policy

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGOR, Me., Nov. 2

 BODY:
When the Federal Government brought its progressive highway program to this rural state 44 years ago, the superhighway that would eventually link Maine and Florida was considered a path to prosperity, enabling cities and towns to flourish along its route.
Now, what was once heralded as progress is causing residents to question whether the priorities of yesterday are valid for tomorrow. 
 Voters are to decide Tuesday whether to abandon the traditional Federal policy of encouraging highway construction, and instead to force the state to look toward mass transit and other means to reduce traffic congestion.
The debate, focusing on a proposal to widen from four lanes to six a 30-mile stretch of the Maine Turnpike, has pitted environmentalists against construction and trucking interests.
 
Ballot Box Opposition
 Opposition to the turnpike expansion has led to a ballot measure that would block the project and put in place a new state policy giving preference to alternatives to highway construction.
Prominent opponents of the measure include Gov. John R. McKernan, a Republican, and the state's largest employer, the Bath Iron Works. Among those in favor of it is the suspense novelist Stephen King.
"Horror is my bread and butter," Mr. King says in a radio commercial broadcast across the state, "but I can't imagine a worse horror than to waste $100 million of Maine's hard-earned public money just to widen a stretch of road in southern Maine. Stop the concrete monster from gobbling up more of Maine's countryside."
Governor McKernan, caught up in a fiscal crisis that has accompanied the New England recession, balks at the opposition's charges that he is "kowtowing to construction interests," and says the project is necessary to give the state's economy a needed lift.
"I wouldn't suggest spending $100 million for a project we didn't need," he said.
 
Some Big Contributors
 The Bath Iron Works, a ship-building company in southern Maine that employs 10,400 people, has given $25,000 to a lobbying group urging defeat of the ballot measure. Construction interests from Maine and other states have also been big contributors, with the Associated General Contractors of America topping the list at $25,000.
Referendum opponents outspent backers by 7 to 1, according to campaign finance reports filed Sept. 30, the most recent reports available. Much of that money has paid for consultants' fees and television advertisements.
In the final days before the election, each campaign has been accusing the other of distortions. Opponents say a new transportation policy would create a bureacratic morass. Proponents accuse state officials of wanting to "gold-plate" the turnpike, which extends 106 miles northeast from York, near the New Hampshire border, to Augusta, the state capital.
Defeat of the measure would allow the widening of a 30-mile segment of the turnpike, extending from York to just south of Portland, and approve the financing of the project with a bond, to be repaid from toll money. Rejection would also maintain the power of the Maine Turnpike Authority to make decisions without review, said Barbara Trafton, a spokeswoman for the campaign opposing the measure.
Approval of the proposal would not only stop the widening of the turnpike, a plan that was approved by the Legislature in 1987, but would also establish a new transportation policy under which state officials would have to consider "reasonable alternatives to highway construction" before pouring more concrete, said Beth Nagusky, a staff lawyer for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, who is an author of the ballot measure.
She said the proposed policy was similiar to parts of a bill now in a Congressional conference committee that would grant states more flexibility to spend Federal money previously earmarked for highways.
In a telephone interview Mr. King, the novelist, said, "In the referendum people are questioning the unbridled buildup of highways, which has gone unchallenged until now."
Then, referring to an earlier time when the results of state elections here were taken as a gauge of national trends, he added, "These guys are afraid that as Maine goes, so goes the nation."

HEADLINE: Haiti's Divisions Deepen Over Aristide's Removal

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Nov. 2

 BODY:
For a brief moment after the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide won the first democratic elections in this country's 186 years of independence in December, Haiti appeared more unified than at any time in a history filled with violent strife.
But in the nearly eight months that he governed as President, and in the four weeks since Father Aristide was exiled in a bloody military coup, Haiti's ancient class divisions have so deepened that many familiar with the political scene here say that the stringent international trade embargo imposed on the country this week could do little to return Father Aristide to office. 
 Presented with the stark choice of accepting an elected President's return or hunkering down as an international pariah for endorsing his overthrow, many in the small but powerful Haitian elite, from white-collar professionals to members of landed, old-money families, seem prepared to choose an isolation they believe will be temporary over a leader whose provocative class oratory they came to deeply fear.
To counter their determination, meanwhile, some of the deposed President's supporters, growing impatient over diplomatic attempts to restore constitutional order, have recently made increasingly strident calls for armed "popular resistance," or international military intervention. Those calls come even as Father Aristide rules out a violent solution.
Hardening each side's position is the fact that behind Father Aristide's active supporters stand a people who voted heavily for him and continue to profess their allegiance. Backing the elite is an army whose fear of elimination helped set off the coup in the first place, and whose fear of punishment for the deaths of hundreds makes it much harder to back down now.
"If anything the army has become more solidified over the sentiment that Aristide would never abide by any agreement," said one of several diplomats here who supported the mediation process, but questioned whether diplomacy alone could return the President to power.
Despite those odds, next week the Organization of American States, the regional group that has taken the international lead in seeking a solution to the Haitian crisis, will step onto this polarized field to attempt to obtain Father Aristide's reinstatement.
In addition to having concerns for Haitian democracy, diplomats say, many of the organization's member countries are showing unusual determination to resolve Haiti's crisis because of their own fears of succesful military coups at home.
Some civilian politicians and business executives are already vowing to negotiate in good faith toward Father Aristide's return in light of the harsh economic sanctions, which now bar Haitian exports or imports with most of the hemisphere. But some diplomats say that with the the United States and other countries forswearing military intervention, Father Aristide's return could simply remain a distant goal.
"The fact of saying you are willing to go all the way has a lot more effect," said France's Ambassador to Haiti, Jean Raphael Dufour, who argued that eliminating the threat of international force as an option could seriously weaken attempts to restore Father Aristide.
Mr. Dufour, whose country has provided strong diplomatic support for Father Aristide during a current tour of European capitals, echoed statements of the exiled President, saying that any solution must provide for elements of the Haitian Army to be strongly "punished" for their role in the coup and the 7,000-man force reorganized or eliminated to prevent future disruptions.
But diplomats from several O.A.S.-member countries, mindful of the lack of international will for an armed intervention here, said they thought the emphasis should be put instead on building democracy.
The O.A.S. will attempt to accomplish this democracy-building by sending a series of reassuring signals, diplomats say, backed by a long-term commitment to remain in the country as observers and mediatorsin order to help boost confidence on all sides.

HEADLINE: Looking for New Fashion Markets, Designers From America Go Global

BYLINE: By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO

 BODY:
The latest buzzword in fashion isn't mini or maxi or stretch. It's globalization.
In seeking areas for expansion, American designers, manufacturers and retailers have gone about as far as they can go in this country and have turned their eyes to the rest of the world. And the world is taking notice: the spring shows opening on Seventh Avenue on Monday will be attended not only by store buyers from all over the United States but also by buyers from Canada, Europe and Asia. 
 The American industry sees unlimited room for expansion in the barely tapped $50 billion market for women's ready-to-wear in Europe, where American clothes currently represent less than 1 percent of sales.
Although some American companies have been selling their clothes in London, Paris and points east for more than a decade, it is only in the last two years that there has been a serious assault on the international market.
 
One Company's Focus
 "Since 1989, globalization has really become the focus of our company," said Stephen L. Ruzow, the president and chief operating officer of Donna Karan New York. "With the way the world economy was and the U.S. retail scene, it became critical."
He could have been speaking for the entire fashion community. You can now see labels like Calvin Klein, Oscar de la Renta, Donna Karan, Adrienne Vittadini and St. John Knits in European stores. And you can shop at the Gap, the Limited and Esprit in England and at Barneys and Charivari in Japan. American companies are following the lead of counterparts in Europe and Japan that have long looked beyond the borders of their own countries.
Oscar de la Renta made fashion history when he took his fall collection to the Paris runways last March, going head to head with the big names of Europe on their own turf. It was an $800,000 gamble that paid off with orders from 15 European stores, enough to take the designer back to Paris for the spring shows last month. Spring orders are triple what they were for fall, said Gerald Shaw, the president of Oscar de la Renta.
 
Addition, Not Subtraction
 "European stores write bigger orders than American stores," he said, "and we picked up 15 more stores. This will not supplant our U.S. business but will add to it. I think we will continue to develop more and more stores throughout Europe. And it would be wonderful to have Oscar de la Renta boutiques."
Calvin Klein had a short-lived boutique in London that was opened in 1979 by Joan and Sidney Burstein, the owners of the fashionable Browns shops. It failed because the clothes were too expensive, Mrs. Burstein said. Two years later, the Bursteins opened a Ralph Lauren boutique, which Lauren later bought from them, starting a Polo/Ralph Lauren international empire that now numbers more than 140 stores throughout Europe, Asia and South America.
Polo/Ralph Lauren is a privately held company, and its executives would not agree to interviews about their business. Industry experts estimate its total yearly sales at $1.35 billion, but it is not known how much of that is from foreign sales and how much from products other than clothes.
A well-known name makes entry into the world market easier but isn't always essential if a company can offer the right product at the right price. Both New York State and the Federal Government have initiated programs to encourage small manufacturers to enter the global market. The Commerce Department plans to sponsor United States participation at a number of European and Asian trade shows next year.
 
An American Pavilion in Paris
 With the encouragement of the American Embassy, an assault will be made on Paris next February at the Pret-a-Porter Feminin, where there will be an American Designer Pavilion featuring two dozen ready-to-wear and accessories designers who are not big enough to break into the foreign market on their own. The entry fee for each participant is $13,000, and the designers will still have to pay for transportation, hotels and the shipping of samples.
A decade ago, a strong dollar made American clothing prohibitively expensive abroad. Today's weaker dollar has helped to keep prices competitive, although American clothing often costs 30 to 50 percent more overseas than in the United States. Because of trade restrictions in Japan, most American companies have licensing agreements that allow the Japanese to manufacture and distribute the clothes in the Far East. Many designers, including Mr. de la Renta and Calvin Klein, have had licensing agreements with Japan since the 1970's.
 
First, Perfume
 "I'm an American, and I always felt that I didn't really need Europe," Mr. Klein said in a recent interview in his office. "There was so much money to be made in this country. But today, Europe wants American clothes, and America needs Europe. There are fewer stores here, especially for designer clothes."
In London, Harvey Nichols has had an in-store boutique for Calvin Klein since 1989. Stores in several German cities are now selling his clothes, and there are plans to open licensed Calvin Klein boutiques next year in Munich, Madrid and Barcelona. His strategy has been to enter a European market with perfume, which creates a demand for his high-priced clothing collection, and to follow these with his lower-priced jeans and sport collections for men and women.
"The goal is to have shops in all the major cities to showcase what I do," the designer said, "and then to more widely distribute the less expensive lines."
European retailers make regular trips to New York to order from designer collections, but less expensive lines with wider distribution possibilities need to be taken to the buyers, Mr. Klein said. Unlike the United States with its department store chains, Europe is by and large a world of individually owned shops.
"If you're selling expensive clothing, there are only so many stores and so many cities," Mr. Klein said. "But a product that can be widely distributed requires a whole other setup. You need someone to go into the hills of Austria, not just to Vienna."
 
Complicated Logistics
 Mr. Ruzow of Donna Karan said that he had been setting up a computer network to handle orders and distribution and that he expects to have a distribution center in Europe by the end of next year, when the European Community's remaining internal obstacles to free trade are expected to be removed. His company does its manufacturing in the United States and in the Far East, which complicates the logistics of selling in Europe.
"You have to deal with export quotas from Hong Kong and import quotas for each European country," he said. "It's a real pain to get import quotas for France. We're waiting to see what happens once the Common Market is operating. If there's just one quota, that's fine. If each country continues to have a separate quota, we'll open a distribution center in the country with the highest quota from the Far East."
This year, exports will account for 33 percent of the Donna Karan collection's $52 million in sales, and 12 percent of the $148 million in sales of her less expensive line, DKNY. More than half of those sales will be in the Far East, about a third in nine European countries and the rest in Canada.
 
'Europe Is Wide Open'
 Adrienne Vittadini, which has been selling ready-to-wear and accessories in Japan for nine years and in Europe for about five years, expects to do half its business on the international front within five years, said Richard Catalano, the company's president. "How much will be through stores and how much through our own boutiques we won't have to decide for about a year," he said. "Europe is wide open. The hard part is going up against the best. There's no shortage of talent in Italy."
To ease its expansion into Europe, St. John Knits, a New York manufacturer, sold 80 percent of its business to Escada, the giant German manufacturer. A Japanese connection had been made three years ago with a company called Best International, which imports and distributes the line, produced in southern California.
"If you can get started in the global market, you have a lot of room to expand," said Robert Gray, St. John's chairman. "But we wouldn't have attempted to go into Europe without Escada. Instead of a few large retailers, you have hundreds of stores in Europe. How can you reach them all? Escada has the contacts and can do the distribution."
 
From 16 Stores to 80
 Thanks to Escada, St. John has a sales representative in Munich and a showroom in Paris so the stores don't need to come to New York to see the line. St. John's first entry into Europe was last spring, with 16 stores. By this fall, that number had grown to 80.
Liz Claiborne Inc. made its first inroads into the international market last January in Selfridge's and Harrods in London. "The timing was the worst," said Jerome A. Chazen, the company's chairman. "We got there just before Desert Storm, and there was no one in London. But we're performing well now and are in about 25 more stores in the U.K. We just went into Spain to prepare for the Olympics, and next fall we're expanding into Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands."
"It's very important to set up the appropriate infrastructure," he added. "At first, we rented a warehouse in the wrong place in the U.K. We got out of that and discovered we could set up in the Netherlands and ship faster than from Manchester."
 
$2 Million a Year
 Mackintosh of New England, a manufacturer of moderate-priced women's coats, decided to take on the British market three years ago and now sells to 100 stores in Britain, to the tune of $2 million a year. The next goal is the European continent.
"I went over to England with six samples," said Bernie Moller, the president of Mackintosh, "and was referred to Jim Knight, a retired retail executive, who said, 'We don't make coats like this anymore' and took us on."
Mr. Knight set up a distribution center for the coats, which retail for about $200 in Britain, or 20 percent higher than in the United States.
Last May, Mackintosh was bought by Biscayne Holdings, which owns several ready-to-wear companies and plans to draw upon the Mackintosh experience to enter the European market.
 
Helping Small Companies
 Six years ago, the United States Department of Education awarded a grant to the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York to inform American students about global opportunities. This led to the formation at the school of the Export Advisory Service Extension, or EASE, which counsels small companies.
"For two years we've brought in people from Europe and Japan to speak in workshops about what a particular country wants and needs," said Elaine Stone, the director of EASE. "Hue, the hosiery company, came to us to find out about export. They had targeted England, and we put them in touch with an English distributor. Irwin Pearl came to us and now has distributors in England and Singapore."
"A market in a foreign country takes time to develop," she added. "It doesn't mean an enormous initial investment, but you have to be in it for the long term."

HEADLINE: Mississippi Race Heats Up as Governor's Margin in Polls Narrows

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GRENADA, Miss., Nov. 1

 BODY:
Gov. Ray Mabus, the Democrat who is seeking a second term in Tuesday's voting, came to this small central Mississippi town today to participate in what seemed a routine announcement of an expansion by a hosiery manufacturer.
But it was anything but routine as the 43-year-old Harvard-educated politician sought to associate himself with any kind of concrete economic development efforts in the state and tout his trips to the company's headquarters to encourage the expansion. 
 It was one of the many indications that the race between Mr. Mabus and his Republican opponent, Kirk Fordice, a Vicksburg businessman, is being perceived by the Mabus campaign as closer than recent polls would suggest.
Although few observers here suggest that the Governor is headed for defeat, they point out that in a state that has two Republican United States Senators and that has delivered up to 60 percent of its vote to the Republican Presidential candidate, complacency can be politically fatal. In recent days the attacks by the candidates on each other have sharpened.
 
Gains for Republican
 According to independent poll results released today, Governor Mabus has 53 percent, as against Mr. Fordice's 37 percent. The figures are evidence of small, steady gains by Mr. Fordice since he was the upset winner in last month's Republican primary. Mabus supporters said privately that their own polls suggested that the race was a bit closer than the public poll indicated.
Among the more telling figures in the poll, done by Mason-Dixon Opinion Research, were those showing the Governor with 90 percent of the black vote, as against 4 percent for Mr. Fordice, but trailing the challenger 37 percent to 52 percent among white voters. Blacks are about 33 percent of the state's population. The poll involved 849 likely voters and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The poll showed the third candidate, Shawn O'Hara, an independent, with about 2 percent of the vote over all.
Mr. Fordice, who has never held elected office above the county commissioner level, criticizes the Mabus administration's "deficit spending" and what he calls an inordinate emphasis on education. He proposes more a fiscally conservative administration and changes in the state's education system built around the recomendations of President Bush's Education 2000 program, which calls for local voluntary efforts rather that increased Federal and state spending.
 
Liberalism Attacked
 Mr. Fordice said in an interview that he would stress the Governor's "Harvard, eastern liberal, elitist" background. "The problem is that he is a Harvard-educated personality who is not prepared to listen to anybody," Mr. Fordice said. "He just doesn't do windows."
But Mr. Mabus's appearance on Friday at the announcement of the expansion of the Pennaco Hosiery Company, based in New York, was an attempt to show just the opposite.
Mr. Mabus has been criticized for his globetrotting efforts to attract foreign investment at the expense of existing business.
Mr. Mabus noted in an interview that everywhere he goes to try to attract business, the first thing that prospects want to know is what he and others are doing to improve education in Mississippi, a state that generally ranks among the lowest for scores on college entrance exams. But aides concede that education as an economic development tool, while valid, is a bit too abstract and long term in an election year, and at a time when the nation is in a recession.
 
More Jobs Now
 Mississippi has 75,000 more jobs this year than it did four years ago when Mr. Mabus won his first term, and the state's unemployment rate today is a little over 8 percent as against the 12 percent level it hit in the mid-1980's. But still the sense of economic gloom nationally is prevalent here as well.
Ally Mack, a professor of political science at Jackson State University, said that black voters who find Mr. Mabus distant and a bit arrogant were nevertheless likely to support him.
"Black folks equate Fordice with David Duke," she said, noting that Mr. Fordice has mentioned some of the same issues, like welfare abuse and affirmative action, as the former Ku Klux Klan leader who is running for Governor in Louisiana.
John Quincy Adams, a political scientist at Millsaps College in Jackson, said that Mr. Mabus may have some trouble because of the sentiment in the country against incumbents. But that may be counterbalanced here by Mr. Mabus's image as a man of principle who would rather lose a fight than cut deals with the Legislature.

The Bomb, in Latin America

 BODY:
It took courage for the Presidents of Brazil and Argentina to agree to ban the bomb. But it takes persistence to follow through with detailed arrangements for international nuclear inspection. Regrettably, these efforts seem to be flagging. Last fall, Brazil's Fernando Collor and Argentina's Carlos Menem defied their military bureaucracies, renounced their nuclear arms programs and promised to open facilities to international inspection within a year.
Officials from the two countries have exchanged visits to some nuclear facilities. But they have yet to sign agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency opening the doors of all their facilities to inspectors. Such safeguards are the best guarantee that future governments won't reverse course and resume a nuclear weapons program. 
 The two leaders are preoccupied with economic and other domestic concerns. Yet without renewed pressure from the top, negotiations with the I.A.E.A. will continue to drag -- further encouraging bureaucratic opponents of inspections to resist an accord. Mr. Collor and Mr. Menem won high praise for standing up against nuclear proliferation; they'll get more praise if they finish the deal. Should they need further inspiration, the U.S. Government can gently remind them of its own interest in a successful resolution -- and the economic benefits, including high-tech exports, that might follow.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Yet Another Summit

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
When Washington spends billions on something that seems to make little sense, the explanation is almost always the same -- politics, bureaucratic politics, pig-headed shortsightedness and more politics.
Such is the case with the vast, growing and largely ineffectual $2.7 billion program to reduce the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. 
 Most distressing, this effort is yet another example of President Bush's willful determination to seek solutions to difficult domestic problems by international showmanship. Instead of concentrating ever tighter resources on treatment/prevention and street police, programs that virtually all drug experts say promise real results, Mr. Bush continues to devote too much time and money to combating the drug trade outside U.S. borders. And for their own reasons, Congress and the Pentagon happily go along.
Mathea Falco, an international drug expert, argues the point more strongly in her forthcoming book, "Just Say Yes: Drug Programs That Work." She writes: "Everyone who has looked at this problem agrees that the progress we've made has come from education, treatment and changes in social attitudes, and not because we've succeeded in cutting supplies."
The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, is equally blunt. In a recent report the G.A.O. says that U.S. intelligence agencies "agree that the estimated volume of drugs entering the country during 1989 and 1990 did not decline."
Experts in and out of government are loath to enter into the drug numbers game. But few would contest this conclusion about Federal efforts to stem the drug inflow: Despite spending about $13 billion over the last 10 years, there has been no significant decrease in cocaine supply, no sustained price increase and no consequential decline in cocaine purity. In New York City today, you can still buy a vial of crack cocaine for less than half the price of a ticket to the movies.
Peter Reuter of the Rand Corporation has demonstrated over and again that almost no matter what the U.S. spends, the economics of the drug trade will prevail. Coca leaf production and refinement amount to less than 5 percent of the street cost. Smuggling accounts for less than 10 percent of street prices. Given the enormous profits, it is very difficult to imagine killing the incentive to grow, refine and smuggle cocaine. Even an inconceivable doubling of supply costs would have little effect on street prices or profits.
Also, the chances of smugglers getting caught are tiny. The G.A.O. report says that in 1990 the U.S. military detected 6,729 suspicious flights, that law enforcement agencies tried to interdict 661 of these aircraft and caught only 49. It's even more difficult to monitor the traffic coming by container ships and by land from Mexico.
Pentagon interdiction efforts alone will cost taxpayers $1.2 billion this year. And officials there have no incentive to look hard at effectiveness; drug programs are simply paying the Air Force and Navy for the flying and steaming they would be doing anyway out of their own budgets.
Stephen Duncan, the Pentagon drug czar, is honest and modest in his claims about interdiction. He feels it is a deterrent, believes it will improve and is convinced that the drug traders cannot be given a free ride into the U.S. His points are well taken and focus the issue: It's not whether to try to hold down supply, but how much to spend on this inherently Herculean task.
Congress, though well aware of the limitations of stemming the drug inflow, does nothing to reorder priorities. Legislators talk about spending more on demand reduction and less on cutting supply, but don't follow through. They want to prove they're being tough on drugs, and hunting down the bad guys on the high seas sounds sexier than the dreary business of helping addicts kick their habits.
Mr. Bush reflects that attitude in spades. Last week he invited his counterparts in six Latin American nations to another "anti-drug summit" early next year. Its goal, like the 1990 meeting he engineered, is to pump new life into efforts to disrupt the international cocaine trade. Such extravaganzas show George Bush bestriding the world, but they cannot substitute for the domestic anti-drug summits he has never held.

HEADLINE: Here's an Economic Policy

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich, who teaches political economy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, is author, most recently, of "The Work of Nations."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
President Bush knows he's in trouble on the economy, and still doesn't know what to do about it. The small uptick during the summer seems to have reversed direction. Unemployment compensation claims rose in early October while durable orders fell. Almost two-thirds of the respondents to a recent New York Times/ CBS News poll called the economy "very bad" or "fairly bad" -- eight percentage points more than in June, when the recession was thought to have hit bottom.
Unemployment, now at 6.8 percent, is edging upward and does not include millions of Americans too discouraged even to look for work or in temporary jobs when they'd rather be working full time. With the election a year away and voter confidence in his ability to handle the economy slipping badly, Mr. Bush can't afford a "double dip" into recession again. He has to do something dramatic before a Democratic challenger can ask whether Americans are better off now than they were four years ago. 
 The following advice to the White House, offered free of charge, is not entirely unsolicited. A week ago a young member of the White House economic staff came to my office in Cambridge, asking what to do about the recession -- an act that confirms the Administration's desperation.
For starters, get the problem straight. The so-called credit crunch isn't the culprit. Easy credit won't help without sufficient demand. So stop pushing the banks to make easier loans. The Comptroller of the Currency is desperately trying to reform the Wild West banking norms of the 1980's, which contributed to the savings and loan fiasco; it's dangerous and irresponsible for the White House to send the opposite message. Nor will it do any good to browbeat Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve into pushing interest rates lower than they are now. Any lower, and savings will start flowing out of the U.S., the dollar will drop, and we'll be saddled with inflation.
Don't count on a capital gains tax cut either. There's no evidence that it would stimulate new investment. Moreover, in the global economy, "trickle down" has been replaced by "trickle out," as American savings race to wherever around the globe they can get the highest returns. Talk about a capital gains tax cut only incites the Democrats to grandstand over the "fairness thing" and proffer their own irresponsible tax cuts.
If the White House is intent on a capital-gains tax cut, at least propose one that creates the right incentives: a three-tiered rate in which patient capitalists who hold their assets for more than six years pay no tax, speculators who hold assets for less than six months' pay through the teeth and all others are kept at the present rate.
Focus instead on raising consumer confidence. Consumers account for most of the demand-pull in the economy, but they're holding back from big purchases. Nothing dampens shoppers' enthusiasm like economic insecurity. Their confidence would get a big boost if the White House recanted on its rejection of extended unemployment insurance (financed, perhaps, by the cancellation of several Stealth bombers) and came up with a credible national health plan.
This also makes good political sense: if the recession drags on, the Democrats almost certainly will make an issue of the President's unemployment insurance veto and will point to his failure to come up with a health plan as evidence of his indifference to domestic policy.
Focus also on what Government can do to prime the pump. Announce an emergency multibillion-dollar program to rebuild and repair the nation's bridges, highways and airports. The immediate advantage is that construction jobs would quickly sop up workers who don't need much training and give them fairly good wages and benefits. No need to worry about the impact on the budget. It's perfectly justifiable to add to the public debt to improve the nation's capacity for further growth. Business executives don't flinch from borrowing money to invest in big boosts of productivity. Yes, this approach would break last year's budget deal, but the deal is on the skids anyway.
Meanwhile, to get the most stimulus out of what the Government already spends, instruct all military contractors to switch to American-based production of the weapons, goods and services they supply. (Since most big American companies make or buy their wares all over the world, corporate nationality is less important than whether the goods are actually made here.) Speed the timetable of American troop withdrawals from Europe. The Pentagon buys an estimated $15 billion a year from European vendors supplying our troops; this money, too, could be better spent stimulating our economy.
And don't forget the symbolic touches. Create a Presidential Medal of Economic Citizenship, to be awarded annually to the 10 companies that invest the most in new plant and equipment and that hire the largest number of new employees in proportion to their earnings. A little hoopla over growth wouldn't hurt at a time like this.
Replace Vice President Dan Quayle's environment-bashing Competitiveness Council with a high-profile National Growth Council, composed of leading Democrats as well as Republicans, and business and labor leaders, to advise Americans about how they can insure a better future for their kids. Not the least, stop all the Presidential and Vice Presidential golfing, tennis and boating excursions, which make the average hard-pressed American feel worse by comparison. Until after the election, switch to bowling, bingo and amusement arcades.

HEADLINE: Unpopular New Taxes Ignite a Rebirth of Populist Politics

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GLASTONBURY, Conn., Oct. 31

 BODY:
Richard Zajicek, a silver-haired local building contractor who never considered running for public office until this year, found his voice at age 59 in denouncing Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and Connecticut's new state income tax. Now he's running for the Town Council in Tuesday's elections on a quixotic third-party campaign to demolish local government and restore the old town-meeting form of participatory democracy that withered and died here in the 1950's.
Across Connecticut and New Jersey, echoes of Mr. Zajicek's message and method -- outrage about taxes, combined with a sort of misty-eyed paean to better or simpler times -- are being repeated in dozens of local and legislative races as politicians and those who hate politicians try equally to tap the mood of a dispirited electorate. 
 Voters in New York will also be going to the polls in local elections on Tuesday and many of those races are also being buffeted as well by uneasiness about the economy, taxes and the quality of government. But candidates and poll-takers say Connecticut and New Jersey will bring those concerns to a singular focus.
In both states, governors whose names are linked to huge and unpopular tax increases have haunted the election process even though neither man is running this year. And in both states, middle- and lower-income residents -- the groups generally least affected by the tax increases pushed into law by Mr. Weicker and Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey -- have formed the backbone of resentment.
 
Reacting to Strong Medicine
 Both are also at the forefront of states that have swallowed strong medicine in an effort to maintain generous public programs once paid for by the Federal Government. Some experts, therefore, see the elections as a sort of referendum on the backyard, hometown consequences of the gradual Federal retrenchment under President Ronald Reagan and President Bush. Mr. Florio, a Democrat, even called on voters earlier this week to send a message to Mr. Bush about his economic and domestic policies by voting the Democratic line.
Politicians who have spent the last few weeks knocking on doors say that things are not that simple, and that the anti-incumbent, anti-tax, anti-governor fervor that lies on the surface and catches the headlines may not really carry the day. Many of those same angry voters, for example, may also be dispirited citizens who will simply stay home on Election Day. And some politicians are playing to a public that seems to want reassurance as much as revenge.
"They're willing to support people who will say, 'I won't hurt you,' " said Henry J. Raimondo, a professor of urban and regional planning at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. "That's what we've been reduced to right now."
And the voters also seem willing to entertain approaches far from the beaten path. Glastonbury, a town of 28,000 people just south of Hartford, has four nonparty candidates this year who got on the ballot by petition, more than any election in at least the last 30 years. Statewide, the number of independent candidates is double the number than in the last municipal elections in 1989, according to the Secretary of the State's office. The number of independent candidates has also risen in New Jersey, where 46 third-party or nonparty candidates are running in 120 legislative races.
 
Tapping the Discontent
 Most of the independents, locked out from major-party financing, are expected to lose because they cannot afford to advertise, and some hold highly unorthodox views. Mr. Zajicek, for example, said in an interview that he thinks "British agents" secretly control of much of the United States Government and banking system.
Even traditional politicians have been forced to reckon with the mood that has given rise to such voices. In order to get on the ballot in Connecticut, nonparty candidates must get signatures from at least one percent of the number of people who voted in the last election. That was the route that Mr. Weicker took last year when he quit the Republican Party and ran under his own Connecticut Party banner.
"People are tired of the old-line approach to political processes," said Peter A. Inverso, a Republican candidate for the New Jersey State Senate in the 14th district, which takes in parts of Mercer and Middlesex Counties.
Mr. Inverso, who has pledged to try and roll back some of the Florio administration's tax increases, is locked in a tight race with the incumbent, Senator Francis J. McManimon, a Democrat from Trenton, and is also fighting off a third-party opponent, Peter P. Garibaldi.
 
Dramatic Proposals
 Mr. Garibaldi, a former Republican State Senator, has promised to try to eliminate all property taxes and pay for local government programs through the state income tax. He has also organized a loose federation of like-minded independent candidates running for state, municipal and county offices in the district.
Here in Connecticut, the drive to repeal the income tax, which was passed in August, has spawned a host of extreme fiscal proposals and has forced local politicians everywhere into making what are in effect negative promises: If elected, they pledge not to do anything that would increase spending.
"We see no growth in budgets, no growth in projects or programs and no growth in capital spending unless absolutely essential," said Sonya Googins, a Republican and the chairwoman of the Glastonbury Town Council, who is running for re-election in the same race with Mr. Zajicek. "There's no appetite for it out there in the public and you've got to be responsive to it."
Mr. Weicker has also put his own spin on the municipal elections, with repeated comments that local officials who support repealing the income tax are in effect asking that their state aid be cut because the $1.2 billion in new revenue generated mostly by the income tax goes disproportionately into town budgets. In New Jersey, by contrast, Republicans have used Mr. Florio's name to invoke curses on the heads of all Democrats for the $2.8 billion in tax increases that took effect last year.
 
Little Support for Governors
 Recent polls give both governors some of the lowest approval ratings anywhere. About 73 percent of the New Jersey residents questioned rated Mr. Florio's performance as "fair" or "poor," according to a poll by the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers, for example. The poll of 800 residents was conducted in mid-September and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
Those figures were almost exactly mirrored in Connecticut, where 74 percent of the 500 residents polled by the University of Connecticut in October said Mr. Weicker was doing a "fair" or "poor" job. That poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent.
National political experts say that those strong public opinions, and the degree to which the two governors have involved themselves or become an issue outright in local election, have made Tuesday's results both more interesting and also less illuminating as indicators of how voters might react in next year's national elections.
"New Jersey is something that Florio messed up, and Connecticut is too Weickeresque," said Kevin Phillips, a conservative political analyst in Washington.
 
Distrust of Incumbents
 New York is not on most lists because the state has not taken the sort of dramatic action that sparks strong feelings among voters, although a new $639 million budget gap could force state lawmakers to grapple with the issue between now and next November.
"The New York story is not an interesting one because it's not doing anything innovative to solve its problems," Professor Raimondo of the Eagleton Institute said.
In Connecticut and New Jersey, however, the innovations and voter reaction seemed to have touched nearly every contest in some way.
"We came through a maelstrom and really we're better off," said Assembly Representative Ann A. Mullen, a Democrat from Erial, N.J., repeating the arguments she makes to her constituents about why she voted for the Florio tax plan. "The sad part is that people don't understand or don't believe," she said.
One Fairfield, Conn., resident, Patrick McInerney, said his mind is certainly made up. His absentee ballot has already been cast because he'll be out of town on election day.
"I voted against every incumbent in the town of Fairfield whether I liked them or not," Mr. McInerney said.

HEADLINE: Seeking a Racial Mix, Dubuque Finds Tension

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUBUQUE, Iowa, Oct. 30

 BODY:
For years now, along the rolling bluffs in this Mississippi River city of Victorian houses and church steeples, nobody ever thought much about race and prejudice. Nobody ever had to.
There were only a handful of black people in town. A resident could go for years without seeing a black. And besides, people thought, racism was something that happened in the big cities or the Deep South, not in a nice, quiet place like Dubuque. 
 But in recent weeks and months, Dubuque residents have been talking and thinking of race often. Because of a cross-burning incident two years ago that surprised many people, the city council last May adopted an extraordinary plan to attract 100 black families in hopes of adding diversity to this virtually all-white city of 58,000 people.
 
A Backlash of Fear
 Since then, a backlash of fear and intolerance has erupted. Five crosses have been burned around town in the last four months. This week, uniformed police officers stood guard at Dubuque Senior High School after racial fights broke out. In recent days, racial epithets have been scrawled on buildings across town, some proclaiming "the New KKK."
And when a man who admitted burning three of the crosses returned from jail to his job at a meatpacking plant, his co-workers are said to have greeted him with backslaps and a standing ovation.
Scenes like these are searing to many white residents, who say they are struggling with their own racial attitudes. "This is the ignorant, oppressive underbelly of Dubuque," said Peter Kjeseth, a professor of Greek and Hebrew at a Lutheran seminary in Dubuque and a member of the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. "Young men who are undereducated and worried about jobs are scared to death."
All of this is happening in a tradition-bound, heartland city of mostly Irish and German Catholics, where racial minorities make up 2 percent of the population and where there are only 331 black residents scattered across the city.
The racial tension has forced residents to confront deeply imbedded prejudices. "People are wondering, 'How can we have a race problem when we don't even have minorities?' ," said Kim Clayton, a counselor at the high school and a member of the committee that drafted the plan.
 
Symbol of Intolerance
 Dubuque, with its newly tapped well of intolerance, symbolizes race relations in this country, specialists on the topic say. As the economy has stalled and as some politicians mine racial fears to win votes, unresolved prejudices have produced a kind of racism whose code words are "quotas" and "unqualified minorities," one that can explode at any time given the impetus, these experts say.
"This is not the South," said Dr. Joe Feagin, a professor of sociology at the University of Florida, who has written extensively about race relations and is white. "If in a heartland city with no history of slavery and segregation, you find such virulent racism, it suggests that it is a cancer affecting us all."
For years, blacks in Dubuque say, they have felt alienated and isolated, enduring namecalling and stares. But what seems to have spurred the latest incidents is a plan to encourage local employers to hire minority workers, particularly blacks. The plan's goal is to recruit 20 minority families a year for five years with financial incentives and recognition awards to businesses that hire minority members. The program is to be financed by Federal grants and private donations.
 
A Minority in the N.A.A.C.P.
 The plan came in the wake of a cross burning two years ago that ignited a black family's garage. A task force set up to examine the situation found what most Dubuque residents already knew: The city is an isolated, homogeneous island where everything from the police force to the fire department to every teacher in every public school is white and where blacks are even a minority in the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P.
The task force of business leaders and school and city officials said that what Dubuque needed was more minority citizens; the hope was that exposure to other groups might make people more tolerant. The City Council approved the plan, 6 to 1, last spring.
Although the city government devised and adopted the plan, its execution is up to private employers, and it is unclear whether they have had any success in luring black workers.
But merely the idea of an influx of new black residents has enraged some residents. Some young whites express fears of black newcomers taking their jobs. Others speak of crime and mayhem coming to Dubuque. People are afraid, as one resident put it, that "we won't be able to open our windows, sit on our porches, stroll in our neighborhoods." One rumor has it that "busloads of gang members from Chicago with guns" will be deposited right on Main Street.
 
David Dukes in Dubuque
 "Dubuque missed the 50's and the 60's," said Mayor Jim Brady. "We didn't go through what Selma and Montgomery went through. We watched and applauded from afar. But we didn't face it ourselves because we didn't have the numbers of black people. Now we're finding we have our David Dukes right here in Dubuque."
It is white, working-class young men frightened by an uncertain economy who have been the most openly hostile, orchestrating fights and cross burnings out of protest against integration.
"We're speaking up for white people," said Michael Lightfoot, 19, a sometime meatpacker, who with a friend admitted to several recent cross burnings. Mr. Lightfoot and his friend pleaded guilty to arson and were given two-year suspended sentences and ordered to perform community service. "Everything in the town was just fine until this. We need to take care of the people here instead of bringing these other people in. It's us against the blacks."
Mr. Lightfoot and his friends are starting a local chapter of the National Association of White People, a group founded by Mr. Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard who is running for governor in Louisiana.
Mr. Lightfoot's view is echoed at the high school, where racial clashes, student walkouts and wild rumors have pitted some of the 1,450 white students against the 12 black students.
Tensions reached a fever pitch last week when a group of 30 white students stood outside the cafeteria, complaining about the black students. Suddenly, a black senior, James Lewis, walked around the corner.
"There goes one now!" a white student shouted, as the other white students stared. Mr. Lewis, his defenses up, asked if they were looking for a fight. A white student, Scott Perry, made an obscene gesture toward Mr. Lewis, who then punched Mr. Perry. Both were briefly suspended.
"I used to have some white friends, but they left," said Mr. Lewis when he and Mr. Perry recounted the details of the fight. "And everybody else is scared of what their friends will say."
 
White Images of Blacks
 The hostilities are surfacing in an atmosphere of ignorance and innuendo, where in the absence of personal knowledge of blacks, white images of them take on a kind of mythology.
In a letter to the local newspaper, The Telegraph Herald, a white resident asked why town leaders thought black people would come to Dubuque when "everyone knows blacks don't like cold weather." Last week, a rumor that black students were bringing guns to the high school prompted officials to search lockers. A jackknife was found.
Some are convinced that, based on what they've seen on television, blacks might do anything. "They're always the mean guy in the movies," said Brian Ainley, a senior at the high school.
Nothing riles people like Steve Dunne, whose goal is to be an auto body mechanic, more than the idea that more black residents might come to town and take jobs he could have had. "It's bad enough to lose your job to a white guy," Mr. Dunne said. "But a black guy? It would mean you lost a job to someone that everybody knows is lower than you."
Supporters of the integration plan say such fears about jobs are unfounded. Dubuque's 6 percent unemployment rate, frequently cited by detractors as the reason the town does not need any more workers, is lower than it was a decade ago. And the positions that supporters of the plan would like blacks to fill are primarily professional jobs that many in Dubuque would not qualify for anyway. One new black resident is a neurologist, for instance, although his recent move here is not related to the city's plan.
But that has not blunted the anger. In recent weeks, anonymous advertisements have run in The Telegraph Herald, urging residents to join a petition drive against the integration plan.
 
'We're Not all Racists'
 Donald Deich, the only city council member who voted against the plan, says he does not think the city should be in the personnel business at taxpayer expense. "We're not all racists," Mr. Deich said. "They can bring in 200 of them as long if we don't have to pay for it. It doesn't bother me any. As long as they behave themselves and don't bring a bunch of ragtag relatives that cause trouble."
Specialists in race relations say that what has happened in Dubuque could happen anywhere.
"This shows we're not very far from old-fashioned racism, and we are able to revert very quickly if social or economic anxieties arise," said Dr. Marilynn Brewer, a psychologist who is director of the Institute for Social Science Research at the University of California, Los Angeles.
What is not at all clear is how city leaders will persuade black people to come to Dubuque. For now, they are hoping that a few pioneers will want to try life in a clean, quiet city that is at least trying to face up to its prejudice.
"Dubuque needs black people more than black people need Dubuque," said Ernestine Moss, a black resident who is president of the local N.A.A.C.P. "Dubuque needs black people to bring it into the 20th century."

HEADLINE: Military Spending Binge Got Us Into This Mess;
Put People to Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There appears to be a consensus that the United States will emerge from recession by consumer spending. Some members of Congress have proposed tax reductions, which they believe will put more disposable income into our pockets. 
 Are they naive, cynical or did they just plain forget Economics 101? A reduction in taxes will do nothing to increase consumption because it will not accrue as cash. This money will not be spendable because it has already been spent to meet daily living expenses in most instances. Therefore it is more likely that any tax reduction will reduce the amount to be borrowed to cover individual tax underpayments. In any case, no tax break will appear before spring because Congress must first pass, and the President must sign, it into law.
The Federal Reserve Bank lowered interest rates to stimulate industrial and entrepreneurial borrowing and subsequent investment, which would generate new jobs. This version of the trickle-down theory puts the cart before the horse. The need for capital is created by a need for increased productive capacity. Companies do not generally borrow when the outlook for an upswing is as gloomy as it is now. The market for new homes has not expanded as expected because of high prices and uncertainty. Staff reductions in virtually every industry, coupled with the reluctance of banks to lend money for operating costs, expose this policy's flaws.
By extending the number of weeks for collecting unemployment insurance, Congress attempted to put money into the hands of those who need it most for survival. This small step toward putting cash in people's hands was stopped by a Presidential veto.
The average person needs to work for money. We know that almost all income is spent on personal consumption. A percentage of each expenditure is an income for another person, who will in turn spend it and so on. In this way, $100 of income may generate a multiple of itself. Obviously, we need to put people to work to generate consumption, which will ultimately revive the economy. When private sector employment shrinks, new jobs need to be developed in the public sector to take up the slack.
Notwithstanding the gradual disintegration of the country's infrastructure, Federal policy appears to be opposed to large public projects or to expanding the public sector even temporarily. The states cannot absorb the costs. The passage of a five-to-six-year $150 billion transportation bill by Congress is the only glimmer of light in an otherwise distressing picture.

Businesses Go Back to School

BYLINE: By John Holusha

 BODY:
OWNERS and managers of small- and medium-size manufacturing businesses are going back to school today as they try to improve the efficiency of their operations by harnessing the power of the computer.
That is what Dominick Martorana did when he decided to add computerized controls to the automatic machine tools that cut and shape parts for electronic devices at his Highland Manufacturing Company, in Highland, N.Y. But Mr. Martorana did not head for an ivy-swathed university. Instead, he went to Hudson Valley Community College in nearby Troy, for instruction in computer-aided manufacturing and the details of the software packages that control the machines. 
 Community colleges, the two-year institutions that have long provided economical access to higher education, are increasingly staking out a role as the agents of technology transfer for manufacturing industries. Instead of simply preparing students for transfer to four-year institutions or providing low-tech vocational training, many community colleges are teaming with industry and government to retrain the existing work force in computer operations and modern manufacturing methods, such as just-in-time inventory management.
 
'Much Stronger Role'
 "Community colleges have been in the process of a major transition during the 1980's," concludes a recent report by several Federal research laboratories. "They have moved toward a much stronger role in vocational education and in supporting U.S. industry."
"Community colleges are probably the most liberated and aggressive force in American education today," said Hirsh Cohen, education specialist at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in New York, which promotes science, technology and management. "They do not have the rigidity of the K-through-12 system and are more aggressive than four-year, research universities."
Mr. Martorana said that Hudson Valley College had provided the help he needed for his 20-worker factory. "I did research on what kind of software to buy," he said. "Then Hudson Valley sent people down here and analyzed my shop to see what I needed." Now computer controls are boosting productivity for him, since machines can be quickly programmed to shift from producing one type of part to another.
These work-force training arrangements are also benefiting the community colleges, which in recent years have become big business. According to the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges, there are about 1,200 such institutions around the nation, with about six million students taking courses for credit and five million more in noncredit training programs.
Federal agencies, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and national research laboratories such as Lawrence Livermore in California are choosing the colleges as the vehicle for bringing high technology to the shop floor. Increasingly, these ventures are three-way alliances, with a Federal laboratory or major university providing technical expertise, private industry supplying money and equipment and community colleges doing the instruction.
Hudson Valley, for example, has formed an Advanced Manufacturing Resource Center in association with the federally financed Northeast Manufacturing Technology Center at nearby Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Although the R.P.I. center directs the program, which is intended to upgrade competitiveness of small- and medium-size businesses, teaching has been delegated to Hudson Valley and 11 other community colleges in the state.
"We are oriented toward transferring technology to small businesses," said Douglas Baldrey, associate dean of the college's school of engineering. Four-year colleges, Mr. Baldrey said, are more academically oriented and interested in basic research rather than factory-floor operations. "We offer a course in selecting computer-aided manufacturing systems," he said. "That is not something a Rensselaer or a Cornell wants to do."
 
Industrial Courses
 The advanced manufacturing program includes industrial short courses for workers seeking to upgrade skills -- courses like Introduction to Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing, Data Acquisition Using Personal Computers and Advanced Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing.
But the manufacturing center also includes an academic track for students, who can take courses in computerized design and manufacturing equipment, automation and robotics. They can graduate with an associate degree in, say, industrial technology or mechanical engineering technology and machine processes, and head for a ready job market.
"The people who run companies around here say they cannot get skilled workers," Mr. Baldrey said. "That is why some of them are asking us to set up apprentice programs." He said there were about 200 students pursuing manufacturing technology degrees at Hudson Valley, with an equal number of industrial workers taking noncredit courses.
At the college, both sets of students receive instruction on how to use the myriad of computer-aided design programs. And they learn how to translate those designs into instructions for automated machinery in industrial settings.
With grants from the Northeast Center, Hudson Valley is also taking its courses to the companies themselves, conducting training sessions at 22 factories and shops this year.
Nationally, about 50 community colleges have built technology centers to enhance local manufacturers. "We know we need to do something with regard to manufacturing competitiveness," said Karl J. Jacobs, president of Rock Valley College in Rockford, Ill., which has built such a center.
Not all programs involve classic, metal-cutting manufacturing. Lawrence Livermore and other Federal centers in the West have set up programs with community colleges in California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona and Hawaii to train environmental cleanup and hazardous-waste specialists.
"It is pretty obvious that rising numbers of people will be needed to work in environmental restoration, pollution prevention and waste management," said Paul Dickinson, an education specialist at Lawrence Livermore. Mr. Dickinson said the program, called the Partnership for Environmental Technology Education, would be a joint government-industry-academic undertaking.
Livermore has also signed an agreement with the 107-campus, 1.5-million-student California Community College system to establish 16 Centers for Applied Competitive Technologies. The agreement is part of an effort to find commercial applications for technologies such as advanced high-temperature materials developed by the labs during the cold war.
The Tennessee Valley Authority is trying to help the 40 community colleges in its region stay close to technology's cutting edge. "The pace of change in some technologies is so fast the instructors cannot keep up," said W. Carroll Marsalis, a sector manager with the authority. "So we are focusing on training and retraining for instructors. We have helped establish a National Institute for Technical Training at Mississippi State University."

School Sports' Last Rah-Rah?

BYLINE: By Michel Marriott

 BODY:
FOR THE first time in the collective memory of Lorain, Ohio, autumn blew into the small, blue-collar town this year and no season of public high school football was there to greet it. No cheerleaders. No pep rallies. No football players hitting the field and each other in the name of school pride and personal glory.
"It feels kind of messed up," said Frank (Scooter) Shrieves, the 17-year-old quarterback for the Lorain High School Steelmen, who still wears his football jacket to school. 
 In Lorain, as in an increasing number of American school districts, student athletic programs are under siege. In recent months, a lingering national recession and a creeping unwillingness among taxpayers to pay yet more for public education have strained school budgets throughout much of the United States. More and more, school administrators complain that they are being pressured to choose between textbooks and touchdowns.
"It's made me sick to the stomach," said Thomas Bollin, superintendent of Lorain's 12,000-student system, about the deep cuts he made in school sports programs in March. When residents voted down a special levy that would have generated the necessary revenues, Mr. Bollin said he had no choice but to cancel sports.
Dozens of other school administrators nationally, many of whom acknowledge the teamwork and leadership skills that sports teach, have made or are facing similar decisions.
 
$750 Per School
 In Chicago, a yawning education budget deficit prompted school officials to slash athletic budgets for its 64 high schools from an already tight $6,700 a year to $750. In Los Angeles, where transporting one team to play another costs on average more than $200, school officials trimmed athletic budgets by 20 percent as funding streams for education run dry. Communities in other states, including Arizona, Florida and Maryland, have endured similar cuts in school athletics.
In some schools, cuts have been accepted with resignation. Elsewhere, school officials have devised sometimes desperate ways to raise money.
In San Francisco, city officials passed a measure in January that placed a one-year-only surcharge on ticket sales for some professional sports to raise money to support local student athletics -- a first in the nation. High school sports were saved from extinction for at least a year, said Anne Herinline, commissioner of athletics for the city's junior and senior high schools.
Ms. Herinline added that the sports programs were being helped by a local group, Save High School Sports, which has raised more than $100,000 a year for supplies and equipment since it was founded in 1985 by Don Barksdale, a former player for the Boston Celtics. Still, she said, the school district will be "looking at the same black hole next year" as education revenues are outpaced by educational needs.
"How can you have sports programs if you don't have schools?" asked Linda Matsumoto, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Board of Education, which was forced by law to close a $315.8 million budget gap before schools could reopen this fall. "Unfortunately, we had to make some difficult cuts," Ms. Matsumoto said. "But learning takes place in the classroom between teacher and student. That relationship is sacrosanct."
Gary Marx, senior associate executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, said American public schools were increasingly confronting that fact of educational life. "Every administrator I talk to is concerned about what is happening in the academic program and coming up with adequate funding to hold their own," Mr. Marx said.
But Carey E. McDonald, executive consultant to the National High School Athletic Coaches Association, suggests that school officials are using cuts and threats of cuts to sports and other extracurricular programs as a ploy.
"Communities don't seem willing to fund the schools," said Mr. McDonald, who said he had been involved in student athletics for 45 years, "and administrators are smart enough to know that if they threaten to cut sports or band, they'll get support."
In Chicago, however, no rescuers have come running, said Lonnie Williams, the football coach at Martin Luther King Jr. High School on the city's South Side. The result, Mr. Williams said, is that the level of participation in athletics will fall, especially among low-income black students attending "ghetto schools" like Martin Luther King. Professional sports, long a showcase and marketplace for black athletes, will be beyond those students' reach. Cuts in high school sports today, Mr. Williams said, mean limited access to lucrative sports careers tomorrow.
Administrators fear that cutting sports programs may discourage some students from attending school at all because their dreams of becoming another Michael Jordan, the multimillionaire Chicago Bulls basketball star, will be dashed.
The alternatives, Mr. Williams said, are the gang and the street and a premature death.
Four students from Martin Luther King, for example, were murdered over the summer within a four-block radius of the school building, he said.
In Tucson, Ariz., education officials faced with deep cuts to sports and other extracurricular programs rallied round their high school teams by eliminating ninth-grade sports altogether and instituting a pay-to-play plan for the rest.
The plan has met with mixed success. Last year, students paid $60 if they wanted to participate in fine arts programs, such as band, debate and drama, and $105 to play sports. Parents complained, said Sheila Baize, director of extracurricular programs for the Tucson Unified School District, Arizona's second largest. Students spoke with their feet; some 2,000 of them walked away from the extracurricular programs, Dr. Baize said.
This year the fees were reduced to $30 for fine arts and $50 for one season of one sport; ninth-grade programs were restored. The extra revenue came from a $300,000 state budget reallocation; more was raised by a private, nonprofit group in Tucson, the Educational Enrichment Foundation.
 
'Scholarships' Offered
 For students who wanted to participate but were unable to pay, the foundation offered "scholarships" to cover the fees, Dr. Baize said. Nonetheless, she added, there were students who would not ask for financial help although they needed it. "Any time you have to ask for a dollar amount to participate in any educational activity, you automatically restrict some students from participating," she said.
In Lorain, Ohio, school officials decided to borrow $650,000 from the state after the elimination of sports brought protests from parents and moved scores of students to leave the district. But the restoration of sports and other extracurricular activities came too late for this football season, said Mr. Bollin, the superintendent.
The special school levy will again go before the voters on Tuesday. Hopes are that this time it will pass.

Principals of Success

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma

 BODY:
SCRATCH the surface of a good school, one where learning is abundant and real joy accompanies the search for knowledge, and it is almost certain that a good principal will be there leading the way. While there is no consensus on what makes one principal more successful than another, there is consensus on the need to find out.
"The traditional role of the principal has to change if schools are going to change," said Phillip C. Schechty, president of the Center for Leadership in School Reform, a nonprofit organization in Louisville, Ky., that works with school leaders nationwide. "If principals keep on doing what principals have always done, schools will keep on doing what they've always done. Even if they were real good at it before, that may not be good enough today." 
 Studies conducted over the last decade to determine what makes a successful principal show that at the very least, those who are most effective generally know how to identify important tasks and then spend most of their time on those tasks. Successful principals also demonstrate an ability to delegate authority, communicate effectively and set an example by their hard work.
But the job of principal, most principals themselves argue, entails more than the basics of a graduate business degree. And Mr. Schechty and other experts say the standard regimen for principals in most states -- a master's degree in any field, 30 graduate-level credits in subjects like school administration, school law and school finance -- no longer is adequate for the leader of as complex an enterprise as a school.
 
'I Learned by Doing'
 "To be honest, I can't say that anything I learned in those school administration classes has come to play in my job over the last seven years," said Dennis W. Boswell, principal of the Conway Middle School in Jefferson County, Kentucky. "I learned by doing rather than by having someone lecturing at me."
Efforts are under way to upgrade the training that principals receive, and some innovative changes, such as New Jersey's alternate route for principals, have already been effected.
At the heart of the issue, though, is an unresolved debate over the very function and focus of a principal. Some believe that today's schools are like small corporations. Thus principals should be trained like corporate managers, able to keep their schools running smoothly, with food in the cafeteria and chalk in the classrooms, allowing teachers and students to pursue their missions without interference.
But many others, while acknowledging the importance of strong managerial skills, maintain that the principal remains the heart of a school and sets the academic tone there. As such, he or she needs to be able to motivate teachers, deal effectively with human-relations issues and shape the educational enterprise.
In most cases, a principal needs to be both manager and educational leader. But it is a matter of philosophy, and often of a school's disciplinary and economic environment, that determines the degree to which one attitude dominates the other.
Successful principals acknowledge that the skills they draw on most are those they picked up on the job, most often working as an assistant principal to someone willing to share administrative responsibilities.
Jane A. Kendrick, a principal in Hammond, Ind., now on leave to work as a special assistant to the superintendent, said that when she received her doctorate in school administration, "that pretty much covered the management piece, what we called budgets, butts and buses." But for Miss Kendrick, it was working with principals that gave her the leadership skills she needed when, in 1978, she went to Henry W. Eggers Elementary/Middle School in Hammond, a 1,000-student, multicultural, multi-ethnic school known as the "zoo." It took time, but she was able to draw in parents, community leaders and teachers in a site-based management reform, in which teachers have more responsibility for curriculum development and classroom management.
The reform of principals' instruction programs formalizes and gives prominence to such on-the-job training. Programs such as Stanford University's "New Pathways" work with hypothetical situations and the team approach to problem-solving.
By contrast, several programs rely on what is basically a corporate management training model. The Bell South Corporation in Atlanta, for example, takes its own employees and local principals into the woods for several days of exercises intended to help develop leadership skills.
For the last six years in New Jersey, a corporate group called The Partnership for New Jersey has been bringing inner-city principals to corporate training programs by businesses such as Johnson & Johnson and Nabisco Brands Inc. to learn leadership skills such as managing organizational change.
 
'Schools Are Businesses'
 "Schools are businesses to the extent that they have to balance budgets, evaluate employees, deal with issues such as stress management," said Jan Carlsson-Bull, associate director of the Partnership.
New Jersey has gone farther than other states in recognizing the managerial skills needed by principals. Along with its widely praised alternate route program that allows people to become teachers without having to take education courses, the State Department of Education offers an alternate route to becoming a principal for someone who has never taught but has a master's degree in some leadership field such as business administration.
The New Jersey program essentially follows the notion that principals learn what they need to know by working on the job. For two years, a business executive-turned-principal must report to an experienced principal who can provide education leadership skills the alternate-route trainee may not have.
The unusual nature of this approach has not been fully tested, since all two dozen people who have come through the program in the last two years had taught. Still, the program remains controversial. "If a principal is expected to hire teachers, evaluate teachers, support teachers, a principal ought to have spent time in a classroom," said Patrick J. Ragosta, a former teacher who now is principal of Burlington Township High School in southern New Jersey.
Mr. Ragosta added, and other principals agree, that working as a vice-principal under an effective principal is the best route to becoming a school leader. They also said principals must be able to juggle several tasks at once, and deal effectively with adults and children.
And then, there is that intangible quality separating the adequate from the extraordinary. "Part of it is instinct," said Eileen Petruzillo, the principal of Greenwich High School in Greenwich, Conn., and a former New York City school principal once called exemplary by a United States Secretary of Education. "It's the ability to say 'My own agenda is that I want this place to be better when I leave than when I came.' "

HEADLINE: Drop in Births Reported, And Recession Is Blamed

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Five years of steady increases in the number of births in America ended abruptly this year, and many demographers and economists are blaming the recession.
 The Federal Department of Health and Human Services reported last week that 2,361,000 babies had been born in the first seven months of 1991, a decrease from the same period in 1990. Since 1987, births had been increasing by more than 100,000 a year. 
The decrease thus far in 1991 puts births 50,000 below the same period in 1990, but that does not include the July figures for Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland and Oregon, which were not reported. But all of these, with the exception of Illinois, had already shown declines in the first few months of 1991. No 1991 statistics for Illinois are available yet.
 Marriages also fell 2 percent in the same seven-month period of 1991, the department said.
 
Economy's Consequences
 Although the final figures could change slightly once all states have reported and corrections have been made, economists and demographers generally agreed that the decline in births and marriages was significant and was caused by the 16-month recession.
 The last three national recessions were followed by reductions in the total number of births in the years immediately after.
 "It's almost certain that the increases of the past years have stopped, primarily because there is a perception that the economy has entered a questionable phase," said Carl Haub, the director of demographic analysis for the Population Research Bureau, a private company in Washington. "The faith of young couples in the job outlook and the economy has been shaken."
 Richard Easterlin, a professor of economics at the University of Southern California who has for two decades been a leading proponent of theories that fertility follows economic cycles -- up in good times, down in bad -- said, "This recession is serious and long and hurting many of the types of people who do the most family planning, who tend to time births and space them."
 This year, the clearest regional decline, 5 percent in the first six months of the year, was in the Pacific states where jobs have rapidly evaporated, particularly in the military-contracting industry. In the Middle Atlantic region, including New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the decrease was less than 1 percent in the first seven months, and the rate of decline was even lower in the mountain states.
 But, while the depressing effect of a recession on births is a constant, demographers and economists say they still have no clear picture of how it works -- which income groups or age groups delay childbearing and which children are delayed, first or second babies, or later children.
 
'We Don't Feel We Should'
 "We still hope to have a third child," said Deborah Lillian, 33 years old, of Montclair, N.J., "but we don't feel we should right now." Her husband, Jonathan, a banker, lost his job in August and has just started his own business.
 The couple has two children, 3 1/2 years old and 10 months old. "We were going to space the next one a little closer, but it wouldn't be responsible to go ahead," Mrs. Lillian said.
 But other young couples, like George Houk and Pat Bailey of Washington, will not let the economy get in the way of their plans. "I lost my job last January, but it had very little impact on our decision to have another child," said Mr. Houk, 34, an architect who had worked for a design and construction firm in Maryland. Like Mr. Lillian, he has gone into business for himself.
 His wife is due to have their second child at the end of January. "We're more concerned with how old the respective siblings are and how old we want to be as new parents," he said.
 Just as the two couples differ in their responses to the recession, economists and demographers are split in predicting whether the current demographic reversal portends a long-term decline in births and in the average number of children born to each woman.
 "It wouldn't surprise me if 1990 was the peak for the remainder of the century," said Martin O'Connell, chief of the Fertility Statistics Branch at the Census Bureau. He said that he did not expect any increase in average family size and that now that the oldest baby-boomers were edging past their childbearing years there would be a slow decline in births, at least until 2000.
 
Some See It as Temporary
 But other economists see the decline as a temporary setback, arguing that women will soon be having more children apiece. Experts follow that trend, measuring it in a statistic called the total fertility rate, or the average number of children a woman will have in her lifetime.
 At its peak, in 1957, in the midst of the baby boom that began after the end of World War II, the fertility rate in the United States was 3.77. At its trough, in 1976, it was 1.77. In 1990, the national rate stood at 2.1, called by experts the "replacement rate," or the birth level at which the population, in the absence of immigration, remains stable.
 These figures reflect the complex demographic minuet between the baby-boom generation in the two decades after the war and the baby-bust generation that followed. Baby boomers in the 1970's and 1980's ushered in the phenomenon of delayed childbearing, pushing down the fertility rate while they were in their 20's, and pushing it back up as they reached their 30's and finished forming families. But as they did so, the baby busters were re-inventing the practice of having babies while in their 20's. The combination pushed the fertility rate and the total number of births up rapidly in the late 1980's, Mr. Haub, Mr. McConnell and other demographers said.
 The baby boomers are now beginning to move out of their childbearing years, leaving a smaller number of women to have children. But Diane J. Macunovich, an assistant economics professor at Williams College in Massachusetts, said she believed that this smaller group of women could expect more success at work because they had fewer competitors. This success, she said, will make them more willing to have three or four children each.
The current downturn "is a blip on an upward trend," she said.

HEADLINE: Giving Downtowns a New, Alluring Look

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
AFTER years of being passed over in favor of regional malls and shopping centers, downtown districts throughout the metropolitan area are reworking their images to try to bring back shoppers and revive their commercial centers.
They are doing this through mixed-use developments involving residential as well as commercial projects to put more middle-class and affluent residents right in the center of town. 
 This month, after 25 years of debate about how best to proceed, the Village of Scarsdale in Westchester County will begin demolition to make way for redeveloping part of its downtown.
The village and the Penn Central Corporation have signed a memorandum of understanding giving the railroad exclusive development rights for a year and setting forth such preliminary steps as site-clearing. Details of the plan remain flexible and subject to village review proceedings and financing has yet to be worked out.
As it stands now, the plan calls for 22,478 square feet of retail and other commercial space and parking for 539 cars. Above the retail space will be about 150 condominium units.
Similar mixed-use projects are planned for downtowns in such places as Danbury, Conn.; Patchogue, L.I., and Englewood, N.J.
These downtown projects seem to be almost the only ones -- except for super expensive apartments in Manhattan -- where condominium development is going forward in the New York region.
Developers apparently believe that despite the oversupply of condominium units throughout the area, there is still demand for those close to transporation and shopping. In fact, all the downtown housing developments now under way are being targeted specifically to young professionals and the elderly, for whom convenience is of paramount concern.
Much of the impetus behind this push to redevelop downtowns comes from the railroad companies that own land near the tracks. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Penn Central Corporation and the New Jersey Transit Corporation are currently involved in developing sites near railroad stations. Not only is this a profitable use of land owned by the transportation companies, but it also increases the number of people who use the trains.
PENN CENTRAL owns half of the three-acre redevelopment site in Scarsdale; the village owns the rest. In exchange for using village-owned land, Penn Central has agreed to make public improvements. The most important, said John Crary, the village's deputy manager, is repairing and widening the Popham Road Railroad Bridge, built in the 1920's and in a "steady state of deterioration in recent years."
The demolition, which is expected to be completed this month, involves three abandoned buildings considered an eyesore in the affluent village. The structures, an old office building, a railroad sub-station behind it and a gas station, "have been deemed to have no historic value," Mr. Crary said.
"A preservation group examined them," he said, "and just asked to have some brick and a sign salvaged and that will be done."
There has been some public opposition about the scope of the development. Some believe it will urbanize the village and the buildings will obscure tree views for some residents. There has also been concern about the affordability of the housing units.
"Because this is a very expensive site to build on, the units are expected to be 1,500-square-foot luxury condominiums," said Mr. Crary. "It's still too early to get more specific than that."
Mr. Crary pointed out that the zoning governing the site requires setting aside 10 percent of the units for the elderly. But some village residents worry that few elderly people will be able to afford them, since they will sell at market rates.
The new buildings will have to mesh with the village's prevailing Tudor style.
"Any design we consider can't just be good," Mr. Crary said. "If it doesn't look outstanding, we're not going to do it."
Taking a slightly different tack is an ambitious downtown project currently under way in Danbury, which is expected to include 20,000 square feet of retail space, 10,000 square feet of offices, 165 restaurant seats, a 1,000-seat triplex movie theater and 86 housing units. The housing, to be marketed to young professionals, will be one- and two-bedroom condominiums, priced between $90,000 and $115,000.
"The whole package is designed to bring the middle class back to the city," said Dennis Elpern, the city's planning director. "To do that, we have to offer the kind of amenities that will make the downtown stand out in this highly competitive market."
As in Scarsdale, this project has been in the planning stage for several decades. What finally got it off the ground was an $8 million state grant that is being used to build a 550-car garage that is expected to be completed next month. That same grant is also being used to build a landscaped median along the shopping district on Main Street.
The plans include building a brick walkway along the shopping corridor and creating a village green, a 19,580-square-foot plot off Main Street that will be landscaped with $250,000 in state funds.
Like many other cities in the Northeast, Danbury's downtown has been devastated by the plethora of shopping centers and malls that sprang up on the city's outskirts. The city now has a 25 percent retail vacancy rate and 20 percent of its office space is unoccupied. To turn things around, city officials hired Hyett Palma, a commercial development consulting firm based in Washington.
"Malls have been very good at locating their retail spaces in positions where they can benefit each other," said Dolores P. Palma, the firm's president. She recommends that downtowns do the same through the "clustering of businesses," where a shoe store, for example, would be positioned next to a shop that sells scarves and handbags, and another that has women's clothing.
The company also advocates "a healthy mix of retail, offices and housing," she said.
"The best cities, like Seattle and Boston, have that," she said. "It creates a synergy that makes for more active streets and more business."
In some communities, housing did not start out as part of the original downtown redevelopment plans, but was added later.
In heavily "malled" Long Island, the village of Patchogue has been struggling, with some success, to keep its downtown shopping district competitive.
The latest attempt is the proposed building of a 27,000-square-foot retail center on Main Street that would have national chain stores. Among the proposed features are storefronts with uniform awnings and a sidewalk arcade where shoppers could view showroom-size windows.
This new look for downtown led a local developer, Connor Construction, to begin building a 30-unit condominium complex, called Seacrest Village, two blocks from Main Street. Designed to appeal to young families, the one- and two-bedroom units are expected to sell for $99,900 to $118,900.
A nearby site at the west end of Main Street is also being for housing.
A similar snowball effect is expected in Englewood, N.J. There, a project called Palisades Court will comprise 60,183 square feet of retail space, a 51,429-square-foot supermarket, 28,100 square feet of office space and a three-level, 100-car garage and additional parking for 553 cars.
It already has all its approvals and is "moving ahead," according to Peter M. Beronio, director of the Englewood Development Corporation.
At some later point, Mr. Beronio envisions a residential complex to be built on a site adjacent to the redevelopment site.
"There's an area southwest of the retail development that the City Council has already deemed in need of redevelopment," he said. "If all goes well with downtown, it should happen."

HEADLINE: Selling Software, Soviet-Style

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

 BODY:
Selling software in the Soviet Union has its own special set of challenges. The Nantucket Corporation, a $35 million, privately held software maker in Los Angeles, is learning that in a country with no clear notion of ownership, much less intellectual property rights, building a market can be daunting. "Copying is so pervasive that the people over there think that Maxell and Verbatim, the floppy disk makers, are actually the software publishers," said Larry Heimendinger, Nantucket's president.
Nantucket, however, is showing other major software companies how to succeed there by painstakingly convincing Soviet software developers that buying is preferable to pirating. Nantucket's popular Clipper package, used to develop software, is unusual in that 2,000 legal copies have been sold in the Soviet Union. 
 Esther Dyson, a consultant and publisher of the Release 1.0 newsletter who has studied the Soviet computer industry, said Clipper's joint venture there appears to be the most successful of any software maker's. Companies like the Microsoft Corporation and the Lotus Development Corporation are using it as a model.
"Nantucket has paved a path," said Jane Kitson, business development manager for Lotus in the Soviet Union. "They were the first to sell software for rubles and to successfully convince customers of the value of the service and support they'd get if they bought the product." Lotus expects to open a wholly owned subsidiary there by the end of the year.
Microsoft, whose earlier attempt to start a Soviet joint venture reportedly failed, has encountered delays in setting up a wholly owned subsidiary, said Charlotte Guyman, director of international marketing. Ms. Dyson pointed out that Microsoft is already "omnipresent," with virtually every personal computer running a pirated copy of its DOS operating system.
Nantucket is already seeing the results of its evangelistic efforts. At a recent computer trade show in Kiev, an irate Clipper user stood up to complain that only registered buyers were eligible for official user groups.
After a tense moment, a registered buyer said, "I paid for that service and support and so should you." Others cheered.
The first step for companies like Nantucket is to spread that attitude. Nantucket has already devoted more than two years and $650,000 to its Soviet effort, with little hope of recouping its start-up costs for years.
To Mr. Heimendinger, it is worth the risk. Though popular in other countries, Clipper -- which has sold 250,000 copies worldwide and lists for $795 in the United States -- has achieved near-legendary status in the Soviet Union from the thousands of illegal copies.
Like other software, Clipper can be traded on the black market. Nantucket's success in selling Clipper, priced at 15,000 rubles, has come in part because it is a software development package, often bought by people who hope to market their own software.
Nantucket built its Soviet business, which now has 30 employees, a two-story headquarters 20 minutes from the Kremlin, a telephone hot-line and a walk-in service center, by selling its product for rubles.
Instead of earnings that can be brought back to the West, Nantucket's immediate goal is market share. "When we started this in early 1989, our only thought was that eventually the Soviet Union would have to become a free-market economy to survive," said Larry Heimendinger, Nantucket's president. "We figured, let's get in now, seed the marketplace with our product and worry about profits down the pike."
In less than a year of selling its software there, Nantucket has made more than 5 million rubles profit, which it is using to manufacture Clipper in the Soviet Union. This month, Nantucket began selling a Cyrillic version written and produced there, except for the disks.
The Soviet Union, with its estimated 600,000 or more personal computers, has been an open frontier of software piracy. But with 280 million people, a good portion highly educated and eager to get their hands on personal computers, Nantucket saw an opportunity too good to pass up.
Rather than sell through a Europe-based distributor, as most major software makers do, Nantucket sought a joint venture. Mr. Heimendinger was overwhelmed by the response to his request for partners. "It was amazing how naive they were," he said.
One man arranged a secret meeting with Mr. Heimendinger in Cologne, Germany. "He came in, locked the door, pulled down the shades and said, 'I need to sell Clipper. I make a list and send everyone a letter telling them to buy it from me,' " recounted Mr. Heimendinger. "I said, 'Oh, you mean mail order?' And he got upset and said 'Who told you my plan?' He thought he had a unique idea."
Unable to discern the good offers from the bad, Mr. Heimendinger turned to Nantucket's Los Angeles office and Vanessa Wade, a native of Poland who speaks fluent Russian. She moved to Moscow and spent the next year simply figuring out how business was done there.
Ms. Wade eventually discovered a Moscow clinic that helps disabled children use computers. Nantucket persuaded it that a joint venture would benefit both parties. Nantucket contributed computers and hypodermic needles and other medical supplies; the clinic offered a perfect base.
Once the venture, JV Magnet, was set up, Ms. Wade brought in an American couple, Robert and Virginia Clough, to manage it. They had worked on Microsoft's joint venture, and were eager to try again.
They understood the difficulties of motivating a Russian staff. "We constantly had to pound it into their heads that they could make decisions and have an opinion and get results," said Ms. Wade. "It took a year to instill that."
Now, the single telephone help-line is constantly busy. The service and support center is usually filled, with a line out the door. The August coup caused only a slight dip in sales, said Ms. Wade, who now oversees the Moscow operation from Brussels, where she is managing director of Nantucket's Belgian subsidiary.
Ms. Dyson believes all the key software makers will seek a formal presence in the Soviet Union. "It's a huge untapped market," she said. "It's extremely difficult to do anything there but if you do, people really want what you sell."

GOING FOR BROKE
How Robert Campeau Bankrupted the Retail Industry, Jolted the Junk Bond Market, and Brought the Booming Eighties to a Crashing Halt.
By John Rothchild.
Illustrated. 286 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $21.  
 It is the time of year when children begin dreaming of a white-haired man from the North bearing gifts. That is the right spirit to approach this engaging and deft book about Robert Campeau, the frosty-haired Canadian who descended on Wall Street in 1986, playing Santa Claus for the fee-hungry lawyers and bankers who helped him take over the Allied and Federated department store chains. Predictably, the Grinch -- in this case, an $11 billion debt load that Mr. Campeau could never have managed -- stole Christmas.
The story of Robert Campeau may well represent the definitive account of the greatest gouging of a client in the history of American finance, but in "Going for Broke," John Rothchild, the author of "A Fool and His Money," has not produced a finger-wagging Wall Street morality tale. "This is the story of a marvelous financial calamity," he promises, and until events become too grim for laughter, it is actually possible to forget how much damage Mr. Campeau and his enablers did to our economy. In this respect, "Going for Broke" does for corporate finance types in yellow ties and jaunty suspenders what Michael Lewis did for bond traders in "Liar's Poker."
This absurd story began improbably, as these things do. Robert Campeau was a survivor of two mental breakdowns, a physical fitness devotee whose regimen included sheep-brain injections and daily swims in a "specially purified" pool, and an energetic Lothario who had spent the 1960's running back and forth between two women and two sets of children. When dealing with bankers, an aide recalled, "Our idea was to let Bob speak last at these meetings, and then hold our breaths."
In 1985, when Edward Finkelstein, the chairman of R. H. Macy & Company, was working on a leveraged buyout of the department store chain, Mr. Campeau got the wacky idea that he should be involved. Mr. Finkelstein declined to meet him. Undaunted, Mr. Campeau decided to buy a chain of department stores and, in the process, become Mr. Finkelstein's equal.
Mr. Campeau was cash-poor, with a spotty career as a developer of shopping centers and apartment and office buildings. But this was the golden age of hostile takeovers, and investment bankers were willing to entertain the notion that Mr. Campeau might actually be a suitable owner of Allied Stores, the third-largest retail conglomerate in the United States (their 750 stores included Brooks Brothers and Ann Taylor). Indeed, Mr. Campeau was the perfect client. No one knew anything about him; he knew zilch about investment banking. In short order, Allen Finkelson of the distinguished New York City law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore was "charmed by Campeau's quirky bravado."
Such assessments worked only until Bob -- no one called him Robert or Mr. Campeau -- actually talked finance. "Mad Bomber," Citicorp bankers dubbed him. "A Steinbrenner in the making," a retailer concluded. "Nothing the man was saying made any sense," noted Eric Gleacher, then of Morgan Stanley.
Mr. Campeau's luck improved when Bruce Wasserstein, at that time the ranking mergers-and-acquisitions wizard of First Boston, gave him "his famous 'dare to be great' speech, the gist of which was that to be great, you had to be willing to take on huge debts and pay huge fees." Mr. Campeau swallowed this line whole; Mr. Wasserstein called him "a brilliant although misunderstood businessman." Still, once First Boston learned that Mr. Campeau consulted a fortuneteller, Mr. Wasserstein made sure he did not give his client a dime until he had paid his commitment fee by wire transfer.
Mr. Rothchild says Mr. Campeau played the part of the empty suit beautifully, showing up at First Boston on an October morning in 1986 to sit with Mr. Wasserstein, Mr. Finkelson and a gaggle of investment bankers. A few minutes later, Boyd Jefferies -- the founder of a brokerage firm that, among other services, was then accumulating stock for favored clients -- just happened to call and to wonder if anyone was interested in buying 32 million shares of Allied Stores. This coincidence was, for these men, considerably less astounding than the fact that, after acquiring Allied, Mr. Campeau could not make the down payment.
Six hundred million dollars in fees later, however, First Boston and Citicorp were only too happy to help Mr. Campeau buy Federated Stores, a mammoth chain with 650 stores (including the glittering, highly successful Bloomingdale's) and 134,000 employees. That transaction generated $200 million in fees for First Boston alone -- more than Federated earned in a year. Unsurprisingly, it only took six months for Mr. Campeau's empire to topple. Allied and Federated went bankrupt, 8,000 employees were fired, Citicorp stock and the junk bond market crashed, First Boston lost a bundle. The age of what Mr. Rothchild terms "the Debtor Barons" was over.
Robert Campeau, who has also been forced to declare bankruptcy, now lives in an Austrian mansion and avoids all depositions "on the advice of his physician." He probably missed a recent advertisement for fur coats. Among the women pictured was Susan Finkelson, wife of the lawyer who was once so helpful to Mr. Campeau that he made him a director of his company. Mrs. Finkelson modeled chinchilla -- from Bloomingdale's. In another time, that would be an insignificant detail. After Mr. Rothchild's book, it offers some crackpot solace: at least the lawyers escaped unscathed.
 
 
THE CAMPEAU TOUCH
 Once, at a retirement party for a longtime employee, [Robert Campeau] tried to make a deal to buy back the man's Campeau Corp. stock at a favorable price. Once, the sale of his house in Ottawa to his own daughter was stalled over his insistence that the washer/ dryer unit didn't come with the property and still belonged to him. Once, the sale of a $600,000 apartment building in Ottawa was held up while Campeau and the buyer argued over who got to keep the lawn mower. . . .
If the Ottawa zoning codes set a height limit of 325 feet for new buildings, as they did in certain sectors of the city in the 1960s, Campeau demanded 450 feet. When government officials acceded to 342 feet, Campeau offered to compromise at 375. When they held him to the 342-foot requirement, he put up a 342-foot building, but with an extra 28-foot "pimple" for rooftop equipment. Campeau argued that the extra 28 feet didn't count as part of the building's formal height. His opponents saw it as another example of his relentless one upmanship. From "Going for Broke."

HEADLINE: Backers Say 'Core' Bank Plan Lives

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Although it was ultimately defeated on the floor of the House of Representatives last week, the proposal by Representative Charles E. Schumer to set up a "core" banking system in the United States is not likely to disappear.
Core banking would split each of the nation's banks into two: a core bank that would take in Government-insured deposits and make only traditional loans to small business and homeowners and a "wholesale" bank that could use its uninsured deposits to lend pretty much as it pleased. The notion is to reduce the amount of risky activities that are protected by Federal deposit insurance. 
 That this approach, a fundamental change in the structure of the banking system, was able to attract the support of 106 House members was a sign of how far many frustrated legislators are willing to go to deal with the deteriorating banking system.
 
Overwhelmed by the Opposition
 Presented as an amendment to the banking overhaul legislation now before the House, the proposal was opposed by nearly every bank lobbying group and, after heated debate, by 312 legislators.
Despite losing by 200 votes, Mr. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, predicted as he left the House floor: "Core banking will pass, and it will be law within three years. It's an idea whose time will soon come."
Others agree. "Core banking is on the shelf," said Robert Litan, a banking analyst at the Brookings Institution. "It will be one of the first things to be resurrected if the banking system deteriorates."
And Samuel J. Baptista, a lobbyist with the Financial Services Council, a trade group representing both banks and securities firms, commented, "Win, lose or draw, core banking is a concept that will not go away."
That's too bad, almost all banks say. They contend that core banking has so many pitfalls it would weaken an already fragile system.
The core banking idea was first floated by Lowell L. Bryan, a banking consultant with McKinsey & Company, who sent a book he wrote on the subject to all members of Congress. He followed up with personal visits and in Mr. Schumer found a responsive ear.
 
Two Main Features
 Under the Schumer proposal, core banking would have two main features. First, an interest-rate ceiling would be reimposed for depositors in the core bank, on the theory that competition by banks to attract depositors with higher rates push them into risky lending. Second, the Schumer proposal would limit the loans a core bank could make to a single borrower, on the belief that such concentrated loans put a bank more at risk. These two proposals, with the changes in the banking system being considered in Congress to allow banks to enter the securities business, would bring about a core banking system of insured banks doing traditional lending and uninsured banks undertaking riskier ventures.
 
Search for Higher Returns
 Few bankers care for this approach, and in a rare united front, big and small banks criticized the proposal. One big bank that favors it is the NCNB Corporation, based in Charlotte, N.C. "Core bank is a four-letter word for comprehensive reforms, and we at NCNB like many facets of it," said Timothy P. Hartman, chairman of NCNB Texas. NCNB, many banking experts say, is already structured along core bank lines and could make the switch more easily than many banks.
But Mr. Bryan of McKinsey calculated that the interest rate ceiling would drive $800 billion to $1 trillion in funds from core banks as depositors fled in search of higher returns. This money should flow to the uninsured part of the bank, he said, which would pay higher rates but offer no Government guarantees against loss.
Bankers do not see it that way. Without money on deposit, banks would have no money to lend, making the already existing credit shortage even worse. "This proposal suffers from all the basic problems of price controls," said Edward L. Yingling, a lobbyist for the American Bankers Association. "It would drive a lot of money out of the system. It would cause credit crunches if too tight. If not tight enough, it has no teeth."
William M. Isaac, chairman of the Secura Group, a Washington bank consulting firm, and former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, was even more blunt. "The last thing we need right now is a plan to drive a trillion dollars of depositors out of the banks," he said.
 
Premiums of Deposit Insurance
 In addition, Mr. Isaac said, the money that would flow to the uninsured bank is money that could be used to pay premiums into the Government's bank deposit insurance fund. Since the uninsured banks would be able to turn to the Federal Reserve System in times of trouble, they would be getting the benefits of Government bank guarantees without paying the premiums, a situation that Mr. Isaac terms unconscionable.
The second part of Mr. Schumer's proposal, to limit the amount a bank could lend to a single lender, is criticized by banks as unnecessary. They say the problem with banks is not that they lend too much to any single lender, but that they overly concentrate loans to single risky groups -- for instance, too much commercial real estate loans or loans for leveraged buyouts.
"You can't find a bank that has failed because it made too big a loan to one person or group," Mr. Yingling of the bankers association said, "but you can find lots of banks that failed because of overconcentration in one area, and this lending limitation accomplishes nothing about that."

HEADLINE: Compaq Moves Are Reported

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Nov. 3

 BODY:
James M. Harris, a co-founder of the Compaq Computer Corporation, and two other senior executives have left the company, The Houston Chronicle has reported.
The departures follow the ouster of another founder, Joseph R. Canion, who had been chief executive and president. 
 The Chronicle reported on Saturday that several employees had said Mr. Harris, 47 years old, had decided to retire. He had been senior vice president of engineering.
The newspaper said the others who left included Robert Vieau, Compaq's senior vice president of manufacturing, and C. Murray Francois, the senior vice president of corporate quality and materials.
Compaq officials could not be reached for comment over the weekend. Mr. Canion, reached at home today, said he did not have enough information about his former colleagues' departures to comment.
Compaq, hurt by the recession and increased competition, announced on Oct. 23 its first-ever quarterly loss and said it would lay off 1,400 employees, or about 12 percent of its work force. The first layoff notices were issued on Friday.
Eckhard Pfeiffer, the chief operating officer, was named to replace Mr. Canion.

HEADLINE: Rare Miscalculation by Honda

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Among automotive cognoscenti, the Honda Motor Company sits on a tall pedestal for its almost uncanny ability to aim at a market niche and fill it with a wildly popular car. But after Honda's introduction of its Accord station wagon, that pedestal is not quite so high.
Nearly a year after Honda showed off its first Accord wagons at its Marysville, Ohio, assembly plant, American sales are running at about 2,000 cars a month, well short of the 3,000 cars Honda had hoped for. 
 True, a recession in the United States has severely hurt car sales and promises to give Detroit its worst financial beating ever. And true, the station wagon market has been shrinking, badly hurt by the growing popularity of mini-vans.
But Honda's wagon is also off to a slow start because of its lofty price, its comparatively modest amount of space and a missing feature or two.
 
Problems of Price and Space
 Honda, for its part, says it is not disappointed with station wagon sales. They will improve, company executives insist, as the model becomes better known and the economy improves. In any event, they say, the plant where the car is built is operating at close to full capacity, partly because Honda is exporting the station wagon to Europe and Japan.
Honda's first mistake, several Honda dealers said, was in pricing the compact wagon considerably higher than the Honda Accord sedan -- initially more than $2,000 higher. Shoppers quickly noted that the wagon was not all that much bigger than the sedan and concluded that it was not worth the added cost.
Given what Honda initially wanted for its wagon, ranging from $17,300 to $19,800, many buyers chose roomier competitors like the Subaru Legacy or the Volvo 240 wagon, which costs only slightly more than a fully-equipped Honda wagon. Others just chose the Accord sedan.
"In the climate we're in, purchase price is a major factor," said Larry Brueshaber, a Honda dealer in Cincinnati.
Because Honda's wagon is generally less roomy than many other wagons, as well as comparably priced mini-vans and utility vehicles, it is also less useful. With 64.6 cubic feet of cargo room with the second seat folded down, the Accord compares poorly with the midsized Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable wagons (81.1 cubic feet), and import wagons like the Subaru Legacy (71 cubic feet) or the Volvo 240 (76 cubic feet).
"Honda may have overestimated the potential for a sporty-type wagon without that much space in the back," said Craig Scott, who owns Scott Honda in West Chester, Pa. "And I think Honda has to address the fact that a station wagon is perceived to hold more than four people."
Although a third adult could squeeze into the back seat, enabling the car to carry five adults, Honda engineers lacked room for a foldaway third seat in the rear similar to the third-seat option offered by Ford on its Taurus and Sable wagons and on the Chevrolet Caprice, Volvo and others. Honda executives have said they are considering adding a third seat, but not until the car is redesigned in 1995 or 1996.
 
Swayed by a Radio Ad
 Debbie Luciano of Lincroft, N.J., had been planning to buy a 1992 Honda station wagon, and she even put $2,000 on one. Then she heard a radio advertisement that compared its size with that of a Volvo. "I started thinking about these high school kids I drive around," she said. "They are big."
After comparing the $20,020 price for the well-equipped Honda with the $21,500 cost of the Volvo, she and her husband decided that the extra space was worth the extra money.
With the 1991 introductory price of $17,300, the basic Accord wagon cost $2,205 more than a comparably equipped Accord sedan. The most expensive wagon had a $19,800 price tag, $2,255 more than the most luxurious Accord sedan. By contrast, prices for a Ford Taurus station wagon start at less than $15,000.
Honda has since made some pricing changes. For the 1992 model year, it narrowed the price difference between the wagon and the sedan, not by cutting prices but by raising the price of the sedan more than the wagon. Now, the least expensive Honda wagon costs $17,450, compared with $15,825 for the least-expensive sedan, a $1,625 difference. The most expensive wagon costs $20,650, only $655 more than the costliest sedan.
A Honda spokesman said the value of the station wagon was enhanced this year by the addition of a driver's side air bag as standard equipment. The sedan has featured an air bag since last year.
Executives of Detroit's Big Three, who have watched glumfaced as Honda's Civic, Accord and Acura models have inexorably devoured their sales since 1973, can barely conceal their glee now that Honda may finally have hit something short of a home run.
"It surely hasn't measured up to vaunted expectations," said Joel Pitcoff, a research analyst for the Ford Motor Company. "If their strategy was to woo away Taurus and Sable owners, that's going to be a tough struggle."
The Honda wagon is also struggling in a shrinking market. Throughout the 1980's, mini-vans steadily gained ground as the multipurpose vehicle of choice, while station wagon sales steadily declined. Since 1985, station wagon registrations have plummeted 57 percent, to 390,770 cars in 1990, while mini-van registrations have more than doubled in the same period, to 829,126 units.
 
Resisting the Mini-Van Trend
 Ford, for example, discontinued its full-sized wagons this year after annual sales had dwindled to less than 15,000 cars. It continues to make the Taurus and Sable wagons.
But Honda has resisted the mini-van trend, preferring to invest in other projects like its Acura luxury models. The Acura Legend was the first Japanese luxury car to be sold in the United States and quickly captured a niche because it was priced slightly below European luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and BMW and won more praise from reviewers than American luxury models like Lincoln and Cadillac.
Since most shoppers consider domestic or foreign brands exclusively, Honda probably did not hope to attract much crossover business from Ford. Still, Honda has to wonder whether the Accord wagon possesses the attributes for its target audience: import buyers who like a sporty vehicle but need a roomier car than a sedan.
Honda dealers say more changes in the pricing stategy could go a long way toward increasing sales. Generally, Honda cars have been so popular that the company has not offered rebates. But Honda will sometimes subsidize leases or pay incentives to dealers, which can indirectly lower a customer's price.
 
A Comparison With Subaru
 Mr. Scott, the Pennsylvania Honda dealer, said the Honda wagon "drives and handles like the sedan and has more space, but it still could cost almost $2,000 more," taking into consideration options and incentives.
"At that price," he said, "people start comparing with the Subaru wagon, which is $3,000 less, or they discover they can get something much bigger for about the same money."
Last fall, a few months before the Accord wagon was available, John Lewis and Judith Bell-Lewis, his wife, of Lynchburg, Va., were hunting for a station wagon. They bought a four-wheel-drive Subaru Legacy wagon for $15,500. The Honda dealer had told him a comparably equipped wagon might cost $18,000.
"The Subaru was a great value," Mr. Lewis said. "My wife owned a Honda Accord sedan and loved it, but we have no regrets."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Fed Delay Of Rate Cut Expected

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
On the eve of the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions, many credit market traders and investors expect the Federal Reserve Board to move today or tomorrow to push short-term interest rates down to levels that have not been seen since Richard M. Nixon was President.
But many analysts who agree that another cut is coming say the Fed may wait a bit before pushing rates down to the levels of the early 1970's. 
 Current conditions and recent history support the argument that the Fed will quickly push the discount rate, the rate the Fed charges banks to borrow at its discount window, down by half a point, to 4.5 percent, as well as cut the overnight Federal funds rate for loans among banks by another quarter-point, to 4.75 percent.
 
Continuing Weakness
 Recent economic reports have quashed talk of an accelerating recovery and strengthened the possibility that the positive growth registered in the third quarter was merely a blip in a lengthening recession. And recent inflation statistics give little reason to suspect that price pressures are anything but tame.
"We have enough information to say that the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 1992 will be very soft," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "And there is no inflation threat anywhere."
But one of the Fed governors asserted yesterday that the economy would not slide back into recession, pointing to figures showing economic growth over the summer. "I don't think there will be a double dip," John P. LaWare, told a conference of bank-loan and credit officers in Washington.
Mr. LaWare said pessimism among consumers and businesses was dragging down the economy. "What is most worrisome is not so much the basic statistics, but confidence," he said.
 
Cut at Last Refunding
 Expectations of an imminent rate cut have also been raised by the Fed's recent history of easing policy. While the bond market's collective memory is not long, it does extend back three months, and the Fed did ease at the start of the August refunding. Four times each year, the Government sells three- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
But when the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee meets in Washington tomorrow, other considerations are likely to provide more compelling ammunition for delaying action, analysts said.
A delay in easing rates would most likely sit well with the bond market, where stubbornly high yields suggest that the Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy have been largely unappreciated. At this juncture, coaxing long-term interest rates down is more important than cutting short-term rates again, analysts said.
"They need to convince a lot of money managers that the economy is soft and getting softer and that inflation is not a threat," said Jerry L. Jordan, senior vice president at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.
The efforts to refocus the bond market's attention on the economy and on inflation were helped by the dismal October employment statistics released on Friday.
The report contained few positive elements, but traders and analysts said the one-tenth of 1 percent rise in the unemployment rate, to 6.8 percent, had probably cooled political pressures in Washington to consider fiscal policy changes, at least until after next year.
Talk of tax cuts haunted the bond market through much of October, effectively blocking the Fed from reducing the funds rate by another 25 basis points until last week. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Impact on Dollar
 In addition to assessing the bond market's probable reaction, analysts said the Fed must be concerned about what another quick cut in short-term rates would do to the dollar, which came under savage attack last week.
A decision by the Fed to pause before cutting rates again would almost certainly push short-term market rates higher over the next few days. But analysts and money managers said such an increase might be necessary to insure success for this week's refunding auctions.
"It is time for the Fed to act," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International. "But easing before the refunding is like having dessert before the entree, because it makes it very difficult to distribute these new issues."
As the auctions approached, traders and money managers said the crucial issues surrounding the debt sales centered on whether bond yields would have to exceed 8 percent to stimulate demand, and how the lingering effects of the Salomon Brothers scandal involving improper Treasury auction bids might influence the auction process.
The bulk of the new securities will almost certainly be bought by domestic investors, analysts said.
Net purchases by foreigners of Treasury securities totaled an enormous $13.6 billion in the second quarter, Treasury data show. But since then, the differences in interest rates overseas and here have narrowed further and the dollar has weakened. And compared with last spring, there seems less chance of a further big recession-related decline in American rates.
 
Taking Long-Term Risks
 In the recent past, investors have found it a mistake to buy bonds yielding less than 8 percent. But at the end of last week the spread, or difference, between yields on two-year notes and 30-year bonds was a 2.30 percentage points. Given that sort of premium, the risk of buying long-term securities is worth taking, some money managers say.
"People haven't been very successful buying bonds at under 8 percent," said one money manager, who insisted on not being identified. "But this time I think I will, because the economy stinks and inflation isn't a problem at all."
William H. Gross, a managing director at the Pacific Investment Management Company in Newport Beach, Calif., said: "With inflation at around 3 percent, bond yields are very attractive at close to 8 percent. I believe that, but I don't know if the rest of the market believes it."
Although the Treasury has held a number of debt sales since the Salomon scandal erupted in August, this week's refunding will be the first sale since then of the Government's most speculative securities.
Since the scandal broke, Salomon has been barred from bidding for clients at auctions, and other houses have become much more circumspect about their conduct. Those changes could have an effect this week, traders said.
"All of the primary dealers are much more sensitive about what they can and can't say," since the scandal, one trader said.
"As a result," the trader added, "I think distribution of these securities may not be as efficient as at previous refundings."

HEADLINE: BAKER WILL VISIT CHINA THIS MONTH

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID, Nov. 4

 BODY:
After several months of secret negotiations, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d announced tonight that he would visit China this month, a trip that is bound to revive the debate over the Bush Administration's stance toward the hard-line Beijing Government.
Mr. Baker will be the highest-level Bush Administration official to visit Beijing since the violent crackdown on democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen Square in June 1989. His announcement of the trip, in a news conference at the close of Middle East peace talks in Madrid, came only a few days after reports that China may be helping Iran develop a nuclear bomb. 
 Clearly aware that his trip will re-ignite the debate between the Admministration and Democrats in Congress over how tough the United States should be in dealing with Beijing, Mr. Baker immediately took the offensive.
"China has almost one fourth of all the people in the world," he said, echoing Mr. Bush's argument that China, no matter how repressive its domestic policies, is simply too big to ignore. "It has nuclear weapons, it has great influence in the region and it has immense economic potential."
 
Invokes Human Rights
 Seeking to justify the timing of the trip, Mr. Baker said his mission was the only way of persuading Beijing to make changes in its arms control and human rights policies.
"We cannot make headway unless we discuss them," he said. "Ignoring them will not make the problems go away."
Mr. Baker's trip will also take him to Korea and Japan.
The Administration's policy toward China is widely believed to be governed by President Bush himself, who was the top-ranking American diplomat in Beijing in the mid-1970's.
It was Mr. Bush who dispatched thenational security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, on two secret trips to China in 1989, a decision that stirred wrath in Congress when the visits were disclosed late that year. Mr. Scowcroft made the first trip only a month after the killings of the -democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
 In addition to China's poor human rights record, American critics have assailed its reported sales of ballistic missiles to the Middle East and growing trade surplus with the United States. Tensions in the trade relationship have increased with reports that China uses prison labor to make cheap exports.
Negotiations about the possibility of a Baker visit are believed to have been under way for months, with the United States seeking specific assurances from Beijing that some kind of formal agreement could be reached during the visit. Most expectations focus on arms control accords.
 
Signing Arms Pacts
 During a visit in August by the Japanese Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, China said it would sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. During Mr. Baker's visit, it is possible that China will also declare its willingness to sign the Missile Technology Control Regime, an accord that curtails the transfer of medium-range missiles, or other agreements limiting the sale of conventional weapons.
Chinese leaders have pressed hard for a visit by Mr. Baker, who even journeyed to the tiny neighboring country of Mongolia in July without stopping in Beijing. China feels that Mr. Baker's visit would be an important propaganda victory, demonstrating China's continued importance in the new world order and Washington's willingness to work with its hard-line leadership to resolve the strains in their relationship.
While other foreign leaders are now regularly visiting Beijing -- albeit complaining each time about human rights violations -- Chinese officials have expressed frustration that ties with Washington are not improving. They argue that their relationship with Japan has been normalized and relations with Europe have "basically recovered" since the Tiananmen Square crackdown, and that only the United States has held back on repairing ties.
Aside from arms control, issues on Mr. Baker's agenda will presumably include trade and human rights. The Chinese now profess a willingness to discuss human rights in general, though they reject specific criticism as interference in their internal affairs. Mr. Baker may ask for assurances that certain dissidents or their family members will be allowed to travel to the United States.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Shopping as Soviets Offer To Sell Once-Secret Technology

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
The Soviet Union is marketing an array of secretive items from its space program -- things that no spies or reconnaissance satellites could have pried loose during the cold war -- and the United States is so interested that it is sending teams of bargain hunters to look at the merchandise.
Items on the block include nuclear reactors, satellites, rocket engines, space stations, plutonium for compact power sources and a host of scientific reports on space testing and experiments. The goods are seen as the cream of the Soviet industrial complex and in some cases are considered better than similar items in the West. 
 "Nobody ever contemplated that the Soviet military-industrial complex would end up in Chapter 11," said Russell Seitz, an associate at the Olin Center for Strategic Studies at Harvard University who monitors the Soviet activity. "It's the yard sale at the end of history."
 
Some Are Resisting
 Few sales have been completed so far, and some Government and military officials are resisting the idea.
But in an important change, Federal experts are now making secretive trips to Moscow and beyond to sample the merchandise, and interest in the Defense Department and Congress is running high. The White House has begun a high-level review of the policy issues surrounding any possible purchases.
"There is clearly a rising level of interest and activity," Dr. Richard L. Verga, a Pentagon official in charge of developing advanced technologies for the Administration's "Star Wars" anti-missile research program, said in an interview. "As the result of decades of investment, the Soviets have all kinds of equipment and technologies that might be of interest to us."
Dr. Verga said the Soviet goods were apparently being quietly marketed to many countries, not just the United States. "When you're in the hotel bar over there," he said, "the language at the next table is German, and at the next one over is Japanese."
Mr. Seitz of Harvard said a major problem was simply sorting through all the offerings, which in recent months have increased sharply. For the Soviets, any sales would result in an influx of hard currency and the satisfaction of having their technical work admired and acquired.
For the United States, the purchases would be a technical bonanza and would possibly help stabilize a rival superpower now on the brink of chaos. The Soviet predicament is seen as so dire that Congress is moving to transfer up to $1 billion from the Pentagon budget to give the Soviets food, medicine and technical aid on converting their industries to peaceful purposes.
The Soviet space enterprise is the world's largest and most active, forged in the cauldron of the cold war and surrounded by layers of secrecy. For decades its successes dazzled the world. Starting around 1987, amid pressure to become more self-reliant financially, Soviet officials in charge of the vast complex began trying to market a diverse line of goods and services.
But that effort largely failed, mainly because of the West's resistance. The United States, for instance, banned the launching of most American payloads atop Russian rockets, partly for reasons of national security and partly because it preferred to spend its space dollars at home to stimulate domestic industry.
The West's resolve, however, has recently begun to weaken. Early this year, the Pentagon announced that it intended to spend $12 million to buy an advanced Soviet nuclear reactor for generating power in space, similar to ones that have powered Soviet spy satellites. The aim is to learn about technology, since the United States has long studied that type of advanced reactor but has never built one.
Pentagon teams have made repeated trips to the Soviet Union in preparing for the deal. Dr. Verga said he last went there in July and saw sprawling reactor test installations, parts of which are up for sale, that could not be duplicated in the West for $1 billion.
 
Soviet Edge on Alloys
 The Soviet Union has lagged in many aspects of the world's technology revolution, especially those relating to computers and electronic miniaturization. But it is ahead in others. For instance, its scientists have mastered the manufacture of high-strength, high-temperature alloys that are virtually unknown in the West. These metals can be important in the design of advanced rocket engines and nuclear reactors, which generate tremendous heat.
The Air Force, tempted by such wares, has quietly made repeated inquiries about buying an advanced Soviet rocket engine known as the RD-170, said to be the most powerful liquid-fueled rocket engine in the world. The Soviets are eager to sell. An industry expert privy to the East-West negotiations said a major problem was a conflict in the American military over whether it was wise to aid a former adversary by making such a purchase.
"It's schizophrenic," said the expert, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Middle management will talk to the Soviets, who get all excited. But when it goes to the next step, upper management is not interested, leaving the Soviets up in the air. That's also a problem on the Soviet side. Middle management tries to cut a deal. But upper management says, 'Hey, we don't know anything about this.' Part of the problem on both side is lack of clear direction from the top."
Nonetheless, American interest is growing. A six-member team, led by Leonard Caveny, deputy director of innovative science and technology at the "Star Wars" program, the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, recently returned from a Soviet visit. It included two civilian scientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
The team went to the Institute of Thermal Processes, a military research and development center just outside Moscow, where they tested a very small but advanced space engine that uses magnetic fields instead of burning chemical fuels to move a spacecraft. Such a small engine could have many uses in the American space program for propelling satellites and payloads that have already been boosted into orbit.
 
'Very Moderately Priced'
 The Soviets are offering the device for $500,000 to $1 million. "It's very moderately priced," Mr. Caveny told Space News, an industry publication, in September before the visit.
In an interview last week, Dr. Verga, the Pentagon official, said that the results of tests by the American team "were quite favorable" and that interest in a purchase was growing.
Dr. Verga added that the engine was small enough to fit into the palm of a hand, and that the purchase price would include all associated flight hardware, such as equipment to condition the electricity that powers the device. "This kind of engine has been kicking around on paper in this country for 30 years, but never in space," he said. "The Soviets are actually flying these things."
So too, the Air Force is said to be interested in acquiring some secret Soviet data on the atmospheric effects of nuclear blasts, which has recently been put on the block. "They're selling everything," said an expert familiar with the negotiations.
The shopping spree, begun by the military, is beginning to attract others. Plans are under way for a large interagency team, including the Defense Department, the Energy Department and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to visit the Soviet Union to evaluate a host of high technologies.
So too, the Energy Department has reportedly obtained from the Soviets 27 grams, or less than an ounce, of plutonium 238, a radioactive chemical that emits heat and can be used to make electricity. A different isotope, plutonium 239, is used to build nuclear weapons. Compact power sources made with plutonium 238 are used on NASA's deep-space probes, although supplies of these sources in the United States are likely to run short in the near future because of problems in the nation's reactors that make plutonium.
The Albuquerque Journal reported yesterday that the Soviet plutonium had been obtained and analyzed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and been found to be of high quality. The Energy Department, it reported, is now weighing a purchase. The plutonium 238 would be used to power NASA space probes.
 
Congress Is Interested
 Congress, too, is interested in Soviet space goods. Representative Bob Traxler, the Michigan Democrat who heads the House subcommittee that oversees NASA's appropriations, and Representative Bill Green, a Manhattan Republican who is the subcommittee's ranking minority member, recently wrote NASA's Administrator to inquire about the technical feasibility of using the Soviet space station Mir or some part of it as a complement to the American program. The Soviet station is reportedly up for sale.
In an interview, Mr. Green said he had also made inquiries to Soviet diplomats about a possible purchase.
In its current issue, Space News reports that during the summit meeting in Moscow last summer, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave President Bush a document calling for an easing of trade restrictions to help the Soviet space industry. The White House is reportedly preparing a response.
With political pressures mounting to help the faltering Soviet economy, some Western experts see a growing chance for the success of East-West sales. But there is also much skepticism. Some officials fear that the swift pace of political change in the Soviet Union and the sense of impending chaos make it impossible to know who will be in charge in a few months to see any deals through.
 
U.S. Manufacturers Resist
 Moreover, there is resistance to sales by American space manufacturers, who have been battered by a global recession in space sales and a sputtering economy at home.
Adm. Richard H. Truly, NASA's Administrator, gave voice to such apprehensions in writing to Representative Green on Oct. 23 to discuss possible purchases of Soviet goods.
"The Administration is intensely concerned about the health and capabilities of the U.S. aerospace industry," Admiral Truly wrote. "Depending on the specific case, procuring a Soviet system or technology in place of a procurement from U.S. industry may or may not be in the overall national interest."
While the Administration will consider purchases, Admiral Truly said, it is unlikely that movement in that direction will occur quickly. "We do not anticipate any precipitate or speedy actions in this regard," he wrote.

HEADLINE: Louisiana Governor's Race Becomes Debate on the Past

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 3

 BODY:
While State Representative David Duke styled himself as the candidate of change and former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards talked of being able to unify disparate interests, the main thing the two men running for Governor in Louisiana did Saturday night in their first televised debate was to exchange accusations about their pasts.
At the end of the hourlong confrontation, Mr. Duke had a slight edge on the number of attacks. He repeatedly accused Mr. Edwards, who served three terms as Governor, of selling state jobs "three and four times over" to win support. 
 In his closing, Mr. Duke, who is running as a Republican, held up a sheaf of papers that he said were copies of pardons signed by Mr. Edwards and said, "Some said that he sold these pardons, but I don't know whether he sold them or gave them away."
 
Answering Duke
 Mr. Edwards, 64 years old, gave as good as he got. At one point Mr. Duke, 41, dismissed the worries of the business community and state tourism officials that his background as a former Ku Klux Klan official and neo-Nazi could scare away business, tourist and conventions; he said similar fears were expressed before the elections of men like George Wallace in Alabama and Lester Maddox in Georgia.
Mr. Edwards replied: "I think it is very interesting that my opponent identifies himself with the politics of the past in naming Lester Maddox of Georgia and George Wallace. The wrong signal at this time could cost this state 45,000 jobs and $1.8 billion in economic recovery if we don't get in step with the rest of the nation."
The slashing in the debate is likely to be seen increasingly in the two weeks remaining before the election, as interest groups express concerns about Mr. Duke's extremist ties and about the past of Mr. Edwards, who has been accused, though never convicted, of political corruption.
One such group, the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism, which was formed to counter Mr. Duke's bid for the United States Senate in 1990, began an advertising campaign today with a full page in The Times-Picayune in New Orleans that quotes racist and anti-Semitic statements it says were made by Mr. Duke in the last six years.
Lance Hill, director of the group, said in an interview that it was important to show that Mr. Duke's views reminiscent of Nazism were not mistakes of his youth, as he often argues, but are indicative of his current attitudes.
"Many argue that we are confronted with two bad choices," the advertisement said. "But there is a considerable difference between good ole boy politics and genocide."
 
From Fringe to Spotlight
 Mr. Duke and Mr. Edwards were the top vote getters in a 12-candidate primary last month and will face each other in a runoff on Nov. 16.
Edward Renwick, director of the Loyola University Institute of Politics here who conducts polls for local news organizations, said neither candidate had scored a knockout in the debate. Mr. Duke seemed "more strident," he said, while the usually flamboyant Mr. Edwards was "more conciliatory."
Democratic strategists here say that demeanor was intended for Mr. Edwards to attract the reform-minded supporters of Gov. Buddy Roemer, who switched from Democrat to Republican earlier this year but who did not win enough votes in the primary to advance to the run-off.
James Carvin, a political consultant here, said he had worked with business groups to produce advertising for Mr. Edwards that expressed fears about what a Duke victory would do to tourism, investment, the convention trade and big-ticket sporting events. "I think there will be a half a dozen groups doing such ads," said Mr. Hill, of the Coalition Against Racism and Nazism.

HEADLINE: '90 Pact Failing To Curb Deficit, Lawmakers Say

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3

 BODY:
Members of Congress say that last year's budget agreement, despite its heralded promise to reduce the Federal deficit, has given them virtual license to disregard a deficit that has swollen to its highest level ever.
The budget agreement, reached a year ago by Congressional leaders and the Bush Administration, imposed new fiscal discipline on Congress, requiring it to pay for new spending with tax increases or spending cuts elsewhere. And it included yearly targets for the size of the deficit. 
 But there is no immediate penalty for missing the target, and lawmakers and economists say it has become almost meaningless.
The agreement did not require the Government to find savings to offset the extra costs of unemployment insurance, food stamps and other benefits arising from the recession, or the huge cost of protecting depositors at Government-insured financial institutions.
 
No Alarms Sounded
 As a result, there was virtually no reaction here when the Treasury reported last week that the deficit for the last fiscal year had surpassed all records, at $268.7 billion, a figure that reflects the extra costs of public assistance and the savings and loan bailout. Neither at the White House nor in Congress did anyone publicly express alarm.
"The age of no-fault budgeting has arrived," said Allen Schick, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, who has studied the budget-making process for many years. "Nobody is to blame for the deficit, and nobody has to do anything about it. Last year's agreement has paralyzed the Federal budget process and frozen budget priorities."
And Representative Bill Gradison of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, said: "The budget agreement has nothing to do with the deficit. It abandons meaningful annual deficit goals which we had under the Gramm-Rudman law." As originally passed in 1985, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law was supposed to balance the budget in the fiscal year 1991, which just ended.
As the nation heads into a Presidential election year haunted by an anemic economy, conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats alike are agitating for changes in the budget agreement, including tax cuts to stimulate economic growth. But major changes in the agreement appear highly unlikely this year because there is no consensus in either party, much less between the two parties. Thus, lawmakers say, if the budget deal is reopened, the negotiations are just as likely to produce a political stalemate as an economic elixir.
Many Democrats and Republicans praise the agreement and say the deficit would be even bigger without it -- more than $300 billion in the year just ended, rather than the $268.7 billion actually recorded.
Representative Leon E. Panetta, Democrat of California, chairman of the House Budget Committee, described the agreement as "one of the most important fiscal disciplines that we've put in place in more than a decade."
And Representative Gradison said: "I voted against the budget agreement because it didn't promise sufficient deficit reduction. But I've become one of its strongest supporters because every alternative I see as worse."
 
More Than a Statistic
 The Federal budget deficit is more than just a statistic. Many economists, including Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, say that increases in the deficit adversely affect the American standard of living because they reduce funds available for private savings and productive investment by businesses and households.
When President Bush signed the budget bill on Nov. 5, 1990, he said it was "the centerpiece of the largest deficit reduction package in history." The deal was supposed to reduce the deficit by $482 billion over five years, one-third through tax increases and most of the remainder through spending restraint.
But since the package was adopted, official projections of the total deficit for 1991 through 1995 have increased 70 percent, to $1.3 trillion. The figure for the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, shot up $100 billion. The Congressional Budget Office now estimates the 1992 deficit at $362 billion, up from its estimate of $262 billion in December 1990.
"Those deficit-reduction measures, while very significant, did no more than keep the problem from getting a lot worse," said Mr. Reischauer, of the Congressional Budget Office.
In the fiscal year just ended, Federal spending for unemployment insurance benefits increased 40 percent, reaching $28.4 billion. The cost of the food stamp program rose 23 percent, to $19.6 billion. Medicaid spending, to finance health care for low-income people, rose 28 percent, to $52.5 billion. Cash assistance to the elderly, blind and disabled, under the Supplemental Security Income program, increased 23 percent, to $15.5 billion.
While increases like these are not limited by the 1990 budget agreement, Congress has found several ways to get around the fiscal constraints that do apply. In passing appropriations bills, it often stipulates that Federal officials may not make commitments to spend money until September 1992, so the outlays will not count against the limits for the current fiscal year. Congress has also tried to get around the limits by labeling appropriations as "emergency requirements," though Mr. Bush often refuses to go along with that designation.
Still, Congress has generally adhered to the spending constraints, to the surprise of many here. On three occasions this year, the Senate has decisively rejected proposals to suspend the budget agreement because of the recession, and no such proposal has reached the floor of the House.
 
Concerns About Flexibility
 Mr. Panetta and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Jim Sasser of Tennessee, have defended the agreement even when they sympathized with Democratic efforts to undo it by shifting money from the Pentagon to programs aiding poor children. "We have adhered to the caps on spending that were established by the law, and we have adhered to its pay-as-you-go requirements," said Mr. Panetta.
There is growing concern that the spending limits in the agreement are too inflexible because they do not allow the Government to respond to changing priorities or new developments. The agreement, intended to last five years, is likely to be renegotiated in 1993, or perhaps earlier if the economy remains weak.
Senator Bob Kasten, Republican of Wisconsin, called last week for "abandoning the 1990 budget agreement to take into account the recent economic downturn." Another Republican, Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota, said the agreement was "a failure because it hasn't helped the economy and hasn't reduced the deficit."
Democrats on Capitol Hill have repeatedly tried to breach spending limits in the budget agreement to provide extended unemployment benefits to jobless workers without cutting other programs.
And others have spoken of reducing Pentagon spending. "If we could have foreseen this year's events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union," said Representative Anthony C. Beilenson, Democrat of California, "we would likely have set a lower spending cap for defense programs."

HEADLINE: As Maine Voters Cut Back Spending, Police Force May Go From 1 to None

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STOCKTON SPRINGS, Me., Nov. 1

 BODY:
Ted Reed, the police chief in this rundown town of weatherbeaten houses by Penobscot Bay, now exists on a salary made up of donations. His old cruiser runs on gasoline provided by a garage owner.
Chief Reed's plight has been brought about by growing anger among the town's 1,383 residents over the recession and rising property taxes. In September they voted to do away with their one-man police force, and the drive stalled temporarily only after some townspeople took up a door-to-door collection to keep Chief Reed on the job. 
 On Tuesday the question will be settled by a referendum. If the vote goes against keeping the Chief, the town will have to fall back on the county sheriff's office and the state police. Tempers are running high.
 
Familial Insults
 At a selectmen's meeting on Thursday night, with beige quilts covering the windows to keep the cold out of the unheated room, members of the audience insulted each other's families and one burly man poked his finger in another's face. Afterwards, Parker Gray, the head selectman, summed up the sentiments: "If you took these same parties and put them in a bar, with a couple of .38's, I think you can imagine what kind of problem you'd have."
Although the amount of money at stake here is small -- it would cost $4,000 to keep Chief Reed and his patrol car operating till the end of the year -- the issue touches a raw nerve in Maine, where the economy has been declining and frustration over taxes has been building for two or three years, especially in poor rural areas.
Similar concerns led two other towns in Maine to eliminate their police forces last summer. In one, Lebanon, a town of 4,300 people in the southwest near the New Hampshire border, an 18-year-old security guard at a campground was stabbed to death while trying to stop a break-in shortly after residents voted to abolish the town's seven-member police force in July.
Some local and state authorities worry that more communities will follow suit next spring at their annual town meetings, New England's traditional form of town government in which financial and other major decisions are made by a vote of those attending. "Our small towns see their police departments as discretionary spending; it's not like it is in big cities where crime is a big threat," said Jim Damicis of the Maine Municipal Association.
These towns are counting on their county sheriffs and the state police to take over the duties of their police forces, Mr. Damicis said. But the sheriffs and the state police have been hit by budget cuts of their own and are concerned that they may not be able to provide adequate assistance.
Col. Andrew E. Demers, head of the Maine State Police, said, "If there are any more cuts, I am afraid there will be a point where we'll have to decide what we can do and what we can't."
 
Town Business and Feuds
 In Stockton Springs, the battle over whether to keep the Chief's job is typical of the fights elsewhere in Maine, and, as is true of small-town tussles, it is spiced with local feuds.
The conflict began at the town meeting last March when Mr. Gray, newly elected as head selectman, proposed a Police Department budget of $22,000, including Mr. Reed's salary, gasoline and maintenance for his cruiser. That was $9,000 less than was spent the previous year.
Mr. Gray said he believed that the department was simply too expensive. "People were in a cutting mood," he recalled. They had just watched as their property taxes were re-evaluated, with the valuation on some waterfront land jumping to more than $100,000 an acre from $3,000.
Mr. Gray offered the Chief an option: Take a cut in his $440-a-week pay, or face elimination of his job when money ran out in September.
Chief Reed, a blunt-spoken 56-year-old man who some people here say "would arrest his own mother," took his chances, reckoning that come September the citizens would vote to draw enough money from the town's general fund to cover his expenses.
But at a special town meeting on Sept. 26, after two disputed ballots, the decision was no, by four votes.
Ed Marshall, a retired 69-year-old traveling salesman who voted to extend Chief Reed's pay, said: "We all felt sick when we left the meeting. I tossed and turned all night."
Mr. Marshall said he remembered what it was like when Stockton Springs, a working-class town of clam diggers and mill hands, did not have a policeman. He lives across the street from the local school, and he recalled young people gathering there, drinking and swearing and breaking into the buses.
 
The Drive for Donations
 So Mr. Marshall and some friends came up with a plan. The next week, at the selectmen's meeting, after Chief Reed's job was terminated, Mr. Marshall's group asked if the Chief could be kept on with contributions. The answer was a grudging yes, and so the Chief was rehired a few minutes later.
In the next two days Mr. Marshall's group raised $2,000 for their police officer. Mr. Marshall's team also circulated a petition, getting 242 signatures, seeking a referendum on Election Day that would have the town pay the rest of Chief Reed's expenses until the end of the year. That way, under Maine's form of government, the Chief would automatically be kept on three more months, until the next annual meeting. Perhaps then, Mr. Marshall thought, the town would come to its senses.
But Manly Shute, a barrel-chested carpenter and lobsterman, was angered by the donations scheme and the referendum. He saw the donations as a trick, because it forced the town to continue paying the Chief's insurance.
 
'They Don't Give a Darn'
 "I'm not against the officer personally," Mr. Shute said in an interview. "It's just that it's the poor people who keep paying and they don't give a darn about the poor people."
So Mr. Shute began gathering signatures for another petition, which he presented at the selectmen's meeting on Thursday, calling on the town to stop the donations plan.
At the meeting, one supporter of Chief Reed shouted at Mr. Shute, "Your problem is, your name is Shute" in a derogatory reference to Mr. Shute's large clan of relatives in town.
Mr. Marshall tried to quiet the dispute. "Let's not get into this," he said. "This is a good town."
Mr. Shute replied, "Well, it was."
It was Halloween, and as the angry participants, including Mr. Reed, left Town Hall, they noticed his cruiser. It had been splattered with eggs.

HEADLINE: Motorists Are Still Shunning Car Pools: They Want to Be Alone

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Every weekday, Janet Perkins commutes between her home in Fairfield, Conn., and her job 15 miles away in Greenwich, blissfully alone in her car and clearly not doing her part to reduce traffic congestion on Interstate 95. The very picture of someone who ought to be car pooling.
Tell her about it. 
 "I quit car pooling because the people I commuted with were total geeks and I began to loathe every moment I spent with them," said Ms. Perkins, a 32-year-old software engineer. "One guy in the car pool picked his nose constantly, and another woman used to sit in the corner and read comic books and shriek with laughter. I couldn't take it any more."
Ms. Perkins is not alone in her drive-time solitude. Car pooling, long promoted as a remedy for worsening traffic, has simply failed to catch on in the New York metropolitan region despite a decade-long campaign to persuade people to double, triple and even quadruple up in the interest of reducing traffic congestion and pollution.
 
Why They Won't
 The reasons are many, and maybe predictable. Some commuters drive alone because they want to be able to leave work early or stay late and not be bothered by someone else's schedule.
Some want their own cars on hand so that they can run errands at lunch, or depart immediately in case of family emergencies.
Some want to listen to their favorite radio stations.
Some want to be able to smoke.
Some want to drive as fast, or as slow, as they please.
And some, if not most, find the notion of car pooling to be, at bottom, positively alien to their unfettered, get-in-the-car-and-go American individualism.
According to surveys conducted by transportation agencies in the metropolitan area, 85 to 90 percent of commuters who take cars to work in the region are driving by themselves. The figures were borne out in interviews recently with commuters in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, almost all of whom said they had never joined a car pool. Nationwide, the number of people who car pool has been declining over the past decade. In 1980, 33 percent of commuters who drove to work participated in car pools, compared with 22 percent in 1990, according to Commuter Transportation Services, a nonprofit transportation management company.
Commuters like Isabella Tandy, an executive secretary for TransAmerica Leasing in White Plains, say driving alone is an escape. "Commuting is the only time in my life when I am really alone," Ms. Tandy said. "In the morning I listen to traffic reports while I am driving, but not at night. That's decompression time."
For another woman, who would not identify herself, driving alone has psychological benefits. "I feel nervous about driving with other people in the car," she said. "I'm phobic, and I do not feel guilty about it."
The woman, who works for a direct mail company at the Schulman Office Park in White Plains, said she recently learned that a worker in the next office building lives near her in New Rochelle, so she felt compelled to suggest a car pool.
"She said no," the woman recalled. "I was so relieved."
 
Where They Are
 Most highway commuters in the region work in clusters of businesses and office parks that have sprung up along major roads in Westchester County, on Long Island, in Fairfield County in Connecticut and in Bergen, Passaic, Morris and other northern New Jersey counties.
As populations in these suburbs soared in the late 1970's and 1980's, creating traffic tie-ups on highways and back roads that were not designed to handle the sharp increase in cars, transportation officials looked to car pooling, van pooling and mass transit to help relieve congestion.
But that has not happened, mainly because there are no significant incentives for people to give up the convenience and flexibility of driving their own cars to work, transportation officials say.
"The jury is still out on car pooling," said Jeffrey M. Zupan, a senior fellow at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit research organization. "It can work and help reduce traffic but not until we come up with new ways to make it more appealing to the average commuter."
A recent study by the planning association found that many car pools are disrupted when riders change jobs or residences. Half of all Americans change jobs or move every five years, the planning association said.
 
Why They Like It
 Despite the odds and the widespread preference for riding solo, not all commuters are averse to car pooling. Some say it saves them money on parking, gas and tolls. Others, worried about air pollution, say ride-sharing is simply the right thing to do. And still others say they enjoy the company and conversation.
Ray Anderson, Edward Battistelli and Robert Hamm have been commuting from their homes in Fairfield to their research jobs at American Cyanamid in Stamford for 20 years.
"The reason we have stayed together so long is that we have very lax car-pooling rules," Mr. Anderson said. "Some car pools have very complicated formulas that they use to determine how many times a week a person drives, and what can and cannot be done in the car, but we just relax and do whatever we like."
Some commuters who car pool are not all that happy about it. Vincent Carr and Cosburth Quailey, tax accountants for TransAmerica Leasing, drive a blue van along with three other employees from their homes in Queens to the White Plains office. They park the van in a preferred parking space, and are reimbursed by the company for gas and toll costs.
 
They Have No Choice
 Despite the free ride, both Mr. Carr and Mr. Quailey said that they would prefer to drive alone. "It's very tiring, and it's very stressful," Mr. Quailey said of ride sharing. The five car poolers must be ready to leave at 6:30 A.M. and most do not return home before 8:00 P.M. "We have to do it because it's a condition of the job," Mr. Quailey added, referring to an agreement the car poolers made with TransAmerica when the company moved its offices to White Plains.
Eric B. Langeloh, Commissioner of Transportation for Westchester County, said that a recent study of traffic congestion on the Cross-Westchester Expressway found that there are few local incentives to car pool.
"Car pools work but they must be made to work better," Mr. Langeloh said, calling for economic incentives like cheaper tolls for group rides.
Dee Angell, president of Metropool Inc., a nonprofit company that helps commuters and companies form employee car pools in Southwestern Connecticut and the Lower Hudson Valley region of New York, said, "We will not see a significant increase in car pooling until we make driving alone so costly and unfavorable that people only do it in extreme circumstances."
 
Cost Savings
 Car pooling already has many advantages that are often discounted or go unnoticed, she said. For example, Metropool estimates that a person driving alone pays about $300 a month in driving costs to travel 55 miles round trip. The same commute would cost the members of a two-person car pool about $150 each, the company said.
Car pooling also reduces the stress of daily commuting and saves on personal car maintenance and insurance. Metropool operates a referral service for commuters who wish to form car pools and distributes a registry of commuters looking for car poolers.
Despite the advantages, many still resist car pooling. One woman, a data processor who works at the Schulman Office Park in White Plains, said that she has considered car pooling but that she continues to drive alone.
"I'm free to get away from the office," said the woman, who refused to give her name. "I'm free to go home early. I'm basically free."

HEADLINE: Ogata Journal;
Japan's Unlikely Rebels: The Fabled Rice Farmers

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OGATA, Japan

 BODY:
When this village on the edge of the Japan Sea was created as a giant national experiment 25 years ago, it was called frontier land in a nation with no frontiers.
Farmers were lured from all over the country with promises of vast, cheap land and a stake in a new Japan. It was here, they were told, that the Japanese would teach themselves how to rival America's biggest farms and ease the country's perpetual worries about its over-reliance on foreign-grown food. 
 It did not turn out that way. In the new Japan, fiber optics and computers proved a lot more important than rice and soybeans. A generation of Japanese fed on McDonald's hamburgers eat far less rice than their parents did, and now Japan produces much more rice than it can consume. And that has started a series of events that have transformed Ogata from a rural utopia into a bitterly divided community.
At its core, the argument centers on those who think the Japanese Government is saving the fabled Japanese rice farmer -- descendants of the men extolled in song and swathed in nationalistic myths -- and those who think it is dooming him to extinction.
 
Farmers Flout the Law
 Ogata is the site of a rice rebellion, one Tokyo is eager to put down before it spreads throughout the country.
Nearly half the farmers here have openly flouted the law that requires them to keep their rice production within strict quotas and to sell their entire crop to the Government, at Government-set prices. It is then sold to long-suffering consumers at upward of four or five times the world market price.
Until now, the price-fixing system has worked because Japan has imposed a ban on all foreign rice, a perennial irritant in its relations with the United States.
But on the edge of town here, Kyoji Suzuki and his fellow farmers have decided to produce as much rice as they want and sell it for whatever they can. "We've lived under the thumb of the Government for years now," Mr. Suzuki said the other day, while his colleagues bagged their rice for direct delivery to their customers, evading the Government system. "We've had enough."
Last year, Mr. Suzuki said, his band of rebel farmers sold $4 million worth of rice, despite what he called a campaign of harassment by Government agents."
Grass-roots rebellions of any kind are rare in Japan, and not surprisingly Mr. Suzuki has not quite got the hang of being a free marketeer. His rice is scarcely any cheaper than the Government's, and he is not eager for foreign competition either. But price is not the issue, he says. He argues that the real problem is that Japan's overregulated agricultural markets are an example of economic planning gone wild.
 
Diplomats Are Interested
 He and his friends are getting a lot of visitors lately who agree, mostly from foreign embassies in Tokyo. The diplomats are drawn here because they see the Ogata rebellion as evidence for their case that Japan must give in to the inevitable, and crack open its market for rice.
It is a move being desperately opposed by farmers, the Agriculture Ministry and the many politicians who depend heavily on Japan's extraordinarily influential farm vote.
If Japan sticks to its position, many here fear, it will be blamed for scuttling the global trade talks known as GATT -- something that Japanese officials fear as much as farmers' protests. The new Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, has hinted recently that he will continue Japan's hard line against opening the rice market.
Among the many disputes that trouble relations between America and Japan, rice can seem pretty trivial. Measured in dollars, it pales next to automobiles or supercomputers, and one could argue that it is hardly worth the passion expended by either side. But it is futile to argue that point here: The Government has promoted much of the mythology about how Japan has long fed its own and how its "food security" would be threatened by imports.
 
'Spitting Into the Heavens'
 Here in Ogata, the farmers who have abided by Japan's rules say foreigners and next-door-neighbors alike are risking the ruin of rural Japan.
"They are spitting into the heavens, and it will fall back on them," said Seiki Miyata, the Mayor of Ogata, which was created by filling in Japan's second largest lake. "Japan is not prepared to liberalize these markets. If we do, it will destroy rice growing, and with it all of our villages and our towns."
In truth, Japan's farming villages and towns are fading out already. At the agricultural high school in Akita, there were 286 graduates in March. "Forty-seven of them went to university," the principal, Yoshimitsu Ikeda, said the other day. "The rest went to work. But the number who started to work as farmers is zero."
Eventually some of those will drift back to agriculture if they take over the family farms. But they hesitate. "We try not to say we will be farmers, because the image is not so good," said Takashi Tamura, a student at the school. "We're told it is not so easy to find a wife."
Meanwhile, in the country that celebrates "wa," or harmony, Ogata remains a decidely unharmonious place. At the new year's party, opposing groups will not eat at the same table.
"We have two villages really, existing side by side," says Shinichiro Sakamoto, one of those who has vociferously argued against opening the market. "These days, we don't talk to each other very much."

HEADLINE: Revising Budget Plan, Mayor Scrambles to Balance Taxes and Services

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Two days before Mayor David N. Dinkins must submit a four-year budget plan, a stiff warning from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo not to count on too much help from a state takeover of Medicaid costs has left the Mayor struggling to decide how and whether he can freeze property taxes, protect services and salvage his political standing.
Mr. Dinkins is to present the plan Wednesday and much is riding on its reception, including a potential $1 billion aid package from the Municipal Assistance Corporation that could ease the pain of service cuts or reduce the need for new taxes. 
Last week, senior mayoral aides said they hoped to freeze property taxes for at least two years to stabilize the economy and quell a growing chorus of demands from business groups and the City Council. But this plan would also assume nearly $1 billion in help from a state takeover of Medicaid by 1995, roughly twice what Mr. Cuomo had proposed.
 
Boon for the City
 The Governor's original proposal is already under attack by the Republican-led State Senate, which sees it as too big a boon for the city, and on Friday, Mr. Cuomo told the city that it should not ask for more.
"I don't see any reasonable possibility of additional money," Mr. Cuomo said. "It's not a question of the desirability of giving the city that money. But it seems to me as a simple practical proposition that they cannot reliably include that money in their plan. If they do, it will threaten the reliability of the entire plan."
As chairman of the State Financial Control Board, to which Mr. Dinkins must submit the plan, Mr. Cuomo will be one of the chief judges of its credibility. Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, has repeatedly said he wants assurances from the Control Board that the plan balances the city's recurring revenues and expenditures before agreeing to provide the $1 billion in aid through refinancing corporation bonds.
 
Series of Meetings
 All that led city officials, in a series of meetings over the weekend, to reassess their plans on the speed of the state's takeover of Medicaid costs and to review a complex array of options, including financing bridge maintenance or garbage collection through a mix of fees or new tolls. They hope to reach final decisions by today.
"We've got to figure out all these variables," the city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, said last night. "It's hard to hold one steady while the other three are moving."
Mr. Cuomo has his own worries. His aides say he will probably not reveal his intentions on seeking the Presidency until he sees the city's plan and his own budget division's blueprint for closing a $689 million gap in the current state budget. In making his comments on Medicaid, they say, he was warning that any attempt by the city to speed up a takeover could doom the effort to failure with the Legislature.
 
Seeking Support
 But mayoral aides say they are most worried about the first two years of the plan, which cover the rest of Mr. Dinkins's term, and they believe there is room to argue over the last two years. And the Governor is not the only player from whom they want support.
They have also courted the support of the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, for creating new bridge or garbage authorities, as a way of extending the tax freeze Mr. Vallone wants.
Mr. Vallone's aides say he will not support any move that leads to tolls on the East River bridges that are now free, or that means fees for garbage pickups. But he has not ruled out some kind of new auto-use fees or other revenue plan, like diverting money from the state bottle-deposit, to pay for such needs.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Seeks New Environmental Fund to Aid Economy

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, L.I., Nov. 3

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo will propose the establishment of a special state fund to pay for tens of millions of dollars of water, sewage and other environmental improvements on Long Island, as part of a new state effort to rebuild the region's faltering economy, administration officials said today.
The environmental fund, the officials said, will be part of a broader plan to speed up public works projects immediately, to work on long-term development of airports, roads and ferry service, and to help Long Island cope with its rising unemployment and faltering defense industries. Mr. Cuomo is scheduled to unveil the plan next week. 
 In an interview today, the Governor declined to discuss the details of his plans, but he said it was the natural extension of a $7.8 billion plan for job creation and ecnonomic development in New York City that he proposed in September in New York City. These packages would be followed by similiar efforts across the state.
"This is statewide, it is not New York City, it is not Long Island," he said. "We have to go around the state and see how we can prod the economy. This is not a reaction to anything, except the recession, and the failure of Washington to do anything for us."
Mr. Cuomo dismissed suggestions that the plan was shaped in part to show he was on top of New York's economic problems as he ponders a race for President in which the suburbs are apt to be a key battleground.
"You don't plan an economic and fiscal plan for every part of the state just so you have a quick answer in the political department," he said.
Business leaders and environmentalists on Long Island, as elsewhere, have long been at war over many issues, from nuclear power plants to highway expansion, and Mr. Cuomo's plan is clearly seeking to meet the concerns of both groups.
Among the projects to be included in the Long Island plan, officials said, was speeded-up construction of a $110 million widening of the Long Island expressway and state support for a new freight jetport at Calverton that could be linked to a high-speed ferry to transport the freight across Long Island Sound. Details of some of the projects were reported in Newsday last week.
But state officials said that the plan would be a "broader blueprint" than support for economic development projects. They said it would include programs to improve schools and parks, protect undeveloped land and help local governments cope with fiscal problems brought on by the recession.
It was not immediately clear where New York State would find the money to finance the special fund. Officials said that among the sources being considered were admission fees from state beaches and parks on Long Island -- which produced a surplus last year -- and leftover bonding authority from a 1986 environmental bond issue.
Asked about the Governor's proposal, State Senator James J. Lack, an East Northport Republican, said that Long Island legislators of both major parties had already called for legislation dedicating state park fees for parks, after the state threatened to close Robert Moses State Park earlier this year. "All these inclinations by the Governor are always welcome," he said. "But like the nine years of his governorship, they are long on perceptions short on substance."
Richard Amper, executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, an environmental group, applauded the Governor's environmental initiatives, but he noted that the proposed freight jetport would be in the middle of the enviromentally sensitive pine barrens that are critical to maintaining water quality on Long Island.

HEADLINE: Lure Talent, Urban Experts Tell New York

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Manhattan remains the economic engine of the metropolitan region, but New York City is misdirecting its development efforts in a futile drive to retain traditional factories and back offices, a new study has found.
With the regional economy reeling from the recession, the study's authors say the city is wasting much of the hundreds of millions of dollars it offers each year in development incentives by directing such a large proportion to the real-estate industry. 
 Instead, it should concentrate on the true sources of future growth by reinforcing the city's role as a center of brainpower and talent, the authors, two New York University urban affairs experts, say.
The authors, Hugh O'Neill, a senior researcher, and Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at N.Y.U., wrote the report, "Reinventing New York," for the Andrew W. Mellon and Charles H. Revson foundations. It is to be formally released today.
 
Magnet for 'Intellectual Capital'
 City officials, who have yet to see the report, concede that their development program often focuses on retaining offices and factories. Yet they say they have little choice but to do all they can to preserve jobs, especially in a depressed economy.
The report says Manhattan is crucial to the region's economic future because it is a magnet to individuals and companies at the cutting edge of their industries. The city is not just a financial center, the report says -- it is the place to be for law firms, publishing houses, advertising and media companies, architects, fashion designers, actors and painters.
That mass of what Mr. Moss and Mr. O'Neill call "intellectual capital" creates about one-quarter of all the jobs in the region, the report estimates, and in turn creates demand for local services: grocery stores, dry cleaners, copy shops, messenger services and so on. Those industries generate about half the region's jobs.
The report argues that New York City should be concentrating on vocational training and investments that will bolster its position as a center of intellectual capital. Instead, the city has funneled its economic incentives to real-estate developers and manufacturers and to financial firms that are considering moving their back offices out of the city.
 
No Need for More Offices
 Yet the last thing the city needs now is more office space, the authors say. As for companies that mass-produce goods and services, the experts conclude that since they compete on the basis of cost, they are almost inevitably going to leave New York anyway. As Mr. Moss and Mr. O'Neill point out, "routine production," which generates just 20 percent of the city's jobs, has been declining in both good times and bad.
Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Moss argue that no matter how humane the city's economic development strategies may have been intended to be, they have not helped those at the bottom. From 1979 to 1989, their report states, average family income for the poorest fifth of New York City's families fell by 30 percent, adjusted for inflation, while the incomes in the poorest fifth within the larger region fell by 18 percent.
The authors say officials in the region should spend money on job training, should invest more in the region's airports, and should encourage foreign companies to establish research and development divisions.
The report also argues that the city needs to invest more in telecommunications, because its leadership is being eroded by investments elsewhere. And instead of cutting back its support for cultural institutions, New York should increase it, and acknowledge its role not as a frill for the rich but as a vital ingredient in economic development, the report says.
 
Dealing With the Short Term
 "Our assets are quite strong," said Mr. Moss, "but we don't invest in them." Mr. O'Neill added that in the last fiscal year the city provided economic development incentives to businesses valued at $700 million, more than $500 million of which was directed to the real-estate industry.
Although city officials call those numbers overstated, Mr. O'Neill argues that whatever the number, "If there's a single major change in emphasis, it should be away from subsidizing and providing tax abatements for the real-estate industry and towards investing in human resources and certain types of infrastructure."
Easy to say, says the city's deputy mayor for economic development, Sally Hernandez-Pinero. While she said she agreed with a number of the recommendations in the report, which she had not seen, she said that government does not have the luxury of thinking about just long-term strategy. Instead, she said, government has to deal with more immediate issues, like job preservation, when the private economy is so weak.
"I'm not foolish enough to think that we can keep those jobs here forever," she said. But she emphasized the social and political implications of just letting them go. "These are folks who, if they are not working, might be very expensive for the city to support," she said.

HEADLINE: Bumpy Ride for C.I.A. in Effort to Hire Minorities

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3

 BODY:
As the Central Intelligence Agency struggles to catch up to a changing world while simultaneously changing its image, one of its major tasks is attracting the right people to do the job.
But its first post-cold war recruiting campaign -- a full-page advertisement in Ebony magazine to lure black Americans into the traditionally white intelligence world -- has met with brickbats from lawmakers and prominent blacks. 
 "Wouldn't you want to know if U.S. territory was going to be invaded?" the headline reads in an ominous, decidedly pre-new-world-order tone.
A color photo shows a gray-haired black woman sitting on the stoop of a well-kept brownstone graced with windowboxes of flowers, a black boy maneuvering on a skateboard and three black girls jumping rope. "The thought of a gang wreaking havoc to your neighborhood is disturbing," reads the text. "Not to mention frightening. Of course you'd want to know if you could stop them way ahead of time. It's the same way for the President when it comes to America's security. And that's why he depends on the country's largest information network -- the Central Intelligence Agency."
 
Harsh Response
 For years, the C.I.A. has run recruiting advertisements, usually somber blocks of type in publications as varied as The Wall Street Journal and Air Force Times. But the agency's first foray into glossy full-color has evoked a response unprecedented in its harshness.
"African-Americans have fought long and hard for full participation in American society and in that sense the ad is a welcome reflection of that acceptance," said Wade Henderson, Washington director for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. "But its message is simplistic and ambiguous, particularly given the C.I.A.'s history in Africa and in Latin America, and the fact that the world is no longer dominated by Communism."
Senator David L. Boren, the usually cautious Oklahoma Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, put it more bluntly: "Invaded? That's not something we think is about to happen. It's a scare tactic thing that I do not approve of. If they had some black people in decision-making roles out there, they would know better."
The C.I.A. asserts that the Ebony advertisement, developed by the black-owned Mingo Group in New York for $50,000 and published in the 1.8 million circulation magazine for an additional $34,000, illustrates its enlightened approach in trying to hire minorities. "Black agency employees were very much involved in developing the ad and in the decision to go with it," said Mark Mansfield, a C.I.A. spokesman. "The feedback we're getting is that it's an innovative ad, an ad that will enhance our recruiting efforts."
 
A New Breed of Employee
 Hiring blacks and other minorities is not the only recruiting problem the C.I.A. faces. Instead of armies of political analysts to analyze the Kremlin and Soviet weapon systems, the agency now needs engineers who can develop intelligence collection systems, bankers to carry out technical financial investigations, physicists to analyze nuclear, chemical and biological proliferation and linguists to understand better what people are saying, said Eugene J. Horan, the C.I.A.'s director for employment.
In his confirmation hearings before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Robert M. Gates, President Bush's nominee for Director of Central Intelligence, also said the agency must dramatically expand its "clandestine human intelligence effort" by installing more secret operatives around the world to run informants, penetrate societies and ferret out political intentions. Unfortunately, training such people in languages and steeping them in cultures takes years.
Adm. Bobby Ray Inman, the former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, said at the hearings that the agency could not "go out and easily hire people who've got a language capacity in Uzbek."
Recruiting priorities are complicated by dramatic budgetary cutbacks that are forcing a 60 percent reduction in hiring and a 15 percent reduction in the work force over the next six years. Agency recruiters still visit college campuses, despite isolated campaigns to eject them, although budget cuts have meant that last year they visited only 250 campuses, as against 450 the year before.
"The agency is going to take massive cuts," Mr. Horan said, "and we are looking at major battles over priorities. On the one hand, you have to do 'precision hiring' of economists, for example. At the same time, you need to change the culture of the agency to reflect American society."
 
Low Turnover, Tough Tests
 In addition, the low rate of employee turnover at an agency where people tend to stay for life makes it harder to rid the C.I.A. of unproductive workers. During the Gates hearings, for example, Admiral Inman estimated that 5 percent to 10 percent of the agency's employees "don't measure up to the high standards we would all like to see."
Hiring is also made more difficult in the C.I.A. than in other governmental agencies because applicants must pass a polygraph test and survive rigorous security and medical screening. Drug use and theft are the top reasons for failing the lie test, although some applicants have failed because of violent crime, including rape and child abuse, Mr. Horan said.
For decades, the C.I.A. was a white, male preserve, where Ivy Leaguers, Jesuit-educated Irishmen and Italians and Midwestern Protestants seemed to thrive. Over the last several years, the agency has made some strides in recruiting and promoting women. Thirty-six percent of its "professional" positions are held by women, and the C.I.A. general counsel and comptroller are women, although only about 8 percent of the 60 senior "office director" posts are held by women.
The agency has done much worse in its hiring and promoting of minorities, many of whom have been skeptical of joining an organization with a history of conducting coups, assassination attempts and covert operations in the third world. Only 6.4 percent of the agency's "professionals" and only one of the office directors are black, while an additional 3.7 percent come from the other minority groups: Hispanic, Asian-American and Native American.
"Over the years, there's been a lot of reluctance in minority communities to look at the agency as a place to work," said Gary E. Foster, Deputy Director for Planning and Coordination, who added that 20 percent to 25 percent of employees hired last year -- professional, clerical and technical -- belong to minorities.
The agency is so pleased with its Ebony advertisement that it is working on a similar one in Spanish to attract Hispanic applicants. In that advertisement, the setting will be a kitchen, and the photo will probably feature a grandmother and a young child. A suggestion by the C.I.A. to put a crucifix on the wall was vetoed by the advertising agency. Like the Ebony advertisement, the Spanish one will include the C.I.A. seal and its new recruiting motto: "The C.I.A.: Our business is knowing the world's business."

HEADLINE: Philadelphia's New Mayor to Face Tough Job

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 3

 BODY:
The 127th Mayor of Philadelphia, to be elected Tuesday, faces one of the most challenging jobs in America.
The new Mayor, most likely the Democratic front-runner, Edward G. Rendell, will take over the helm of a city that has been stumbling out of control for many years, racking up chronic deficits, and losing population, respect and political clout in Harrisburg and Washington. 
 The new Mayor will almost certainly have to deal with an immediate cash crisis, negotiate a long-term fiscal strategy with a newly formed state oversight authority, pull in the reins of an City Council accustomed to running the city, negotiate new contracts with all 25,000 municipal workers and further reduce services for residents who have seen services steadily cut in recent years. At the same time, the Mayor will have difficulty fulfilling expensive campaign promises, like Mr. Rendell's pledge to hire 1,000 more police officers.
 
'Very Painful Process'
 If the Mayor succeeds in pulling the city back from the brink of insolvency, he would then be in a strong position to plead with the state Legislature to pick up most of the cost of state-mandated county courts, prisons and social services. Without state relief, the rising cost of these services will ultimately bankrupt the city, as just about everyone says.
State lawmakers say they have been reluctant to give the city assistance until they are confident that the money will be spent efficiently. Philadelphia spends more per capita on its courts than any other major city, and it ranks second in spending per capita for human services, health care and corrections, according to the Pennsylvania Economy League, a not-for-profit research organization that monitors the city.
"Philadelphia is in the final stages of never-never land, so it's going to be a very, very, very painful process to rescue it," said Frederick L. Voight, executive secretary of the Committee of Seventy, a not-for-profit public policy organization here.
Mayor W. Wilson Goode, the city's first black Mayor, completes his second four-year term this year and the City Charter forbids a third consecutive term. He has talked about teaching and advising other cities on how to become more efficient.
 
List of Candidates
 The city's black community, which represents 40 percent of the 1.5 million population, was unable to agree on a single black candidate this year. A black, the Rev. Dennis M. Wesley, a Baptist minister, is running as an independent, but he has trailed Mr. Rendell in the polls by up to 60 points. Most black leaders have endorsed Mr. Rendell, a 47-year-old former District Attorney.
The city's fiscal crisis and crime have been the only significant issues in the campaign. Mr. Rendell, who holds a 40-point lead over the Republican contender in most polls, has taken a tough stand on reining in city expenses. In particular, he has said he would seek concessions from municipal workers, whose total compensation exceeds that in the private sector by more than 20 percent, according to some estimates.
Mr. Rendell said he would face down the unions and let the workers strike before he would give in to high contract demands, if need be, and would consider contracting out some labor-intensive services like garbage collection if the unions would not budge. "We have to downsize expenditures and cut a quarter of a billion dollars out of the cost of government," he said, suggesting a 10 percent decrease in the city's $2.3 billion budget.
 
'A Results Guy'
 The Republican candidate, Joseph M. Egan Jr., is a 57-year-old real-estate developer and former head of a quasi-public industrial development commission in the city. He became the party's nominee after Frank L. Rizzo, the winner of the Republican primary this spring, died of a heart attack on July 16.
Mr. Egan has run a lackluster campaign. He has offered no substantive program for rescuing the city, but asserts he is qualified for the job because he is "a results guy, a coalition builder." He presented his first position paper on the city's fiscal condition just five days before the election.
A third candidate, Pamela Rainey Lawler, 41, is the founder of Philabundance, a not-for-profit organization that picks up surplus perishable food and distributes it to the hungry. Running on the Consumer Party ticket, she has advanced few ideas for fixing the city. One of her ideas is for the city to sell city-owned real estate and other assets to help balance the books.
Mr. Wesley, a 41-year-old Republican who is running as an independent, primarily talks about reducing city expenses, like consultants' fees.
"The money is there if you cut off the gravy train," he said. "Every year we give away over $500 million in consulting fees to people who are only interested in building pools and Jacuzzis for themselves in the suburbs."

HEADLINE: Metro Matters;
After 50 Years, a New Powell On an Expanded City Council

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
FIFTY years ago today, a 33-year-old minister named Adam Clayton Powell Jr. melded protest and electoral politics to become the first black member of the New York City Council.
Tomorrow, his legacy will be rekindled when 29-year-old Adam Clayton Powell 4th is assured of election to the Council. The Puerto Rico-born Mr. Powell decisively won a special primary last week in a Harlem district where twice as many Hispanic people live as blacks. In January, he will join 20 other black and Hispanic members of an expanded Council. 
 What a difference five decades make! What difference?
In 1941, after a cumbersome proportional representation process, Mr. Powell's election was certified on the same day that he and hundreds of other Harlemites jammed an emergency meeting convened by the Social Service Bureau of the Magistrate's Courts. Fifty years later, sentiments expressed at that meeting reverberate in painfully familiar oratory, in part because some solutions proposed then were largely unheeded.
Magistrate Anna M. Kross insisted that the fundamental problem was a "social and economic one, created by lacks of many kinds." Vivan C. Mason, a Welfare Department official, complained that to pay for an apartment, relief recipients "must use not only the money that is budgeted for rent but also part of the food budget."
And Anna E. Lawson, principal of Junior High School 81 in Harlem, lamented: "I have in my school 1,600 girls, and 1,400 of them are as fine and decent and upstanding girls as any in the city. But 200 of them are pretty low, and I could pick out 30 of them who will be behind bars in a few years. If I had skilled help, I could save some of them, but I can't get it. When the board of superintendents asks for help to deal with these problems what do we get? We get a cut in the budget instead."
In his new book, "Adam Clayton Powell Jr. -- The Political Biography of an American Dilemma" (Atheneum), Prof. Charles V. Hamilton of Columbia University recalls Mr. Powell's own agenda that day.
"Right now," Mr. Powell said, "there are 1,400 persons on the city college faculties. There is a payroll of about $4 million. But there are no Negroes on these faculties. The day after I'm sworn in at the Council, there are going to be pickets outside the offices of the Board of Higher Education. I'll raise a ruckus in the Council, but I think it will look better with 2,000 or 3,000 people crowding around Park Avenue and 68th Street."
He also disclosed that blacks would be instructed to call operators for assistance instead of dialing telephone numbers directly and, as a result, the "telephone people will find they need maybe a thousand operators to carry on the business." He added: "I think they'll hire Negroes. The bus companies didn't like it at first either. But they came around."
Mr. Powell's institutional base at the Abyssinian Baptist Church enabled him to jump the ideological traps that ensnared some political successors. "Locally, Adam was the first to effectively combine protest action and electoral politics," Dr. Hamilton said. Only the Rev. Jesse Jackson has approached Mr. Powell's skill at finessing a fundamental conflict that dogs Mayor David N. Dinkins and other black politicians, Professor Hamilton said, as they win higher office and become accountable to broader constituencies.
"Does that mean David Dinkins should not lay off people?" Dr. Hamilton said. "No, it means that his task of explaining this to his base constituents is going to be so much greater. Adam Clayton Powell never had that problem. We never expected anything but the leadership of oratory, and he delivered."
Expectations for Mr. Powell's son are somewhat lower, although he has signaled his independence by bucking the Mayor in Mr. Dinkins's home base and by endorsing rule changes proposed last week by Council members Sal F. Albanese, Susan D. Alter, Alfred C. Cerullo 3d, Stephen DiBrienza, Ronnie M. Eldridge, C. Virginia Fields, Carol Greitzer, Carolyn B. Maloney and Stanley E. Michels. They constitute a potentially influential maverick minority that is likely to enlist some of the Council's new black and Hispanic members -- only one of whom, though, was elected from a predominantly white district, in a pointed reminder of how little is different after 50 years.
The elder Powell aspired to be an irritant and succeeded. Like him, his son harbors Congressional ambitions in a district now represented by Charles B. Rangel, who defeated Representative Powell in 1970 after the House voted to exclude him for, among other allegations, padding his payroll with his wife, who was actually raising Adam 4th at the time in Puerto Rico.
For all the shortcomings that made him vulnerable to a double standard, Mr. Powell could use power even more effectively than he abused it. "Nobody," his son says, "will ever be like him."

HEADLINE: Ernest Nathan Is Dead; Entrepreneur Was 86

 BODY:
Ernest Nathan, an entrepreneur and supporter of Jewish and Israeli causes, died on Saturday at Miriam Hospital in Providence, R.I. He was 86 years old and lived in Providence.
He died as a result of a stroke, his family said. 
 Mr. Nathan, a native of Augsburg, Germany, graduated from the Institute of Textile Technology in Reutlingen, Germany, and began working with Chemische Fabrik Pfersee, a chemical company that his family started in 1868. In 1929, he moved to West Warwick, R.I., for a joint venture with the Crompton Corporation to produce Impregnole, a water repellent that his company had developed.
He sold the Impregnole business to the Sun Chemical Corporation and was a company vice president from 1948 to 1952. After working on Israeli industrial development for two years, he returned to Crompton in 1954 to run its Chemo Products Teflon division in West Warwick.
In 1962 he bought Elmwood Sensors, a new company in Cranston, R.I., with four employees that was set up to make thermostats. He expanded the company to include more than a thousand workers and a second factory in England before selling it in 1980.
Mr. Nathan, a naturalized American citizen, helped dozens of other Jews escape from Europe to America in World War II. Later, as vice president of the Palestine Economic Corporation, he helped develop industry in Israel.
He is survived by his wife, the former Pearl Gluck; two sons, Alan, of Barrington, R.I., and Richard, of Italy; a daughter, Joan Gerson of Washington, and a sister, Alice Regensteiner of Warwick.

HEADLINE: Fear and Dependency Jostle in Shelters

BYLINE: By THOMAS MORGAN

 BODY:
Close to midnight, about the time that Nelson Echevarria wanders onto the armory drill floor in a Brooklyn men's shelter to find his assigned cot, fear and uneasiness settle in among the homeless there who struggle to sleep amid the cacophony of hacking coughs, blaring radios and moans from violent dreams.
This dimly lighted, unheated cavernous shelter at Atlantic and Bedford Avenues, with its sea of cots, is the kind of city shelter that has frightened many homeless people into staying on the streets. 
 But many of the 900 men who sleep there have grown increasingly comfortable with it, even calling it home and staying on for months or years.
 
Violence and Drugs
 Some advocates and city officials worry that the city's shelter system is breeding dependency: often the only decision required of residents -- who are served meals and given bed linens -- is not to cause trouble with the staff.
Mr. Echevarria, who has lived in the shelter for two months after exhausting other alternatives, understands why so many of the homeless living on the streets in paper boxes or rickety lean-tos say they are terrified of shelters and refuse to go to them despite recent efforts of the Dinkins administration to clear some streets and parks of the homeless.
"I have been threatened and I've seen people pull out razors," said Mr. Echevarria, 30 years old, a former building superintendent who lost his job and apartment and now seeks retraining as a boiler repairman. "You never know when a guy with a mental problem or someone smoking crack is going to go off. You have people in here who use drugs in the bathrooms, and the guards and institutional aides do nothing about it."
More than 7,000 men and 1,300 women live in the shelters and, though there is no precise figure, about 1,000 people are thought to have been there for more than a year.
Roger Barry, 39, has lived in the shelter for seven months now. Mr. Barry, who has a prison record and is trying to break a heroin addiction, found part-time work as a barber but said that he did not earn enough to afford an apartment on his own.
"It's not bad here," Mr. Barry said matter-of-factly. "It's what you make it. It's in my best interest to stay here until I can get myself together and afford to leave."
 
Bullies and Thefts
 At the Atlantic Avenue Armory, as in many other shelters, fights break out with little interference from security guards. The mentally ill sleep unsupervised side by side with men displaced from single-room-occupancy hotels, former prison inmates, crack addicts and alcoholics.
Sometimes in retribution for some perceived slight, bullies and their friends wait until a man is asleep and then toss a blanket or a sheet over him and beat him with pipes and sticks, shelter residents say. Theft and extortion are so common that everything from sneakers to underwear are taken. Men put the legs of their cots into their worn shoes or use their shoes as pillows to keep them safe.
 
Adopting Prison Ethic
 As he spoke, a roach crawled across the lips of a man who had passed out on the floor of the shelter's recreation room. It took 45 minutes for the security guards standing at the entryway to notice that the man was not moving and to attempt to rouse him. When the guards eventually woke the man, he grumbled obscenities, slumped in a metal chair and pointed to something in the air that only he could see. Many of the men who have lived in the shelters for years say they survive by adapting a prison ethic to shelter life, lessons that many of them actually learned in prison. No one is trusted.
Eric Watkins, 34, has lived in the Atlantic Avenue shelter for two years and still dreams of being a floor sander. He has refused to join self-help programs, saying he knows best how to help himself get back on his feet. His caseworkers think he is mistaken.
 
'We Have to Push'
 Rife with tuberculosis, bronchitis and other infections, congregate adult shelters like this one have become dumping grounds for men without homes who have been released from prisons, hospitals and other institutions, advocates and city officials say. The number of single men in city shelters changes with the weather, rising to 9,000 on very cold nights. On average the cost of basic shelter is $39 per person per day.
City officials are increasingly focusing on services that will help the homeless get back on their feet.
"Sometimes we have to push. Sometimes we have to say, 'Why don't you call about a job? Why don't you see your family?" ' said Tony Branch, 28, the director of the Atlantic Avenue shelter, who has started a number of innovative self-help programs there.
"When they start calling a shelter home, it makes you think," he said. "Some people say it's cleaner than the environment they grew up in. They have guaranteed breakfast, lunch and dinner. They get clothing and a place to sleep. By court decision we have to offer shelter to anyone who asks for it. To be honest with you, a lot of guys come in here who need mental repair. They lose faith in themselves. They've been put down by a lot of people.
"We try to encourage them to take advantage of the self-help programs, the Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous," said Mr. Branch, who is alternately dismissively gruff and sympathetic to men twice his age who stop him to plead for favors like children ask for candy. "But we can't make them."
 
'Place to Throw Away'
 Psychologists and social scientists call the adaptation to life in homeless centers "shelterization."
Dr. Kim Hopper, an anthropologist who studies homelessness among single men at the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research in Orangeburg, N.Y., said that skid row in the 1950's was similar in many ways, "a place to throw away" mostly old white male alcoholics who were demoralized and deemed unproductive.
Today, he said, the shelters are the new "zones of discard" and the homeless men are primarily black or Hispanic of all ages and with a range of disabilities.
"It doesn't take much of a social historian to track the changes that account for that very different configuration of discarded men," Dr. Hopper said. "There are fewer jobs, hospitals that took care of the mentally ill are closed and families that used to be able to put up a dependent member, temporarily out of work, are much more sorely strapped today."
Statistics for New York City are unavailable, but about 30 percent of the homeless adults in shelters are thought to be mentally ill and another 30 percent are former prison inmates, according to Jeffrey Carples, executive deputy commissioner of the city's Human Resources Administration who is in charge of the adult shelter system.
 
5-Year Plan
 Mr. Carples said the shelters are ill-equipped to handle the range of clients and problems they receive despite their best efforts to provide services to all who need them.
But a five-year shelter development plan that Mayor David N. Dinkins proposed last month calls for smaller city homeless shelters with more special services geared to the problems of homeless men and women, would increase the range of services that the agency would offer, like job training and counseling, psychiatric therapy and substance abuse counseling. But the five-year plan is under considerable attack by elected officials and community residents who do not want such shelters in residential communities.
What Mr. Carples envisions is a shelter system that is really temporary and offers the homeless whatever skills and services they need to move toward independent living.
"A lot of these guys have never lived on their own," he said. "Beyond dealing with the substance abuse problems for example, you have to teach somebody not only a work skill but how to groom themselves a certain way, to dress a certain way. It's basic things about how to live in a society, but these clients have not been socialized to this extent."
The Atlantic Avenue Armory shelter has the kind of programs that city officials would expand on in smaller, future shelters, city officials said. For instance, there is an assessment unit there that attempts to place men in other shelters that provide counseling for specific problems like unemployment. There are what officials call clean and sober dorms inside the Atlantic Avenue shelter where homeless men who are attempting to stay sober sleep in a room segregated from others who are still using drugs. Advocates for the homeless say that despite the programs offered in the shelters, the men become despondent because there are few permanent apartments available.
"Unlike the family shelter system, these men are not transitioned into permanent facilities," said Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless. "For those who work and have to go back to a shelter bed, there is not much incentive to continue to work."

'A Piece of My Heart,' Women In Vietnam

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
At the end of "A Piece of My Heart," Shirley Lauro's new play about the unsung American women who served in Vietnam, the characters appear before a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington and place homely mementos of the war at its base. It is a powerful tableau -- like every other glimpse of that long, dark wall -- and it allows Ms. Lauro at last to stir up the feelings of grief and anger that she has been chasing all night.
Yet, for me at least, the feelings evaporated the moment I was back on the street, at which point I resented having my buttons pushed so cheaply. Right until its coda, "A Piece of My Heart," a Manhattan Theater Club presentation by way of the Actors Theater of Louisville, is embarrassingly cliched in its efforts to bring home the stories of forgotten survivors of the Vietnam nightmare. Are we to applaud a playwright who uses the wall to prop up what is otherwise an incompetent piece of work? 
 "A Piece of My Heart" can be called incompetent because it coarsens and wastes valuable documentary material. Ms. Lauro's source is a 1986 oral history by Keith Walker in which 26 of the estimated 1,500 American women who went to Southeast Asia recounted their experiences, whether as nurses, civilian do-gooders or entertainers. These women had their own distinctive and courageous war to fight: with their consciences, with the Vietnamese, with the American military command, with primitive medical facilities and, most pointedly, with men.
Though the playwright draws on the words of her actual subjects, her play seems synthetic, like an old-fashioned news-magazine round-up story with archetypal, if not composite, characters speaking in souped-up quotes. Bizarrely enough, most of Ms. Lauro's major characters are so generic that they could have stepped out of the stereotyped male ranks of bygone service comedies like "Mister Roberts" or "No Time for Sergeants": the tough-talking but big-hearted military lifer (Novella Nelson), the rich college kid (Sharon Schlarth), the religious small-town naif (Corliss Preston) and even the immortal Andy Griffith role, that of the thick-accented yet shrewd country bumpkin (Cynthia Carle) who strums a mean guitar.
"A Piece of My Heart" never makes the audience feel close to these or its other characters because Ms. Lauro manipulates them from without rather than observing them from within. Once the women have shipped off to Vietnam, the action of the play is not driven by their specific narratives, intimate thoughts or feelings; instead the players become faceless, symbolic figures in a mural.
Whether appearing individually in didactic vignettes or banding together for lengthy rounds of group recitation, the women react mechanically to the expected checklist of red-letter experiences, from their first encounter with the brutality of combat through their initiations into drugs and booze, sexual harassment and official duplicity (during the Tet Offensive). When the women return home to face a series of new indignities in Act II (unemployment, discrimination, Agent Orange mutations), they go their separate ways but just as predictably. The alcoholic finds salvation in Alcoholics Anonymous; the idealist joins Vietnam Veterans Against the War; the true believer becomes a born-again Christian.
Everything in this play is over-generalized to the point of blandness. Even the potentially theatrical idea of assigning all the male roles to a single actor (Tom Stechschulte) -- a conceit reminiscent of Amlin Gray's harrowing Vietnam play, "How I Got That Story" -- comes to nothing because virtually all the male roles turn out to be variations on the same blue-collar white Everyman. The ideological point of this all-purpose man is clear and unexceptional enough -- "Men wanted that war, men made that war," says one of the women in Act II -- but the device has the odd and falsifying side effect of completely eliminating black men from the Vietnam story.
Such lapses are surprising coming from Ms. Lauro. In "Open Admissions," her searing play about a confrontation between a black male student and a white female teacher in an urban university, she met head-on the sorts of complex ideological and racial conflicts that are either oversimplified or sidestepped here. "A Piece of My Heart" has far more in common with another Manhattan Theater Club production this year about a neglected patch of American military history, "Black Eagles," in which the tale of black World War II fighter pilots was reduced to a lulling pageant of unassailable worthiness and infinitesimal drama.
Ms. Lauro's play must struggle under the additional handicap of being presented at the expansive Union Square Theater (until recently the home of the Roundabout Theater Company) while "Lips Together, Teeth Apart" continues its extended run at the Manhattan Theater Club's snugger auditorium at City Center. Under the direction of Allen R. Belknap, the performers often seem to be inflating their soliloquies, whether perky or sorrowful, to fill the big house, with the consequence that both their wartime experiences and sobbing postwar nervous breakdowns sometimes come across like audition monologues from "A Chorus Line." Mr. Belknap's staging also boasts an arsenal of cheesy sound-and-light effects that, like the rest of the evening's sloppy histrionics, say nothing about the tragedy of Vietnam that can remotely match the eloquence of the wall's mute, unadorned listing of the names of the dead.

HEADLINE: Vote 'Yes,' Three Times

 BODY:
New York voters will find three proposals on their ballots tomorrow, one big and two little; all three make sense and deserve approval.
The truly important ballot measure is Proposal One, which would expand the borrowing power of the Job Development Authority. This is a state agency that makes low-interest loans to businesses trying to expand. Its record of loan repayment is impeccable.
Though opponents fear further indebtedness by state authorities, the authority is one of the state's most effective levers for economic growth. A "yes" vote is all the more important in light of the current economic slump.
Proposal Two would authorize a 50-acre land swap. Piseco Airport, a one-runway haven for small planes in Hamilton County, and the only airport in the southern Adirondacks, is threatened by the growth of trees. A constitutional amendment is required to authorize a swap of locally owned land for 50 acres of forest preserve that will enable local authorities to clear land around the runway. The impact on the forest would be negligible; the additional safety factor is extremely significant. Vote "yes."
Proposal Three would authorize new development along the Erie Canal, which crosses the state, connecting the Hudson River with the Great Lakes. This early 19th-century development was instrumental in opening the Midwest to settlement. It has become a lively tourist attraction; to expand that role, a constitutional change is required to permit leasing and development of adjacent areas. Tolls would also be authorized.
Objectors are right to insist that a comprehensive plan should be developed, but the time to develop it is after the voters have indicated their support. Again, vote "yes."

The Last Vestiges Of the 80's Boom

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill.

 BODY:
THE United States is glutted with newly built, unoccupied office space, and that makes the once-common sight of a skyscraper under construction a rare one today. So it is a pleasant surprise to drive into downtown Peoria and come upon just such a scene: three luxury office buildings in various stages of completion, with sidewalks blocked off to make room for steel beams and slabs of marble facing.
Peoria is not an anomaly. Office towers are also going up along the downtown streets of Cleveland, Columbus and Milwaukee, among other Midwestern cities. But if Peoria's builders are any guide, then the construction so visible in these heartland cities is hardly a leading indicator of a construction revival elsewhere in the land. Rather it signals that the nation's free-wheeling office-building of the 1980's is in its last throes. 
 Certainly G. Raymond Becker, Peoria's leading builder, thinks so. "I don't believe anyone will get stuck with the three buildings now going up, but in Peoria there won't be any more need for office space for the next 10 years," said Mr. Becker, who is building the tallest of the three, a 20-story tower with its steel frame not yet enclosed.
That is a gloomy assessment. But George A. Christie, chief economist at the F. W. Dodge division of McGraw-Hill, which tracks construction data, considers it an accurate one for cities in the former Rust Belt states -- particularly those in the Great Lakes region -- where manufacturing, after a disastrous period in the early and mid-1980's, made a comeback.
That comeback explains why office towers are still rising in the Midwest. While much of the country was putting up office buildings and shopping malls in the mid-1980's, Mr. Becker and other Midwestern builders stood by, as local manufacturers shed thousands of workers, closed factories and struggled to become efficient and profitable. In 1988, when Caterpillar Inc., this city's major employer, had finally recovered and was once again breathing extra money into the local economy, Peoria's office vacancy rate stood at 5 percent -- far below the national level of 19.8 percent.
The revival began modestly. Mr. Becker bought and renovated a dilapidated office building. Caterpillar, briskly selling tractors and heavy construction equipment again, also bought existing office space for its headquarters operation. With space disappearing, new construction began, and ground was broken last year for the three buildings that are now more than half-finished. The problem is that tenants are lately hard to find.
That's the case for a six-story structure with pink marble facing that Jay Jansen, head of a Peoria law firm, is building. Mr. Jansen's lawyers will occupy three floors; the rest are still unleased, although a restaurant has rented basement space. Nearby, Diane Cullinan, a developer, is raising an eight-story brick structure, and so far only 40 percent of the space is leased, to Cilcorp, the holding company for the region's electric utility.
Finally, there is Mr. Becker's skyscraper, with 65 percent of its space to be occupied by an accounting firm, a law firm, Mr. Becker's own real estate operations and the Illinois Transportation Department, which is taking 4 of the 20 floors and paying nearly enough rent to cover the mortgage.
Mr. Becker, who has been putting up an assortment of buildings for 40 years without a major reversal, says that unlike much of the nation, Peoria has not fallen into the trap of speculative over-construction. "I think we will rent all the space," he said. "The Federal Government is looking for space, and state agencies are also a possibility."
But then what? Most economists count on a revival in construction to sustain a recovery from the national recession, but as Peoria's experience indicates, commercial construction is not likely to make this possible. Nationwide, the value of newly started commercial buildings -- mostly offices, but also shopping malls, warehouses and the like -- has fallen to an annual rate of $40 billion, from $60 billion in boom years, F. W. Dodge reports.
The much larger housing sector has taken up some of the slack, having risen to an annual rate of $100 billion in new starts from $75 billion in January. But this is treading water. With family incomes barely rising and the population growing more slowly than in the 1980's, home construction in the early 1990's probably won't reach the boom levels of previous post-recession periods.
That leaves public works, an area restrained by government budget cutbacks, and commercial construction. "Normally, commercial construction kicks in about a year after a recovery is under way," Mr. Christie said. "But this time you probably won't get that secondary kick until much later in the decade."

HEADLINE: Economic Memo;
Wall St. Finds Silver Lining In Cloudy Economic Reports

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
Some curious things, it seems, are happening this fall to the Washington-Wall Street axis. With few exceptions, each time one of the Government statistics mills issues a discouraging report on the economy, the stock market takes off toward a new high. And when politicians talk about tax cuts -- which would reduce burdens on producers of wealth -- the market takes a dive.
Confusing? Sure. Illogical? Not necessarily. 
 In Wall Street's orthodox view, the stock market, reflecting collective investor opinion about the prospects for corporate profits, looks to the future, not to the past or present. And what it sees, with inflation modest and some interest rates at the lowest levels in 14 years, is an economic recovery ahead that will lift profits and thereby support today's valuations.
"I think it's an unmistakable recovery sign," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, referring to the stock market's ebullience. "There's no doubt in my mind the recession's over."
History tends to support this conclusion, with the stock market enjoying a reputation as one of the better predictors of the economy. In fact, the Commerce Department includes the Standard & Poor's 500 in its index of leading indicators, the Government's principal business forecasting gauge.
But there is at least one other possible explanation for the elevated stock market. This is that the market is artificially high, benefiting in part from over-optimism about a recovery that struggles ahead, "but in the face of a 50-mile-an-hour headwind," as Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last week, referring to the reluctance of some banks to lend.
The Dow Jones industrials are selling at 30 times the earnings of their latest 12 months -- more than twice the ratio of a year ago -- though the market has declined modestly in the last three sessions. In addition, the trading volume in over-the-counter stocks has surpassed that on the New York Stock Exchange for two straight weeks.
 
Savers Flock to Stocks
 Also contributing to the notion that stock prices are too high is evidence that savers, confronting drastically reduced returns on certificates of deposit and Treasury bills, are pouring money into equities. Some of this is moving directly into stocks and some is channeled through mutual funds.
Charles I. Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch & Company, is one person on Wall Street who has turned cautious about the stock market rally, which he says may have gotten ahead of itself based on economic fundamentals.
"There is some speculation going on, and that's bothersome," Mr. Clough said. He added that while much of the hyperactivity was in one industry, biotechnology, he was concerned that the market might be overly optimistic about the pace of economic recovery. He noted that the Fed has been easing monetary policy, pushing interest rates down, for a year, but still has a negligible rebound to show for it.
In the view of James Grant's Interest Rate Observer, one of Wall Street's most insightful publications, Mr. Greenspan has "driven income-seeking people" into growth stocks and bond funds, thereby increasing the amount of speculative money outside the banking system. This made Mr. Greenspan's relationship to Wall Street comparable to that of "a bush beater to a party of quail hunters."
But even if the stock market is more vulnerable than is generally recognized, a drop would not necessarily imply that the economy will tumble back into recession. This is because stocks seem to have been overrated as a predictor of business activity, and the linkage has recently gotten weaker.
A study by Michael P. Niemira of the New York office of Mitsubishi Bank found stock prices to be "a prime candidate for replacement" in the Commerce Department's economic-forecasting index, because they have emitted a high rate of false signals, particularly since 1980. He would favor using instead a gauge of interest rates like the yield curve -- the difference between rates for three months and those for 30 years.
These days, reports of a weak recovery tend to raise stock prices, since it is assumed that the news increases the likelihood of further easing by the Federal Reserve, which will meet on Tuesday for one of its every-other-month strategy sessions.
Yet there must be a limit, analysts say, to how long bad news for the economy can be good for stocks. Ultimately, of course, it means a dearth of profits.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues to Decline On Outlook for Lower Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday amid pessimism about the United States economy and the expectation of lower interest rates. Gold prices were mixed, rising in New York after falling overseas.
Analysts said the dollar continued where it left off last week -- declining as traders anticipated the Federal Reserve would have to lower interest rates after several negative economic reports, including an increase in the unemployment rate. Lower interest rates are generally bearish for the dollar because they lessen the value of dollar-denominated securities.
 
Brief Rise Possible
 Richard Levine, a foreign exchange broker with Merrill Lynch & Company, said the dollar could briefly move higher because it had been heavily oversold. 
 It would be difficult, however, for the dollar to sustain a long-term advance because of the continuing weakness in the economy.
Some overseas brokers said the dollar could fall as low as 1.5850 German marks in the coming weeks. The dollar fell to 1.6385 marks yesterday, down from 1.6445 late on Friday.
In earlier European trading, the dollar slipped to 1.6316 marks from 1.6605.
The dollar fell to 129.185 Japanese yen in New York, from 129.73 late on Friday. Markets were closed in Tokyo yesterday for Culture Day -- a national holiday -- but in London, the dollar fell to 128.95 yen, compared with Tokyo's Friday close of 130.74.
The British pound gained against the dollar, rising to $1.7740, from $1.7675 late on Friday. In London, sterling rose to $1.7810 from late Friday's $1.7680.
Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.4425 Swiss francs, down from 1.4435; 5.6000 French francs, down from 5.6215; 1,227.00 Italian lire, down from 1,233.65, and 1.12125 Canadian dollars, up from 1.12005.
Gold for current delivery rose $1.20 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $356.80 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $356.40, up $1.40.
But gold fell in London to a late bid price of $356.60 from $357.85 late on Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to $356.30 from $357.50. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.29 to close at $356.85.
Silver for current delivery gained 2.1 cents on the Commodity Exchange, ending at $4.067 an ounce. Silver fell in London to $4.08, from $4.11 late on Friday.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 10.73, to 3,045.62, in Light Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed lower yesterday in light trading as investors worried that the Fed would not cut its discount rate soon with the Government's quarterly refunding beginning today. Easier credit would buoy economic and corporate growth, many traders believe.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 10.73 points to finish at 3,045.62. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 155.7 million, down from 206.5 million shares traded on Friday, as declining issues outpaced gainers by 974 to 658. 
 Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers, described yesterday's market performance as not the most sterling. "There will not be much coming data from Washington this week, he said. The focus will now turn to the refunding by the Treasury and possible Fed action because of the absence of economic news and because third-quarter corporate earnings results are largely over."
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was down 1.04, to 390.28, with the Big Board composite off 0.58, to 215.43. Trading on the American Stock Exchange lowered that composite by 2.75 points, to 384.10.
The Nasdaq composite index was down 3.43, to 537.50, while the Russell 2000, a narrow measure of small stocks, was down 0.76, to 183.86.
Initially, stocks opened lower, and losses widened as bonds slipped in a moderate selloff ahead of the Treasury's refunding. Analysts said some investors were cashing in after last Friday's sluggish report on jobs and a decline in the index of leading economic indicators showed a stumbling recovery.
Investors are expected to remain mainly on the sidelines during most of the week, because they are uncertain whether the Fed is going to act and therefore are not sure what tack to take.
In market activity, Compaq Computer, hurt by the recession and increased competition, fell 1 1/8, to 26 3/4, after The Houston Chronicle reported over the weekend that James M. Harris, a co-founder, and two other senior executives had left the company. On Friday the company sent out the first layoff notices that are going to 1,400 employees.
Shares of Agouron Pharmecuticals closed unchanged at 18, after the company said it had received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration to begin tests on human beings of a psoriasis treatment. The stock was as high as 18 1/2 yesterday.

HEADLINE: A.T.& T. Plan To Expand Europe Cable

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Anticipating a huge rise in business telephone traffic between the United States and Europe, A.T.& T. said yesterday that it planned to lay two 4,500-mile undersea cables in the Atlantic Ocean that will more than double the number of possible trans-Atlantic conversations.
A.T.& T. said the sharp expansion of telephone capacity was necessary because of the coming unification of Western European markets at the end of 1992 and the emerging market economies of Eastern Europe. 
 Yesterday's announcement means that 80 percent of A.T.& T.'s total trans-Atlantic capacity will have been added between now and August 1993, all of it with the latest in high-capacity fiber-optic technology.
 
Capacity for 300,000 Calls
 About 57,750 simultaneous conversations are possible today, and a further 80,000 calls will be possible with capacity due to be added in February 1992. But the planned undersea cables announced yesterday would add capacity for 160,000 more calls, as well as data and video, resulting in a total capacity of nearly 300,000 calls.
"Every time we've had to do these things, we've had to rush" to add capacity, said Charles G. Schmitz, A.T.& T.'s district manager for facility planning and agreements. "Now, we wanted to make sure we had enough capacity to serve customer needs."
Mr. Schmitz said the new capacity was not intended to cure any current problems, such as too many calls flooding over too little capacity into Europe, but rather to handle complex blocks of data, like Wall Street trading data and airline reservations.
The new capacity is intended to expand service from the United States to Germany, France and Britain.
The cables, which carry fiber-optic filaments the size of human hairs, vary in size over the varying terrains of the Atlantic Ocean. Dropped by special cable ships, the lines range from the thickness of a human thumb in the least vulnerable areas, like the deepest parts of the ocean, to the thickness of three fingers for reinforced cable near shore, where fishing boats and other boat traffic could ensnare and cut a cable.
A 4,400-mile cable will stretch from Greenhill, R.I., through the North Sea oilfields of Scotland to the coastal towns of Norden, Germany, and Alkmaar, the Netherlands. Another 4,470-mile cable will stretch from Manahawkin, N.J. to Swansea, England, and St. Hillaire, France.
 
Lower Fiber-Optics Costs
 The new cables, known as Trans-Atlantic-Telephone 10 and Trans-Atlantic-Telephone 11, or TAT-10 and TAT-11, must still be cleared by the Federal Communications Commission. Mr. Schmitz said he expected F.C.C. clearance as early as this month, but noted that another telecommunications company, Submarine Lightguide Cable, wanted to lay its own cable and had filed an objection to A.T.& T.'s plan.
TAT-10 is set to be completed in August 1992 and TAT-11 in August 1993.
Installation of the new A.T.& T. cables will cost $300 million for TAT-10 around the North Sea oilfields and $280 million for TAT-11, which crosses a somewhat shorter and less hazardous path.
Mr. Schmitz said the huge addition of capacity had been made possible by advances in fiber-optic technology, which makes undersea cable far less costly than in the past, especially compared with satellite transmission, once thought to be the best and cheapest means of international long-distance calling. A large telecommunications satellite can carry 135,000 calls or more.

HEADLINE: 2 Democrats Seek Tough Trade Policy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
Reviving a fiercely debated issue from the 1988 Presidential campaign, two Democratic members of the House introduced legislation this afternoon that calls for trade sanctions against countries that unfairly exclude American exports and run trade surpluses with the United States.
Democrats and Republicans agree that whether trade becomes a leading issue in next year's Presidential campaign will depend on whether the recession ends, whether the nation's trade deficit continues to narrow and whether negotiations for an international round of reductions in trade barriers prove successful. 
 Representatives Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, and Sander M. Levin of Michigan introduced the bill, which broadly resembles the legislation that Mr. Gephardt advocated during his unsuccessful Presidential campaign in 1987 and 1988. That bill was widely criticized as protectionist by Republicans and some Democrats.
 
3 Democratic Proposals
 Today's bill was the latest of three Democratic bills attempting to limit the Administration's time to seek negotiated reductions in barriers before imposing sanctions. Consideration of the bills coincides with Democrats' efforts to blame President Bush for continued economic weakness.
"Trade by itself isn't the critical issue -- it's the economy," Mr. Levin said at a news conference today.
"But trade is a metaphor," he added, for the nation's economic problems.
The Administration and most Republican members of Congress oppose all three bills. "It would seem to me harder to get this out of the Ways and Means Committee than 6 or 12 months ago," said Representative Willis D. Gradison Jr., an Ohio Republican who is a leading opponent on the Ways and Means Committee of protectionist legislation. He said the bill's prospects would be dimmed by recent indications of a possible breakthrough in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. Those talks, which began in Uruguay in 1986, are the latest in a postwar series of negotiations to reduce tariffs.
"The weak economy makes it more attractive, but the signs of progress on the Uruguay Round make it less attractive," Mr. Gradison added in a telephone interview.
But Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who is also a member of the Ways and Means Committee and who also opposes Mr. Gephardt's initiative, said the current economic climate and public anxiety could mean that this year's initiative has a better chance of becoming law than the majority leader's last attempt.
Mr. Matsui said he opposed Mr. Gephardt because "I don't think you can legislate toughness," and because he thought structural issues like a weak educational system and fractious labor relations lay at the base of the nation's competitiveness problems.
 
Trade Deficit Has Fallen
 The nation's economy grew 4.5 percent in 1988, so the job losses caused by imports were less a concern than now, when the economy is struggling to emerge from a recession. But the trade deficit has narrowed from $152.1 billion in 1987 and $118.5 billion in 1988 to an estimated $70 billion to $80 billion this year, prompting some Administration officials to predict privately that trade will be less of an issue in next year's Presidential campaign than it was in 1988.
Mr. Gephardt said recent shrinkage of the deficit was inadequate. "It is still way too high, way too high, and still presents a real danger to the American economy and the American citizen," he said.
Mr. Gephardt's bill would revive and extensively modify the so-called Super 301 legislation, a watered-down version of Mr. Gephardt's proposals in the mid-1980's that was passed in 1988 and expired last year.
 
Attempt to Require Sanctions
 Super 301 was a series of amendments to Section 301 and other sections of the 1974 Trade Act, and was intended to obligate the Administration to impose sanctions on countries that did not quickly lower barriers toAmerican exports.
Mr. Gephardt's proposals, both now and during his Presidential campaign, have linked the size of a country's trade surplus with the United States to whether it would be cited for unfair trade practices.
Senators Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and John Danforth, Republican of Missouri, introduced legislation two weeks ago that would revive Super 301 but give the Administration more time to negotiate before beginning formal proceedings against another country. No hearings have been held on the bill.
Mr. Matsui and Mr. Baucus sponsored legislation early this year that would require the United States trade representative's office to review each American trade agreement annually and three months before it expired, and to take action if necessary.

HEADLINE: American Express's Rating Cut

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The financial troubles at American Express widened yesterday, as Moody's downgraded the rating on about $7 billion in the company's long-term debt. It was the first time in the American Express Company's history that any of its debt was downgraded by Moody's.
The rating service took the action because of problems in American Express's credit business and because the company faces growing competition. 
 In the summer, the Standard & Poor's Corporation lowered its rating on the company's long-term debt because of turmoil at American Express's securities subsidiary, Shearson Lehman Brothers.
Although the downgrading will raise some financing costs, the action did not affect the company's short-term debt -- an effect that could have hurt American Express's ability to raise money to finance daily operations. But the move will have a much greater impact on confidence in American Express, analysts said, which in many ways depends on its image as a skillfully run company providing financial services for affluent customers.
 
Lack of Improvement
 The action by Moody's Investors Service Inc. is the first indication that recently disclosed problems at American Express may not be improving. Last month, American Express took a $265 million charge against third-quarter earnings, including $155 million in new reserves to pay for losses that resulted from defaults on credit.
In a statement, Moody's said it had downgraded the debt because of the continued deterioration in the quality of the company's assets and because of "competitive challenges in American Express's core Travel Related Services segment." Moody's added that the asset quality pressures could continue for some time.
American Express stock closed yesterday at $18.625, down 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. The loss dropped the share price to just $1 above its 52-week low of $17.625 and nearly 39 percent below its high for the period of $30.375.
Moody's still rates the debt at investment-grade. American Express's domestic debt and Eurodebt was lowered to A-1 from Aa-2, and the preferred stock was lowered to A-2 from Aa-3. Some debt for a number of other divisions, including the American Express Credit Corporation, the American Express Bank and the IDS Life Insurance Company were also reduced.
 
Aware of Concerns
 In a statement, American Express said, "While we're disappointed with the Moody's decision, we were aware of their concerns in view of the economy, the additions to our credit reserves and our recent quarterly results."
The company added that it would continue in its plans to issue new stock, and it said the downgrading should not increase the potential costs of borrowing.
Such a downgrading had long been feared. That concern was a driving factor behind a number of the company's most significant actions in the last two years, including the decision to recapitalize and then purchase all of the public shares it did not already own in the predecessor to Shearson Lehman Brothers.
The fear of a downgrading has been strong because of the dependence of the financial services company on its rating to keep finance costs low. The move will increase those costs slightly for long-term financing.
The troubles at American Express, which began in 1989 when Shearson's debt was put under review by Moody's, grew worse this year as the core business lines began to deteriorate. While the troubles at Shearson came under better control, the company's Travel Related Services division, which oversees the well-known green, gold and platinum charge cards as well as the Optima credit card, turned in its first losses in decades.

HEADLINE: Tour Industry's Busloads of Gold

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLEVELAND

 BODY:
Every year, thousands of tour buses crisscross North America. With each busload of people spending about $4,300 a day on food, lodging and admissions, it is little wonder that thousands of tourist attractions, restaurants and hotels eagerly roll out the welcome mat.
Hoping to cash in on this rare bright spot in their industry, about 2,500 representatives of everything from the Civil War battlefield of Vicksburg, Miss., to the World's Only Corn Palace gathered in the Cleveland Convention Center recently to woo 575 operators of escorted bus tours. 
 The tour-bus business is big and getting bigger, especially in the decade since the deregulation of the bus industry. Enthusiasts say it provides safety in numbers, companionship and a relatively problem-free vacation. Like airline and travel agency packaged tours, which they often supplement, most bus tours are less expensive than the sum of their individual parts.
One suitor in Cleveland was Rozella Hahn, executive director of the convention and visitors bureau of Iowa's seven Amana Colonies. Amana's religious and communal tradition attracts more than 1.5 million visitors a year, including many tour groups. Ms. Hahn came here to reacquaint herself with existing customers and to drum up new ones.
Altogether, some 3,100 people attended the convention of the National Tour Association, whose membership includes most of the nation's escorted tour-bus operators. The members spent much of their time either making or listening to quick pitches for hundreds of the nation's "must see" tour stops.
During the convention, Ms. Hahn and her fellow tourism officials conducted some 70,000 seven-minute meetings between the companies that package, market and operate escorted bus tours and those that own the attractions, hotels and restaurants vying for their business.
 
No Rest This Year
 With 58 appointments crammed into less than seven hours over two days, Ms. Hahn, her turtleneck sweater and jacket set off by a strand of black glass beads, had little time to sing Amana's praises to prospective visitors before she had to dash down the aisle to her next meeting.
"Usually I have a break or two between appointments," Ms. Hahn said, "but this year I'm so busy I even have appointments during my breaks."
In 1986, 44.7 million escorted passengers spent $10.7 billion for transportation, food, lodging and admissions, according to S.E.A./Tourism-Travel Research in New Bedford, Mass. Last year, ridership increased to 60.7 million, and passengers spent $13.8 billion. This year's totals are expected to be even higher, despite the recession and the Persian Gulf war's dampening effect on much of 1991's travel plans.
The typical traveler on an escorted tour is more than 55 years old, the tour association estimates, but the average age is falling steadily -- just as it has fallen among those who take sea cruises.
 
After Tuitions Are Paid
 "What we often see now," said John P. Stachnik, a veteran tour operator and the new president of the association, "is that adults take their first escorted tour in their late 40's or early 50's, about one year after they have paid off their children's tuition and have become empty nesters." About 75 percent of escorted tourists are repeat customers.
It helps that today's buses, unlike the Spartan vehicles of the past, actually give some validity to the industry designation motor coach. They have plush reclining seats, large tinted windows, sun shields and larger bathrooms. Many have television monitors with individual headsets and controls. Just days ago the National Motorcoach Network, a consortium with headquarters in Fairfax, Va., announced plans for a motor coach television network that will distribute videos to coach operators beginning next year.
"Some new buses even have card tables," said Don Dunham of Yankee Line Inc. of Boston, as he showed a visitor through one of Yankee's newest models, parked on the convention floor. Other buses have microwaves, coffee makers and refrigerators.
While group bus tours have been around at least since the 1920's -- Tauck Tours Inc. of Westport, Conn., started in 1925 -- the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 helped to break up what Mr. Stachnik described as "protected fiefdoms" and helped encourage innovation and competition.
The most popular tours are still those to national parks and natural wonders, and to old standbys like Mackinac Island, Mich., and Colonial Williamsburg. But the younger people taking the tours, and the relative fitness of even the older travelers, have prompted tour companies in recent years to add an array of what Mr. Stachnik, the president of Mayflower Tours of Downers Grove, Ill., terms "soft adventure" tours -- everything from ski trips to rafting to mule trips in the Grand Canyon.
And the industry is growing so fast that it offers thousands of tours for specialized events like Mardi Gras, Kentucky Derby Week, athletic events and class reunions.
 
Returning to China
 Many tour operators also combine their bus tours with air, sea and rail transportation, sometimes to overseas destinations. Maupintour Inc. of Lawrence, Kan., one of the nation's biggest escorted tour operators, offers tours not only in the United States but to Europe, Africa, Asia, India and the Middle East. Next year it will add new tours to the Netherlands and the Canary Islands, and it will return to China for the first time since 1989, when the Beijing Government crushed the pro-democracy movement.
In contrast to Maupintour, 80 percent of whose group tours combine bus and airplane, only 5 percent of the group tours of Eyre Tour and Travel Ltd. involve air travel. Instead, the family-owned business in Glenelg, Md., offers an extensive range of domestic tours using its own 50 buses and limousines.
 
Tour Operators Courted
 The star attractions of the convention were neither the new machines nor the many educational seminars on subjects like ecotourism, professional liabilities and personal motivation. They were the tour operators, who on average change about a third of their tours in any given year. They sometimes also switch from hotels and restaurants whose standards of quality and service have slipped.
Operators also switch to hotels and restaurants that offer them better discounts. Success in the highly competitive tour industry is closely tied to the ability of tour operators to keep prices low, which means striking the right deal with suppliers.
In many of her seven-minute appointments, Ms. Hahn began by extolling the Amana Colonies' new 300-seat theater, then -- flipping to the appropriate photos -- proceeded to remind her hosts of the 12 family-style restaurants, 6 museums, factories where visitors can see furniture being made by hand, more than 500 motel rooms, 3 bakeries and a new golf course.
"It's an absolutely beautiful thing," she assured one bus operator, inviting the tour operator's gaze to linger over the photo of the golf course in all its greenery. Ms. Hahn used her last minute or so to throw in a good word about some other Iowa attractions, including a nearby Amish community, the Hoover Library in West Branch and the birthplace of John Wayne in Winterset.
The tour operators have also been busy. The 300 or so scheduled appointments for Brownell Tours of Birmingham, Ala., included visits from representatives of Carlsbad Caverns, N.M., the Chattanooga River Boat Company, the Alabama Shakespeare Festival in Montgomery and the Corn Palace, an auditorium decorated with 3,000 bushels of corn in Mitchell, S.D.
"We do between 300 and 400 motorcoach tours a year," said Bill Sellmer of Brownell Tours, "and right now we're looking ahead to where to go next year and in 1993." A colleague, Marie Byers, added, "Every year we try to find something new, and to improve on what we have."

HEADLINE: U.S. Mail-Order Merchants Try Japanese Market

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
When its warehouses are bursting with expensive ostrich boots, fancy fringe jackets and stacks of twill fishing bags, where is a mail-order merchant to turn?
To Japan. 
 At the suggestion of a big Chicago printer, the R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company, a dozen mail-order merchants are collaborating on a catalogue designed to sell slices of Americana to Japanese consumers.
Land's End, Tweeds, L. L. Bean, Orvis and eight others each have two pages in the catalogue, which is expected to arrive in 50,000 Japanese homes later this week. Using the catalogue, Japanese shoppers can order from a handful of each company's products or order a complete catalogue from any of the merchants.
A second mailing, to 500,000 homes in Japan, is planned for February.
 
Donnelly Picking Up the Tab
 Although L. L. Bean has already been sending its own catalogue to Japan, the idea for the group effort came from R. R. Donnelley, which prints and mails catalogues for many of the nation's largest mail-order retailers and is picking up the cost of the Japanese experiment.
The American mail-order business is as slow as the rest of the economy, and Japan, after the United States, is the second-largest consumer products market in the world. Luxury merchants like Tiffany & Company have opened stores in Japan, but most United States retailers have been deterred by the prohibitively high cost of Japanese real estate.
"The Japanese are hungry for a certain kind of Americana." said George Rosenbaum, president of the Chicago market research firm Leo J. Shapiro and Associates.
Mail-order retailing has been slow to catch on in Japan, but the American merchants are banking on the popularity of name-brand American products among fashionable Japanese.
With the help of a Japanese advertising firm hired by R.R. Donnelley, the first catalogue is carefully tailored to the Japanese market. Retailers were told to emphasize fashionable apparel and to avoid including electronics products or products that were labeled "Made in Korea." Japan and Korea are trade rivals.
For a nation of golf buffs, the first mailing includes a golf ball personalizer and personalized golf tees from Austad's golf catalogue. There is also lots of denim (acid- and stone-washed) and things like silver-plated bolo ties for the well-dressed Eastern Westerner. The Sheplers Western Wear section of the group catalogue offers, in addition to $850 cowboy boots, a $1,400 lamb blazer that would do any Texan proud.
The mail-order business in the United States has slowed recently after years of growth because of the weak economy, increased mailing costs and heavy competition.
But in Japan, the mail-order market is still growing, accounting for $11 billion, or 1.3 percent, of the country's retail sales in 1990, said James H. Stewart, senior vice president of Donnelley's catalogue group. In the United States last year, mail-order sales accounted for more than $30 billion in sales, or 4.8 percent of total retail sales, Mr. Stewart said.
Japanese consumers are still becoming accustomed to shopping by mail. Katsuhiko Nitta, vice president of Mitsukoshi U.S.A., an American division of the one of Japan's largest department store retailers, said early efforts at mail order merchandising in Japan had not been successful.
"Shopping by mail was not a preferred method," he said. "They like the old way, turning over and handling the merchandise." Mr. Nitta said, however, that the resistance to mail-order shopping was receding and that Mitsukoshi was increasing its activities in that area.
New customers' names are the key to growth in mail order. But until recently, Japanese mail-order companies have been unwilling to rent or sell their lists of names to foreigners. "That has been the big barrier," Mr. Stewart said. R. R. Donnelley, he said, had convinced the Japanese companies to provide names of Japanese consumers by persuading them that exchanging information on customers was the best way to build the mail-order business.
The cover of the catalogue, called American Showcase, features a photograph of a woman with blond hair and blue eyes peering over a Japanese-style hand fan emblazoned with an American flag. The catalogue is printed in Japanese.
The 2-ounce, 28-page catalogues will be mailed from the United States for about 24 cents apiece, compared with more than a dollar apiece if they were mailed in Japan, according to Mr. Stewart of R. R. Donnelley.
Donnelley research found that Japanese were more comfortable dealing with a venture based in Japan. As a result, Japanese shoppers will send their orders to an R. R. Donnelley facility in Japan, which will fax the orders each day to the various retailers in the United States.
Mr. Stewart said merchants were not charged to be included in the first catalogue, but that they would be charged for future editions. He said an additional dozen companies would be included in a second catalogue to be mailed early next year.

HEADLINE: Prescribing a Dose of Confidence

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
America's business leaders are usually more comfortable talking about their companies' bottom lines than the mood of the country's body politic. But as the economy continues to flounder, they are becoming less reticent about sounding off about what needs to be done.
The problem, as many executives see it, has more to do with sagging spirits than with dollars and cents. And their antidote to the nation's economic anxiety depends less on the mechanics of monetary or fiscal policy than on clear signs of some leadership from Washington. 
 Jerry Della Femina, a New York advertising executive, says the American economy needs a cheerleader President, another Ike or Ronald Reagan -- a Mario Cuomo, in fact, he says. James M. Zimmerman, chief of the Federated and Allied department store chains, based in Cincinnati, says Washington should acknowledge that the economy is in trouble and come up with a plan of action promptly. H. Ross Perot, the Texas entrepreneur, admonishes politicians to get back to the basics, as does R. David Thomas, the founder of Wendy's, the hamburger chain whose worldwide headquarters are in Dublin, Ohio.
In more than a dozen interviews, occupants of the executive suite, like other Americans, said they were dismayed by what they see as partisanship and just plain perverseness in Congress. "Can they govern or what?" asked Curt Bradbury, an Arkansas banker.
Old-fashioned tonics like easier money and fiscal stimulus are not out of favor. Many of the executives favor cuts in taxes, especially taxes on capital gains, and in interest rates. But for the most part they emphasized other means when asked their prescriptions for the nation's ills.
 
H. Ross Perot
Chairman, Perot Systems Corp. Herndon, Va.
 We're approaching the 1992 election. The economy's still in a slump. We'll do what we did in 1988. Think of a great old race horse with sore legs. Just before the election, we'll get the horse out of the barn, shoot up its legs with painkillers and hope that we can win one more race.
All those quick fixes, like running interest rates down or fiddling with taxes, won't work. The only real trick is hunkering down and doing what we know we have to do.
Step One: You've got to say to the White House, Congress, the Democrats and Republicans: "Stop acting like little boys in a schoolyard fight. Link arms. The nation's at risk."
Step Two: Make our Government sensitive to the voters, not to PAC's. Tell politicians they can't give themselves a raise unless they put it on the ballot. Change the laws to hold elections on Saturday and Sunday so that the average guy has more than an hour in the morning and an hour at night to vote.
Step Three: Stop spending beyond our means. We've got to draw a line in the sand. These people work for you and me, but they don't act like our servants. Close the barber shop, the gym, the parking lot. Make them pay for it. Ground every airplane for Federal officials except Air Force One. Let 'em fly commercial, get in line, wait three hours, get their baggage lost. We're going broke, and they're flying around in our airplanes.
I watch these C.E.O.'s wandering around with their blow-dried hair, their $3,000 suits, their 23-year-old trophy wives and I think, "These are the stewards of millions of jobs." I'd give anything if the old man in the White House would call them in and tell them: "I'll support you, or I'll tear your head off. I'm tired of excuses. I want the jobs to stay here; I want the TV's made here. No excuses. Let's go back to basics."
 
T. J. Rodgers
President, chief executive, Cypress Semiconductor Corp., San Jose, Calif.
 I believe that Government deficit spending is really hurting us. By sucking huge amounts of money out of the economy, our Government makes it difficult for high-tech companies to get cheap debt and cheap equity to build plants and hire people. Expensive capital is kind of like lead poisoning. It's always in your system, always weighing on you, always slowing you down relative to your competitors.
I've never wanted to mess with the Constitution, but I've come to a firm conclusion that we need a balanced-budget amendment. I've watched Gramm-Rudman fall apart. It taught me that every bona fide effort to control spending would fail if it was subject to politics. You can't leave politicians under a system that rewards them for spending and punishes them if they don't bring home the projects and expect them to respond differently.
 
R. David Thomas
Founder, senior chairman, Wendy's International, Dublin, Ohio
 The Government has got to stop hurting business and help it instead. The luxury tax that was passed last fall didn't hurt the rich, but it did put 17,000 people out of work. The boating industry was hurt, and recreational vehicles are almost dead. Congress needs to repeal that tax. Washington can't do everything, but it can stop hurting the people who create jobs.
We should take the peace dividend and use to it take care of the problems that we've got. We have a big drug problem, a big alcohol problem. We have people who don't want to work, and we have welfare programs that break up families. Every city, every neighborhood, has got to work on its problems.
I hate the Democrats and the Republicans when they don't take care of what they are supposed to be taking care of. We elected them to take care of the people, not special interests. I think there should be a limitation on politicians' terms. Let them make the laws for a couple of terms and then let them go home to live under those laws.
 
James M. Zimmerman
Chairman, chief operating officer, Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores Corp., Cincinnati
 The key is leadership in Washington: first to deal with perceptions, then to deal with reality.
It's critical that consumers have hope. Washington should send a strong message to consumers that the Administration and Congress will do whatever is necessary.
Instead of bickering, the Government needs to acknowledge there's a problem. And then it needs to do something promptly. Washington not only should continue to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower rates, but Congress and the Administration need to consider tax cuts.
The fixation on the budget deficit is wrong. Some action on taxes would send consumers a message of hope. If you want to have a big budget deficit, let the economy go into the tank next year. Compared to that alternative, a tax cut is cheap.
 
Curt Bradbury
President, Worthen Bank, Little Rock, Ark.
 What is retarding the economy is the inability of small banks to lend into their community to revive their local economy. You've got a dynamic driven by fear, and that fear translates into regulatory stingency that then translates into a sectoral credit crunch. In our part of the country home building is done on spec. Well that's virtually gone.
The jawboning from George Herbert Walker Bush, I've noticed, is having a positive effect on the regulatory cadre that comes into our bank. But the dynamic is being driven by bank bashers in Congress.
In the face of all this, when small banks cannot lend to revive their local economies, Congress cannot pass a bank reform bill. Isn't that staggering? Can they govern or what? The Dingell-Gonzalez compromise, in terms of how it affects the economy, is worse than anything the Judiciary Committee did on Hill-Thomas. On the one hand people decry the credit crunch. On the other hand, the answer from enlightened leadership is to bash the banks some more.
The simple answer is to pass the Senate bank reform bill. The more likely scenario is that we will have to abort what we have now, get a bill that recapitalizes the bank insurance fund and adds teeth to the regulatory process. But let's don't address the issues of reform in this environment.
 
F. Kenneth Iverson
Chairman, chief executive, Nucor Corp., Charlotte, N.C.
 Partly, we're just washing out the excesses of the last half of the 80's. Corporations still have too many management layers, too many administrators, too many fringe benefits for executives. When you listen to all those people who are restructuring, taking thousands of jobs out, you wonder why in the devil they put them in in the first place. You don't need a new manager every time you hire six people. That was an excess.
But we're also getting a poor selection of qualified individuals, whether for blue-collar jobs or jobs that require college degrees. That's the fault of our education system.
I'm not sure that the Government can come out with any grand program to improve education. One of the primary problems of schools is the same problem American companies have. Here in Charlotte, we have an administrator for every teacher. It used to be where we had an administrator for every 10 teachers. Like everything else, it's a bloated bureaucracy. We've gotten into some very bad habits.
 
Richard D. Besser
President, chief executive, Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co., Utica, N. Y.
 I'm a Republican and much as I hate to say it, a tax cut for the middle class will motivate spending. After Reagan cut taxes in 1981, the economy just soared. People are saying that we need a meaningful tax cut and that it has to be revenue neutral. But that's not possible. If we take away every time we give, it won't be meaningful. We've got to be aggressive about lowering taxes, and we're going to have to break the budget agreement.
 
Jerry Della Femina
President, Della Femina, McNamee Inc., New York
 The problem is confidence -- confidence in our leaders.
George Bush is not leading the cheering squad. Since Truman, the U.S. economy has only done well when we've had a cheerleader in the White House. Now everybody's whispering the D-word. And there's no one connected with the Government that can bring it back with a speech.
My clients are the smartest, the most conservative people in the world. They're not going to spend money. They don't believe the President. I believe my bookie, who says business has never been so bad, more than I believe the President.
When the stock market dropped a zillion points in '87, reporters asked Reagan "What's wrong with the stock market?" The helicopter was going so he yelled back: "I can't hear you. Everything seems fine to me." Instead of screaming "String up the President, it's his fault," everybody said, "He said that it's O.K., so we guess it's O.K." And we came back. And we came back.
Whatever people thought of Ronald Reagan, he had a certain credibility. Let's face it, we were in a recession in '80. Carter was saying: "Wear sweaters. You have to suffer; the world is bad; everything is terrible. This is the time to tighten your belts." Boom. There's an inauguration. Reagan gets up and makes a speech. The hostages are set free. The economy starts sailing up and doesn't stop until he leaves. For better or worse, people believed this man.
The only person in politics now who can inspire confidence is Mario Cuomo. He may be a Hamlet-like character, but there's a sense that he's telling the truth. And this is a Republican speaking.
 
Benjamin F. Edwards 3d
Chairman, chief executive A. G. Edwards Inc., St. Louis
 The crucial thing is: Are we or are we not competitive in world markets? We do have our problems, like the S.& L.'s, but I think that American industry is healthier now than I have ever seen it.
We're in a fundamentally strong position unless Washington puts layers of costs -- whether it's tariffs or taxes -- on industry. If our costs get inflated, we either operate at a loss or pass those costs on as price increases. And if we give price increases to a market that doesn't have to pay 'em, people will say "Look, we don't want your expensive stuff."
So ultimately we've got to keep our costs down. Greenspan has it just right. Inflation is his No. 1 fear. He gets a lot of grief from politicians, but inflation is the No. 1 worry.
 
G. Lee Thompson
Chairman, chief executive, Smith Corona Corp. New Canaan, Conn.
 We have to tighten up our trade laws. We tend to bend over backwards to be fair. No other country in the world is as liberal. The biggest protectionist in the world is Japan. It's time to get tough.
 
Karen Horn
Chief executive, Bank One, Cleveland
 I think we ought to put monetary and fiscal policies in place that we think are good for the long term. Money growth is a bit too slow. I think you'd want to get money growing at a reasonable 3 percent to 4 percent rate.
There's a lot of talk about changing taxes to somehow give the economy a short-term lift. But I guess my view of tax cuts or tax redesigns is that they take a long time to propose, they take a long time to get implemented and, thirdly, they take an even longer time to take effect. With these big deficits, I don't think we have at our hands the fiscal-policy tools to do what we used to be able to do. I also believe if we started doing things with cutting taxes, and the financial markets thought it would worsen the deficit problem, we wouldn't entirely get a positive effect.
Long-run fiscal policy should be that the Government would not absorb a significant proportion of the private saving and allow those savings to be used by business for investment. There's a wonderful quote by Washington Irving, "When traveling by stagecoach, it is often a comfort to shift one's position and be bruised in a new place." The idea is that if we take actions that we hope help us in the short run, we might find that they are bruising and damaging in the long run.
 
Charls E. Walker
Chairman Charls E. Walker Associates, Washington
 The sluggishness of this recovery partly reflects the markedly lower rate of investment in this country in the 1980's. The chickens have got to come home to roost sooner or later, and they may be coming home now.
Tax-policy actions alone raised our capital costs in the 1980's by 23 percent. Congress and the Adminstration should start reversing that bad tax policy on investment. We should show the world that we're going to have a sensible, competitive tax policy. High real interest rates also raised our capital costs. Quite obviously we should move that deficit back to balance.
The most powerful bang for the buck is the investment tax credit for new equipment.
One thing that's so disturbing about this town is that we're got an "inside the Beltway" warp and our own debates over taxing capital are completely out of sync with academics like the Shovens, Krugmans, Summers and Boskins. The old distinction between liberals and conservatives on such things as equipment investment is obsolete. Those men stand on a dime.
If nothing happens in 1992, I would hope that the Democratic and Republican leaderships would sit down and draw up a new bipartisan budget agreement in January 1993 that would include a value-added tax, a capital gains tax cut and an investment tax credit.
 
E. W. Deavenport

 I think we should use the peace dividend for reducing the deficit, lowering taxes and new programs for people -- all three. In the short term, one of the better things we could do would be to take some of this money and put it into infrastructure spending, provide jobs and stimulate the economy. A lot of the infrastructure is starting to wear out. Tax cuts are also very, very important. I'd certainly like to see continuing talk on capital gains reductions. That would be a stimulus to the economy and to investment.

HEADLINE: Zambia's Democratic Shock to Africa

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUSAKA, Zambia, Nov. 4

 BODY:
The peaceful and speedy transition in Zambia from Kenneth D. Kaunda's authoritarian leadership to the democratically elected Government of Frederick Chiluba is likely to send shock waves into Africa's long-entrenched regimes and embolden opposition groups, international election observers here say.
They say the victory of Mr. Chiluba, leader of this country's labor union congress, and his new-born opposition party against Mr. Kaunda, one of Africa's "big men," should hasten Africa's "second independence" -- the end of the end of the post-colonial autocrats who rule their countries as personal kingdoms. 
 Now that an African country has achieved the political pluralism that Western aid donors have been seeking, the United States plans to provide inducements to others to follow Zambia's example, Assistant Secretary of State Herman J. Cohen said over the weekend.
 
Pressure on Old-Timers
 Few predict the lightning transformations that swept Eastern Europe in 1989. But the optimists believe that the example set here will put pressure on all the old-time leaders, one of whom, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, the 86-year-old President of the Ivory Coast, took office in 1960.
Former President Jimmy Carter, who headed an election-monitoring group here, said, "It will be much more difficult for the oppressors to keep their people oppressed."
Others were not so sanguine. An African ambassador who watched the elections here as part of a delegation from the Organization of African Unity was more cautious. "Some of the strongmen could react with fear and dig their heels in," he said. Several African ambassadors representing their countries in Zambia were "outraged," he said, that the O.A.U. had given credence to the elections by sending a delegation.
 
Vary From Country to Country
 Thus, the impact of the Zambian elections will vary from country to country on this continent, depending on the status of opposition groups, the character of the governments and the personality of individual leaders.
In the Sudan, for example, where a military dictatorship dominated by Islamic fundamentalists is in charge, it will be difficult for the Zambian result to even register. One of the Sudanese military leaders recently called multiparty democracy as alien to Africa as a "three-piece suit in the desert."
In West Africa, movements toward democratization already taking place through national conferences that bring together governments and opposition groups, may get bolder, the international observers said here.
But the Zambian experience, they said, will reverberate most acutely in East and Central Africa. There, former British colonies like Zambia, formerly Northern Rhodesia, inherited institutions -- a judiciary, a press and professional organizations -- that had not been entirely eroded and could be used by an opposition, said Richard Joseph, a professor of political science at the Carter Center of Emory University in Atlanta.
 
Looking to History
 Mr. Joseph cited Kenya, headed by President Daniel arap Moi, and Zimbabwe, now a one-party state that has been led since full independence in 1980 by President Robert Mugabe. "Moi and Mugabe are going to have to take a look and decide: 'Do I want to be a Kaunda or a Mobutu in the historical record?' "
Mr. Kaunda will be remembered, Mr. Joseph said, as having led his country to independence and then having agreed to multiparty democracy. By contrast, he predicted, President Mobutu Seke Seso of Zaire, who resists power sharing as his country seems to disintegrate, will go down as a dictator who ruined his land.
Mr. Carter expressed hope that in Kenya the Zambian experience would infuse the opposition with more courage to stand up to coercion.
While few doubt that there will now be increased calls in Kenya for elections, Kenyans and other Africans say it may take time for the pressure to mount on either President Moi or President Mugabe as it did on Mr. Kaunda. The former Zambian President, apparently feeling little choice, legalized political party activity last December after food riots and an attempted coup. Mr. Moi has categorically refused to allow the formation of opposition parties and threatened to crush demonstrators "like rats."
 
Economic Advantage
 Mr. Moi has the relative advantage in Kenya of a stronger economy. Mr. Chiluba conceded in an interview that his campaign was helped by conditions in Zambia -- a lively labor movement and almost universal economic despair -- that did not exist in Kenya.
On the diplomatic front, the Zambian elections may have a vital effect: It will be harder for the British Government, the main foreign backer of Mr. Moi, to maintain its public silence about his conduct.
A British Conservative legislator, Anna Nicholson, here as an election observer, said she planned to raise the contrast between Zambia and Kenya in Parliament this week. "I think it's time we came out in the open for multiparty democracy," she said. "I think it is a disgrace that Moi has been able to get away with it for so long."

HEADLINE: Senate Expected to Approve Gates by a Sizeable Margin

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
The Senate opened debate today on the nomination of Robert M. Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence, as the endorsement of two leading Democrats helped assure him of a comfortable margin of approval when the Senate votes on Tuesday.
Supporters of the 48-year-old nominee, who is the deputy national security adviser, made opening statements that praised him as a man of competence, remorse and experience who had learned from his mistakes and would ably reorganize the Central Intelligence Agency and its sister intelligence agencies. 
 Detractors dismissed Mr. Gates as an ambitious, unimaginative bureaucrat who would be beholden to the White House and the wrong person to lead the intelligence community in the post-cold war era.
Mr. Gates was nominated for the intelligence post in 1987 but withdrew his name after questions were raised in the Senate about his role in the Iran-contra affair while he served as a senior intelligence official. Although similar questions came up again this year, the passage of time and Mr. Gates's service as deputy national security adviser since 1989 muted concerns in the Senate.
 
Gates's Integrity Is Praised
 In announcing his support for Mr. Gates, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who was a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence from 1981 to 1989, praised his integrity, experience and his cooperation with Congress. Senator Bentsen said these were necessary ingredients "to do the job that has to be done."
Senator Claiborne Pell also announced that he would vote for Mr. Gates. "I realize he has made errors in the past," said the Rhode Island Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But he added that the endorsement of the nominee by the Senate's intelligence panel, by an 11-to-4 vote, as well as his own conversations and correspondence with Mr. Gates had satisifed him.
Senator David L. Boren, the Oklahoma Democrat who is chairman of the Intelligence Committee and who earlier had lavished praise on Mr. Gates, thanked both Mr. Pell and Mr. Bentsen. Mr. Boren has telephoned or met with several Democratic colleagues urging them to vote for Mr. Gates.
But two Senate Democrats, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bill Bradley of New Jersey, faulted Mr. Gates for what they called his pessimistic, misguided cold war views that they said made him blind to irreversible changes in the Soviet Union. And Senator Jim Exon, the Nebraska Democrat, announced that he would vote against the nominee.
Today's discussions also became a debate over the extent to which the C.I.A. failed to predict the problems in the Soviet economy and the weakness of the entire Soviet system.
Mr. Moynihan said, "For a generation the C.I.A. told successive Presidents everything they needed to know about the Soviet Union except the fact that it was about to fall apart."
It was only in 1989, he added, when the Soviet Union was about to collapse, that the agency began to revise its view. "By confirming Mr. Gates, the Senate will confirm this revisionist view," he added.
 
Criticism of Administration
 Mr. Bradley concurred, faulting the nominee for what he called his lack of intellectual curiosity, political judgment and managment skills.
"How can we be assured he won't make the same mistake with China?" he asked.
Mr. Bradley also sought to use the nomination to indict the Bush Administration for failing to predict the changes in Moscow. "The fundamental question posed by this nomiantion is not about Bob Gates, but about this Administration and its failure to understand the emerging post-cold war world," he said.
In rebuttal, Mr. Boren interjected into the record excerpts from a number of previously classified C.I.A. reports from 1979 on that he said proved that the agency had documented the decline of the Soviet economy, saying it was an overstatement to say that in the last decade the intelligence community's record was "totally wrong."
 
Excerpts Unclear
 Because the excerpts were so brief and some of their conclusions equivocal, it was difficult to assess the extent to which they showed "conclusively," Mr. Boren said, that the C.I.A. "got it right."
One 1982 C.I.A. assessment released by Mr. Boren, for example, noted "general social malaise, ethnic tensions, consumer frustrations and political discontent." But it added, "How these internal problems will ultimately challenge and affect the regime, however, is open to debate and considerable uncertainty."
A September 1985 C.I.A. assessment stated that the Soviet system could not simultaneously maintain growth in defense spending, satisfy consumer demand, invest in economic modernization and support client-state economies, but its conclusion did not predict the failure of the Soviet economy. It only stated, "It is an open question how much economic improvement will occur and how long it can be sustained."

HEADLINE: Defying Stereotype, Woman Runs for Salt Lake Mayor

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 2

 BODY:
If Deedee Corradini wins Tuesday's mayoral election and becomes the first woman to lead Salt Lake, another old stereotype about this city will crash with a thud.
Ms. Corradini is not a Mormon. She has been divorced. And she vows to bring more members of ethnic and racial minorities into City Hall. 
 "Don't vote for me because I'm a woman, but because I'm qualified," Ms. Corradini often tells voters. "But if you think my being a woman is a bonus -- great."
Public opinion polls show Ms. Corradini, 47 years old, who owns a management consultant business, leading David Buhler, 34, the State Director of Commerce.
The election is non-partisan, but Ms. Corradini is a Democrat, and Mr. Buhler is a Republican in a city that tends to elect Democrats as Mayor.
And Mr. Buhler, a Mormon who says he "neither advertises that fact nor denies it," acknowledged that being a Republican "is not an advantage here."
But he said voters want a candidate with expertise in government. "When it comes to managing government," he said, "I'm the candidate with real world experience."
 
Big Group Is Undecided
 A poll prepared for publication last Sunday in The Salt Lake City Tribune showed Ms. Corradini with an eight-point lead. In the poll, conducted by Insight Research, Ms. Corradini was favored by 45 percent of those questioned while Mr. Buhler was favored by 37 percent; 18 percent were undecided. The poll, which questioned 600 prospective voters, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Support for Ms. Corradini was nearly identical among men and women.
Seeking to capitalize on the prospect of being the city's first woman Mayor, billboards for Ms. Corradini declare: "It's time."
In Salt Lake City, many voters said they would support Ms. Corradini, in part, because she is a woman.
"I choose politicians the same way I pick a doctor," said Jamie Kamm, a 30-year-old genetic counselor, as she pulled two children from car seats. "When all other things are equal, I go with the woman."
There does not appear to be a significant philosophical difference between the two candidates. Indeed, some Democrats said they would vote for Ms. Corradini, but disapproved of her close ties to Republicans. She attended a $300-a-plate fund-raising dinner for President Bush, for example.
 
'They're Both Acting Civil'
 "It hasn't been a dirty campaign," said Horace Reschke, a genealogist. "They're both acting civil, handling themselves in an intelligent, responsible manner. So I think we're safe either way."
Ms. Corradini would not be the city's first non-Morman Mayor. The current Mayor, Palmer DePaulis, who is not seeking re-election, is Roman Catholic.
If the election of Ms. Corradini would come as a another jolt to the stereotype of Salt Lake as a city run by men in which women are expected to tend to the home, a victory by Nancy Boyasko for a City Council seat would be a real shocker. Ms. Boyasko is a member of the Socialist Workers Party. She finishing second in the primary, trailing the front-runner, Alan Hardman, by 400 votes. She said her Socialist affiliation has not frightened or offended voters.
"We're not insulated in Salt Lake," said Ms. Boyasko, a 34-year-old laborer for the Kendicott Copper Mine. "People here know what it's like to go from paycheck to paycheck."
In the mayoral race, Ms. Corradini expects to spend about $150,000, about twice the amount spent by Mr. Buhler.
In recent years, the economy in this area has shown robust growth. Corporate employers are fond of its relatively low wage scale, plentiful numbers of young workers and ethos of hard work.
 
3,000 New Jobs in a Year
 In the past year, the region has gained 19 new employers, adding about 3,000 workers. Another 21 companies have expanded, adding 1,500 new jobs.

HEADLINE: Darman Sees Deadlock On Plan to Spur Growth

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
Republicans have decided to delay any push aimed at spurring economic growth, because such an effort now would lead to "political skirmishing" and nervous bond markets, Richard G. Darman, the budget director, said today.
No legislation could be passed now, he told reporters. Mr. Darman said that the Republican Congressional leaders who emerged from the White House on Oct. 17 promising legislation by the next week had later concluded that the only certain and immediate consequence of such a proposal would be "an unproductive fight of the class-warfare type." 
 Any measure intended to spur growth would include a renewed appeal for lower taxes on capital gains, a proposal that most Democrats say would be helpful mainly to the wealthy.
Besides the "class warfare" argument, Mr. Darman said, there was a strong risk of a "bidding war" that would threaten last year's budget agreement.
 
'Sound' and 'Sustainable'
 He said that in later meetings with the same Rebublican Congressional leaders, "a fairly strong majority of us concluded" that it would be better to wait until next year. That would provide time, he said, to "get our own act together on a basis that is not only sound programatically, but sustainable politically."
In the waning days of a Congressional session, he said, Democrats could control what issues the public paid attention to. Next year, with a Presidential campaign on, it would be easier for the Bush Administration to make its case, he said.
While Mr. Darman charged that Congressional inaction on several Administration proposals had hurt the economy, he identified one area of potential quick agreement: extended unemployment benefits.
"If there's good will we could have a bill this week," he said.
Mr. Darman said he believed that money could be found to pay for a program costing $4 billion or a little more. The most recent Democratic proposal, which stalled Friday in the House Ways and Means Committee, would cost $5.5 billion.
 
Key Leaders Out of Town
 Otherwise, there was no significant action on the issue today, with Congressional leaders like Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Speaker of the House, and Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, out of town until Tuesday.
Mr. Darman also accused Congress of disregarding some measures the Administration had offered. President Bush was not sitting back and waiting before proposing measures to help the economy, he insisted. Instead, the budget director said, "Congress has failed to give him a number of things he has requested to deal with the economy."
These included proposals to lower the tax on capital gains, banking changes, highway authorization, an extension of the research and development tax break and a plan to allow Individual Retirement Acount money to be spent on home ownership.
Mr. Darman complained that every bill in Congress "threatens to make the banking industry less competitive," while the Administration sought to make the industry more competitive
On the highway authorization measure, he said he had expected the bipartisan interest in developing the nation's infrastructure to produce action long before today. Now, he said, he had just heard that a four-month House-Senate conference was likely. "There's no need to do that," he said. "That bill could be settled in 24 hours if people had a responsible interest in trying to sort out the differences."
 
Education Changes Needed
 Mr. Darman said that in the long run the economy could not be made competitive without education changes. "We simply will not adequately improve our productivity if we don't get a fairly radical reform of our educational system," he said.
He said Congress was ready to accept some elements of a necessary program, such as setting national goals and moving toward a national testing program.
"But then what you really need badly is the pressure in the system to change, to reform, when people don't meet the goals," Mr. Darman added. For that, he said: "I think you need choice in the system. That is very much harder to get legislatively."
He said pending House legislation was "permissive" toward allowing parents to choose what school their children could attend, "which is a step forward," but the Senate was flatly opposed to Administration proposals that would let Federal aid follow students who wanted to attend private schools.

Whereas, and So Forth
 The model in black lace waltzed down the runway at the Hotel Pierre, made a turn and posed, like Camille in your high school play.
"That is a very pretty dress," said a woman. 
 "Do you think I dare?" wondered another.
"I really don't think you could," remarked the first.
Time to consider fashion again, even though a lot of people are saying no one is in the mood.
It is spring fashion week in New York, and if anyone had any doubts, Mayor David N. Dinkins proclaimed it so, with lots of whereases and therefores. The city assigned additional police coverage to Seventh Avenue between 37th and 40th Streets, where many of the designer showrooms are; the Sanitation Department scheduled an extra sweep-up in the garment district to make a good show for the out-of-town retailers and journalists.
None of this was any consolation to Eleanor Brenner, the Seventh Avenue designer, who had a trunk of 40 expensive samples stolen last week from outside her showroom. They found the trunk, empty, in the Times Square subway station.
"They probably sold the clothes for $5 each," said Ms. Brenner, adding that one of the beaded jackets had cost $2,000 to make.
"It's an ugly situation," she said, "but the show will go on."
 
Toast of the Titans
 The spring showings begin at a time when many people have been talking about a new era in fashion, a new consumer spirit and so forth. In one sense it is a new era, as two of the titans of the industry, Ira Neimark, the chairman of Bergdorf Goodman, and Marvin S. Traub, the chairman of Blooingdale's, have announced their retirements this winter.
There are so many tribute-party invitations, no one can see straight. Mr. Neimark, who was honored at the "21" Club this summer and at the Museum of Wine in Paris last month, will be toasted at a black-tie dinner-dance tonight at the Plaza and with cocktails at the Pierre tomorrow. Mr. Traub, who was honored by the French at the Hotel de Crillon a week ago, will get the black-tie treatment at the Waldorf-Astoria next Monday.
Kind of a long goodbye.
 
The Enduring Video
 Several designers have either canceled their shows or come up with new ways to present their collections. Norma Kamali has decided to produce and direct videos for her three spring lines.
"The shows are boring, abstracted," Ms. Kamali said. "Walking on the runway has little to do with the street. Video has a much longer life than the show itself."
She added that the cost of the videos -- $100,000 to $150,000 -- is about the same as for a fashion show.
For the first time, Ms. Kamali will sell her sportswear to stores other than Bloomingdale's, which has sold it exclusively for three years. The less expensive clothes ($15 to $200) are based on the white shirt: body shirts, shirt jackets and shirt dresses.
"These are basics that have nothing to do with fashion," Ms. Kamali said. "The timing is right, with the economy being so terrible."
 
New Backing for Shamask
 Ronaldus Shamask, who has been out of circulation after the withdrawal of his Japanese financial backer, Mitsukoshi, is back.
Mr. Shamask has signed a licensing agreement with Barneys New York to make two men's wear collections exclusively for that store. Both lines -- with suits at $900 to $1,100 and at $700 to $800 -- are for "the streetwise businessman," he said, and will be available in the spring.
"Having the men's wear license will free me to do a proper women's collection," he said. "Before I start, I will rethink the needs of the consumer. There are a lot of clothes out there."

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY VOTES, AND FLORIO IS ISSUE

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Nov. 4

 BODY:
With control of both houses of the New Jersey Legislature at stake on Tuesday, about 1.7 million voters who have been lobbied for months in one of the state's most expensive midterm elections will choose their legislators and, perhaps, determine the fortunes of Gov. Jim Florio.
Though Mr. Florio's name will not be on the ballot for the election, which will fill all 120 seats in the State Senate and the Assembly, his $2.8 billion tax increase has been the pivotal issue in the campaign, and the vote's outcome is sure to change the way New Jersey is governed.
 
'The Real Question'
 
 Mr. Florio was not making predictions today; indeed, he seemed to be looking beyond Tuesday's results. "The Governor will work with whoever wins the election to move ahead on confronting some of the people's real concerns," said Jon Shure, Mr. Florio's spokesman. "We're at the point where the real question is, regardless of who wins, how do you govern a month down the road?"
If the Republicans take control of the two houses, in which Democrats have long held majorities, one of the first items of state business is likely to be a Republican pledge to reduce the sales tax to 6 percent from 7 percent. Mr. Shure said that the Republicans had yet to say how they would replace the $500 million such a reduction would cost and that Mr. Florio would resist their effort until they come up with an acceptable revenue source.
On the other hand, if the Democrats retain control of the Legislature, they and Mr. Florio will have to make a priority of restoring the coalition of labor, teachers and urban voters that had traditionally supported them. The unions representing state workers have been dismayed by budget cuts and layoffs. The teachers were angered by the diversion of $360 million from education aid to property tax relief, and low-income voters opposed the sales tax increase.
Mr. Shure, the Governor's spokesman, insisted that his remarks about working with the election's winners were not a concession of victory to the Republicans, adding that neither the Governor nor anyone else knows what will happen on Tuesday.
 
What the People Want
 "But whether he is dealing with a Democratic or Republican Legislature or one that is split, the people don't want to hear politics as usual," Mr. Shure said. "They want a health-care program that holds down costs and leadership that will get us out of the national recession, and they don't care about party labels."
Such talk suggests that the Republicans might be dealing with a conciliatory Democratic Governor if they take control of one or both houses of the Legislature on Tuesday, and that idea came as a surprise to Jeff Michaels, the executive director of the Republican State Committee.
"That's not his style," Mr. Michaels said. "He usually comes out swinging. But if he is willing to work with a Republican majority, it will be a pleasure, and all we can say is, it's about time."
 
'Get Off Your Knees'
 After keeping a low profile for several months, Mr. Florio showed some of his combative personality in the closing weeks of the campaign. Apparently dismayed by the Democrats' strategy -- running without mentioning party affiliation or defending their votes for the new taxes and the property-tax relief and increased school aid it helped support -- Mr. Florio told Democratic candidates: "get off your knees" and carry the fight to the Republicans.
Stephen A. Salmore, a professor of political science at Rutgers University, who is a consultant to the state's Republican Party, said the Governor's late campaign cut into a growing Republican lead in party surveys.
"The Democrats," he said, "in districts where they have a base of voters were not only losing the independents but also some of their own base by not telling voters what they have done for the last two years. When the Governor began to campaign, we noticed some movement toward the Democrats; at least it began to bring back their base voters."
Mr. Michaels of the Republican State Committee predicted that Republicans would take control of both the State Senate and the Assembly, something they last accomplished in 1971. Steve DeMicco, the executive director of the Democratic State Committee, was not so sure. "It's difficult to say how the final winds are blowing," he said. "But I think we're in a position to hold our own." The Democrats now hold slim majorities of 23 to 17 in the Senate and 43 to 37 in the Assembly.
The one advantage the Democrats enjoyed throughout the campaign was a bigger war chest, created by the fund-raising leverage that goes with control of both the Governor's office and the Legislature. State election officials have estimated that $14 million will be spent when all the bills are paid, and Democrats are expected to outspend Republicans by almost three to one.
Republicans were further encouraged over the weekend by a Star-Ledger/Eagleton Poll in which respondents favored Republicans over Democrats by 9 percentage points. The statewide telephone survey of 539 likely voters, conducted from Oct. 22 to 30, has a possible sampling error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.
 
Making Up Ground
 But Mr. DeMicco of the Democratic State Committee also found something encouraging in the poll. "About six weeks ago," he said, "we included a similar party-preference question in our surveys, and we found people favoring Republicans by 17 points over Democrats. That means that Democrats have made up ground between our survey and the Eagleton poll."
The last flurry of what has been a blizzard of campaign literature went to the post office on Friday, and Mr. DeMicco and Mr. Michaels have been getting their telephone banks humming and their volunteers assigned to the "get out the vote" effort. Democrats, with the deeper campaign pockets, will again be passing out "street money" to local political figures to inspire the door-to-door canvassing that may turn out a few more votes.
Mr. Michaels said he has to be ready to compensate for "volunteer slippage" in one district or another, and today he had to switch a planned 50,000 telephone calls from one district to another because polling suggested some slippage in the second one.
Mr. DeMicco of the Democrats said he was still receiving last-minute requests for money, and both party leaders said they would have teams of lawyers ready to march into court to stop perceived interference in the election.
Mr. DeMicco said he expected the Republicans to mount a "ballot security task force" operation in Mercer, Middlesex and Bergen Counties to try to reduce the number of minority voters.
He was recalling an effort he said was carried out by the Republicans during the 1981 gubernatorial election, especially in minority areas in urban counties. The Republicans later signed a consent order, agreeing to refrain from such abuses as congregating outside polling places and posting signs warning that illegal voting could be prosecuted.
Mr. Michaels said the Republicans' Election Day effort would stay within the law and the consent order. He accused the Democrats of "waving the bloody shirt." But he said lawyers would be on hand to guard against abuses.
"We're concerned about the integrity of the election process," Mr. Michaels said. "And we're going to make sure this is one election that doesn't get ripped off."

HEADLINE: A Neighborhood Struggle With Despair

SERIES: Life at the Bottom: Mott Haven, the Bronx -- First of four articles.

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ with CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Six days a week, from midmorning until nightfall, Shirley Flowers sits alone in the lobby of her South Bronx apartment building, greeting neighbors with cheerful banter while doing her best to banish the nervous strangers who wander in after buying crack in a nearby basement.
The 48-year-old grandmother is all that remains of the tenant patrol she started two years ago to rout the crackheads who lolled in the building's hallways and stairways. Coaxed into being out of apathy and fear, the 340 Beekman Avenue patrol could never overcome its dubious birth. 
 "Sometimes I get disgusted with the tenants," Mrs. Flowers said one day as a steady stream of neighbors slid by. "They like to complain, but nobody likes to participate."
Shirley Flowers keeping her solitary vigil at a small school desk in her lobby: This image is a minimalist metaphor for one of the city's most forlorn neighborhoods, Mott Haven, at the southern tip of the Bronx.
To visit Mott Haven -- and there are Mott Havens in most large American cities these days -- is to discover a world apart. Here, poverty cuts deeper than the lack of money, the lack of health care, the abundance of drugs. This gray place is largely bereft of many of the threads that knit other very poor neighborhoods together: strong tenant organizations, powerful community groups, charismatic leadership, even a safe playground.
"We're like the forgotten city here," said Janet Jones, a native of Mott Haven who left college to raise her three children alone and on welfare in a building around the corner from Mrs. Flowers. "When we need something done, we're always the last ones."
Now, this already strained neighborhood of 50,000 people around East 138th Street and the surrounding avenues is being strained even further as the city moves 200 formerly homeless families into two transitional shelters and hundreds more into renovated apartments. Inadvertently, this immigration has often pitted neighbor against neighbor, as longtime tenants in city-owned buildings watch the homeless move into renovated apartments with new appliances while they remain in the same decaying quarters.
In Mott Haven, the strongest community is the one defined by hardship. No wonder Shirley Flowers can't get any help.
Once, Mott Haven was a bustling enclave of Irish and Italian immigrants who toiled in the factories and rail yards that ringed their tenement neighborhoods. The postwar boom spurred their exodus to the suburbs, attracting in their stead rural Southern blacks and Puerto Ricans.
But the factories, and their seemingly insatiable appetite for unskilled labor, moved away as the city's economy changed, taking with them that immigrant staple, hope, and leaving Mott Haven as the flashpoint for the blight that engulfed the South Bronx. When it emerged from the arson-fired crucible of the 1970's, Mott Haven had lost nearly half its population; the rest stayed behind to witness the devastation wrought by thousands of smaller fires -- flames that heat crack pipes and cook heroin.
 
Beer and Beepers
 Now, the landscape is almost unceasingly drab. Towering red brick projects that house half its souls loom high along its southern border. The new arrivals are filling the valley to the north, where apartment buildings are crammed along side streets, their lobbies secured by dented metal doors shut tight with magnets, the mailboxes sealed in wire mesh to keep out thieves.
There is a park here in Mott Haven, St. Mary's, a rectangle of green stretching six blocks north from 143d Street between St. Ann's and Jackson Avenues, but many residents say they avoid it for fear of robbery. The only other patches of green often are scraggly lots choked by weeds.
Along streets littered with garbage, men sit on boxes sipping beers and playing dominoes near young women pushing strollers and young men with beepers standing on street corners. Under the shade of the Bruckner Expressway, where scavengers have ripped up the cobblestones for sale to suburban homeowners, prostitutes take their midday break.
 
Signs of Progress
 Almost 40 percent of Mott Haven's residents survive on welfare. More than two-thirds of the families are headed by single women. Pregnant women in Mott Haven are the most likely in the city to receive late or no prenatal care and among the most likely to give birth to drug-exposed babies, according to statistics from the City Health Department. The children of Mott Haven are more likely to die before their first birthdays than children in other neighborhoods.
Which is not to say that there are no signs of a future worth working for. Churches and their schools are trying to nurture Mott Haven's young people while hoping to unite their parents into effective neighborhood groups. Commerce and construction bustle along East 138th Street. And nestled along a block once dominated by crumbling tenements, a strip of two-family houses is attracting working-class homeowners.
Still, for every Mott Haven resident who works, there is another who does not. Just one block north of 138th Street is another thriving bazaar, where the wares are illicit, addictive and sold in small vials and glassine envelopes. In Mott Haven, progress often seems like a limited partnership, and even the hardest-working people fear that the problems run too deep to solve.
"There is a combination of things that keep depressing the area," said one detective at the 40th Precinct. "It builds up a momentum that this community by itself cannot stop."
 
Random Violence
Crackling Gunfire And Early Deaths

Mrs. Flowers arrived in Mott Haven 20 years ago, when denim-clad gangs like the Savage Skulls and the Black Spades waged fierce turf battles. When word of a rumble spread through the neighborhood, the streets would clear as in an Old West town anticipating a showdown.
"I'd rather have those days than what we have now," she said. "They fought among themselves but looked out for most of the people they knew around here. These kids around here today, they don't care."
At night, the rhythm of life is jolted by the crackle of gunfire and the crash of bottles flung off roofs. So fearful is Mrs. Flowers of the random violence that plagues her neighborhood that she refuses to let her grandchildren go to the store alone.
"Sometimes you look out your window and are surprised to see how many kids grew up to kill each other," she said quietly.
 
Remembering the Dead
 Around the corner, by a scruffy asphalt schoolyard flecked with glinting shards of glass, 20-year-old Joey Maysonet, surveyed a horizon of ghosts. He pointed to one corner, recalling how in this year alone, three of his friends had died there. Swiveling, he cast his gaze beyond a fenced-in grassy lot, to the block where his brother Ismael fell to the streets in 1983. He was 23.
"He used to rob people and take their drugs," Mr. Maysonet said. Ismael was shot while sitting in a car with several friends, presumably by a victim seeking revenge.
Capt. Carl Larsen, commander of the 40th Precinct, said there have been 66 murders through mid-October, up from 52 for the same period last year. Much of the violence erupts along East 139th Street, where heroin dealers shout out their wares with abandon while lookouts scan the streets calling out "ta to," Spanish slang for "all clear."
Tracy Pringle, a 19-year-old whose basketball skills have made him into a respected local hero, said that despite his celebrity he sometimes feared becoming a victim of the neighborhood's violence. Survival and success hinge on a commitment to his family and college while giving a wide berth to the drug dealers who strut past him.
"If they don't get you, they get your family,' he said. "You've got to learn to live with it."
 
Community Organizing
Using the Church To Fill a Gap

Before becoming acting pastor of St. Ann's Episcopal Church, the Rev. Earl Kooperkamp thought he had seen the worst of social entropy in Harlem and East New York in Brooklyn. Now he knows better.
"It's a whole other magnitude of poverty here," he said.
In a city where cutbacks are the order of the day, his church and others have stepped into the breach, providing after-school programs, cultural activities, and help for immigrants. A food pantry helps stretch welfare budgets and put food on the table, while the soup kitchen feeds scores of people who line up early outside, spilling down the steps and onto the sidewalk.
The flood of newcomers has strained his church's resources; the food pantry regularly runs out of the monthly donated food a week early. Hardly a day passes without a disoriented, newly arrived family stopping by in search of a handout or help with cashing an emergency food check.
"It's easy to move people into the neighborhood," Mr. Kooperkamp said. "The hard part is getting people to be part of a community."
 
'They Want Solutions'
 Parishioners like Edwin Lorenzo, a friendly 20-year-old with a spot of gray above his forehead, are trying to forge a sense of community through church-sponsored outreach and tenant organizing. "People are tired of hearing other people tell them their problems," he said. "They want solutions."
In his case, that means earning his neighbors' trust by getting quick results on apartment repairs, teaching them how to file complaints and going downtown to complain at the Housing Authority headquarters.
More than half the families in his 16-story building in the Millbrook Houses have enlisted in the association. Together with residents of other buildings, they have started a tenants' committee that lobbied successfully for new street lamps along the project's newly paved walkways.
Part of their success is the relative success of the housing projects, generally the most stable housing in the area. Despite the ominous shadow they cast on the horizon, the buildings' tenants are mostly either employed or elderly and the crime rate is lower than in the blocks of tenements that ring them.
Welfare families, who account for about a quarter of the complex's tenants, have been the hardest to get involved. "They don't know they can challenge the government," Mr. Lorenzo said. "They fear if they challenge the government their aid will be taken away from them."
Without more effective organizing, he worries, things will only get worse. "The people who are working are the ones who are leaving," he said.
 
Dearth of Support
Social Service Cuts Despite Poverty

Some urban planners say the city has only added to Mott Haven's problems by reacting too quickly to the double burden of having a community rife with abandoned housing and a growing citywide problem with homelessness. Shelters that better-organized neighborhoods blocked found their way into politically powerless Mott Haven, even as many homeless families moved into city-owned buildings.
Camilo Jose Vergara, a sociologist and photographer who has documented Mott Haven and other impoverished urban neighborhoods, calls them "new ghettos" -- neighborhoods where crime and poverty coexist on a scale unknown, and untolerated, in other communities.
"It is a proof of the distance from the public eye or wherever the moral and political center of the city is," he said.
 
Creating a Housing Mix
 In the last couple of years, though, the city has begun to modify its policies.
Felice L. Michetti, the city's Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, said the city was developing a healthy economic mix of housing where fewer than half the new or renovated apartments would be for the homeless; the rest would go to low- , moderate- and middle-income people. Mott Haven, city officials say, is unlikely to get any more homeless shelters.
"We want to create an economic ladder in housing," Ms. Michetti said.
She disputed the idea that placing the poor in places like Mott Haven is inherently wrong. The real issue, she said, is whether services are available to help integrate the new families into the neighborhood.
But in Mott Haven, by and large, they are not.
"It was just bricks and mortar. It was not community development," said Bernd Zimmermann, director of planning and development in the Office of the Bronx Borough President. "We need programs that serve the community, not a community to serve the programs."
This year, social services to help the formerly homeless were slashed because of the Dinkins administration's budget cuts. The Human Resources Administration closed the 34 branches of the Office of Family Services, which used to aid relocated homeless families. Ken Murphy, deputy commissioner for crisis-intervention services, said the city planned to distribute $5 million to community groups to pick up the slack. But that money has not been found.
 
Battling to Save Lives
 The city now has a staff of 21 to do follow-up. They can help only about one-fourth of the 4,000 families resettled annually, Mr. Murphy said, and they carry heavy caseloads of 35 families at any given time.
Health care is one of the most crying needs.
Like a garrison digging in before a major assault, boxes of medical supplies are stacked in the basement of the Segundo Ruiz Belvis Neighborhood Family Care Center, Mott Haven's only city health clinic besides Lincoln Hospital, which is almost always oversubscribed. J. Gilberto Sierra, the clinic's quick-thinking administrator, stockpiled the supplies soon after the city announced budget cuts earlier this year.
Most of the cuts have been staved off, but the air of urgency lingers in an area where poor housing and inadequate nutrition complicate health problems, and a reputation for danger makes it hard to recruit doctors.
AIDS, drug and alcohol abuse, as well as chronic diseases like asthma, have made Mott Haven among the city's leaders in serious illness, Mr. Sierra said. And with a young population, there has been a continuing increase in teen-age pregnancies.
"Compared to other areas, our patients have a multitude of problems," Mr. Sierra said. "We cannot handle the demand. If we had three more centers like this we could fill them up easily. We're maxed out."
 
Revitalization
Seeking Stability In Homeownership

Homeownership, a traditional benchmark of stability, is virtually nonexistent in Mott Haven; only 3 percent of the area's housing units are owned by residents. An adventurous attempt to do something about that can be found along East 145th and 146th Streets, where rows of boxy two-family town houses with wrought-iron gates and tidy backyards stand along blocks once lined with burned-out tenements and peopled by dazed addicts.
Costing about $145,000, the houses require a down payment that is roughly double the median family income for Mott Haven, which is $7,600. Nonetheless, nearly all of the first 44 houses are occupied by people from nearby neighborhoods. A total of 112 homes will be built through a partnership of a private developer and the Southeast Bronx Community Organization with state and city subsidies and marketing assistance from the New York City Housing Partnership.
Nana Asare had looked in neighborhoods in the north Bronx but decided to buy his house at 452 East 146th Street because it was the best deal he could get on a new house. And while he knew the neighborhood had its own dangers, he hoped more families like his would bolster the area.
"I look at it this way," he said. "If the place is improving by putting in working people who are more responsible, you would think the area would improve as time goes on."
 
Forming Role Models
 Genevieve S. Brooks, a former housing advocate who now is deputy Bronx borough president, said the new homeowners were vital to the area's turnaround. As a founder of the MBD Community Housing Corporation, a nonprofit housing sponsor, she helped transform Charlotte Street in Morrisania from a national symbol of urban blight into a community of ranch-style homes and white picket fences.
"They are better able to stay on top of public servants and see that they deliver the services people are entitled to and to be a beacon and a role model for people in need," she said.
That may not be evident at first. The aluminum siding on Orlando Andrade's new house on East 146th Street is pitted from rocks hurled by children playing on a nearby rooftop.
"Maybe they are jealous of the people who have houses and cars," he said.
The Bronx, he said, will change: "It won't always be bad." But he still wonders if moving to Mott Haven was the right decision.
"I'm beginning to doubt it," he said. "I'm not sure."
 
Next: Old-timers and newcomers -- uneasy neighbors.

HEADLINE: Lag Is Seen in Transplants

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 4

 BODY:
Advances in organ transplant technology are racing far ahead of the ability of the nation's health care system to provide the organs and the funds needed to perform costly life-saving operations, says a study made public today.
As a result, more than 23,000 Americans are waiting for new hearts, kidneys, lungs, livers and pancreases, 10,000 more than were on waiting lists just five years ago, according to the 11-volume report, which was issued at a medical conference here.
Roger Evans, a researcher with Battelle Human Affairs Research Center in Seattle, said the three-year study found transplants were cost-effective despite their relative expense. 
 But he said a shortage of donor organs had hidden the true cost of the new technology because the shortfall ruled out surgery for many people who needed a transplant.
"It's rationing on the basis of available organs instead of on the basis of the ability to pay," Mr. Evans said.
"Improving organ supply will perhaps cause more economic problems than we have now."
 
Cost of $39,000 to $1.5 Million
 Few patients can afford the operations, which usually cost from $39,000 to $145,000 but can soar as high as $1.5 million. And many insurers are reluctant to pay for them.
In addition, many transplant recipients remain chronically ill long after their operations, requiring medical care that costs on average $10,000 a year, five times the per capita rate for medical care in the United States.
Mr. Evans said as medical techniques improved, the Government might be forced to limit the availability of the new technology to keep medical costs from rising.
The three-year study was a cooperative research project carried out by Battelle, the United Network for Organ Sharing, and the United States Health Care Financing Administration and the United States Health Resources and Services Administration.

HEADLINE: Stark Data On Women: 100 Million Are Missing

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
LITTLE girls in China no longer have their feet crushed by foot-binding, and widows in India are no longer supposed to be roasted alive on the funeral pyres of their husbands. But a stark statistic testifies to women's continuing unequal status: at least 60 million females in Asia are missing and feared dead, victims of nothing more than their sex. Worldwide, research suggests, the number of missing females may top 100 million.
If sex discrimination in the West means office harassment or fewer good jobs for women, in the third world it often means death. A traditional preference for boys translates quickly -- in China, India and many other developing countries -- into neglect and death for girls. While the discrimination is widely seen as a relic of outdated attitudes, in fact the problem appears to be getting worse in Asia. Recently released census data in China and India show that in both countries the sex ratio of the population became more skewed over the course of the last decade. 
 The tens of millions of missing include females of all ages who are aborted or killed at birth or who die because they are given less food than males, or because family members view a daughter with diarrhea as a nuisance but a son with diarrhea as a medical crisis requiring a doctor.
"If a boy gets sick, the parents may send him to the hospital at once," acknowledged Li Honggui, an official in China's State Family Planning Commission. "But if a girl gets sick, the parents may say to themselves, 'Well, we'll see how she is tomorrow.' "
 
 
A Shadow on Census Data
 Remarkably little research has been conducted on the plight of the missing women, and even their disappearance is discernible merely as a shadow on the census data and mortality statistics.
"It's shocking that so little is known," said Amartya Sen, a Harvard economist who has tried to call attention to the issue. Professor Sen estimates that considerably more than 100 million females are missing around the world, and he asserts that the reason the shortfall is getting worse in some areas is that girls are not allowed to benefit as much as boys from the improvements in health care and nutrition that are lowering death rates in developing countries.
Any investigation into the case of the missing women begins with one fact: 5 or 6 percent more boys are born than girls, but in normal circumstances males die at higher rates at every age thereafter. Typically in the West, where female infanticide is not considered an issue, children are disproportionately male, the number of men and women evens out by the time people are in their 20's or 30's and the elderly are disproportionately female. In relatively advanced countries like the United States, Britain and Poland, there are about 105 females for every 100 males.
 In India, however, a census this year found only 92.9 females for every 100 males, down from 93.4 in the 1981 census and 93.0 in the 1971 census. And in China, the 1990 census found just 93.8 females for every 100 males, compared with 94.1 at the time of the 1982 census. By a conservative calculation there are 30 million females missing in China, about 5 percent of the national total and more than are missing in any other country.
 A United Nations report this summer, "The World's Women," found that other countries with very low ratios of females include Afghanistan, with 94.5 for every 100 males; Bangladesh, 94.1; Bhutan, 93.3; Nepal, 94.8; Pakistan, 92.1; Papua New Guinea, 92.8, and Turkey, 94.8.
"Millions of women have died because they're women," said Sharon Capeling-Alakija, director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women, adding that mothers as well as fathers are responsible. "In most societies, women are the bearers of tradition, and if decisions are made between boy children and girl children, women were involved in making those decisions."
 While the countries with shortages of women are all quite poor, it is not inevitable that poor countries will mistreat and kill their females. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, poverty and disease make life perhaps more grim than on any other continent, yet there are 102 females for every 100 males. In Latin America and the Caribbean, for all the influence of machismo, there are equal numbers of males and females.
 Even within India, there are huge differences. The southern state of Kerala, which is among the most educated, has a ratio of 104 females for every 100 males, almost the same as the United States and Europe. Despite the immense number of missing females, it is virtually impossible to find human faces to match the statistics. Strolling around Chinese villages, it is easy to find out about girls who died of pneumonia or some other disease but difficult to prove that they were victims of their sex.
 
Statistical Challenge
 It is only in the overall statistics that the shortfall becomes clear. A study published early this year by a Swedish expert, Sten Johansson, suggested that in countries without strong patterns of discrimination about 130 infant boys die for every 100 infant girls. In China, however, only about 112 boys die for every 100 girls -- presumably because boys are favored.
The Swedish study calculated that these data point to 44,000 female deaths each year that are the result of unequal treatment, just among infants less than 1 year old.
Likewise, two studies in India reportedly found that for most of the first year of life, girls had lower mortality rates than boys, but that later in infancy boys did better than girls. This may be because early in life the infants were fed from the breast, which was gender blind, but that parents later favored their sons over their daughters in allocating food and medical treatment.
Perhaps the most challenging problem statistically is to determine the number of missing females around the world. The difficulty is to derive the sex ratio that would exist in a population if males and females were treated equally.
The ratios in Western countries are perhaps inapplicable to developing countries because of the difference in age structures. A population with a lower average age should have a higher proportion of males, because children are disproportionately male. Thus a country with a short life expectancy or with a rapidly growing population -- both reasons for a low average age -- would have relatively fewer females than Western nations.
 
A Reporting Problem
 Even so, the 2 percent surplus of females in sub-Saharan Africa and the 4 percent surplus of females in Kerala may suggest that those ratios are benchmarks for the third world if it were gender-blind. If one picks a ratio, such as 103 females to 100 males, as the one that would prevail in an equitable developing country, that would indicate that more than 100 million females are missing around the world.
Ansley J. Coale, a Princeton University demographer, outlines a much more sophisticated method in a forthcoming article in Population and Development Review, the journal of the Population Council in New York. Professor Coale calculates a hypothetical sex ratio that might be expected to exist in each of a half-dozen countries, based on their fertility and mortality rates. For example, he calculates that China should have 101 males to 100 females, and that India should have 102 males for each 100 females.
Those ratios suggest that 30 million Chinese females are missing, along with 22.8 million Indian females, 3.1 million Pakistanis, 1.6 million Bangladeshis, 600,000 Egyptians and 200,000 Nepalese. In these countries alone, nearly 60 million females are unaccounted for by this method -- a figure Mr. Coale notes is lower than other estimates but one he calls "still distressing."
Using Professor Coase's method, 5.2 percent of females are unaccounted for in China, along with 5.6 percent of females in India, 7.8 percent in Pakistan, 3.8 percent in Bangladesh and smaller proportions in other countries.
Huang Baoshan, a spokesman for China's State Family Planning Commission, suggests that at least in China a significant number of the missing females are very much alive but have eluded census takers because peasants officially limited to one or two children are reluctant to report the birth of a daughter.
Still, before the "one child policy" was introduced a dozen years ago, there was no obvious reason to under-report girls. Yet even then, millions of girls were missing. The 1953 census found 107.6 males per 100 females -- a ratio even more skewed than today's, presumably largely because of female infanticide and discrimination against young girls in the first half of the century.
 
The Ultrasound Option
 The killing of newborn girls was banned in India in 1870, and was denounced and outlawed by the Communists after they imposed order on the Chinese countryside after the 1949 revolution.
Nevertheless, female infanticide has deep roots in rural China -- partly because infants were not always regarded as full persons until they had lived for a year or grown their teeth. An old fable recounts approvingly how a couple buried their daughter alive so they would have more food to give to the man's mother. In burying their child, the couple found a treasure and were thus rewarded for their filial piety.
Each year in China, about 600,000 fewer girl births are reported to the authorities than there should be, based on the number of boy births and the ratio that should exist between them. A large number appear to be surreptitiously given up for adoption, and many others are simply raised quietly by their parents or relatives without registering the birth. Some are also drowned at birth by a midwife who keeps a bucket by the mother's side, in case the infant proves to be an unwanted girl, but it is impossible to know how often this happens.
These days, technology has presented parents with a tidier option than infanticide: ultrasound tests that determine whether the sex of a fetus.
"Everyone wants a son, so they get an ultrasound test and if it's a girl they have an abortion," said a businessman from a rural area in Fujian Province. Though the practice is illegal in China, the man said: "There's no law for the doctors. It's all money and connections."
In India, amniocentesis is sometimes used in the cities to determine the sex of a fetus so that it can be aborted if it is female.
The United Nations report cited 8,000 abortions in Bombay after the parents learned of the sex of the fetus, only one of which involved a male. Professor Sen believes that the practice is not widespread enough throughout India to account for a significant proportion of the millions of missing females. In China, however, anecdotal evidence suggests that selective abortion may be having an impact on the statistics.
Chinese law prohibits doctors from telling prospective parents the sex of the fetus, but the prohibition simply raises the cost of the bribe to extricate the information from the ultrasound operator. Even official reports acknowledge the practice.
"Ultrasound has brought great joy to peasants who still carry old ideas," Science and Technology Daily reported earlier this year. It quoted a peasant as saying: "Ultrasound is really worthwhile, even though my wife had to go through four abortions to get a son."

HEADLINE: Danes Link Sunspot Intensity to Global Temperature Rise

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
ARE changes in the intensity of the Sun's radiation partly responsible for the rise in global temperature that has been observed over the last century and especially over the last few years? If so, it would mean that heat-trapping atmospheric gases like carbon dioxide played a smaller role in the warming than some scientists have believed likely.
The possibility has been raised anew by Danish geophysicists. They report in the current issue of the journal Science that they have established a close statistical correlation between variations in the length of the sunspot cycle -- which they say are an indicator of changes in the intensity of solar radiation -- and fluctuations in the world's surface temperature over the last 130 years. 
 The analysis was made by Dr. Eigil Friis-Christensen and Dr. Knud Lassen of the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen.
 
Bush's Cautious Approach
 Their finding is one of a number of new pieces of information being considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international group of scientists convened by the United Nations to make a continuing assessment of the global warming problem as new evidence develops.
In international talks on a treaty to deal with the threat of global warming, the Bush Administration has taken a cautious approach on the question of whether to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It argues that significant reductions would be economically damaging and that not enough is known about the magnitude of the threat. Earlier suggestions that changes in solar radiation might affect the climate as much or more than the heat-trapping gases have played to the Administration's hand.
Some scientists say that if the findings of the Danish scientists are borne out by further investigation, carbon dioxide's suspected role in the warming of the last century would have to be downgraded. But they emphasize that even then, no conclusions could be drawn as to how the climate would be affected by changes in solar radiation over the next century, since the length and intensity of solar cycles are unpredictable. Meanwhile, atmospheric carbon dioxide is expected to increase steadily as a result of the burning of fossil fuels.
To cancel out the warming that many scientists expect to come from carbon dioxide would require a decrease of 2 percent in the intensity of solar radiation, "and I don't know of anyone who believes there is that large a variability" in solar activity over a century's time scale, said Dr. James E. Hansen of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. Dr. Hansen is a foremost proponent of the view that global warming caused by humans is taking place.
He and others, including the authors of the new study, point out that the new finding is based on a statistical correlation and that no physical mechanism for the supposed variations in solar radiation has been demonstrated.
 
A Remarkably Close Fit
 Dr. Friis-Christensen and Dr. Lassen analyzed the lengths of sunspot cycles, which vary from 9 to 13 years with an average of 11 years. Shorter cycles, they said, are associated statistically with more intense solar activity. The variations in cycle length, the scientists found, almost precisely match the fluctuations in Northern Hemisphere temperatures from the mid-1850's to the mid-1980's.
The years immediately before 1985, when temperatures were rising, coincided neatly with a period of shorter solar cycles lasting about nine and a half years. By contrast, the years from 1945 to 1970, when the climate cooled, coincided with a period of longer cycles.
While the correlation established by Dr. Friis-Christensen and Dr. Lassen falls short of definite proof, a number of scientists nevertheless called it remarkable in its close fit between the solar and temperature trends. The findings were termed "a major advance" by Dr. Robert Jastrow, a professor of earth sciences at Dartmouth College who is also the president of the George C. Marshall Institute in Washington.
 
A 'Gut Feeling'
 In 1989, the institute issued a report, cited favorably by Bush Administration officials, which said that the last century's warming could have been caused partly by solar variability. It also said that natural cooling factors could partly or largely offset any temperature increase caused by carbon dioxide in the next century.
Dr. Hansen said that while the Danish researchers' statistical correlation may or may not hold up, "my gut feeling, nevertheless, is that they're at least partly right." If the findings turn out to be true, he said, the variations described by the Danes "could substantially moderate or enhance" climate changes brought about by heat-trapping gases.
If the findings are ultimately borne out by physical evidence, they would advance the effort to separate from a welter of natural variations whatever amount of warming humans have contributed to a rise of about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the average surface temperature of the globe over the last century. The Danish scientists said that human-induced warming could have taken place but might have been counteracted by air-polluting sulfates produced by industrial activity. These are believed to exert a cooling effect on climate.
It is also possible, Dr. Friis-Christensen said, that some of the observed warming might be attributable to human factors and some of it to increased solar radiation.

After Mega-Losses, Mega-Alterations?

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
Flo Ziegfeld's Follies. Seward's Folly. Now, CBS's $604 Million Follies.
CBS wrote off $282 million on its major league baseball deal last year, anticipating future losses. CBS underanticipated. Badly. Last Friday, the network wrote off $322 million more on its baseball and National Football League properties. Quite a reality check after all that World Series euphoria. 
 Unfortunately, CBS won't provide the baseball-football breakdown in the new write-off. But figuring conservatively that just a half of the write-off was from baseball means CBS now expects the baseball contract to lose $443 million over its four-year term, or almost 42 percent of the value of the $1.06 billion deal.
Will there be more write-offs next year? Will CBS miscalculate the 1992 advertising environment as badly as it did the 1991 market? Said John Reidy, a media analyst with Smith Barney: "If they can't figure it out by now, they'll never figure it out."
Like Arthur Watson, his predecessor as the president of NBC Sports, Dick Ebersol isn't shy about leading the CBS-Has-Ruined-Network-Sports Police. Said Ebersol of CBS's newest losses: "It's cataclysmic. This mini-series of mega-losses will change the basic economics of American sport. What's happened in the American economy is finally coming to sports."
And it's coming soon to NBC, which has a write-off of its very own speeding down the red-ink highway. Already that network has lost $50 million in the first two years of its $752 million N.F.L. deal. But within the next two months, an estimated $90 million will be written off the value of its four-year N.F.L. contract in anticipation of future losses.
"It's the worst deal at the network -- the deal was made in March of 1990 and by August, Bob Wright was saying he wished he hadn't made the deal," Ebersol said, referring to the president of NBC. "If we're not able to get a risk-free deal the next time out, we won't be there."
Yes, football fans, NBC may be out of the football business if it can't get a saner N.F.L. deal next time around. That means more sponsored, made-for-TV beach volleyball and bicep beauty contests on Sunday.
"The N.F.L. has been a good partner," Ebersol said. "They may see fit in the months ahead to initiate some sort of restructuring. But we won't ask them for any relief," on the current contract.
Val Pinchbeck, the league's director of broadcasting, said: "We meet with the networks routinely, where the subject of their losses has come up. They paint a dark picture of what's going on."
Is Ebersol's salvo merely public posturing or an illustration of deep concern? Probably some of the former, but more of the latter. His ultimate boss is Jack Welch, the chairman of General Electric, NBC's parent. Welch is considered one of the toughest bosses in America. You figure out how much he likes financial write-offs.
 
Musburger on Golf
 Roger Twibell and Dave Marr are out as the voices of ABC's golf coverage come January. In are Brent Musburger as the host (promoted from World League of American Football games), Mark Rolfing (from NBC) as an on-course reporter and Steve Melnyk (from CBS) as an analyst at the 18th hole. Twibell will shift downward to the W.L.A.F.; Marr will be gone by 1992.
 
Albert's No. 25
 Marv Albert, who will be behind the microphone for tonight's Knicks-Bucks game on the MSG Network, on entering his 25th year as the radio-then-TV voice of the team: "My kids make fun of the 25 years, which is why they no longer receive tickets." . . . Quinn Buckner, the new studio host of NBC's "NBA Showtime" pre-game program, on the player's perspective he will try to bring: "The salary cap is an issue, but the players haven't made it one. No one is under the illusion that it hasn't been a positive, that it saved the league, but is it necessary to keep saving the league by keeping the salary cap?" . . . The weekend's broadcast highlight may have been Tom Durkin's calls of the Breeders' Cup on Saturday for NBC, especially of Arazi's stunning victory in the Juvenile. Throughout the seven races, Durkin was excited, knowledgeable and cliche-free.

HEADLINE: Housing Law Challenges Power of Zoning Boards

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRUMBULL, Conn., Nov. 4

 BODY:
A Connecticut law intended to spur the construction of affordable housing is putting on trial one of suburbia's most powerful institutions, the planning and zoning commission.
The law allows a special housing judge to overturn the decisions of town zoning officials if they cannot prove that health and safety concerns "clearly outweigh the need for affordable housing." In doing so, it strikes at more than half a century of freedom that suburban zoning boards have had in shaping and protecting their communities, often by excluding cheaper housing and the people who live in it. 
 That power to exclude has long been blamed for making possible the racial segregation that divides cities from suburbs across the Northeast. Only recently, however, in court decisions in Yonkers, on Long Island and in Connecticut, have judges made the connection between housing policies and segregation and begun to attack zoning's power to discriminate economically.
A shortage of affordable housing has also brought zoning under attack in legislatures. Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Hampshire all recently adopted zoning appeal laws, modeled on one in Massachusetts that established a state Housing Appeals Committee more than 20 years ago.
 
Misuse of Power?
 "The reason towns were given the power to zone was not so they could do whatever they wanted to do," said Terry J. Tondro, a University of Connecticut law professor involved in proposing the Connecticut law in 1989, "but so they could improve the welfare of the residents of their community."
"To allow a community to use a state power to keep some of us out," he said, "means they're not using the power given to them for the proper purpose."
More than half a dozen developers have begun appeals against zoning commissions under the law, but the first case scheduled for a hearing, in Hartford on Friday, is by far the largest.
In it, the nation's largest builder of apartments, Trammell Crow Residential, is challenging the zoning commission of one of the state's most suburban communities, Trumbull, home to the 1989 Little League World Champions.
At issue is the fate of 38 acres near the Bridgeport border, which the zoning commission has marked for a future office park. In a town of 32,000, where more than 93 percent of the homes are traditional single-family houses, where there is not a single apartment building, where no land is zoned to allow apartments, Trammell Crow has proposed a 600-unit apartment complex for the site.
The key, for Trammell Crow, is that it proposed to rent 20 percent of the apartments at prices that meet the state's definition of "affordable." Providing that housing, under the law, turns the tables on Trumbull's zoning officials, requiring them to prove that their concerns over traffic, sanitation or other local factors outweigh the need for a kind of housing that the town does not have.
"Affordable," is relative, however, and it has not escaped Trumbull officials that state income guidelines would allow Trammell Crow to rent its 120 affordable apartments for as much as the other 480. Market rates for a three-bedroom unit range from $800 to $1,200 a month. Under the income guidelines, someone renting an "affordable" apartment could be charged as much as $960 a month, but no more than the market rate. All units would be part of an upscale complex with its own clubhouse, gym, pool and tennis courts.
So the real effect of the law here would be to open a suburban community to apartments for the first time. That possibility alternately encourages and alarms those involved.
"Very few towns are going to change until someone gets whacked," said Timothy S. Hollister, a Hartford lawyer who represents Trammell Crow. Mr. Hollister earlier won a landmark decision from the Connecticut Supreme Court, in a zoning suit against East Hampton, that laid a foundation for the appeals law.
Trumbull's lawyer, Burton S. Yaffie, says the law threatens to give a judge absolute power over towns.
"So much for Home Rule!" he exclaimed in his brief opposing Trammell Crow's appeal. "So much for local control of zoning! So much for the longstanding controls and checks and balances that have been built into all of our land-use powers during the last century!"
In the rarefied world of Fairfield County real estate, Trumbull is both a wealthy suburb of Bridgeport and a haven for commuters to Greenwich and Stamford who cannot afford the more expensive houses there.
It is 95.3 percent white, according to the 1990 Census. Its Town Council has refused to join a regional compact to develop affordable housing, making it the only holdout among the suburbs of Bridgeport, which is 51.7 percent black and Hispanic. But First Selectman David A. Wilson suggests that the town's character is more family-centered than exclusive.
"Trumbull has more volunteer boards and commissions than any town in the state," Mr. Wilson said. "We play every sport, no matter the size or shape of the ball. There is absolutely no activity that we don't have for youth. It's a very family-oriented community."
Mr. Wilson is troubled by the state's definition of "affordable housing": housing affordable to people with incomes no more than 80 percent of a region's median. That "moderate" income in Trumbull can range up to $38,400 a year.
To people like Mr. Wilson, who served on Trumbull's police force for 25 years, that means a developer is seeking to break the town's zoning to provide "affordable housing" for people earning more than he did for most of his life.
"My own daughter just got married," he said, "and she can't afford Trumbull. But if she works as hard as my wife and I did, and her husband does, they'll find a way. Not everybody can afford to live in the suburbs."
Trammell Crow, however, says Trumbull doesn't realize how much soaring prices changed the suburban housing market in the 1980's.
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out there are lots of middle-class and lower-middle-class people in Trumbull who bought their houses 20 or 25 years ago," Mr. Hollister said. "Now they're worth astronomical amounts, and they couldn't afford to buy them if they were just coming to Trumbull for the first time."
 
Strict Quotas Unwanted
 Trammell Crow, an Atlanta-based partnership with its Northeast division's offices in New Canaan, says the high density it proposes -- 16 apartments per acre -- is necessary to make a profit. It will not disclose the purchase price for the property, on which it has an option.
The judge in the case, Marshall Berger of Hartford Superior Court, could find in favor of Trammell Crow, but simply instruct Trumbull zoning officials to reconsider its plan. A major goal of the law is to persuade towns to accept housing voluntarily. No one wants the strict quotas that New Jersey imposed after its Supreme Court, in two cases involving the town of Mount Laurel, ruled that all communities had an obligation to provide housing for people of all incomes.
Professor Tondro said the law is intended not to strip towns of the ability to plan for themselves but to insure that they use their zoning powers to promote the general welfare, not to discriminate.
"What we were seeing," he said, "was that these kinds of decisions were being kept in the hands of local people who were intent on keeping outsiders out, apparently for racial, or most frequently, economic reasons, and sometimes just because they liked their quiet corner of the world.
"What we're doing," he said, "is asking the courts to examine their purpose."

HEADLINE: Many Dreams, Fewer Dollars In Lotteries

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
In some ways, New York would like to be more like Connecticut; in other ways, more like New Jersey. New Jersey wouldn't mind being a little more like Connecticut. In certain respects, New Jersey and Connecticut would like to be more like New York. And everybody would love to be a lot more like Massachusetts.
This envy has nothing to do with violent-crime rates, yearly rainfall or the percentage of houses without aluminum siding. Rather, it concerns that fascinating obsession of the not-yet-rich: state lotteries. 
 While the lotteries in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey have all been around so long that their growth has stalled -- they are grappling now with how to change that -- and while all foist a similar mix of games on a similar mix of people, they achieve different results. It is treacherous to judge their relative performances: You're better off trying to calculate the winning chances of playing your grandmother's baptism date seven times a week in alternate months.
But certain conclusions can be reached by studying several barometers. A fundamental measure that lottery directors look at is the net per capita revenues their states reap each year. In the 1991 fiscal year, Connecticut achieved $71.21 a person, the fifth-best rate in the country. New Jersey was close behind at $68.30. New York lagged at $52.86. The much-envied Massachusetts led the nation with a whopping $83.24.
 
In Pursuit of Preposterous Odds
 "We trail all the neighboring states in per capita sales," lamented Peter Lynch, the director of the New York Lottery. "That indicates there is opportunity for us to do better."
Even though there should be certain efficiencies of scale, New York spends the highest percentage of revenues on operating its lottery. It also pays the smallest slice in prizes, and therefore a higher split of revenues flutters into state coffers. New York spends 56 cents of each lottery dollar on prize money and operating expenses, while New Jersey spends 58.7 cents and Connecticut, 57 cents.
In fiscal 1991, Connecticut collected $228.6 million from its lottery. New Jersey produced $529.3 million, its best performance after $532.2 million in 1989. New York generated a record $940 million. But each of the three states' incomes grew less than 2 percent.
"You've got three remarkably similar lotteries," said Terri LaFleur, a senior editor at Gaming and Wagering Business Magazine. "Without new product introductions, they're going to stall at their slight growth rate."
All three states are frantically rooting in a cornucopia of possibilities to get people to part with more dollars in the pursuit of preposterous odds -- everything from rejiggering the dimensions of their jackpots to hooking into a televised lottery game show to sponsoring instant games that anoint winners every few minutes.
Mr. Lynch is of the mind that New Yorkers need to bump into lottery machines much more often. He sees no reason why a lottery machine shouldn't present itself whenever a routine errand is run, and is beginning a pronounced effort to put them into gasoline stations, supermarkets and convenience stores like 7-Elevens.
"We're trying to get the impulse player," Mr. Lynch said. "The person who leaves the house not necessarily to buy a lottery ticket but to get gas or some bread and milk."
At the same time, a new advertising campaign is about to be unveiled. The state is dumping its catchy and highly successful "A dollar and a dream" slogan for "Hey, you never know," a phrase meant to suggest that you just never know if you might win many millions of dollars.
 
In Airports and a Casino
 New Jersey is looking to lasso more out-of-state visitors. Frank Pelly, the executive director of the lottery, said he sees no reason why tourists and business visitors shouldn't take a fistful of New Jersey lottery tickets home with them. Beginning early next year, the state is putting lottery machines in turnpike rest stops. It recently installed machines at two terminals at Newark International Airport and is looking to add them to train stations. Just weeks ago, in another experiment, it put its first lottery machine in an Atlantic City casino, Harrah's.
All three states are weighing new games and ways to reconfigure existing ones. They have emulated the enormously successful Massachusetts strategy of putting multiple instant scratch-off games on the streets simultaneously. New Jersey has increased its selection to three at a time. In early 1990, Connecticut switched from one game to as many as five. New York now has seven.
As early as January, New York might introduce a variation of the Fantasy Five game offered in Florida, where players pick 5 out of 39 numbers. Because the odds of winning are appreciably better than in the main lotto game, the product might appeal to players who have spent small fortunes buying lottery tickets and never won a dime. For those impatient gamblers, New York is also looking at the keno game in Oregon that produces a drawing every five minutes.
Meanwhile, Connecticut is exploring lump-sum lotto games that pay out immediately rather than over 20 years. Both Florida and Massachusetts have tried these.
 
Like Jeopardy Without Answers
 One of the hottest ideas in lottery circles is a lottery game show on cable television. A consortium of states is exploring this prospect. The way it might work, players purchasing tickets that match winning numbers or color combinations drawn on the show would become eligible to appear as contestants. "This could produce prize money at a level never seen before in the game show industry," said Mr. Lynch. "You could have $1 million a day given away on the show."
Other magical hopes that the three states are examining are video lottery games, which could produce staggering sums of money. For the last two years, South Dakota has had video poker and keno, and Eugene Christiansen, president of Christiansen-Cummings Associates, a consulting firm that tracks the gambling business, said that "these games have stimulated the greatest increase we have ever seen in any form of gambling that we have observed since we started in 1982."
A fundamental principle of lottery strategizing is to weigh the drawbacks of worsening the odds for players against the lure of building larger jackpots. Research has shown that players covet monstrous jackpots; at the same time, they get peeved if they don't occasionally win decent money for a second or third prize.
New York has been stingier than any state in how much of its lottery sales are paid out as prizes, something sophisticated lottery players doubtlessly take into account in deciding whether they might be better off stepping into a bordering state to try their luck.
 
How New Jersey Sales Grew
 Still, because of New York's far larger population and poorer odds of winning, the biggest jackpots in the region appear in New York. The record jackpot was the $90 million awarded in January. New Jersey's biggest jackpot was $29.2 million, while Connecticut has not gotten beyond $22.7 million.
New Jersey, jealous of those bigger jackpots, restructured the prize distribution in October so that 70 percent, rather than 35 percent, of the prize pool was devoted to the top prize. (New York devotes 50 percent and Connecticut allocates 51.1 percent.) This enabled the state to vastly increase the size of its jackpot without lowering the odds of winning.
Since the change, New Jersey lotto sales gained by 15 percent and in September, the state realized its biggest jackpot. New York has been closely studying the New Jersey experience.
Because of player dissatisfaction with lower prizes, Connecticut significantly added to the prize pool for second place in 1989, as well as putting more money into first place. It tripled the average payout for getting five numbers right to about $3,000.
 
Pizzas as Booby Prizes
 Though the Connecticut lottery has fared well in per capita sales, the mood is chilly about its future. The General Assembly in Connecticut has financed a state study of legalized gambling in the state, which is due early next month. The lottery is hopeful it will supply provocative ideas to counter the constrictions of a mature lottery in a bad economy. In particular, the lottery is fretful about the debut of casino gambling when an Indian casino opens in Ledyard in February.
Lottery officials in all three states are looking at cross promotions with private companies. "We could get together with a soda company or a pizza company," Mr. Ziemak said. "The company might accept losing lottery tickets in return for 10 percent off on a pizza. And then the company would promote the lottery in its ads."
As the states broaden their lottery options, deep suspicion is likely to spread about how healthy all this is. Mr. Christiansen, the consultant, who said he doesn't gamble himself because he finds it boring, said he sees absolutely nothing wrong with lotteries and their variations, but he wonders about the motivations driving their expansion.
"It's often argued that gambling is painless taxation," Mr. Christiansen said. "I think taxation should be painful. I'm not against lotteries, but I'm not sure that trying to balance your budget by encouraging people to gamble is good government."

HEADLINE: Incumbents Hunker Down As Discontent Flies Over

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In tiny Neptune Township, N.J., local Monmouth County Republican candidates bought time on cable television to denigrate their opponents as "Florio-type Democrats." In Harlem, a Democrat was nominated for the City Council last week after declaring that Mayor David N. Dinkins had "neglected his base." And in Bridgeport, the mayoral election has been turned into a referendum on Mayor Mary C. Moran's budgetary strategy that led Connecticut's largest city to file for bankruptcy.
"It's good to be the king," Mel Brooks said smugly, playing Louis XVI in his film "History of the World, Part 1." But in tough times, as Louis later learned, incumbency can become a fatal liability. 
 Incumbents throughout the New York region -- including some office-holders who are not even up for election -- find themselves on the defensive, although most, particularly in Democratic strongholds like New York City are considered safe. Today's off-year elections could have profound consequences in 1992 if challengers can capitalize on unassuaged voter dissatisfaction.
This year, Democratic candidates in New York have largely avoided any association with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the state's leading incumbent. But nationally, victories by political outsiders could send a powerful signal to Mr. Cuomo as he contemplates a challenge to the consummate Washington insider, President Bush.
 
47 Independents
 The strategy of attacking the ins threads through disparate local elections in New York and Connecticut and crucial races that could cost Democrats their slim majorities in both houses of the New Jersey Legislature -- 23 to 17 in the Senate and 43 to 37 in the Assembly -- for the first time in two decades. Fully 47 candidates appear on the ballot as independents -- more than four times the number who ran in 1987 without being identified as Democrats or Republicans.
In nearly every campaign, challengers are mining discontent over tax increases and service cuts that have outraged voters ravaged by a stubborn national recession that has proved to be particularly intractable in the Northeast.
In New York, mayors from Newburgh to Niagara Falls decided not to even seek re-election.
In New Jersey, Gov. Jim Florio's own name won't be on the line until 1993, but it became a Republican epithet as he emerged as the clearest target of a tax-increase backlash. He has struggled to convert the legislative races from a referendum on his $2.8 billion tax package into a vote on President Bush's domestic policies.
 
'Very, Very Bad Year'
 Patrick G. Halpin, the Democrat elected as Suffolk County Executive in an upset four years ago, is also pointing fingers upward -- at Albany and Washington -- to divert blame for Long Island's economic slump.
Paradoxically, said John A. Marino, the New York Democratic state chairman, some Republican challengers are "in better shape politically because their president has given us a national recession.
"It's a very, very bad year for incumbents," Mr. Marino added, predicting, hopefully, that voter antipathy will not abate in 1992 when a Republican United States Senator from New York and a Republican President run for re-election.
The smallest Republican gain numerically -- though larger symbolically -- may come in New York City, where reapportionment and expansion of the City Council have transformed the November election from the usual formality. Republicans are poised to expand their Council minority of one, possibly by unseating one or two incumbents on Manhattan's East Side and by capturing up to three other seats.
One of those seats is on Staten Island, where the Democratic organization formally disavowed the Mayor last week, in part to absolve its Council nominees of guilt by association. No Democratic Council member has lost a general election since 1985, and that was on Staten Island where the proportion of enrolled Republicans is higher than in any other borough.
Only one incumbent was unseated in the September primary.
Regardless of whether Republicans gain, tomorrow's special election will produce 16 more incumbents. It will transform the Council's complexion, if not its ideology, by ratifying the results of primaries that guaranteed a dramatic rise in black and Hispanic representation, from 25 percent of the current 35-member Council to about 40 percent of the 51-member body that will be inaugurated in January.
Barring upsets, the Council also will have its first Dominican member and two openly gay Councilmen.
In the region, the immediate threat is to the gains Democrats in county executive races four years ago in Suffolk and in Monroe County upstate. And the Democrats' half-century hegemony in Albany County may be jeopardized.
Thomas Frey, the first Democratic County Executive of Monroe, surrounding Rochester, even produced a television commercial that expressed his frustration over being held accountable for economic conditions beyond his control: "Did you ever know anybody who got so mad they went home and kicked their dog?" the commercial asks, as the camera pans from a labrador retriever to the county executive. "Well sometimes I know how the dog feels," Mr. Frey says.
In Westchester, the outcome of tomorrow's ballotting for the Board of Legislators could also determine who succeeds County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, a Republican who has been nominated for a Federal judgeship. His successor will be chosen by the board, which Republicans now control 10 to 7.

Polls and Quacks

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
Among the many terrifying and shabby facts of modern life is the fact that our rulers never make a move without taking a public-opinion poll. In Ronald Reagan's favor let it be noted that sometimes at least he preferred the astrologer's counsel to the guidance of the poll-taker.
In this he was attuned to the wisdom of the ancients who pondered chicken entrails as well as the flight patterns of birds and asked advice of the Cumaean Sibyl, the Delphic Oracle and other such frauds before undertaking new adventures in statecraft and war. 
 For predicting the course of human behavior, quacks may be no more dependable than scientists, but a statesman relying on the latest chicken-entrail readings is apt to be less sure of himself than one under the influence of scientifically calibrated instrumentation, hence more likely to think for himself, which, after all, is what we're paying him for.
These reflections are prompted by the latest poll stating that a large majority of the population disapproves of the United States Congress.
And who elects this Congress of which a large majority of the population disapproves? Of course: a large majority of the population. Since the Congress then reflects the people who elect it, is the poll telling us that a large majority of Americans are fed up with themselves? Incapable of making choices that don't disgust them?
Of course not. The poll isn't telling us anything unless you think it news that public opinion about Congress hasn't changed from public opinion reflected 110 years ago in Eugene Field's observation: "Some statesmen go to Congress and some go to jail. It is the same thing, after all."
Being sick and tired of Congress is a traditional and honorable American state of mind, and not doing anything about it is as American as not getting carried away by gun-control fanatics every time a mass murderer lets off a heavy load of psychic steam by mowing down a dozen people or so.
Congress may hate these mass murders, but it is never stampeded by them into assaulting the constitutional right to bear the weapons that make them such an easy option for the aggrieved and maladjusted. In the same way, every two years Americans, though fed up with Congress, refuse to be stampeded into electing a new one and vote to re-elect 95 percent of the membership.
There are several explanations for this, none flattering to the kind of Americans who get surveyed by the poll-taker. One is that these disgusted masses who are fed up with Congress are fed up with everybody's Congressmen but their own, so they keep electing him.
Another is that once somebody gets elected to Congress the corrupt system of financing so vital to American political campaigns makes it impossible for an outsider to beat him; in other words, Americans can't bear to vote against anybody coarse, tasteless and brutal enough to subject them to an overwhelming assault of television commercials.
President Bush's approval by polled America is down too. Presidential popularity polls yo-yo up and down with the flow of events. With war, they rise in the usual opening surge of patriotic zeal; with unemployment, they fall, and fall, and fall.
We are now in the unemployment phase. Until it ends, count on it, the Bush yo-yo will keep dropping unless a war comes along. If Saddam Hussein is aware of the way American politics works, he might sensibly stop asking for a punch in the nose unless the American economy improves before next November.
That it might not improve before next November must be more than the Bush people can bear to contemplate. Another year in these doldrums would leave the invincible Bush looking so vincible that it might even breathe life into the Democratic Party.
Before this could happen, of course, somebody articulate and with a few ideas would have to tell the Democratic Party who it was, what it stood for and what it wanted the country to become. At present, at the Washington level, it is only an association of office-seekers, which stands for getting its members elected, and which wants the country to become a place that will quit electing Republican Presidents and now and then choose the occasional Democrat.

HEADLINE: Cars Are America's Main Form of Mass Transit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Right Road for Transportation" (editorial, Oct. 26), you understate when you observe that the Federal transportation bill shows less appreciation for the country's changing needs than for traditional practices like building more highways and passing out more pork to individual members. The House and Senate bills fail to address the real problems except to provide funds for maintenance of highways and bridges.
The attempts by Congress to improve "mass transit" address less than .5 percent of the problem, while virtually ignoring 98 percent. According to Department of Transportation statistics for passenger-miles traveled by Americans, cars account for 86 percent; airlines 12 percent, and the remaining 2 percent takes in all forms of "mass transit," of which rail (including commuter) represents .44 percent. 
Congress fails to realize that we enjoy the most advanced mass-transit system in the world -- the private automobile, which gets you from where you are to where you want to go. And when distances are longer, you drive to the airport. Long-distance passenger rail travel is a thing of the past, no matter how fast the trains run. Magnetic levitation will not save Amtrak.
Money would be better spent improving car and air travel, which account for 98 percent of passenger miles. For example, air travel's growth has produced gridlock congestion around major airports with skyrocketing parking costs. Airport parking should primarily be for those living within the airport vicinity, with satellite parking lots within 20 to 30 miles of major airports, linked with the airports by a relatively low-cost overhead transit system. The same transit system could link the three major airports in the New York area.
For freight transportation, neither the Senate nor House bill has considered pneumatic capsule pipeline technology, which would allow common carrier freight to be moved through underground pipelines in an automated system. This would displace most of the long-haul trucks from the interstate highway system. The technology has been extensively developed, and because of projected economies this looks like the freight transportation system for the 21st century. Aside from relieving surface congestion, such systems are environmentally benign, operate with a high degree of safety and reliability, and are highly energy efficient.
The House bill states that Congress finds that "Despite annual expenditures in excess of $10 billion on surface transportation and its infrastructure, the Federal Government has not developed a clear vision of how the surface transportation system of the 21st century will differ from the present." Congress has overlooked moving freight underground through pipelines. The Soviet Union has about a dozen such underground freight transport systems operating today, and the number is growing.

HEADLINE: Our Diplomats Need Lessons in Diplomacy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your account of the behavior in Japan of David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, who harshly criticized the Japanese on financial regulation (Business Day, Oct. 18), raises questions about the training that American diplomats and officials receive. Presumably, Mr. Mulford was in Japan at the invitation of the Japanese Government. His performance was a remarkable example of cultural insensitivity.
I have no doubt that Mr. Mulford, and others of his kind, have been well schooled in the traditional disciplines of economics, political science and history. The students of their generation functioned in a much more homogenous world, dominated by Anglo-European concepts of diplomacy and international relations. The world has changed and, like it or not, the balance has tilted. The players now adhere to a variety of cultural concepts and norms.
If the United States is to remain a respected and central player, it will have to come to terms with the new internationalized workplace. Likewise, the training its players receive will need to reflect these changes. International studies programs in many colleges recognize this trend. Their curriculum goes beyond the traditional political and economic base to provide training in crosscultural communication and an appreciation of the diverse value systems at play in the world.
It is time our political decision makers caught up with the younger generation.

HEADLINE: Economic Trend for 90's: Fear;
Grappling With Tough Times on Long Island

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Nov. 4

 BODY:
It is hard to pinpoint, but sometime in the last year economic fear took deep root in New York's suburbs. William Butler, head of the state unemployment office in Hempstead, saw it by March. "We had so many white collar professionals coming in," he says, "we didn't know what to do with them." He started job-search seminars, but couldn't keep up. The waiting list is now a month. Last week's seminar included a lawyer, an accountant, three teachers, four engineers and a company vice president.
In the suburban malls -- where there is no weather -- everyone talks about the economy. "It's the main thing I discuss with friends," Seth Rosenthal, a Macy's manager, was saying at the Roosevelt Field mall in Carle Place, L.I. "We were talking about this before Judge Thomas, and we're talking about it now." 
 It is there in the numbers: Unemployment in New York's suburbs has nearly doubled in the last year, from roughly 3 to 6 percent, going as high as 7.8 percent in Suffolk County; Long Island is losing jobs for only the second time since the state began keeping statistics in 1958; the Federal bankruptcy court in Westbury, L.I., had 15,000 filings by the end of October this year, compared with 11,600 for all 1990 and 6,000 in 1986.
Economic fear drives people to do things they wouldn't do in better times. Last month Peter Daraio, principal of Clara Carlson Elementary School in Elmont, L.I., reported to the Federal authorities two illegal immigrants: children who had come to register at his school. Though he was criticized by refugee advocates and Hispanic groups and told not to do it again by his superintendent, he had no apologies. "We can't go on taking care of the world," he says. "We're not in good shape. When I came to this school seven years ago, we had one teacher for every 15 or 16 kids in primary grades. Now with budget constraints, it's one for 28."
The Elmont district, which borders Queens and is far more integrated than most Long Island districts (about half minority), has hired investigators to make sure that students from New York City are not sneaking into the schools. "Each year 10 to 15 students who want a better education are tossed out of my school and sent back to Queens," Mr. Daraio said. "And here we have illegal aliens, and we must give them space. That doesn't make sense to me."
 
'Very, Very Bad Here'
 Rita Mezzapelle, who runs the Elmont Herald (circulation 5,200) from the den of her five-room Cape Cod, wrote an article about the burdens illegal immigrants put on taxpayers, right after receiving a $400 increase in her school tax bill. She was angry when the Federal authorities said they did not have staff to go after the immigrant family, which had since disappeared. If Federal law requires illegal immigrants to be educated, Ms. Mezzapelle said, the "education President" ought to supply more money. "Things are very, very bad here," she said. "I've been putting out the paper since 1978, and I've never had more than one legal notice of a foreclosure. In the edition I'm doing now, I have four foreclosures. No, I missed one -- five. Five!"
The Renards, at 6 Diamond Street, are one of those foreclosures. They bought their three-bedroom house six years ago for $165,000. When the economy boomed, Duverna Renard took the profits from his two taxis and invested in a limousine service. He lost the limo service, and when he tried to make up the money through the taxis, the recession had hit. "The gulf war killed me," he says. "People stopped flying. You'd wait hours at the airport for a fare."
Elmont is primarily a middle-class and blue-collar suburb, but there is plenty of fear and loathing, too, in Huntington, L.I., an upper-middle-class town that is venting its spleen at a cable company. Since deregulation, cable companies have operated in each town as virtually unchecked monopolies. There have been periodic uprisings on Long Island against Cablevision, the major supplier here, but nothing with the broad support of the current Huntington outburst.
It started when Cablevision announced that it would modernize the town's system at no charge. On the surface that sounded great, but in practice it meant that subscribers who on their own had hooked up a second television to cable would now have to pay an extra $7 monthly for that additional set.
Before long, the town hall was crammed with angry citizens; Democrats and Republicans had found a common enemy. Two propositions are on Tuesday's ballot asking voters if they'd like to kick out Cablevision. Never mind that Cablevision backed down, making the modernization optional for each subscriber. Never mind that the state cable commission calls the referendum illegal.
"It has lots to do with the economy," said Thomas Sinnickson, counsel for Huntington's recently formed cable committee. "In boom times you could justify paying $40, $50 a month on cable. Now -- you know what it is? Everybody's on edge. And the edge is, you don't know if it'll ever come back."
Mr. Sinnickson sounds like a 60's radical when he speaks of cable: "Cable operators as a whole have become pigs! With no competition they gorge themselves in greed!" He's a Republican.
The particulars for each suburban region differ, but the end point is the same. On Long Island, says Gary Huth, a state economist, it started with layoffs by military contractors, then the real estate and construction industries, retail sales, banking, insurance and most recently, government. "Health services are strong," he said. The good news is that people continue to get sick.
 
Lulls and Layoffs
 Frank Cohen, 66 years old, of Long Beach, L.I., has been in the tire business most of his life. He knows idle trucks don't wear out tires. "Everyone's hurting," he says. "You understand Yiddish? Right now there are no big machers." And furthermore: "I reiterate, no big machers!" He is angrier. "Yeah, you hate the people you hate more." In Mr. Cohen's case, that's former President Reagan and President Bush. ("What's he doing traveling around the world?") Other people suburbanites hate more are their Governor, the Democratic Congress, "those damn politicians," inhumane bosses and themselves.
A year ago Kathy Jackson moved to Great Neck, L.I., and within three days found a job as a legal secretary for $28,000. She types 65 words a minute, knows six word-processing programs, has 15 years' experience. Last spring things got slow at the firm. She's been out five months now and has no savings. The unemployment checks stop this week.
Last year Terry McQuade, who made $40,000 with overtime in building operations for Merrill Lynch, and his wife, a computer operator, bought a house in Elmont. A few months later he was dismissed, and he hasn't been able to land steady work since. He puts on one of his three blue suits and walks up and down Manhattan, dropping off resumes, hoping a personal visit will make an impression. "A lot of companies I couldn't get by security. I tried." It's hard making his monthly mortgage payment of $1,637. "Hard? I've gone into all my cash advances on my credit cards. It's destroying my marriage."
 
Support Groups for Jobless
 There are so many support groups for unemployed professionals in Connecticut -- at least 50 -- that they now hold a statewide gathering on the first Saturday each month in Ridgefield. Robert Lobman, a computer systems expert who has made as much as $110,000 yearly, lives in Wantagh, L.I., but drove to Saturday's meeting with two other men from Long Island. He goes to unemployment support groups nearly every day. On Monday nights he runs his own group in Wantagh. Tuesdays he attends meetings for unemployed computer specialists at Le Bistro in Elmwood Park, N.J. (The restaurant donates a dining room; to save money, the group doesn't eat.) Wednesdays he attends a group in Rye, N.Y., one of Westchester County's wealthiest suburbs.
"I'm busy, so I keep an 'up' attitude," said Mr. Lobman, who has been out of work for 16 months. "The less busy you are, the worse you get. It feeds on itself. I refuse to be embarrassed. I have two people on my block unemployed, they won't come to our group. They don't want anyone to know."
One of the most telling images of the Great Depression is a Walker Evans photo of a line of unemployed men and women standing in front of a billboard advertising new cars. For the 90's recession, the proper visual would be men and women alone in their suburban kitchens, using their touch-tone telephones to tell a computer they're still out of work.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Capital Crunch: Capitol Quandary

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IS the credit crunch real? Are banks denying creditworthy businesses the loans they need to invest the economy out of the recession?
The idea certainly appeals to the White House, which is in hot pursuit of a villain or three to explain why the stalled recovery is not the President's fault. But many economists remain skeptical. The fall in the volume of bank loans, they point out, could be explained equally well by a recession-induced decline in the demand for credit. 
 Or at least it could until now. Minds are bound to be changed by the release of the first serious analysis of the crunch hypothesis, by Ben Bernanke of Princeton University and Cara Lown of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. The study, to be published in the January issue of the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, confirms that a scarcity of bank capital has indeed affected the supply of loans. But the two economists believe that the full weight has been felt only in the Northeast. And they say the impact on jobs and incomes may be smaller than anecdotes of businesses' drying up for want of liquidity would suggest.
Everyone agrees that the banks have been bloodied by losses on business loans in general, and commercial real estate in particular. Everyone agrees that the timing of losses could not have been more awkward, since banks are under orders to beef up their stockholders' capital to comply with an international agreement signed by regulators in 1988.
But while the experts also agree that the fall in lending during this recession has been exceptionally severe, most acknowledge that the decline does not amount to proof that financially sound loan applicants have been given the bums' rush. It is possible that businesses have been inclined to borrow less than usual during this recession because they are carrying smaller inventories -- and because many overdosed on debt during the long boom of the 1980's.
But the Bernanke-Lown research blows away the case for a pure "demand-side" credit bust. They use simple statistical techniques to show that roughly half the state-to-state variations in the rate of change of business loans during this recession can be explained by parallel changes in bank stockholders' capital. New England has been hit hardest, with an 18 percent drop in commercial and industrial loans. Only the Pacific states have been spared a net decline in business lending.
Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Lown are quick to add that the reality of the bank credit crunch does not necessarily mean that the crunch is a principal cause of the economy's current woes. Most businesses look to alternative sources of finance when banks reject their loan applications. And if the crunch were severe, the two economists argue, one would have expected a surge in loans from insurance companies and non-bank finance companies, as well as increased sales of short-term corporate debt called commercial paper. In fact, the growth in alternative financing has been tepid, leading the two economists to conclude that demand for loans has cooled in tandem with the supply.
This latter point does not impress Ben Friedman, an economist at Harvard who was asked by Brookings to analyze the Bernanke-Lown results. The lack of an upturn in non-bank financing, he notes, may simply be because non-bank lenders are suffering a capital shortage of their own. Certainly, life insurers and the big industrial lenders like Westinghouse are in no position to profit from the banks' woes. Nor, in light of the perilous state of the junk bond market, is it plausible to assume that less-than-blue-chip companies can sell commercial paper.
Mr. Friedman also takes issue with the Bernanke-Lown view that the crunch has not reduced the Federal Reserve's room for monetary maneuver because, one way or another, the Fed's purchases of Government securities from the private market will still depress interest rates. The Harvard economist believes that blockage of the primary route to money creation, increased bank lending, could certainly slow down this process and limit its impact on business activity.
The least disputed implication of the research is perhaps the least expected. If Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Lown are to be believed, banks in New England are not making business loans as they otherwise would if they had a plumper cushion of capital. But the Federal prohibition on interstate banking stops better-endowed lenders from other parts of the country from coming to the rescue. New Englanders, it seems, are paying a hefty price for Washington's inclination to protect the turf of all those friendly neighborhood banks.

HEADLINE: Pushing Video in the Film Capital

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 5

 BODY:
The technological revolution they once hoped to bring to Hollywood has not yet arrived, but the Japanese companies with stakes in the entertainment industry are starting to attract attention with advanced video systems that might soon change the way movies and television shows are made.
The new high-definition video systems, which can record and display images in much sharper detail than current video technology, are perhaps best known to consumers as the basis for the next generation of television sets. But the Japanese companies with the greatest involvement in Hollywood, including Sony and Matsushita, are also promoting high-definition video as a breakthrough for film editing and special effects and ultimately as a new movie-making medium. 
 The Japanese are already seeing some results. The director Francis Ford Coppola recently used Japanese high-definition cameras and videotape to shoot screen tests for his next movie, "Dracula." The Walt Disney Company is using the process to help create special effects for the sequel to "Honey I Shrunk the Kids."
The technology was also used in making a commercial for Michael Jackson's forthcoming album, "Dangerous," and in production of "Prospero's Books," a recently released film based on Shakespeare's "The Tempest."
"These tools are going to make the movies of the future," Mr. Coppola told a conference on high-definition video technology earlier this year.
But many other directors and cinematographers remain more skeptical about high-definition video's value to them, and almost no one foresees it taking the place of 35-millimeter film any time soon.
Film makers say that for all the crystal clarity of the images it produces, high-definition video cannot come close to film's ability to capture the moods, the richness of color, the contrasts and shadings that collectively give a story visual life.
And 35-millimeter color film technology, the industry standard for six decades, has advanced significantly in recent years, giving movie makers considerably more flexibility in creating visual images. Competitive pressure from the Japanese high-definition video systems has also led the Eastman Kodak Company, the leading supplier of film to Hollywood, and other companies to develop sophisticated new editing and special- effects technology of their own.
High-definition video "is desperately trying to solve a need in the motion picture industry that simply doesn't exist," said Harry Mathias, a cinematographer who has studied and written about the new process.
 
Special Uses, Initially
 Recognizing that movie makers are not rushing to dump 35-millimeter film, the proponents of the new technology are concentrating for now on its advantages as a tool for special effects and editing. Editing videotape is far less costly and time consuming than editing film, and some studio executives are advocating the transfer of movies from film to high-definition tape for editing, and then back to film again for theatrical distribution.
In special effects, high-definition systems make it much easier to meld images from different sources into a seamless picture -- combining a background shot on film, for example, with an effect generated by a computer.
 
Patient Optimism by the Japanese
 The Japanese companies say that they are taking a long-term view, and that ultimately the technology will play a major role in Hollywood. The Sony Corporation has gone so far as to open a high-definition video laboratory in the middle of the lot of Columbia Pictures, the studio that Sony acquired two years ago. The lab is just steps from where technology-minded film makers like Steven Spielberg have been making movies.
Sony has been the most visible proponent in Hollywood of high-definition video. The Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, which last year acquired MCA Inc. and MCA's Universal Pictures studio, is also promoting the technology. So are several other Japanese companies with Hollywood ties, including NHK, Japan's state-run broadcaster. On Nov. 25, NHK plans to increase its broadcasting of high-definition television from the current one hour a day to eight.
Thomas Pollock, the head of MCA's motion picture group, said of the promotional efforts, "We're trying to educate people in the community and ourselves as to what you can do and can't do, and trying to educate the manufacturers, Matsushita and others, as to what film makers need to use this technology."
That Japan's initial influence on Hollywood is turning out to be more technological than creative is in keeping with the rationale offered by Sony and Matsushita when they bought the American studios.
Each company said it wanted a library of existing movies and television shows and a steady output of new entertainment "software" that could be shown on the high-definition television sets and other "hardware" they were developing. And they clearly saw Hollywood as an ideal proving ground for the potential of high-definition video.
Their vision was that television shows and movies could both be shot on high-definition videotape, broadcast to high-definition television sets or played on high-definition videocassette recorders in homes, and one day shown through high-definition projection systems in theaters.
Even the technology's boosters acknowledge, however, that the future is arriving more slowly than they had hoped.
The technology has been hindered by disagreements among Japan, the United States and Europe about what technical standard to adopt for high-definition broadcasting.
Some experts have argued that it is not worth investing billions of dollars in high-definition systems when an entirely new generation of video, based on digital technology, is likely to develop in the near future. In a digital video system, the image would be translated into a binary code of 0's and 1's that would let the picture be stored, manipulated and transmitted in the same manner as computer data.
And even though high-definition video has its advantages in editing and special effects, it is encountering stiffer-than-expected competition. Eastman Kodak last month introduced a system that uses powerful computers to transfer filmed images to a digital form. That allows those images to be manipulated or melded with other material to create the desired effects. The sequences can then be transferred back to film or to videotape.
To date, only one full-length feature movie has been shot in high-definition video -- "Julia and Julia," starring Kathleen Turner, which was released in 1988. The movie was shot by the Italian television network RAI and then transferred to film for theatrical distribution. The movie generally received poor reviews and sank with barely a ripple at the box office.
Executives at the Japanese-owned studios still insist that their technology will improve enough that shooting, editing and even projecting movies in high definition will one day make both artistic and economic sense.
"Creating feature films shot in HD is problematic, but possible still," said Sidney Ganis, an executive vice president of Sony Pictures Entertainment, the parent company for Columbia.
"In the meantime," he added, "the technology is proving extremely useful to the creative community. It has people intrigued, and it has people using it."

HEADLINE: Bush Seems to Oppose Tax Cut This Year

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Apparently ending any chance that the Administration would offer a plan this year to spur economic recovery through tax cuts, President Bush warned today that such action could prove counterproductive by driving interest rates "through the roof."
While insisting that he had not yet made up his mind, the President was seen as now firmly in the camp of advisers, including Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and the White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, who oppose tax cuts on the ground that a Congress controlled by Democrats could turn any fiscal initiative to their political advantage by simply increasing any benefits that Mr. Bush proposes. Mr. Darman said Monday that the Administration had decided to postpone any action until next year. 
 Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp and Vice President Dan Quayle have been urging Mr. Bush to propose cutting capital gains and other taxes to demonstrate engagement on the home front as the economic recovery loses momentum.
"What I don't want to do is come up with a growth package that just further burdens the American taxpayer, and I'm not going to do that," Mr. Bush said at a picture-taking session at the White House. "So some of these suggestions that shoot the long-term interest rates right out through the roof are simply unacceptable."
One Democratic measure, proposed by Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, would give families a $300 tax credit for each child. Another, offered by Senator Albert Gore and Representative Thomas Downey, would cut tax rates for middle-income Americans and impose a surtax on the rich.
The White House seems to have been impressed with negative reaction in the bond market when tax-cutting was broached by Democratic leaders in late October. Interest rates jumped, reflecting fears of higher budget deficits and revived inflation.
Mr. Bush expressed his own concern about this today, referring to what he called "the idea of getting broad tax cuts without regard as to what it does to long-term interest rates and the budget agreement." The budget deal struck with Congressional Democrats last autumn provided, among other things, that any new tax breaks must be offset by revenue increases elsewhere or by a decrease in Government spending.
The Administration has had on the table all year various measures, including a capital gains cut and expanded deductions for individual retirement accounts, that it contends would stimulate the economy without breaking the agreement.
Today's comments, however, were not seen as ruling out more aggressive efforts next year, when electoral pressures will intensify.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Rate Uncertainty Leaves The Dollar Little Changed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed yesterday as the expectation of lower interest rates in the United States cast a pall over the foreign exchange markets.
Gold prices were lower, slipping $2.70 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, to $354.10 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $354.10, down $2.30. 
 Few traders want to stake out big positions in the currency markets because they expect the Federal Reserve to push interest rates lower soon. A decline in interest rates would make United States Government securities and other dollar-denominated investments less attractive, thus lowering demand for the American currency.
Some analysts had expected the Fed to move before yesterday, when the Treasury began a three-day auction of new securities. But the central bank did not act, and no move is expected until Friday at the earliest -- after the current round of refinancing.
Most of the dollar buying yesterday was technical, pushing the currency up marginally against some major currencies.
The dollar rose to 130.025 yen in New York, from 129.185 late on Monday. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.38 yen, down from 130.74 on Friday. The Tokyo markets were closed on Monday for Culture Day, a national holiday. In London late yesterday, the American currency was quoted at a higher rate of 129.80 yen.
The British pound fell against the dollar. In New York, sterling edged down to $1.7725, from $1.7740 on Monday, and in earlier London trading, it fell to $1.7695 from $1.7810.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.6385 German marks, unchanged; 1.4455 Swiss francs, up from 1.4425; 5.6020 French francs, up from 5.5600; 1,228.00 Italian lire, up from 1,227.00, and 1.12065 Canadian dollars, down from 1.12135.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $356.40 an ounce, down from $356.60 late on Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $356.50 from $356.30. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $356.64, down from $356.85 late on Monday.
Silver dropped 1.9 cents on the Commodity Exchange, closing at $4.048 an ounce. Silver rose in London to a late bid of $4.09, compared with $4.08 late on Monday.

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Issues Fall, With Dow Off 14.31

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks fell in choppy trading yesterday, but the broad market was stronger. The Dow Jones industrial average was off by 14.31 points, to 3,031.31, with a decline for Walt Disney accounting for more than half the loss.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a moderate 172.1 million shares, up from 155.7 million on Monday. Declining issues had a small lead on gainers by 869 to 763. Trading on the Big Board pulled the composite down 0.75, to 214.68. 
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 1.57, to 388.71, while the American Stock Exchange Composite gained 0.84 to close at 384.94.
In Nasdaq trading, the composite index rose 1.32, to 538.82, while the Russell 2000, a measure of smaller stocks, inched up 0.10, to 183.96.
Ricky Harrington, director of equity investment for Marion Bass Securities, saw the market testing its support level of 3,000. And one obvious test at that level will be the Treasury's quarterly refunding, he noted.
"When the word got around about the disappointing three-year note auction yesterday, the stock market, which was dead even up until then, followed the bond market down," he said. "This may translate into problems possibly with the 10-year note and 30-year bond auctions to follow today and tomorrow. As a result, there is a risk that interest rates may turn higher and in turn put pressure on the economy and the stock market."
"If the market does not break below the 3,000 level in the next few days, we may be due for a further rally going into Thanksgiving," Mr. Harrington said.
 
Tracking Program Trades
 Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trades, said there were two buy programs in the morning and five program sells in the afternoon. The total impact on the Dow pulled it down 19.31 points.
Disney was down as Richard F. Simon an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, lowered his earnings estimate and removed the company from the recommend list. Trading on the stock was delayed earlier in the day, as the stock closed down 4 5/8 to finish at 113 3/4.

HEADLINE: The Mixed Blessing of Empty Bins

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTEREY, Ind.

 BODY:
A quiet yet radical change in American agricultural policy has largely eliminated the mountainous food stockpiles of the mid-1980's. But the new policies, of reducing price supports and subsidizing exports, have devastated the grain storage industry and angered other grain-exporting countries.
By encouraging farmers to grow less food and send more of what they do produce overseas, the Federal Government has mostly quit the expensive business of storing huge supplies of grain. Poor harvests in the last two years also contributed to clearing out stockpiles. Reserves are now so low that the Agriculture Department may soon start giving cash subsidies to exporters instead of free grain and dairy products. 
 The trend toward smaller stockpiles has been masked because the Government keeps separate statistics for each type of food. But when added, these figures show that Government-owned stores of grain and soybeans have plummeted by more than four-fifths in the last four years, to 561 million bushels this year.
 
A Giant Bin Is Empty
 The effects of those dwindling stockpiles are starkly visible at the grain elevator here in Monterey, a town of 230 people 36 miles southwest of South Bend.
Four years ago a tarpaulin here extended from the top of a 40-foot pole down to a circular wood fence and covered a million bushels of Government-owned corn. Today the pole and fence remain, but the tarpaulin is gone, and this temporary storage bin, like hundreds of others scattered across the Midwest, stands unused.
Nationwide, the stockpiles of cheese, honey and cotton have also shrunk, while only the stores of butter and dry milk have risen, a result of low market prices for these dairy products.
And grain-exporting countries like Australia, Brazil and Canada complain bitterly that they are losing markets to subsidized exports from the United States and Europe.
The policy shift has helped taxpayers by reducing the direct cost of supporting the nation's farmers to about $10 billion in the fiscal year that began last month from $14 billion in the 1987 fiscal year.
The Government paid $1.1 billion during the 1987 fiscal year to grain elevators for storage. For the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30 about $251 million was paid, and the estimate on payments for the current fiscal year is $142 million.
The new policy has, however, hurt grain elevators and it may have made food prices more volatile.
Government stockpiles can be sold only when grain prices reach fairly high levels. Large supplies, as during the 1988 drought, tend to moderate any big rise in grain prices, said Darrel L. Good, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana.
"If we'd had the current stocks in 1988, then I'm convinced prices would have gone higher than they did," he added.
The poor crops in the last two years, combined with low stockpiles, could lead to a leap in prices, said Carol G. Brookins, the president of World Perspectives Inc., a Washington agriculture consulting firm.
Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan said in an interview that he was not concerned about a possible shortfall because he had ordered that less land be held out of grain production next year than this year. "It has been a goal of the Administration to reduce those stockpiles," he said, "because large stockpiles have a very depressive effect on market prices for farmers' commodities."
Stockpiles ballooned in the mid-1980's because the Government allowed farmers to repay many loans with grain that was valued at far above the market price. In 1985, for example, farmers could sell corn on the open market at about $2.23 a bushel, and use the cash to pay off their Government loans. Or, they could give their corn directly to the Government, which counted each bushel as a payment of $2.55.
Now, the loan price supports are well below the market price for most commodities. Corn, for example, earns a credit of just $1.57 a bushel, as against the $2.41 cash price available in Monterey.
 
A Troubled Industry
 With all the changes, the grain elevator industry is going through a wrenching contraction.
Grain elevators deal directly with farmers and make money by shelling, drying, and either storing or trading grain. Most are privately owned, so figures on revenues and profits are hard to obtain. But the National Grain and Feed Association, a Washington-based trade group, says the nation's elevators have gone from being three-fifths full in 1987 to less than a third full this year.
Temporary bins across the United States are being abandoned, and the industry is struggling to keep its silos and permanent bins in operation. Some elevators are now operated only during the harvest season. A few permanent bins, which resemble long sheds with metal roofs or giant metal tanks, are even being used to raise hogs or have been partitioned to create personal storage areas for rent, said Kendell W. Keith, the association's executive vice president.
"Sometimes they're just abandoned because the revenues don't justify the costs of operating," he added.
 
One Elevator's Story
 At the Buckeye Ag-Center elevator in Monterey, much of the revenue and most of the profits during the mid-1980's came from the storage of Government grain. During that time, the grain elevator continued to buy some farmers' grain and either load it into railroad cars for shipment or store it for delivery at a higher future price. But much of the local farmers' grain was taken by the Government at steep market-support prices and stored in two permanent storage bins, built in 1983, and a temporary bin, built in 1986.
For the elevator operators, storing the Government's corn meant removing any remaining corn cobs with a shelling machine, drying the kernels with hot air in large metal cylinders to prevent decay, pumping the kernels into the storage bins and then collecting quarterly checks for years.
For them, the arrangement was almost as easy as holding Government bonds, and so lucrative that the temporary bin paid for itself in a year and a half, said Don Smolek, the grain manager here, who added that the elevator is breaking even now.
The grain "came in, and we clipped coupons," he said of the Government storage program.
 
The Effects of Change
 Now, the shrinkage of stockpiles has left a lot of extra storage room, so the Government and private owners are paying less per bushel to store less grain. In addition, many farmers now own big trucks that allow them to carry their crops economically over greater distances to the elevator offering the highest price.
International negotiations aimed at ending the competitive use of export subsidies could, if successful, increase exports and cause grain production to increase. But even this would only slow, and not reverse, the elevator industry's broad decline, experts agree.
"We're still going to have a reduction, but if we have full production then we'll have a more orderly reduction," said Donald G. Brouillette, the majority owner, chairman and chief executive of privately held Demeter Inc., which owns 23 grain elevators in three states and is based in Fowler, Ind., 55 miles southwest of Monterey.
There are 13 mostly aging grain elevators around Fowler, but the region could be served by just two large modern elevators, Mr. Brouillette said, adding that he is considering operating some of his elevators only during harvest season because of weak demand. "It hasn't been nearly as lucrative because there are too many people scrambling for too few bushels," he added.

HEADLINE: Bank Funds and C.D.'s Fall

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on deposit accounts fell sharply again this week in anticipation of further easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, a trade publication that covers interest rates.
"Deposit yields on savings accounts will be directly affected by whether the banks lower their prime rate by one-half point or by one-quarter point of 1 percent if the Federal Reserve cuts its discount rate a half-point," said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor. "If the banks do not match the Federal Reserve reduction, in essence they would be pocketing the difference at the consumer-borrower's expense." 
 Outside of the New York area, the commercial bank cutting its money market fund by the largest amounts was Seafirst of Seattle, which cut the yield offered as of today to 4.08 percent from 5.13 percent.
In the New York area, the largest cut among commercial banks was made by First Fidelity Bank of New Jersey., which cut its money market account by 35 points, to 4.50 percent. A point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
First Nationwide, a unit of the First Nationwide Financial Corporation, which is a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Corporation, was the savings bank that cut its three-month and six-month rates the most. The three-month certificate of deposit was lowered by 35 basis points, to 4.50 percent, and the six-month certificate of deposit was lowered 35 points, to 4.75 percent.
At New York commercial banks, the average yield on money market accounts was cut by 9 points, to 4.55 for money market accounts, while the average yields on three-month and six-month certificates were 4.68, and 4.77 percent, respectively.
At savings institutions in the New York area, yields on money market accounts were cut to 5.16 percent, down 2 basis points; 5.22 percent for three-month certificates, down 5 basis points, and 5.44 percent for six-month certificates, down 5 basis points.
The Bank Rate Monitor said the average yields on money market accounts at 20 big banks outside the New York area were cut by 12 basis points, to 4.71 percent, and by 7 basispoints, to 5.03 percent, on six-month certificates.
By comparison, at the Treasury's weekly bill auction on Monday the three-month bill was auctioned at an average discount rate of 4.74, compared with 4.99 a week earlier. The six-month bill averaged 4.80 percent, compared with 5.04 a week earlier.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
3-Year Note Auction Goes Badly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The first Treasury debt sale under new auction guidelines imposed in the wake of the Salomon Brothers bidding scandal went extremely poorly yesterday, as the Government struggled to sell $14 billion worth of new three-year notes.
Traders and analysts cited a number of reasons for the poor auction. But all agreed that it would cost the Treasury -- and the taxpayer -- well over $120 million in higher interest over the life of the securities sold yesterday. 
 Aside from an adverse reaction by primary dealers in Government securities to the new rules, traders said that the low level of short-term market rates and disappointment that the Federal Reserve Board did not move to cut key interest rates yesterday contributed to the poor results.
 
Watching Fed Policy
 Continued signs of economic weakness had led some traders and analysts to believe that the central bank, whose policy-making Open Market Committee met in Washington yesterday, might decide to lower the overnight Federal funds rate to 4 3/4 percent from its current target of 5 percent before the refunding auctions began.
The auction had a negative impact in the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds, where prices fell sharply, and interest rates rose after the results were announced.
The new securities were sold at an average yield of 6.00 percent, down from an average yield of 6.92 percent at the last three-year note sale on Aug. 8.
The poor reception given the notes was visible in an unusually wide discrepancy between high and low bids placed for the securities and the total amount of bids placed at the auction.
 
Less Efficiency Perceived
 The spread, or difference, between high and low bids -- an indicator of how efficient the price discovery mechanism has been at the auction -- was an unusually wide 6 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. At previous three-year note auctions a spread of 1 or 2 basis points has been the norm.
Moreover, the Treasury received only $21.7 billion worth of bids for the $14 billion worth of securities sold, the lowest total of bids placed at a three-year auction since 1978. In recent three-year note auctions, total bids have amounted to $40 billion or more.
Traders and analysts said the low total was at least partly a protest by primary dealers against the new auction rules.
"This was probably the worst auction in the last 10 years," one government securities trader said. "Low short-term rates probably had a good deal to do with the results. But there may have been a sort of coordinated protest on the part of the dealers, too. And it has cost the taxpayer money."
The new auction guidelines, announced Oct. 26, were intended to open up the bidding process to brokers who have not been designated as primary dealers in Government securities by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The rule changes were made in response to the bidding violations disclosed by Salomon Brothers in August. Previously, firms wishing to place bids at Treasury auctions did so through the primary dealers, a group of 39 securities firms and banks.
"The trend in Washington is to chip away at differences between primary dealers and non-primary dealers," said Louis v.B. Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm. "But if you chip away all the differences then the dealers won't be there. These auction results serve as a reminder to the Treasury that something quite specific is gained from the commitment dealers make to backstop Treasury auctions."
 
Only a Rational Response
 Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets, said the reaction by primary dealers was not a protest, but merely a rational reflection of how the rule changes have increased the risk and lowered the reward for primary dealers bidding at the auctions.
"Rather than a protest, I think this is a natural response on the part of primary dealers to the change in incentives," Mr. Stone said.
Jay Powell, the Treasury's Assistant Secretary for domestic finance, said in a telephone interview: "We had an auction that was not as successful as we had hoped, But we find it a little far-fetched that the kind of rule changes we made would have a material effect on an auction."
The debt sale was the first leg of the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions, which continue today and tomorrow with the sale of a total of $24 billion worth of new 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
Analysts said the results of the much less speculative three-year note auction cast doubt on how large demand would be for the securities.
Late yesterday the new 10-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.53 percent, up sharply from 7.47 percent late Monday.
Traders in the secondary market for Treasury securities responded to yesterday's results by pushing prices of outstanding notes and bonds down sharply.
By late in the day, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 101 1/8, down more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.02 percent, compared with 7.95 percent late Monday.
Among note issues, the 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 3/8, down 9/32, to yield 6.78 percent. And the 6 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 18/32, down 1/8 point, to yield 5.69 percent.
 
Bill Rates Are Up
 Late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.74 percent, up 2 basis points. And six-month bill rates rose by a basis point, to a late offered rate of 4.79 percent.
Fears that interest rates may have bottomed prompted a number of investment-grade corporations to price new debt issues.
Among the issuers was Sears, Roebuck & Company, which sold a total of $900 million worth 3- 7- and 20-year securities through and underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Yields on the securities ranged from 7.08 percent on the three-year notes to 9 3/8 percent on the 20-year securities.
The issue is rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by Standard & Poor's.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for an offering of $542 million worth of securities backed by auto loan receipts from a financing entity of the Chrysler Corporation.
The 6.25 percent securities, which have an average life of 1.8 years, were priced at $99.637 to yield 6.55 percent, 85 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
The issue is rated triple-Aby both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
 
Popular High-Yield Issue
 In the high-yield junk bond market, the Maxxam Group priced a $130 million offering of four-year notes through an underwriting group led by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The 12 3/4 percent notes were priced at $99, to yield 13.08 percent.
Due to strong demand, the size of the issue was increased from $100 million. The securities are rated B-2 by Moody's and B-minus by Standard & Poor's.
The slide in Treasury prices had a negative impact on prices of secondary issues in the investment-grade and tax-exempt municipal bond markets.
Corporate traders said prices of most issues had fallen by anywhere from 1/4 point to 3/8 point.
Meanwhile, prices of widely quoted issues in the secondary municipal bond market slipped by 1/8 point to 1/4 point, market participants said.

Grains and Soybeans Drop On Doubts Over Soviet Aid

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Grain and soybean futures prices fell yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid flagging hopes for an announcement soon on new United States food aid to the Soviet Union.
Wheat for delivery in December dropped 1/2 cent to settle at $3.62 1/2 a bushel; December corn fell 2 1/2 cents, to $2.49 1/4 a bushel; December oats fell 1 1/2 cents, to $1.30 1/4 a bushel, and November soybeans slipped 3/4 cent, to $5.63 a bushel. 
 Last week's expectations for an imminent award of Soviet food aid approaching $3.5 billion have given way to perceptions that President Bush is reluctant to propose such a large package to a Congress preoccupied with domestic economic woes.
President Bush said yesterday that he planned to discuss a possible Soviet aid package with his economic advisers but did not indicate when an announcement would be made.
"The United States has always tried to be of assistance to people who are really truly hurting, but there's certainly some constraints on what the United States can do right now because of our own budget problems," he said.
Prospects for a multibillion-dollar Soviet aid package heavily weighted toward livestock feed helped corn and soybean prices last week. But some analysts now doubt the White House will offer more than $1 billion in export loan guarantees.
"We aren't seeing anything in the market to push it toward the positive side except these credits, and any kind of delay is just pushing us toward a weaker tone," said Jason Roose, a broker with U.S. Commodities Inc. in Des Moines.
A further drop of 5 cents in the corn market would likely start heavy selling by traders who bought into the market during the last two weeks on speculation that a Soviet aid announcement was just around the corner, said Katharina Zimmer, a grain analysts with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
Orange juice futures rose sharply for the third straight day on the New York Cotton Exchange on news of price increases by Brazilian processors and exporters of frozen concentrated orange juice. Brazil supplies about 25 percent of the American orange juice market.
November deliveries of frozen concentrated orange juice surged 3.95 cents in New York to $1.722 a pound.
Crude oil was little changed on the New York Mercantile Exchange but refined petroleum products rallied amid scattered refinery troubles and speculation that the nation's gasoline supply was still falling.
December deliveries of light crude oil fell 2 cents to $23.78 a barrel.
After trading ended, the American Petroleum Institute reported that the gasoline supply fell by 1.4 million barrels last week to 204.3 million.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales End October Even Lower

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Sales of cars and light trucks built in North America declined 8 percent in late October from a year earlier, the 11 domestic auto makers reported today. Analysts said the figures suggested that underlying demand remained weak, largely because of consumers' concerns about the economy and anemic growth in real wages.
"It appears we're beating a dead horse," said Tom Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association, who added that many special financing deals were having little effect. "No matter how low the interest rate, it's difficult to get a financially strapped and psychologically skittish consumer to sign a five-year contract to buy a new car." 
 For the 10 days that ended on Oct. 31, the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for cars was 6.2 million, compared with 7 million a year earlier. Domestic car sales totaled 228,637 in the period, down 10.4 percent from 1990. There were 10 selling days in the period this year, and 9 in the 1990 period.
Light-truck sales fell 3.7 percent in the 10-day period, to 132,252.
 
Lowest Sales Rate Since May
 The annual selling rate for the month was 6 million, the poorest showing since May. Sales of cars, both domestic and foreign, dropped 10.9 percent in October, while sales of light trucks were off 8 percent.
Analysts noted that the weak figures were due partly to lower fleet sales to car-rental companies, a result of the car makers' new policy that forces the rental companies to keep cars longer before trading them in. Even after those sales are discounted from the overall numbers, however, the figures point to sluggish consumer demand.
"There is still no turnaround," said Jean-Claude Gruet, an analyst with UBS Securities in New York. The auto makers recently announced production cuts for the remainder of the fourth quarter, providing more evidence that they are bracing for further sales declines.
Dealers across the country reported mixed results in recent weeks. Several echoed the plaint of James M. Rife, who said showroom traffic was down 30 percent at his family's Chevrolet dealership in Sebeka, Minn. Shoppers are uneasy about the economy, he said, and some are trying to make unrealistic deals, thinking that dealers are more willing to slash prices in light of the financial difficulties of the American auto makers.
Mr. Rife still has eight new cars and trucks from the 1990 model year on his lot. "I've never had this problem before," he said.
But one dealer said incentives and new-model introductions had helped to generate sales. At Kurland Cadillac-Oldsmobile-GMC Truck in Nanuet, N.Y., sales were up 24 percent in October from a year earlier. Joe DiRocco, general sales manager, attributed the increase in part to the introduction of restyled Cadillac Seville and Eldorado models. General Motors' three-year, $499 lease special on deVille models and 2.9 percent financing on the Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight Royale are also raising sales, he said.
American auto makers continued to lose market share to the Japanese in October. The Big Three held 67.9 percent of the overall vehicle market, including imports, compared with 70.2 percent a year earlier. Japanese car makers increased their share to 26.6 percent, from 23.9 percent. The market share of non-Japanese importers fell to 5.5 percent, from 5.9 percent a year earlier.
Sales of all cars and trucks, imported and domestic, fell 10 percent for the entire month, to 1.03 million, from 1.14 million in October 1990. G.M. sold 230,170 North American-built cars in October, a drop of 13.5 percent from a year earlier; Ford sold 137,067, a drop of 15.6 percent, and Chrysler sold 63,579, down 21.7 percent.
G.M.'s total market share for all cars in October was 34.2 percent, compared with 35.3 percent in October 1990. Ford had a 20.8 percent share, compared with 21.4 percent a year earlier. Chrysler's total market share was 10 percent, down from 11.3 percent. Toyota's market share was 9.7 percent, up from 8.3 percent, and Honda's share was 10.6 percent, compared with 9.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Productivity Rose at 2.4% Rate Last Quarter

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Caution and cost-cutting may be slowing down the economy, but they are having the opposite effect on the country's efficiency. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday that productivity in the United States economy, outside of farming, rose at a healthy 2.4 percent clip last summer, the first gain in a year and the fastest pace since the summer of 1988.
Economists, who cautioned that the gain could later be revised away, greeted the report as a hopeful sign. "The economic environment is tough," said Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley, "but the silver lining is productivity." 
 The spurt in efficiency may partly be a product of efforts -- some begun years ago -- by service companies to automate, streamline operations and squeeze overhead. "New technology has allowed us to grow without adding people," said Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, a Minneapolis-based retailer with 750 stores around the country. "It's allowed us to work faster and smarter."
Productivity almost always revives in the wake of a recession, as businesses hold off on adding new hands and employees work harder. The question is whether productivity will perform equally well in the fourth quarter, when economists expect growth in the gross national product to slow to a 1.5 percent rate or less compared with G.N.P. growth of nearly 2.5 percent in the summer.
"We've seen signs that the economy turned quite sluggish in September and October," said Edwin R. Dean, associate commissioner at the bureau, "and we don't know what that portends for productivity."
But Mark J. Lasky, senior economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass., thinks business will keep aggressively pruning costs and paring work hours; he expects productivity will advance at an even faster 2.9 percent rate this fall.
Last summer's rise in output for each hour worked reflected the fact that non-farm business output increased at a solid 3 percent rate while hours worked inched up at just a six-tenths of 1 percent pace. "Business is producing more, but it isn't using more workers to do it," Mr. Lasky said.
The increase in productivity, typical in the early stages of a recovery, augurs well for inflation, profit margins and, eventually, pay. "It's a good sign for the cost picture generally," Mr. Dean said. "Labor costs are increasing very slowly over all."
The rise in labor costs for each dollar of output, an important determinant of profit margins and prices, slowed sharply in the summer. Unit labor costs actually fell in manufacturing at a seven-tenths of 1 percent rate. In services, where costs had been rising at a runaway 6 percent rate, the increase slowed to a 2 percent pace.
In any case, hourly output in the nation's factories soared at a 4 percent annual rate last summer for the second consecutive quarter.
"You ain't seen nothing yet," said Adrian T. Dillon, vice president for planning at the Eaton Corporation, a Cleveland-based manufacturer. "The restructuring efforts we made at the beginning of the year show that business is taking a hard-nose look at costs in order to make sure that we can make money even in this dreadful economic environment."
 
Gain in Service Sector
 An even more encouraging note of improvement was struck in the sprawling service sector, where productivity has stagnated for more than a decade and efforts to cut overhead have brought an unusual stream of white-collar layoffs. According to unpublished data from the bureau, non-farm, non-manufacturing productivity rose at a respectable 1.5 percent annual rate after declining at more than that pace last spring.
"We're seeing all this white-collar restructuring," said Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley, who recently published an article in the Harvard Business Review on productivity in the service sector."This will be a very unique recovery, driven primarily by efficiency rather than new hiring."
One corner of the service sector that has seen more than its share of restructuring is commercial banking. "We're re-engineering the industry," said Michael R. Zucchini, executive vice president at the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, based in Providence, R.I., which earlier this year acquired the failed Bank of New England. "From the back end to the front end, we're looking at new ways to reduce expenses and improve quality, and we're doing this primarily through consolidation." Fleet/Norstar has been pruning branches and, more important, merging back-office operations.

HEADLINE: An Enormous Empire With Debts to Match

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Robert Maxwell died just as his grip on his global publishing empire seemed to be slipping.
His empire -- and investor confidence -- had been shaken by turnovers in management, the burden of billions of dollars in debts incurred from acquisitions made in the 1980's, and depressed business conditions in the United States and Britain. It also has had to absorb losses from The Daily News in New York, which Mr. Maxwell acquired last spring, and from The European, an English-language pan-European weekly newspaper he introduced in May. 
 As a result of the problems, he has had to sell all or parts of significant holdings. This year alone, divestitures have totaled more than $1.9 billion.
 
Two Sons Take Positions
 Mr. Maxwell's two sons stepped into the void today by assuming control of his two flagship companies.
Ian R. Maxwell, 35 years old, was named acting chairman of Mirror Group Newspapers P.L.C., one of Britain's leading newspaper companies. He had been executive director.
And Kevin F. H. Maxwell, 32, was named acting chairman of the Maxwell Communication Corporation, whose operations include Macmillan book publishers, Berlitz language products and the Official Airline Guides. He had become chief executive in July.
"The vacuum left is obviously a very big vacuum because Maxwell is so personally identified with the running of the companies," said Neil Blackley, an analyst at James Capel & Company in London.
Mr. Maxwell presided over the finances of his empire, including the dizzying pace of buying and selling businesses and shifting assets among an array of private and public holding companies and trusts. Onlookers were often left unsure of which entity owned what. The interests of the Maxwell family's private companies also included a market-research company, soccer teams and papers in Israel and Hungary.
With Mr. Maxwell gone, some analysts wondered whether his successors would have the patience to wait for businesses like The European and The Daily News to become profitable.
In an article published last month, The Independent, a British newspaper, said it calculated that Mr. Maxwell's private companies have a debt of about 1 billion ($1.77 billion).
Given Mr. Maxwell's domination of his empire, some analysts speculated that his death must be sending shivers through the banks and financial firms that have lent him money.
It is known that Mr. Maxwell pledged sizable stakes in some of his companies as collateral for loans from banks and investment firms, reportedly including Goldman, Sachs & Company and Midland Bank of Britain.
Mr. Maxwell had already been scrambling to sell assets to reduce debt. Deals this year have included the 446 million sale of Pergamon Press, the scientific and academic publisher that was one of the empire's jewels.
In May, he offered for sale to the public 49 percent of Mirror Group, his British newspaper operation, for 245.5 million.
And in July he announced his intention to sell shares in the North American operations of Maxwell Communication, the company that accounts for the vast majority of the assets and operating profits of his holdings.
The article in The Independent concluded that the debts of Maxwell Communication may exceed the value of its assets by almost 400 million ($708 million).
"Maxwell Communication is obviously in a financially delicate situation," Mr. Blackley said. In the year that ended March 31, Maxwell Communication's earnings before taxes and extraordinary items dropped 15.6 percent, to 145.5 million on sales of 996.9 million. But the vast majority of those earnings came from things like foreign-exchange profits and one-time gains.
When trading in the company's stock was suspended today in London after losing 12.9 percent of its value, its price was 1.21 ($2.14). That was down from a 1991 high of 2.41.
Mr. Blackley added that the Mirror Group, with a net debt of about 350 million ($619.2 million) "is fine" financially. Its British newspapers include five tabloids led by The Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror, Britain's second-largest daily and Sunday papers, with average daily circulations in September of about 2.9 million each.
But investor jitters, which analysts have attributed to the recession in Britain and the sluggish American economy, nervousness about the Maxwell empire's finances and second thoughts about the true value of the company, have caused Mirror's stock price to plunge. It was 77.5 pence ($1.37) when trading in the shares was suspended in London today. That was down from 78 pence on Monday and from a 1991 peak of 1.27 reached shortly after the offering of shares.

HEADLINE: Banking Overhaul's Fate;
Bush Never Pulled All the Political Stops And a Top Domestic Priority Unraveled

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
The competing interests of powerful lobbies could not be reconciled. Many lawmakers, without really addressing the merits, smelled a rerun of the savings-and-loan disaster. And President Bush never pulled out all the stops politically.
So legislation to revamp the nation's anachronistic banking system, which at the beginning of the year the President called his top domestic priority, has come unraveled. 
 Before the year is out, Congress will probably give the Administration a $70 billion loan from the taxpayers to shore up the bank insurance fund. And Congress may agree to lift the age-old restrictions on banks' opening branches nationwide, although the Administration will have to play its cards exactly right to get even that relatively modest change.
 
Fate of Other Proposals
 But Mr. Bush's more ambitious proposals to permit banks to sell insurance and stocks and underwrite bonds and to allow commercial enterprises like retail chains and even automobile companies to buy banks are almost certainly dead.
On Monday night, the House of Representatives voted down comprehensive changes in the nation's banking laws. The Bush Administration actually worked against the bill in the House because it had become so filled with bank restrictions the President opposed. The Senate today found itself unable, at least for the time being, to begin debating a similar measure. [Page D6.]
No one doubts that banking laws are outmoded. They were written mostly during the Great Depression, long before the advent of money-market mutual funds, commercial paper, bank credit cards, computer transfers of funds, automated teller machines and countless other mainstays of modern banking and financial life.
And no one doubts that the banking system is deeply troubled. Many of the nation's most prominent banks like Citibank and the Bank of Boston are in financial straits, scores of banks are expected to fail in the next couple of years, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is close to insolvency.
But no consensus exists on whether modernizing the system would avert a more serious banking crisis, and few experts believe it would make any short-term difference.
The Administration argued that over the long run its measure would have allowed banks to diversify, attract more capital and theoretically become more profitable. But opponents maintained that banks had made enough mistakes managing their own affairs and that letting them get into stocks, bonds and insurance policies, hardly profitable businesses anyway nowadays, would risk another expensive taxpayer bailout.
The division did not start out as a partisan one. Republicans and Democrats were on both sides.
In the end, though, Mr. Bush and some Republicans may reap some benefit from the collapse of his legislation. To some degree, it ties the hands of Democrats who might try during next year's campaign to pin on the President the miserable condition of the banking industry. Now, true or not, Mr. Bush can turn the tables and blame the Democratic Congress for the banks' problems.
 
Disinterest of Voters
 From the beginning, the banking legislation faced enormous obstacles. The biggest one, probably, is that voters for the most part do not care much about banking laws, about whether, say, commercial and investment banks are allowed to compete with one another.
But influential lobbies -- the major money-center banks, small-town banks, securities dealers, investment bankers, insurance companies, real estate agents and dozens of others -- care a great deal. Not since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 had there been so much arm-twisting.
So lawmakers, feeling no pressure from ordinary constituents, saw their job as one of refereeing among competing interests. Since so many interests were involved, any single change in the law was likely to antagonize more lobbyists than it pleased.
A second obstacle is the specter of the savings-and-loan mess. In 1982, savings-and-loan associations were allowed to move into new lines of business. Now, in the biggest scandal in public finance in American history, the failure of many of these institutions is costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.
 
Distinctions Get Fuzzy
 The truth of what happened to the savings-and-loan industry is more complicated than that, and banks, as Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady keeps saying, are much more secure than were the savings institutions. But in the public's eye and that of many lawmakers, the distinctions are hard to draw.
For instance, even though every responsible legislator understands that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation must be given more money (otherwise, blameless depositors will not be reimbursed when their banks fail next year), 75 to 100 Representatives are prepared to vote against any bill that provides the funds. That is because they know that their opponent in the next election will take advantage of the public's dismay over the savings-and-loan bailout and blast a vote for more money for bank insurance.
The final big obstacle that blocked a thorough overhaul of the banking system was the President's failure to throw his full weight behind the measure.
Treasury Secretary Brady pushed hard for the bill. His Under Secretary, Robert R. Glauber, one of the country's foremost authorities on finance, worked night and day and even relinquished his position as a tenured professor at Harvard Business School to press the fight.
 
Bush at Arms Length
 But Mr. Bush kept at arm's length, making few if any calls to round up votes and certainly not wasting any political capital on the matter. That is in sharp contrast to the way President Reagan took the unusual step of going to Capitol Hill himself to lobby for his tax bill in 1985. And it is a far cry from the way the President fought this year for authority to go to war against Iraq, to block the civil rights bill and to win confirmation of the nominations of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court and Robert M. Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence.
Chances are, a bill will be enacted this fall containing the $70 billion for the bank insurance fund and requiring Federal authorities to intervene sooner when a bank failure looks likely. Whether that measure permits interstate banking is largely a matter of legislative tactics.
Before killing the overall bank bill Monday night, the House voted 366 to 4 in favor of a section allowing interstate banking. The bill approved by the Senate Banking Committee has a similar provision. Many experts like Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, argue this is the most important way of strengthening the banking system because it would make banks less vulnerable to regional economic distress.

HEADLINE: Daily News to Continue, Its New Publisher Says

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
One of the sons of Robert Maxwell pledged yesterday that his family was "completely committed" to the continued operation of The Daily News, despite continuing doubts within the industry about the newspaper's future.
"My father was tremendously excited by The News and its prospects," said the son, Kevin Maxwell, who was named publisher yesterday. "We are completely committed to continuing the marvelous comeback of the newspaper by providing the support it needs to prosper in the years ahead." 
 But newspaper executives and industry analysts said yesterday that the long-term prospects for The Daily News, a paper Mr. Maxwell rescued from almost certain death earlier this year, were greatly worsened by his drowning yesterday.
"The Maxwell commitment to The Daily News was more personal than corporate, more an ego trip than an investment," said John Morton, a newspaper analyst for Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington. "It may be his sons were infected with his enthusiasm and will carry on, but I think the likelihood of finding another Maxwell is very slender."
 
Still Unprofitable
 Despite recent growth, the paper is unprofitable and continues to suffer from a combination of recession, a strike earlier this year, and longstanding competition with two other tabloid newspapers: The New York Post and New York Newsday.
What happens to The News will have a huge impact on the city's continuing newspaper war.
The News's recent recovery suggested that the city's three tabloids would continue to slug it out for dominance for a long time to come.
But should The News leave the field, the principal beneficiary would probably be New York Newsday, which has a Sunday paper and showed significant gains during The News strike.
The New York Times has welcomed the revival of The News as a buffer that prevented New York Newsday from making a head-on assault on The Times, which would be very likely should The News cease publication.
 
Strong Circulation Recovery
 Mr. Maxwell acquired the paper six months ago after a disastrous strike that cost most of its circulation and advertising, and, through a combination of nonstop promotion and reader loyalty, had recovered more than half of The News's lost circulation and much of its advertising.
Mr. Maxwell's passionate interest in the paper was considered to be its greatest asset, and the removal of that interest has created a void of monumental proportions.
"With him, it seemed to be a crusade," said Douglas LaChance, president of the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union of New York and Vicinity, which represents the paper's drivers.
While Mr. Maxwell was known for taking a strong hand in the management of all his enterprises, he went even further at The News by effectively making himself the paper's day-to-day operating head. Ten vice presidents at the paper, with responsibilities ranging from news to circulation, reported to Mr. Maxwell even as he traveled the globe.
When word that Mr. Maxwell was missing began to circulate yesterday, the assumption at The News was that James P. Willse, the editor, was in charge because he was the only senior vice president.
Mr. Maxwell had indicated that there was a limit to his willingness to underwrite the paper's losses. He frequently said that he expected the paper to be profitable by next spring, which would have been the first anniversary of his ownership and that he would close the paper if it did not show signs that a sustained profit was possible.
In a recent interview, Mr. Maxwell said the paper had seen its first profitable week of operation under him just before Columbus Day, with advertising revenues exceeding $3 million. John Campi, a spokesman for The News, said that since then there had been two more weeks with similar revenues, and that Mr. Maxwell had been optimistic that his profitability standard would be met.
But some newspaper executives remained skeptical that The News could become profitable on a sustained basis, because expenses remained quite high and because of the overall advertising recession, which has hit New York particularly hard.
"In today's environment, I doubt it," said W. Dean Singleton, chief executive officer of Media News Group Inc., a newspaper group based in Houston, assessing The News's prospects of becoming profitable.
Indeed, an executive at a rival paper who spoke on condition of anonymity said that an analysis by that paper's executives concluded that The News was losing more than $1 million each week. Mr. Campi, however, said such a weekly loss figure was greatly exaggerated but would not give specifics.
Should Mr. Maxwell's heirs decide to try selling The News, they would probably face formidable difficulties.
Mr. Singleton, who is familiar with The News's operation from earlier efforts to sell it to him, said he was "frankly impressed" by the paper's success in rebuilding its circulation. Even so, he said he would not consider buying the paper because, like virtually all other newspaper organizations, his own is concentrating on weathering the recession.
Mr. Singleton said that he would be surprised if any newspaper company would be willing to acquire The News.
Peter S. Kalikow, a real estate developer now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, acquired The New York Post in 1988 from Rupert Murdoch when the paper seemed about to close.
Mr. Murdoch would ordinarily be considered a prospective buyer of last resort for The News, but he could not acquire it because he signed an agreement not to compete with Mr. Kalikow through 1994.
In one sense, the poor market for newspapers could encourage the Maxwell heirs to continue operating The News in hopes that an economic recovery would make the paper profitable and also encourage a prospective buyer. And news executives said it was conceivable that Mr. Maxwell's heirs would manage his empire in a more orderly and efficient manner.

HEADLINE: THE 1991 ELECTION;
Mississippi's Governor Beaten by a Newcomer

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
An apparent casualty of voters' antipathy toward incumbents, Gov. Ray Mabus of Mississippi lost yesterday to a political newcomer, Kirk Fordice, a conservative Republican who stressed his opposition to racial quotas. Mr. Fordice will be the state's first Republican governor since Reconstruction.
Mr. Mabus, a Democrat, was attempting to become the state's first governor to win back-to-back terms. The state dropped a prohibition against successive terms four years ago. 
 In a bitterly fought campaign, Mr. Fordice, a 57-year-old construction company president from Vicksburg, called the incumbent a liberal in the Kennedy tradition and charged that he had bloated the state's payroll while neglecting its economy. It was Mr. Fordice's first bid for public office.
At the last minute, Shawn O'Hara, an independent, threw his support to Mr. Fordice, but Mr. O'Hara's name remained on the ballot.
With 99 percent of the state's precincts reporting, the vote was:
 
Fordice . . . 356,250 (51%)
Mabus . . . 330,347 (47%)
O'Hara . . . 11,674 (2%)
In Kentucky, where governors cannot succeed themselves, Lieut. Gov. Brereton C. Jones, a Democrat, was easily elected governor over a seven-term Republican Congressman, Larry J. Hopkins.
 
Hurt by Bad Checks
 Mr. Hopkins received campaign help from President Bush but was hurt when it was recently revealed that he was among the lawmakers who wrote bad checks on the House of Representatives bank.
Mr. Jones's victory extended the Democrats' 24-year hold on the governor's office. He will succeed Gov. Wallace G. Wilkinson.
With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, the vote was:
 
Jones . . . 2,471 (65%)
Hopkins . . . 288,471 (35%)
Voters in the District of Columbia approved a measure aimed at holding the makers and sellers of some assault weapons liable for the injuries and damage those weapons cause.
Unofficial returns from all precincts in the capital showed 77 percent in favor of the measure and 23 percent opposed. The measure was believed to be the first of its kind in the country to receive voter approval.
As of Monday, 409 homicides had been reported in the nation's capital this year. A record 483 homicides occurred in 1990.
A similar measure was passed by the District of Columbia Council in December. But Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon, who took office in January, persuaded the Council to repeal it after some Congressmen hinted that the measure could block a $100 million aid package for the city.
 
Whitmire Loses in Houston
 In Texas, voters endorsed a constitutional amendment to lift a 146-year-old ban on lotteries. Voters in that state also backed a $1.1 billion prison bond and up to $300 million in bonds to finance college loans, both by 2-to-1 margins.
Control of City Hall was at stake in 10 big cities from Boston to San Francisco.
In Houston, Kathryn J. Whitmire's record 10-year reign as mayor ended when a developer, Bob Lanier, and State Representative Sylvester Turner finished first and second in a three-way race. The two top vote-getters will face each other in a runoff Dec. 3.
With 79 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Lanier had 43 percent of the votes. Mr. Turner, who is trying to become Houston's first black mayor, had 36 percent. Mrs. Whitmire had 21 percent.
Mrs. Whitmire, 45, had been elected to five consecutive two-year terms beginning in 1982, but she came under fire this year because of rising crime and her support of an unpopular $1 billion monorail project.
In Dallas, Steve Bartlett, a Republican who resigned from Congress to run for mayor, topped 58 other candidates in the nonpartisan race to succeed Mayor Annette Strauss. With all votes counted, Mr. Bartlett won 54 percent, while his closest challenger, Kathryn Cain, a lawyer, took 27 percent.
In Boston, Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, 52,entered the race a strong contender for a third term after taking 67 percent of the votes in the three-way preliminary race. Edwin Doherty, 47, ran a half-hearted campaign against Mayor Flynn, who is president of the United States Conference of Mayors.
In Philadelphia, Edward Rendell, a Democrat and former District Attorney, was voted the city's 127th Mayor. This spring Mr. Rendell, who is white, won the Democratic nomination by defeating three black opponents. He attacked Mr. Goode's mismanagement of City Hall as the main cause of a financial crisis that has taken the nation's fifth-largest city to the brink of bankruptcy.
In Baltimore, Mayor Kurt Schmoke, a Democrat, fended off a challenge from Samuel Culotta, a Republican.
In Indianapolis, Stephen Goldsmith, a Republican and former prosecutor, defeated Louis Mahern, a Democrat. Mr. Goldsmith will succeed the retiring four-term Mayor William Hudnut 3d.
In Salt Lake City, Deedee Corradini was elected the first woman Mayor of Utah's capital, foiling Dave Buhler's attempt to become the first Republican leading City Hall in 16 years.
Republicans and Democrats split the contests for the two open Congressional seats. In Charlottesville, Va., a Republican state lawmaker, George F. Allen, beat Katherine E. (Kay) Slaughter, a Democrat, for the seat being vacated by her cousin, Representative D. French Slaughter Jr., a Republican. Mr. French resigned because of ill health.
In Philadelphia, the former City Councilman Lucien Blackwell, 60, the Democratic Party's endorsed candidate, won the seat vacated by the surprise resignation of Representative William H. Gray 3d.

HEADLINE: THE 1991 ELECTION;
Outsider Campaign Works for Insider

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Harris L. Wofford has the sort of dream resume that makes a hardened liberal swoon: he studied civil disobedience with Gandhi's followers, marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., served under President John F. Kennedy and helped found the Peace Corps.
Yet when he was appointed in May to fill the vacancy created by the death of Senator H. John Heinz 3d, Mr. Wofford was widely considered too inexperienced, too unknown and too liberal to have a realistic chance of re-election in a state that had not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1962. 
The 65-year-old Mr. Wofford, who despite a background in politics had never held elective office, turned his inexperience to his advantage. A consumate political insider, he ran an outsider's campaign, and handed a stunning defeat to Dick Thornburgh, President Bush's former Attorney General who had been a popular two-term Governor.
 
A Scarsdale Youth
 Born in New York City in 1926, Mr. Wofford spent his early childhood in Johnson City, Tenn., and spent his teen-age years in Scarsdale, N.Y.
After graduating from the University of Chicago and studying Gandhi's work in India, he became one of the first white students at Howard University School of Law -- an experience that sparked his interest in civil rights. He earned a second law degree at Yale University and later taught at Howard and the University of Notre Dame before joining President Kennedy's staff as a special assistant for civil rights.
He helped R. Sargent Shriver start the Peace Corps and served as its associate director until 1966, when he became president of the State University of New York College at Old Westbury, L.I. In 1970 he became the first male president of Bryn Mawr College since its inception in 1861.
After leaving Bryn Mawr in 1978, he quietly practiced law in Philadelphia, slipping into an obscurity that was never too far removed from the Democratic Party. He was appointed state party chairman in 1986, and a year later Gov. Robert P. Casey made him his Secretary of Labor and Industry.
When Governor Casey named him interim Senator, after two other candidates turned down the offer, Republicans reacted with glee and political analysts predicted he had little chance to win.
"People will say, 'Harris who?' " said Michael L. Young, an associate professor of politics at the Pennsylvania State University branch at Harrisburg.
An incumbent for only six months, Senator Wofford had to stage a remarkable comeback against the high-profile Mr. Thornburgh -- and he did, closing a 40-point gap in the polls.
Assailing what he saw as the ingrained corruption and ineffectiveness of Washington, he ran an aggressive populist campaign. He repeatedly hammered Mr. Thornburgh on issues like health care and the economy. On Oct. 11, just as Mr. Wofford's comeback was peaking, President Bush handed him another club, vetoing a bill to extend unemployment benefits, which would have aided some 170,000 of Pennsylvania's 400,000 unemployed workers.
Mr. Wofford's campaign, and his stunning comeback, suddenly turned the despair of Democratic political analysts to hope, offering the party campaign themes it will no doubt turn to in 1992.

HEADLINE: Amid Criticism, Bush Drops Plans for 2-Week Asia Trip

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
President Bush tonight canceled plans for a two-week tour of the Far East as he faced mounting economic pressure to speed the end of the recession and political pressure to demonstrate his concern about domestic issues.
Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, issued a written statement that expressed the President's regrets and cited "uncertainty over the Congressional calendar" as the official reason for the cancellation. The trip was to have started on Thanksgiving or the day before and ended on Dec. 7 in Honolulu for the 50th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Mr. Fitzwater said the President had not decided whether to attend the commemoration and held open the possibility that another Far East trip could be scheduled soon. 
 But most members of Congress have long been expecting to adjourn by Thanksgiving in any case, and the President's move seemed motivated as much by the sudden shift in political focus from his achievements overseas to his problems at home.
The decision to cancel the trip came today, as Dick Thornburgh, a former Attorney General, met defeat in the Senate race in Pennsylvania. White House officials were reluctant to discuss the politics of the decision, but it seemed clearly linked to the slippage in Republican campaign prospects.
 
More Overt Political Role
 Mr. Bush has acknowledged that the recession is not ending as fast as he had hoped and that economics -- not the new world order -- is going to define the political debate for his re-election bid in 1992.
He seems increasingly at a loss over how to respond to Democratic assertions that he is not paying enough attention to domestic problems, and his advisers have been giving him conflicting advice about what economic and political steps he should take. The debate has forced Mr. Bush, who has yet to formally announce his candidacy, to take on a more overt campaign role earlier than he had planned.
Reflecting these political currents, the decision to cancel the trip, announced after NBC News reported earlier this evening that such a move was under consideration, was coupled with an announcement that Mr. Bush was summoning reporters to the White House at dawn Wednesday to hear him read a statement on today's elections and other domestic questions.
Mr. Bush seems to have seized on the technique of the hastily called news conference to give him a platform from which to respond to the Democrats. He did just that 10 days ago, before he went to Madrid to meet with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and attend the opening of the Middle East peace conference.
Immediately afterward, Mr. Bush planned to leave for Rome for a two-day conference of the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Just a year ago, such a trip would have given Mr. Bush a welcome platform for his diplomatic prowess. But NATO's mission to defend against a Soviet threat has been virtually eliminated.
With public opinion polls showing that many Americans say Mr. Bush should travel less abroad, Democrats in Congress seized on the trip to Rome as a way of keeping pressure on the President as the struggle between the Republican White House and the Democratic Congress increasingly took on the tones of a political campaign.
 
Democratic T-Shirts
 The Democratic National Committee distributed T-shirts lampooning Mr. Bush's globe-trotting Presidency, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee issued a news release with 11 cities in the United States named Rome and the unemployment rate for each.
Asked about Democratic criticism at a White House news conference today, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Mr. Bush's former campaign manager, replied testily: "It would only be valid if there were a failure on his part to address domestic concerns. I don't think there has been a failure. In the absence of that, I think it's quite inappropriate."
One official said of the delay: "There was this whole spate of stories about domestic issues and the concern that the way Congress is behaving, they might try to take advantage. Better to have the President here so he can continue to hold their feet to the fire."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Decision Dismays Japan
 TOKYO, Wednesday, Nov. 6 -- Japanese leaders reacted with surprise and dismay this morning over President Bush's sudden cancellation of his trip, and Foreign Ministry officials sought to assure Japanese journalists that the decision did not represent a snub.
Less than 24 hours after taking office, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa was seen as having to deal with an extremely embarrassing setback, especially since Mr. Bush also canceled a visit here at the last moment in February, because of the war against Iraq.

HEADLINE: For Bush, NATO Talks May Test His Strategy

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
For President Bush, the meeting in Rome of the Atlantic alliance this week will be yet another exercise in trying to hold together an institution shaken by the very new world order that he has been so eager to help create.
As was the case with Mr. Bush's meeting in Madrid last week with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the summit meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on Thursday and Friday promises to be more symbol than substance. Administration officials said they do not view the meeting as a forum for major policy advances, apart from an already agreed-upon effort to bring the former Warsaw Pact countries into a liaison role with NATO. 
 Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d announced here today that the East European countries, the Baltic states and the Soviet Union would be invited to send representatives to a NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels on Dec. 20.
But American officials are keenly aware that relations within NATO are so unsettled that basic questions, like the future security structure of Europe, are best papered over for now. Officials here have set their goals at a minimum: a reaffirmation of NATO's role as the central military institution in Europe.
 
The Stakes Are Higher
 But, where it was Mr. Gorbachev who stood to gain the most from the Madrid meeting, the stakes in Rome are higher for Mr. Bush, who senior officials said views NATO as America's only hope to retain its political influence in Europe as the Continent grows increasingly integrated.
"We think it's still very important to maintain our commitment to the security of Europe" through NATO, Mr. Baker said today, adding, "It is very important that it continue and it will continue."
American officials have deliberately combined the NATO trip with a visit to The Hague for meetings with officials of the European Community, a symbolic gesture that they hope will underscore the overlap in membership of the two organizations. Of the 12 members of the community, only Ireland is not a NATO member.
"The only institutional link we have to Europe is NATO as an organization," an American official said. "In NATO, we play a leading role and can exploit the overlap, we hope, with the E.C. membership to keep an institutional link in their economic zone."
In Rome, since much of what the NATO summit will produce has already been worked out, American officials are concentrating harder on the sideshow of individual meetings with European leaders than on the main event.
"The summit will be more like a political convention, where they come together in a big room with a common platform, but the real action takes place on the outskirts, where they dicker and the problems are aired," an official said. "This is the first NATO summit where the importance will be in the bilaterals."
American officials said Mr. Bush hoped to head off a call by President Francois Mitterrand of France for a four-power meeting on nuclear disarmament, a process that Mr. Bush prefers to keep within his own control, as he did with his most recent initiative, or in the context of Soviet-American relations.
The President also will seek assurances from Mr. Mitterrand and from Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany that a recent Franco-German statement on joint defense policies is not intended to replace NATO as Europe's primary security apparatus.
With Mr. Kohl, Administration officials said the President would press for concessions in the current round of international talks aimed at lifting barriers to free trade. Officials here said Mr. Kohl had promised the United States he would press for progress on lifting protections for European farmers after his last round of elections but has since been dragging his feet.
 
Meeting in the Hague
 Mr. Baker said those trade talks will be at the top of Mr. Bush's agenda in the Hague when he meets on Friday with Jaques Delors, the European Community's chief executive, and Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers of the Netherlands, which holds its rotating presidency.
Stitched throughout all these talks will be the Soviet Union, which has been a central subject for every NATO summit meeting but will be discussed by the alliance's leaders this week in an entirely different context than before.
The last time the NATO allies met at this level was in London in July 1990, and the goal was to make progress in reducing conventional armed forces in Europe and on the strategic arms reduction treaty.
"But that was before the Soviet Union fell apart," an Administration official said. "The Rome meetings will be the first opportunity for the President to brief the allies in person on his meeting in Madrid last week. What are we going to do about the fact that Gorbachev seems increasingly irrelevant?"
 
Principles for Soviets
 Mr. Baker said today that the President would urge his allies to adopt a specific set of principles for judging democratic reform in the Soviet Union, including respect for international conventions on human rights and strict control of Soviet nuclear weapons.
In an oblique criticism of the Ukraine's effort to use the presence of nuclear weapons on its territory as a bargaining chip with Moscow, Mr. Baker said, "Soviet nuclear weapons should not become the object of political bargaining of any kind."
As Mr. Baker did today during his news conference, American officials said Mr. Bush would use the uncertain political future of NATO's former adversary to bolster his argument to keep the Atlantic alliance intact, to protect its members against unexpected threats, like the Persian Gulf war earlier this year, and to provide a source of stability for Eastern Europe.
"The President will make a pitch that we have to be careful with this euphoria," one official said, adding: "After World War II, everybody disarmed and went home, then we had to come back and create NATO. So the argument now is to keep it strong. Its role has changed and the President will say, 'I'm the first to recognize that, but let's be realistic about the world around us at this stage.' "

HEADLINE: Cultural Links With Chinese Are Eroding

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Throughout the 1980's, Chinese-American relations flourished across the cultural bridges built by scholars, artists and business executives who established exchange programs and advisory councils to help bring the two nations closer.
Now, these bridges are slowly deteriorating, not so much because China is closing its doors, but rather because American bitterness over human rights abuses in China has dried up interest. Many of these programs are fighting for survival, and their struggle underscores the difficulties that the Chinese-American relationship is likely to face in the future. 
 "It's all part of the tremendous mood swings people suffered, going from the exaggerated rosy picture of China that Americans have from time to time to the exaggerated, depressed picture that they have from time to time, and now we're in the bottom of the swing," said Jerome A. Cohen, a specialist in Chinese law at New York University. "The whole picture is a very serious and sad picture."
 
Students and Tourists Still Come
 To be sure, many American students still come to China on exchange programs and American tourists still flood the Forbidden City. And the trip later this month by Secretary of State James A. Baker, the first by such a high-level official since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, is expected to have some impact on relations with China. But several prominent links between the two countries are now in trouble because of disgruntlement at the political repression in China -- even though those associated with the programs insist that they help foster a more democratic culture there.
These people worry that if the trend develops, it could create a gap in understanding that may make bilateral problems more difficult to resolve.
"The great impetus for Americans to give is a missionary impetus -- wanting China to change -- and there's a frustration that China hasn't changed the way we wanted it to," said Anthony J. Kane, co-director of the Center for Chinese and American Studies, a program sponsored by Johns Hopkins University and Nanjing University. "It's going to end up hurting Sino-American relations in a number of ways. Obviously, it closes a window."
The six-year-old center, in the eastern city of Nanjing, is one of those that is struggling. It has enough money to make it through this year, but may not be able to operate next academic year. The program, which has 31 American students and 46 Chinese students this year, exposes the Chinese to American teaching methods and materials.
 
Students Turned Away
 A second major exchange, a business school program for Chinese students at the Dalian University of Technology in the northeastern city of Dalian, did not take students this academic year because it did not have enough money. The United States Department of Commerce, which had sponsored the program by contributing $400,000, used the money elsewhere. Organizers are trying to arrange private financing to keep the program alive.
The United States-China Business Council, which represents the interests of American businesses in China, has lost about one-fourth of its membership in the last two years. The Council's president, Donald M. Anderson, says that raising money has been difficult for a variety of reasons, including the poor economy in the United States.
Most of the money from foundations is going elsewhere -- often to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Only a few of the large foundations, like the Ford Foundation, which has an office in Beijing, continue to finance projects in China on a steady basis.
To raise money, programs sometimes need to be packaged as part of an Asiawide effort so that China is not singled out. Some centers are scaling down their programs, while others are rethinking their strategies.
 
Arts Exchange Is Silent
 For example, the Center for U.S.-China Arts Exchange, which brought Arthur Miller's play "Death of a Salesman" to China in the early 1980's, currently has no programs. For the last two years, it has been revising its focus and approach. Now, it hopes to translate and distribute works about prominent Western composers. Chou Wen-chung, the center's director, also said that it plans to focus exchanges but on smaller cities and counties.
Organizers say that for the near future, they do not foresee changes in the American perception of China, which many believe is unduly negative. They are confident a change in attitude will come about, but none could say when they expected that to happen.
"It is important for Americans to actually go over and see what is happening," Jan C. Berris, vice president of the National Committee on United States-China Relations, one of the organizations not in difficulty. "Until the number of Americans who have the opportunity to go increases, I am concerned that these impressions that are now prevalent in the country are going to remain."

HEADLINE: Dozens of Peruvians Killed In Wave of Political Violence

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Dozens of Peruvians have been killed in new political violence around the country.
Five suspected leftist guerrillas fired rocket-propelled grenades at Peru's presidential palace this morning, wounding two police officers and a merchant when the devices exploded in the vicinity of the palace, the police said. 
 Initial reports said the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement was responsible for the attacks and for explosions on Monday night at several banks, the state-owned water company and an Ecuadorean airline office, the last apparently connected with a border dispute with Ecuador.
The attacks came as Lima residents were still in shock from a massacre in a poor neighborhood in the city center on Sunday night, in which 16 people were killed and 4 wounded at a chicken barbecue.
 
Investigation Promised
 Attorney General Pedro Mendez called the crime, the deadliest attack in the capital in a decade of guerrilla violence that has taken thousands of lives, "inconceivable to the human conscience," and he promised an exhaustive investigation.
The killings came three days after a human rights team from the Organization of American States expressed concern over the impunity with which Peru's security forces deal with guerrillas.
Informers close to Mr. Mendez's office said that statements by witnesses to the killings on Sunday pointed to a paramilitary group because the people who organized the barbecue were suspected of having links to the Shining Path guerrillas, a Maoist group that advocates the overthrow of the government and creation of an agrarian Marxist new order.
In Ayacucho, 240 miles southeast of Lima, the police said that about 100 Shining Path militants raided the remote Andean village of Santo Tomas de Pata late Sunday, killing 37 members of peasant self-defense militias.
Shining Path has stepped up attacks in recent weeks on the militias, calling them traitors for collaborating with the army in its counterinsurgency war in the countryside.
The new violence has led to renewed calls for a change in the Cabinet of President Alberto Fujimori a week after Prime Minister Carlos Torres y Torres Lara surprised the nation by saying he would resign in mid-November.
 
Inquiry by Peru's Senate
 Mr. Fujimori has been meeting with Cabinet ministers for six days, looking at Cabinet changes and putting final touches on decrees before special powers to legislate in areas of investment and pacification run out.
Late Monday, Peru's Senate summoned the Defense Minister, Jorge Torres Aciego, and the Interior Minister, Gen. Victor Malca Villanueva, to render their account of the killings in the heart of the capital.
Sen. Raul Ferrerro Acosta, speaking on television today, called for their resignations and urged Mr. Fujimori to forge a strategy to defeat the guerrillas.
"The Government must make the war its highest priority, not its third or fourth," Mr. Ferrerro Acosta said. "This is not just a military problem but a political and economic problem."
He was referring to Mr. Fujimori's heavy emphasis on seeking foreign investment for Peru's stalled economy.

HEADLINE: Bridgeport Mayor Falls, but No Wide Anti-Incumbent Trend Is Seen

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Mayor Mary C. Moran of Bridgeport, whose decision to file for municipal bankruptcy earlier this year made Connecticut's largest city a symbol of the nation's urban struggles, was defeated in her bid for re-election tonight after one fiery term. She conceded about an hour after the polls closed to Joseph P. Ganim, a 32-year-old Democrat who has never served in public office.
"This is not our loss -- it's Bridgeport's loss," she told supporters. "They said that filing for bankruptcy was against the odds, but I knew it was the right thing to do." 
 Across the state, as Connecticut residents went to the polls in 158 towns and cities to vote on offices from zoning boards to school boards, results were equally quick and decisive, but the message was mixed. The supposedly angry electorate, concerned about the recession and incensed about the state's new income tax, took out its frustration on many incumbents but not on others.
In Waterbury, voters dismissed the three-term Republican incumbent, Mayor Joseph J. Santopietro, who was indicted earlier this year on Federal corruption charges but chose to run for re-election anyway. He came in last in a three-way race, trailing even an independent candidate who had never before run for public office, losing to Edward D. Bergin, a Democrat who was Waterbury's mayor from 1976 until 1985. Mr. Bergin was under a cloud as well -- he cleared his name of bribery charges only this spring.
But in New Haven, the Democratic Mayor, John C. Daniels, that city's first black chief executive, successfully fought off a challenge from a Republican Alderman, Jonathan J. Einhorn, and won another two years in office. And in Stamford, a Republican candidate, Stanley J. Esposito, who had been endorsed by the current Mayor, Thom Serrani, a Democrat, won handily over the Democrat, Sandra Goldstein.
In Hartford, the state's second-largest city, Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry, a Democrat, was unopposed.
Democrats, who accounted for the majority of legislators' votes for the income tax, generally fared well, picking up town hall control in 22 communities, including Bridgeport, previously controlled by Republicans and losing 10, for a net gain of 12. Republicans who opposed the income tax also lost in West Haven and East Haven.
Ms. Moran, a Republican who battled her way to the top office in a city long dominated by Democrats, lost by about 4,000 votes out of about 20,000 votes cast, according to the unofficial count. Mr. Ganim will become the second-youngest mayor ever in Bridgeport, and Ms. Moran becomes the only mayor since Fred Atwater in 1923 to be denied a second term in office. Mr. Ganim melded a law-and order appeal with a repeated message that Ms. Moran's combativeness had only made Bridgeport's problems worse.
 
Prosecutors Blamed
 In Waterbury, Mr. Santopietro, the mayor since 1985, received only 6,635 votes with all 32 precincts reporting, compared with 14,075 votes for Mr. Bergin, a Democrat, and 11,786 votes for Josephine Mills, an independent candidate making her first bid for public office.
"The Federal prosecutors have won their first election," Mr. Santopietro told about 200 of his supporters gathered at the Pontelandolfo Community Club. Mr. Santopietro has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him.
The state Democratic Party chairman, John F. Droney Jr., said the party's gains in many areas across the state were in part a result of the "failure of the Republican strategy to superimpose the income tax on local candidates" but also of what Mr. Droney said was the party's tradition of being the one people turn to in bad times.
"When times are tough, just as it was with Roosevelt, people go with the Democrats," he said.
Mr. Droney's counterpart, the state Republican Party chairman, Richard Foley Jr., conceded that some of the losses hurt, but that Democrats had also suffered, losing control of several mid-sized communities including Middletown, Norwalk, and Litchfield, in addition to Stamford, the state's fifth-largest city.
 
Clear and Ambivalent
 But other numbers were indisputable. The Democrats now control town halls in the four largest cities, and some small communities that have traditionally been Republican strongholds, like Eastford, a small town in the northeast corner of the state that was thought never to have ceded control of the local government to Democrats until tonight.
But any grandiose claims were tempered by the hesitation that many voters also expressed. In New Haven, in particular, where Mr. Daniels won by more than 7,000 votes in 1989, his margin of victory was cut nearly in half. With 29 of the 30 precincts reporting, Mr. Daniels had 15,827 votes to 11,655 votes for Mr. Einhorn, the Republican. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by about 9-to-1 in New Haven.
"This is no mandate for John Daniels," Mr. Einhorn said in a speech to his supporters. "It's not even a slap on the back -- he's lost a substantial part of his own constituency."
In Stamford, where the city's once sterling image as a gleaming center of white-collar corporate power has been pulled down by the recession and a large glut in commercial office space, Mr. Esposito said in his victory speech that the vote for a Republican mayor was a vote for "open and fiscally responsible government."

HEADLINE: FIRST-CLASS MAIL STAYS AT 29 CENTS

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
The United States Postal Service refused today to raise the price of mailing a first-class letter by a penny, with opponents of an increase contending that the timing was poor because of the shaky economy.
Six of the service's nine governors favored the increase, to 30 cents, but the motion was defeated because a unanimous vote was required. The increase was intended to insure sufficient funds until 1995. 
 Norma Pace, the board chairman, who supported the increase, said it was opposed by three governors who thought an increase unwise in "a period of economic stagnation."
Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board, said the increase would have been "a severe setback to the already fragile U.S. economy."
 
Disappointment Expressed
 Postmaster General Anthony Frank said, "If we could have had a 30-cent first-class stamp, we would have needed only one more rate change this decade." He predicted increases in 1994 and 1997 or 1998.
Mr. Frank predicted a surplus for fiscal 1992 of about $600 million, but he predicted that "as our costs go up and our prices stay steady, why we'll start to lose money."
The Postal Service governors oversee the operation of the Postal Service. The Postmaster General, himself a governor, reports to the Board of Governors, which proposes changes in postal rates to the independent Postal Rate Commission.
The commission studies the proposals, invites comments and then makes its recommendation to the governors, who can either accept or reject the recommendations. Once a recommendation is accepted, however, the governors can only change the rate by a unanimous vote.
The service estimates a $1.5 billion deficit in fiscal 1991, which ended Sept. 30, after an $874 million deficit in 1990.
The Postal Service asked for a 5-cent increase, to a 30-cent first-class rate in March 1990. Ten months later, the Postal Rate Commission recommended a 4-cent increase, to 29 cents. The increase took effect last February.

HEADLINE: Two Years of Trouble;
With Legislature Going Republican, Florio Faces Confrontations Into '93

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Irate about taxes, New Jersey voters set the stage today for what promises to be two years of confrontational politics between Gov. Jim Florio and a new a Republican legislative majority.
The voters, who turned out in numbers far larger than expected, wrested control of the Senate and the Assembly from Mr. Florio's Democratic Party and for the first time in 20 years made the Republicans dominant in both houses. 
 The anger was over Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion tax package and the speed with which a Democratic Legislature had pushed it through. Last year that public displeasure almost cost Bill Bradley his seat in the United States Senate. Today voters clearly showed that their anger has not abated. And the off-year election that proved as much was certainly being watched in Connecticut, where a new income tax is meeting with strong opposition, and in states around the country, where voters are clamoring to tell officials how angry they are.
 
A Republican View
 Many Republicans believe that Mr. Florio's sudden entry into the campaign in the last two weeks, when he said Democratic candidates should "get off their knees" and start defending the tax program, was calculated to shield himself from blame if Democrats did poorly.
"He was innoculating himself against disaster," said Assemblyman Robert D. Franks of New Providence, the State Republican Chairman. "Now he can stand up after the election and say that what happened was not a rejection of his policies, because nobody defended them, and he'll promise to make his case to the voters over the next two years."
Mr. Franks added, "Some would argue that the election was an absolute rejection of the Governor's entire program and that it was time to go back to the drawing board." But he said he does not expect Republicans to reject all of Mr. Florio's programs out of hand.
In the days before the election Mr. Florio had said he would work with the new legislative leadership, regardless of which party prevailed. But Republicans are skeptical. Jeff Michaels, the executive director of the Republican State Committee, said that if Mr. Florio was sincere about reducing public anger over his tax policies, "he could have turned it around after the last election by admitting he made a mistake."
It is more than Mr. Florio's tax and school aid programs that are likely to come up for revision, and it could be more than Republicans who try to do the revising. The National Rifle Association put about $200,000 into the campaigns of candidates likely to support their drive to weaken Mr. Florio's ban on automatic weapons. Mr. Florio has vetoed one attempt to weaken the law without inspiring a serious effort to override his decision. He may have a tougher time when the issue comes up again.
In addition to the Republicans, the Democrats who won today will also be on the ballot in 1993, and they will have to assess their re-election chances in 1993. Some political consultants say Mr. Florio may have as much trouble retaining his party's support as he will dealing with a Republican majority.
Jay Severin, the chairman of Severin/Aviles, a New York-based campaign consulting company that works for Republican clients, including the New Jersey party organization, said voters in New Jersey had "a clear target" in Mr. Florio.
"People don't turn out in large numbers to defend anybody," Mr. Severin said. "They turn out to spit in somebody's eye."
The voters had personalized their anger and focused it on Mr. Florio early on. "Impeach Florio" bumper stickers could be seen everywhere and grass-roots antitax groups bloomed overnight.
The Governor's lack of popularity was a problem for Democratic campaign strategists, and it prompted many Democratic candidates to run without mentioning their party and to try to distance themselves from their support for the Governor's program.
Mr. Florio's problems at midterm contrasted with the experience of his predecessor, Thomas H. Kean, in 1981. Mr. Kean, a Republican, also promised not to raise taxes during his campaign and then signed increases in both the sales and income taxes to meet a budget deficit caused by a recession. Two years later Mr. Kean had become one of the most popular governors in state history.
Mr. Kean was helped by an economic turnaround, something that has not shown up to help Mr. Florio. But there have been other differences between the two. Stephen A. Salmore, a professor of political science at Rutgers and a Republican consultant, recalled that Mr. Kean initially supported a 5-cent increase in the gasoline tax, and that when the measure cleared only one house of the Democratic-controlled Legislature, Mr. Kean told the lawmakers to come up with their own solution. When Mr. Kean signed the sales and income-tax increase, he criticized the tax bills and "held his nose" as he signed them, Mr. Salmore said.
By contrast, Mr. Florio and Democratic leaders rejoiced after enacting the tax package, and this is what turned the public against him, Mr. Salmore said.
"People didn't go against Florio because he lied or raised taxes; people expect politicians to lie, and they accept tax increases if they're prepared for them," Mr. Salmore said. "What Florio did was raise taxes and smile, and it was the smile that got him."
