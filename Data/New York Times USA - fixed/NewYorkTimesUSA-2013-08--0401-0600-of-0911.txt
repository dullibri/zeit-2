HEADLINE: To Judge Sleep Aids, U.S. Looks at Drowsy Driving in the Morning

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
The first test for a new sleep drug is -- unsurprisingly -- how safely it puts people to sleep. Now comes a second test: how safely it lets people wake up.
The Food and Drug Administration is taking heightened interest in the issue, as new evidence suggests what many people have long suspected: the effects of common prescription sleep aids like Ambien can persist well into the next day. Of particular concern is whether people who take the drugs before bed can drive safely the next morning.
Consumer advocates have warned for years about possible links between sleep drugs and car accidents. In one prominent example, Kerry Kennedy, the former wife of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, was arrested last year after tests showed she had taken a sleep aid before swerving her car into a tractor-trailer.
The F.D.A.'s actions are part of a robust national conversation about how to cope with the throngs of drivers who take to roads every day under the influence of prescription drugs. Law enforcement authorities have struggled with how to prosecute those who are impaired, especially when they have a prescription. A government survey in 2007 found that nearly 5 percent of daytime drivers tested positive for prescription or over-the-counter medications. 
Doctors wrote close to 60 million prescriptions for sleep aids in the United States last year, according to the research firm IMS Health, but experts say testing how these drugs affect driving is not easy. Nonetheless, the F.D.A. has been unusually active.
Last month, it rejected an application by Merck to approve a new sleep drug, suvorexant, in part because tests showed that some people had trouble driving the next day. In May, the agency warned patients taking common allergy drugs like Benadryl against driving, noting that the sedating effects can sometimes last into the following day. In January, citing similar concerns, the F.D.A. took the unusual step of requiring that all manufacturers of zolpidem, the generic name of Ambien, cut in half the dosage for women.
The agency has since said that it is taking a closer look at all insomnia drugs on the market, and will ask manufacturers to conduct more extensive driving tests for all new sleep drugs. It will also more closely scrutinize any drug that causes drowsiness.
Part of the problem is that the standard warnings on many drugs -- against driving or operating heavy machinery -- are often brushed aside. ''It would be so convenient and it would be so good if you could just tell people, don't drive unless you feel O.K.,'' Dr. Ronald Farkas, the clinical team leader for the F.D.A.'s division of neurology products, told a group of industry experts at a conference in February. ''I think this has penetrated now that this is not adequate. It is still good advice that, if you feel impaired, don't drive. But if you feel fine, you might be impaired.''
For years, traffic safety officials have called, without success, for a so-called ''safe list'' of drugs that do not affect driving. Some people react more strongly to drugs than others do, making it difficult to predict a person's individual risk. And driving tests can vary significantly, like studies conducted on roads or those done in computer simulators.
''It seems like a really simple question, but it's really difficult,'' said Dr. Matthew Rizzo, a professor of neurology at the University of Iowa, who studies driving abilities in people with cognitive impairments caused by conditions like Alzheimer's disease.
Pharmaceutical companies have long conducted driving tests for certain drugs, but the tests were motivated mainly by marketing goals and not seen as pivotal in getting a drug approved by the F.D.A., said Gary G. Kay, whose company, the Cognitive Research Corporation, leases a driving simulator to pharmaceutical companies. Mr. Kay, for example, helped conduct some of the research showing that the allergy drug Claritin did not cause drowsiness, unlike older antihistamines like Benadryl.
Until recently, the F.D.A. evaluated driving tests by looking at the reaction of the average patient. But that thinking has shifted as research has shown that some people react more strongly to drugs than others, Dr. Farkas said in a telephone interview. ''Some people have higher blood levels than others, and some seem to be more sensitive than others,'' he said.
In 2011, the agency recognized this variability when it approved the sleep drug Intermezzo, which treats patients who wake up in the middle of the night, in two doses: one for men and a smaller dose for women. Data had shown that the drug's effects lingered in women for longer than they did in men. The agency's experience with Intermezzo, along with other research, led it to order in January that the dosage for all drugs containing zolpidem -- the active ingredient in Intermezzo, as well as Ambien and related generic sleep drugs -- be halved for women.
In the case of suvorexant, the Merck drug, four women had to stop the driving tests because of extreme drowsiness, and the F.D.A. concluded that the drug was linked to an increase of impaired driving among patients who had taken it. Last month, Merck said that the F.D.A. indicated it would eventually approve the drug if the company lowers the proposed doses.
The attention has not been limited to insomnia drugs. In 2011, the F.D.A. approved the drug Horizant to treat restless leg syndrome after the drug makers, XenoPort and GlaxoSmithKline, conducted driving tests because the drug also causes drowsiness. Horizant carries a warning against driving until patients know how the drug affects them, and notes that the effects could last until the morning after it is taken.
Dr. Eric Bastings, the acting director of the F.D.A.'s neurology drug unit, said the agency was writing guidelines to help pharmaceutical companies understand what is expected of them.
Until then, however, there is a wide range in how pharmaceutical companies measure driving ability. The most well-established test takes place in the Netherlands, where participants drive in specially outfitted cars -- and alongside a driving instructor -- on open roads. It is the only place in the world where such tests are conducted on roadways.
Drug companies still conduct the tests in the Netherlands -- Merck's drug was tested there, as was Intermezzo -- but driving simulators are also growing in popularity. Dr. Kay's company leases the MiniSim, a scaled-down version of a state-of-the-art simulator at the University of Iowa. Users sit in a dummy driver's seat, complete with steering wheel and pedals, while three computer screens stand in for the windshield.
Despite the increased scrutiny for sleep drugs, however, some sought to place the issue in perspective. ''What we have to weigh here is that people who don't sleep well are a hazard on the road because they do fall asleep while driving,'' said Robert Voas, a senior research scientist at the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation and an expert on driving safety. ''There's risks on both sides.''

HEADLINE: July Retail Sales Rose 0.2%, Despite a Drop in Auto Sales

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Retail sales edged up in July despite a drop in auto sales, and a category of purchases that excludes the most volatile areas rose by the most in seven months, a sign that consumer spending could increase economic growth in coming months. 
The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that retail sales increased 0.2 percent in July from June. Sales had risen 0.6 percent in June from May because of a surge in auto sales.
The core figures for retail sales, which exclude the volatile auto, gas and building supply categories, rose 0.5 percent in July. It was the biggest such gain since a similar increase in December.
Retail sales are closely watched because they are the government's first report each month on consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of American economic activity.
A separate report on Tuesday showed that Americans were reducing their credit card debt. The rate of credit card payments at least 90 days overdue fell in the April-to-June quarter to 0.57 percent, according to the credit reporting agency TransUnion. That is the lowest delinquency rate since 1994.
And the Commerce Department said business inventories were unchanged in June while sales rose modestly. That could mean that companies would need to step up their restocking in coming months, which would help bolster economic growth.

HEADLINE: Rising Output in Factories Hints at Growth in Europe

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- European factories ramped up their output of consumer durable goods in June, official data showed Tuesday, and economists said the news signaled an end to the recession that has made the Continent the laggard of the world economy. 
Industrial production in the 17-nation currency zone rose 0.7 percent in June from May, Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, reported from Luxembourg. The agency also revised down the size of the decline in May to 0.2 percent, from 0.3 percent.
On Wednesday, Eurostat is scheduled to release its first estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product, and expectations for good news were supported by the results of a survey that showed growing confidence in Germany.
The ZEW institute, an economic research organization based in Mannheim, said its economic sentiment indicator had risen to 42.0 points, up by 5.7 points from July, and well above its historical average of 23.7.
''The euro zone's recession ended when the snow melted last Easter,'' Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London, wrote in a research note. He said the euro zone economy, having contracted for six straight quarters, ''probably expanded modestly'' in the April-June quarter ''and will gain further momentum in the second half of the year.''
Ben May, an economist in London with Capital Economics, said the data reported Tuesday -- as well as a small rebound in construction -- suggested that the G.D.P. grew 0.2 percent in the second quarter, following a 0.3 percent decline in the first three months of the year.
Mr. Schulz credited the European Central Bank's monetary policy, as well as the fading impact of austerity measures. He projected a 0.3 percent expansion in G.D.P. for the third quarter, followed by 0.4 percent growth in the fourth.
Even with second-half growth, Eurostat has estimated that the euro zone economy will contract slightly over all in 2013 before expanding by 1.2 percent next year.
Still, there is little to celebrate. More than 26 million Europeans cannot find work, and the jobless rate in countries like Greece and Spain is well over 20 percent. Economists do not expect hard-hit countries to bounce back fully for several years.
Growth in Europe is still likely to lag behind that of other developed nations like the United States and Japan, as well as rising giants like China.
June represented the fifth month of the last seven in which industrial production had risen, with the data released Tuesday confirming the findings of a survey last month of European purchasing managers.
Production of consumer durables rose by 4.9 percent in June, while output of capital goods rose by 2.5 percent.
Eurostat did not break down the data by product, but consumer durables generally include things like appliances, furniture and cars.
Industrial output in Germany, the largest euro zone economy, rose a strong 2.5 percent in June from May, but France, the No. 2 economy, posted a 1.5 percent decline.
For the European Union as a whole, Eurostat reported a 0.9 percent increase in June production.
Compared with a year earlier, industrial production grew 0.3 percent in the euro zone, and 0.4 percent in the overall European Union.

HEADLINE: Divining the Regulatory Goals of Fed Rivals

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Lawrence H. Summers, as Treasury secretary, presided over the group of senior Clinton administration officials who reached the fateful decision in the late 1990s that there was no need to regulate a new family of financial transactions known as over-the-counter derivatives. Janet Yellen attended some of those meetings, too, as chairwoman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. But she did not speak.
Mr. Summers and Ms. Yellen are now the leading candidates to head the Federal Reserve, and the winner is likely to spend far more time on financial regulation than previous Fed chairmen. Congress has greatly expanded the Fed's regulatory purview; moreover, the central bank's basic responsibility to try to keep the economy on an even keel, experts say, will require a much greater focus on ensuring the stability of the financial system.
The two candidates share similar views on many regulatory issues, according to a review of their public statements and interviews with friends and colleagues. Both forged academic careers as members of the economics counterculture that attacked the dogma of efficient markets. Both say they believe that markets require regulation to prevent abuses, ensure fair competition and prevent disruptions of economic growth. 
But those meetings 15 years ago highlight a basic difficulty in predicting what kind of regulators they would be. Ms. Yellen, during her two decades in prominent public roles, has left few footprints on the era's debates about the government's role in the markets. Mr. Summers, in helping to shape the regulatory policies of two administrations, has taken positions that critics say amounted to not following his own advice.
For supporters of stronger regulation, it comes down to a choice between someone they do not know and someone they do not trust.
The overhaul of financial regulation that Congress passed in 2010 -- known as the Dodd-Frank law after its two principal authors, Senator Christopher J. Dodd and Representative Barney Frank (both since retired from Congress) -- amounted to an instruction manual for the creation of a new system. The construction process remains substantially incomplete.
The next head of the Fed faces controversial decisions, in particular, about what safeguards to impose on the largest financial institutions to make it credible that if they falter, they will be allowed to fail.
''There's a huge plate of unfinished business where the Fed has lead -- if not sole -- authority and the next chairman could derail a lot of that, or water it down,'' said Sheila Bair, who was chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the financial crisis. ''That's why it's important for the next Fed chairman to have a good focus on regulation.''
President Obama has said that he intends to nominate a successor this fall for the current Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. The White House has said he is also considering a third candidate, Donald L. Kohn, who was Ms. Yellen's predecessor as Fed vice chairman. While past Fed chairmen have been selected almost exclusively for their views on monetary policy, this time the White House is focused on the fact that it is picking a financial regulator, too.
Mr. Summers and Ms. Yellen declined to comment for this article. Both, however, have spoken in recent months about the need for stronger regulation. Ms. Yellen, in a June speech, detailed areas where she believed stronger regulation was required. Mr. Summers, in an April interview, made a similar point, although he did not discuss specific proposals.
''The world is moving in the right direction,'' he told Maclean's, a Canadian newsmagazine. ''Whether it is moving rapidly enough, and aggressively enough, is a judgment we will have to make in the next several years.''
Mr. Summers and Ms. Yellen were academic stars before entering public service. Menzie Chinn, an economist and professor of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin, said that both were ''at the forefront'' of research undermining the idea that markets were self-correcting. By contrast, the former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan frequently argued that government regulation did more harm than good.
Mr. Summers is known for perhaps the most efficient rejoinder to the efficient-markets theory. ''THERE ARE IDIOTS. Look around,'' he famously wrote in an unpublished paper. Professor Chinn said that Ms. Yellen's work showed an even clearer pattern of viewing markets as inherently flawed.
''She and her husband were thinking about how to model the economy in a realistic fashion,'' said Professor Chinn, referring to Ms. Yellen's husband and his own former teacher, the economist and Nobel laureate George Akerlof. ''The willingness to do that took a little bit of courage.''
In keeping with this worldview, both Mr. Summers and Ms. Yellen have long argued that government must protect people from abuses.
As Treasury secretary in 2000, Mr. Summers joined with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to produce an exposé of predatory lending practices. The report recommended modest changes in federal law but Congress, then controlled by Republicans, made none. The Fed and other banking regulators also ignored the findings. Years later, however, it was a source for elements of Dodd-Frank.
As President Obama's chief economic adviser in the wake of the crisis, Mr. Summers advocated the creation of a regulatory agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing that the Fed could not be trusted to retain that role.
Mr. Summers also was an architect of the administration's broader approach to overhauling financial regulation; he and the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, oversaw the staff that hammered out the details. At the time, he described it as an effort to ensure that participants in the financial system, like drivers, wear seat belts and carry insurance, and submit their cars to regular inspections, to limit the chances and the consequences of crashes.
''I think Larry looked at the financial market and had the basic view that it was broken,'' said Michael Barr, a member of the group.
But the administration's initial proposal in June 2009 was a disappointment to many Congressional Democrats, who added or significantly strengthened some of the key provisions -- sometimes in conflict with the White House -- before passing a bill in 2010.
''Everything in that original working paper was marginal change to the existing regulatory structure,'' said Jeff Connaughton, then an aide to Senator Ted Kaufman, a Delaware Democrat who became one of the most persistent voices for making more fundamental changes.
Critics of Mr. Summers say that he has a record of showing too much trust in financial markets to regulate themselves. And the most important example concerns over-the-counter derivatives -- basically, customized bets on the movements of other prices, which could be used as insurance or, just as easily, to magnify risk-taking.
Mr. Summers, as a senior Treasury official in the late 1990s, played a leading role in the suppression of an effort by the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to establish oversight of these customized derivatives, whose misuse already had contributed to financial catastrophes, including the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif., and the collapse of a ballyhooed hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management.
At the time, Mr. Summers emphasized that he wanted to maintain the status quo to preserve the stability of domestic markets, and to avoid pushing the business overseas. In July 1998, he told Congress that he also saw no reason for regulation because ''the parties to these kinds of contract are largely sophisticated financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves.''
The Clinton administration subsequently agreed with Congressional Republicans to formalize the lack of regulation, allowing the market to grow in the dark. That helps explain why regulators were blindsided a decade later when the world's largest derivatives gambler, the American International Group, nearly brought down the financial system.
More than a decade later, in 2010, President Clinton said on ABC's ''This Week'' that he had been wrong to listen to his advisers. ''Sometimes people with a lot of money make stupid decisions and make it without transparency,'' Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Summers, too, changed his mind in the aftermath of the crisis. ''By 2008, our regulatory framework with respect to derivatives was manifestly inadequate,'' he told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. But he and his supporters have maintained that the failure occurred because the use of derivatives changed over a decade in ways that they did not anticipate.
Michael Greenberger, a senior official at the futures trading commission in the late 1990s, said that did not explain the reluctance to establish safeguards. The problem, he said, was not the failure to predict the specific problem but the willingness to trust that there would be none. ''I don't think that required 20/20 foresight,'' he said.
Lewis A. Sachs, a senior Treasury official in the late 1990s, said that Mr. Summers backed him in his bid to increase the transparency of derivatives by requiring them to be processed through clearinghouses, but that he was unable to win the support of Mr. Greenspan or Senate Republicans, so the idea was dropped.
Mr. Sachs, whose private investment firm now pays Mr. Summers as an outside adviser, noted that the administration's report called for the regulators to revisit the derivatives market as it grew. The Bush administration failed to do so, he said.
Some of Mr. Summers's supporters also argue that better oversight of derivatives would not have prevented or significantly diminished the crisis.
Ms. Yellen found a ringside seat in the years before the financial crisis. She was named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 2004 and, the next year, she became one of the first officials to describe the rise in housing prices as a bubble.
Over the next few years, in public speeches and meetings of the Fed's monetary policy committee, she spoke with growing concern about the potential for broad economic damage when the bubble burst. But the San Francisco Fed, which oversaw the nation's largest mortgage lender, Countrywide Financial, did not move to check its increasingly indiscriminate lending. The regional banks take their marching orders from Washington, which had adopted a hands-off policy.
Ms. Yellen told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2010 that she and other San Francisco Fed officials pressed Washington for new guidance, sharing the problems they were seeing. But Ms. Yellen did not raise those concerns publicly, and she said that she had not explored the San Francisco Fed's ability to act unilaterally, taking the view that it had to do what Washington said.
''For my own part,'' Ms. Yellen said, ''I did not see and did not appreciate what the risks were with securitization, the credit ratings agencies, the shadow banking system, the S.I.V.'s -- I didn't see any of that coming until it happened.'' Her startled interviewers noted that almost none of the officials who testified had offered a similar acknowledgment of an almost universal failure.
Chastened by the financial crisis, Ms. Yellen now favors stricter regulation. ''This experience,'' she told the commission, ''has strongly inclined me toward tougher standards and built-in rules that will kick into effect automatically when things like this happen, that make tightening up a less discretionary matter.''
Mr. Summers's supporters contrast his long experience on regulatory issues with Ms. Yellen's more limited record to argue that he would be more effective in carrying forward a set of reforms that he helped to shape. Ms. Yellen's supporters draw a different lesson from the same contrast.
''Between the two of them,'' said Mr. Connaughton, the former Democratic Senate aide, ''I would rather roll the dice on her than get the known quantity of Larry Summers.''

HEADLINE: Obama, Snowden And Putin

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
You only get one chance to make a second impression. It seems to me that Edward Snowden should use his and that Russian President Vladimir Putin has blown his.
Considering the breadth of reforms that President Obama is now proposing to prevent privacy abuses in intelligence gathering, in the wake of Snowden's disclosures, Snowden deserves a chance to make a second impression -- that he truly is a whistle-blower, not a traitor. The fact is, he dumped his data and fled to countries that are hostile to us and to the very principles he espoused. To make a second impression, Snowden would need to come home, make his case and face his accusers. It would mean risking a lengthy jail term, but also trusting the fair-mindedness of the American people, who, I believe, will not allow an authentic whistle-blower to be unfairly punished. 
As for Putin, he blew his second impression -- the reset in U.S.-Russian relations -- long before he granted Snowden asylum. Dealing with Putin always involved a certain trade-off for America: accepting a degree of Putin authoritarianism in return for cooperation on global issues that mattered to us, as long as Putin ''sort of'' kept Russia moving toward a more open, consensual society. But the balance is not there anymore. Putin's insistence on blocking any diplomacy on Syria that might move out ''his guy,'' President Bashar al-Assad, his abuse of Russian gays and lesbians, and his blatant use of rule-by-law tactics to silence any critics mean that we're not getting anything from this relationship anymore, nor are many Russians.
But rather than punch Putin in the face, which would elevate him with his followers, it would be much better to hit him where it would really hurt by publicly challenging the notion that he is making Russia strong.
Here's what Obama could have said when asked about Putin last week: ''You know, back in 1979, President Putin's brutal Soviet predecessors sent us Sergey Brin and his family. As you know, Brin later became the co-founder of Google. That was Russia's loss, but a gift to us and to the world. We could not have enjoyed the benefits of search had the Soviets not made life so unattractive for Brin's family. I make that point because Putin doesn't seem interested in making life attractive in today's Russia for the Sergey Brins of his generation. Putin only seems interested in sticking pipes in the ground and extracting oil and gas -- rather than the talents of his own young people -- and making sure that he and his cronies get their cut of the oil flow.
''Look what Putin just did. Sergei Guriev is one of the most talented of Russia's new-generation economists. He was rector of one of the few world-class academic institutions left in Russia today: the New Economic School. Guriev was a loyal, liberal adviser to former President Dmitri Medvedev, but after he co-authored a report that criticized the conviction of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the imprisoned oil magnate, Putin's goons began to harass him. He said they even demanded his e-mails going back five years. (Snowden beware.) Well, in the spring, Guriev fled to France, saying he feared losing his freedom, and he says he's not going back.
''Sergei Guriev, come to America. Bring your friends. Bring the members of that band Putin put in jail, Pussy Riot, too. No creative person has any future in Putin's Russia because he doesn't understand the present: There are no 'developed' and 'developing' countries anymore. There are only H.I.E.'s (high imagination-enabling countries) and L.I.E.'s (low imagination-enabling countries). That is, countries that nurture innovation and innovators and those that don't -- in a world where so many more people can turn ideas into products, services, companies and jobs faster and cheaper than ever. Putin is building a political monoculture that will make Russia the lowest of low imagination-enabling countries.
''Putin prefers to rely instead on less educated, xenophobic rural populations, who buy into his anti-American, anti-gay trope that the world just wants to keep Russia down. As the revolution in hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling and energy efficiency spreads around the world, and oil and gas prices fall, Putin's failure to invest in Russia's human talent -- which he won't do because it means empowering and freeing them from his grasp -- will become a big problem for Russia.''
That's what I would have said. Do we lose anything by not having Putin's help? You bet. Those who say we don't need Russia are wrong. There is no major problem in the world today -- Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt, cybercrime, climate or drugs -- that would not be easier to solve if the U.S. and Russia worked together. (It's why I opposed NATO expansion.) But running against America is now essential to Putin's domestic survival.
So there is no sense wasting more time with him. While he will not help us, he can't do us serious harm. He can and is doing serious harm to Russia, by putting loyalty to him before competence. Any system that does that for long, dies.
You can Google it.

HEADLINE: The Great Powers, Then and Now

BYLINE: By PAUL KENNEDY

 BODY:
So President Obama won't have a one-on-one conference with his Russian equivalent, Vladimir Putin, at the time of the G-20 meeting in Moscow, partly because of a nondescript ''leaker,'' Edward Snowden -- that is not good. So Chinese public opinion (however that is cooked up) seems to be ever more nationalistic these days, while Japan launches its first aircraft carrier since the Pacific War -- surely also not good.
So America's National Security Agency looks as if it is spying on everyone, domestic and foreign, producing bouts of outrage -- that is a bad business. So the European Union is as divided, confused, angry and leaderless as, say, the former Holy Roman Empire -- this is surely not good. There's more: Argentina is huffing and puffing about the Falklands, and Spain is huffing and puffing about Gibraltar. Not good at all.
To historians of world affairs, including this one, the only proper response to this litany of spats, pouting and injured pride is to ask: ''Is that all?'' Are these the only issues which divide and upset the Great Powers as we enjoy the second decade of the 21st century? And, if so, shouldn't we count ourselves lucky? 
After all, we are not too far from the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, and if the many expectant authors, publishers, documentary filmmakers and local communities' plans are any guide, we shall face a tidal wave of the memorialization of that historic time -- a time when the governments of the Great Powers, acting with extreme recklessness, plunged the planet into its bloodiest conflict hitherto.
Next summer will also see the 70th anniversaries of the invasions of Normandy and the Marianas, and the great land struggle of Operation Bagration, that combined advance by the three Great Powers of Churchill's ''Grand Alliance'' -- the British Empire, the United States and the Soviet Union -- to smash the resistance of the two Great Powers of the Axis, Nazi Germany and Japan.
World politics in those decades was almost exclusively the politics of the Great Powers, some of whom behaved very badly indeed.
The contrast with today's world actors could not be more striking. With our criteria for national effectiveness and global influence in such a state of flux, it is difficult to say which nations are simply ''large regional powers'' and which are ''Great Powers.''
But let us cavalierly suggest the following septet: Brazil, Latin America's big boy, but domestically rather weak, militarily insignificant and constrained by envious neighbors; India, proud of its rising weight but also very prudent abroad, badly fissured within and cursed by the albatross of its deeply flawed neighbor, Pakistan; Japan, still bewildered by the outside world, cramped by its past, perplexed by its own economic mix of strength and weaknesses; Russia, with its activist government and fortuitous surplus of carbon fuels justifying its Great Power yelps, but its demographic implosion, untrained and obsolescent military, impatient youth and nascent border collapses all holding it back.
Then there is Europe, still a ''geographical expression,'' a federation without a political head, a real foreign policy or military unity, but acting more as an economic unit devised to help its farmers, unions and public servants. And, of course, there's the People's Republic of China, always rising but never quite getting there, politically neuralgic, militarily trying to catch up, worried about mass unrest within its borders and cautious about moving abroad.
Finally, there is the United States, that indispensable nation which seems ever less dispensable in Latin America, Africa, Central Asia and the Arab world, with the country's military leaders ruefully aware of overstretch, and its long-term fiscal mismanagement scarcely veiled by its overprinting of dollars.
All of these Great Powers are egoistic, more or less blinkered, with governments chiefly bent upon surviving a few more years. But none of them are troublemakers; nor are they, in any really significant sense, a source of trouble. Would they but realize it, they all have a substantial interest in preserving the international status quo, since they do not know what negative consequences would follow a changed world order.
The troublemakers, and the sources of trouble, lie elsewhere: in the unpredictable, overmilitarized lunatic asylum that is North Korea; in an Iran that sometimes seems to be daring an Israeli air strike; in a brutal and autistic Syrian regime; in a Yemen that both houses terrorists and pretends to be killing them off; and, far less purposefully, in the conflict-torn, crumbling polities of Central Africa, Egypt and Afghanistan, and many nations in between. Here are the world's problem cases.
If there are neurotic Kaiser Wilhelms or bullying Mussolinis or murderous Stalins around today, they are not -- thank heavens -- to be found in Beijing, Moscow or New Delhi.
If this thesis is correct, and the Great Powers, while sometimes complaining about one another's actions, generally act in a restrained manner, then perhaps we may look forward to a long period without a major war, rather like the unprecedented peace among the Great Powers that existed after 1815 under the Concert of Europe.
Many wars would still take place, but they would be local conflicts, not cause enough, despite their atrocities and inhumanity, to drag a major actor directly into the fighting. The Great Powers, in turn, would set aside their own differences to keep the bloodshed local, putting pressure upon their own client states if necessary to stop them from upsetting the international apple cart.
In no way would this be a ''democratic peace.'' Rather, it would continue to be an Old Boys' club, even if it has new members like India and Brazil. The myth of the equality of all nation-states would indeed remain a myth. Such is the price that liberal internationalists would have to pay to ensure the avoidance of a Third World War.
The price the Great Powers have to pay is self-restraint, year after year, decade after decade. If this is forgotten, then another 1914-like crisis could occur. At that time, it will be remembered, Russia failed to rein in its ''trouble-making'' satellite, Serbia. Austria-Hungary recklessly sent Belgrade an impossible-to-accept ultimatum. Berlin, forgetting Bismarck's cautions, foolishly supported Vienna. A weak czar lost control of his country's military plans. The Prussian army struck westwards, occupying Belgium, and bringing in the British Empire.
Are we sure some equivalent follies will never happen again, even though nuclear weapons surely help keep governments from going over the brink?
When you say your prayers, spare one for the leaders of the Great Powers. They may not be attractive individuals -- some are nasty, blinkered and devious. But so long as they realize their responsibilities to prevent any actions that might lead to a world war, we should all be happy. Their job is simply to hold firm the iron frame that keeps the international system secure. It is our job, not theirs, to work within that frame, to advance the dignity and prosperity of humanity. But that will never be achieved without the Great Powers acting reasonably well.

1913 Governor Impeached
NEW YORK -- Governor William Sulzer, of the State of New York, was impeached by the State Assembly at 5.15 o'clock this morning [Aug. 13], following a stormy session which had continued during the entire night. The vote for impeachment was 79 to 45. Mr. Martin H. Glynn, the Lieutenant Governor, now becomes Governor automatically, pending the trial of Mr. Sulzer by the Senate and the judges of the Court of Appeals. Mrs. Sulzer tried in vain to shoulder the responsibility for her husband's stock transactions, but Mr. Sulzer and his lawyers refused to permit her to sacrifice herself. The specific charge which is the basis for the impeachment proceedings against Governor Sulzer is that certain contributions made to his campaign fund, when he was a candidate for Governor, last year, were not accounted for in his sworn statement of campaign expenses. It is alleged that, in omitting them from the statement, he violated the Corrupt Practices Act. 
1938 Chicago Baby Winning Fight
NEW YORK -- Helaine Colan, Chicago baby who lost one eye, but won a chance for life and partial vision three months ago, is winning her fight, doctors reported today [Aug. 13]. The Medical Information Bureau of the New York Academy of Medicine announced that radiation treatments had brought about a marked recession in the cancerous growth on the infant's right eye. The news brought tears of joy from the baby's mother and grandmother, and was acclaimed by a nation which took a great interest in the problem of the baby's future in May and had since watched her progress anxiously. The baby's grandfather, Dr. Morris L. Hershman, discovered that Helaine had retinal glioma, a malignant cancer which first attacks the eyes and then spreads backward to the brain. It is thought incurable, and is fatal when the growth reaches brain tissue.
1963 AFL-CIO Is Neutral on March
UNITY HOUSE, Pa. -- The American labor movement split today [Aug. 13] over the issue of the ''Jobs and Freedom'' march on Washington scheduled for Aug. 28, when the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations refused to endorse the massive civil-rights demonstration. The AFL-CIO's Executive Council adopted a ''hands-off'' policy toward the march over the protests of United Auto Workers president Walter Reuther and Negro union chief A. Philip Randolph. AFL-CIO president George Meany told reporters that the march was ''not a wise idea'' and that he would not participate. But, Mr. Meany added: ''I would be the last person in the world to say they shouldn't march. I only hope there are no incidents that would hurt the civil-rights idea.''

HEADLINE: Joseph A. Tahl

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Tahl, 51, is a founder and the president of Tahl Propp Equities, a privately held real estate investment, development and management company based in Manhattan. Tahl Propp specializes in affordable housing and retail space in Harlem.
Before starting the company in 1998 with Rodney Propp, who serves as the chairman, Mr. Tahl was an associate general counsel at the Trump Organization.
Interview conducted and condensed by 
VIVIAN MARINO
Q. How do your duties differ from those of Mr. Propp, the other founder?
A. I'm really more the deal-making partner and operating partner, and Rodney is really more the capital partner.
I handle the day-to-day operations of the assets: decisions concerning additional investments; the potential refinancing, sale, leasing and condo conversion of existing assets; strategic decisions about what to do with each building, what to buy, sell, condo-convert, etc.
Q. You sound busy.
A. We are very busy. The apartment market is very strong -- the rental market is probably about as strong as it's ever been in Manhattan.
We are one of the larger landlords in Harlem. We own, manage and have in the pipeline for development over 3,000 apartments in both East and West Harlem.
Q. Do you still live in Harlem?
A. I live there with my family on Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard in central Harlem -- in a prewar building. We love it.
Q. I understand your commitment to Harlem, but why the focus on affordable housing?
A. You do have a steady source of income. Also, it's very important to be sensitive to the community that you're doing business in -- and in my case it's also the community that I live in. It's terribly important that a very strong base of affordable housing be maintained, because Harlem is a very diverse community today -- ethnically, racially, culturally, economically, religiously.
In the past, it was generally diverse because one group was on the way in and one group was on the way out. Today Harlem is diverse but everyone is staying. That's a big difference. White people aren't coming in because people of color are leaving. White people are coming in to join people of color there.
Q. But with home prices soaring throughout Manhattan aren't there also opportunities for more middle-class housing there?
A. I think some limited amount of market-rate has a place.
We're not looking to build market-rate rentals or condos. The closest we come to that would be an 80/20 building, where you have a 20 percent set aside for low-income and the other 80 percent are rent-stabilized but near market. Most of what we'll be doing will be affordable, because that's what the community needs.
Q. There's also a retail component to your holdings.
A. We own 50-some retail stores that are in the base of our various apartment buildings, and I think retail has a terrific future in Harlem. It's becoming more diverse and interesting. More and more restaurants are coming every day and all different kinds of shops.
Q. What kind of rental rates are you getting from retail tenants?
A. If you're on 125th Street you might be getting $125 a foot. If you're on a quieter street, you might be getting $30, $40, $50 a foot, so it's really a mix. But it's well below the rest of Manhattan.
Harlem, until the last 10 to 15 years, really did not have a diverse retail. Now it's getting retail, but it's getting very small pieces of retail where a lot more is needed. For example, the first Gap store opened a few months ago on 125th street. I think it's the only Gap in Northern Manhattan.
Q. Are most of your tenants mom-and-pop-type retailers?
A. Yes. Most are local, but chains are coming as well. We have some national tenants, like H & R Block.
Q. One of your specialties is condo conversions. How many have you done?
A. We've done about a dozen buildings.
We're now working on an 83-unit building at 305 West 150th Street. All of the apartments in the building are rent-stabilized, but they're rent-stabilized pretty much at market, so we think a lot of the people who are renting in that building or others will buy, because with interest rates still relatively low you can actually own the apartment for less than it costs to rent. That condo conversion will be approved next year. It's already been filed with the attorney general.
And we have another one -- a prewar building at 710 Riverside and 150th with views of the river. That's also an occupied building, where about half the units are market-rate and half are below. The market-rate units could be sold. That will also be approved by mid-next year.
Q. What did you do at the Trump Organization?
A. I worked for Donald from 1990 through the end of 1995. I was assistant general counsel and one of three real estate lawyers that worked directly with Mr. Trump on a daily basis on his real estate-related matters. We were doing a lot of restructuring and workouts, and then the last couple of years before I left we started doing new acquisitions and new deals.
Q. Why did you leave?
A. Because I wanted to become a developer.
Q. Was he your mentor?
A. He sometimes refers to me as the original apprentice. I actually played that role for real long before the TV show came out.

HEADLINE: U.S. Inmate in North Korea Seeks Help From Washington

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- An American tour operator imprisoned in North Korea on charges of plotting to harm the socialist country through Christian missionary activities has appealed to Washington to send a high-ranking official to North Korea to help free him, according to a videotaped interview made public on Tuesday. 
The Choson Sinbo, a pro-North Korean newspaper based in Japan, on Tuesday posted the video of the tour operator, Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American from Washington State, sitting in a hospital in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to which he was moved from a labor camp a week ago as his health deteriorated.
Mr. Bae, 45, had been imprisoned at the camp since May, shortly after he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for what the North Korean authorities said were hostile acts against the government. Mr. Bae was leading a group of visitors from China into the special economic zone of Rason in northeastern North Korea when he was arrested in November.
North Korean officials accused Mr. Bae of being a Christian missionary who flouted the country's laws on proselytizing. In his interview with The Choson Sinbo, Mr. Bae said he had ''violated'' North Korean laws.
''As an American citizen, I request the U.S. government to make active efforts so I can be pardoned and return home,'' he said in the interview, which The Choson Sinbo said took place on Friday. ''I think that a high-ranking U.S. official should come here and bring me home, and that such an official should come here as a representative of the U.S. government and apologize and make a request of an early pardon for my release.''
It was unclear whether Mr. Bae was speaking of his own free will.
North Korea had previously said that Mr. Bae would not be used as a bargaining chip. But outside analysts said recent news of his deteriorating health and the letters he was allowed to send to his family in recent weeks, along with another videotaped interview shown by The Choson Sinbo and CNN last month, were probably efforts by the North Korean government to force Washington to engage in dialogue.
In the past, the North has used Americans held on criminal charges to bring about visits by prominent American figures seeking their release, like former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton -- a practice that Washington wants to end.
A visit by a high-ranking American government representative would be a diplomatic coup for the North Korean government, which has long wanted an official dialogue with the United States. Washington has insisted that there will be no such engagement until the North has shown concrete signs of giving up its nuclear weapons development.
In the video posted Tuesday by The Choson Sinbo and broadcast on CNN, Mr. Bae was also shown being visited by a Swedish diplomat. Washington has no official diplomatic ties with North Korea, and the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang represents American interests in Mr. Bae's case on Washington's behalf.
Mr. Bae appeared gaunt in the video and said his various ailments, including a backache, had worsened during his time in the labor camp.
The State Department has called on the North to grant Mr. Bae amnesty and immediate release.

HEADLINE: A Rise in Technology Keeps the Market Ahead

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market eked out small gains on Tuesday after an upturn in technology companies offset weakness in other parts of the market, including a drop in airline shares.
The gain in technology stocks was driven by Apple, which surged $22.21, or 4.8 percent, to $489.57 after the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn posted on Twitter that he held a large position in the company and that its stock was undervalued. 
August has begun as a lackluster month for the stock market as major indexes fail to add significantly to gains made in July. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has drifted lower since closing at a nominal high on Aug. 2. Still, the index is up 18.8 percent this year.
On Tuesday, the S.& P. 500 rose 4.69 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 1,694.16. The Nasdaq composite index gained 14.49 points, or 0.4 percent, to 3,684.44. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 31.33 points, or 0.2 percent, to 15,451.01.
A sharp rise in Treasury yields rippled through the stock market on Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year note climbed almost to its highest point in two years after an increase in July retail sales added to speculation that the Federal Reserve will begin to wind down its economic stimulus program sooner rather than later.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Dennis P. Lockhart, said on Tuesday that it was too early to say when the bank would reduce its stimulus, but hinted that it probably would happen this year.
''You could argue that stocks would be up higher today if the bond market was behaving,'' said John Canally, an investment strategist for LPL Financial. ''The market's trend right now is higher.''
Airline stocks slumped after the federal government challenged the proposed merger of US Airways and American Airlines, which is seeking to leave bankruptcy.
The Justice Department, which filed an antitrust lawsuit to block the merger of the airlines, which are among the nation's largest, said the deal would substantially reduce competition, increase fares and curtail service. US Airways plunged $2.46, or 13.1 percent, to $16.36.
Among the stocks on the move, J. C. Penney fell 49 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $12.68. The struggling department store chain faces uncertainty after the activist investor William A. Ackman resigned from its board.
In government bond trading, the price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 27/32, to 98 3/32, while its yield jumped to 2.72 percent from 2.62 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Merkel Enters Last Leg of Re-election Bid With a Push to Draw In Youths

BYLINE: By ALISON SMALE

 BODY:
BERLIN -- After a summer dominated by questioning of her policy toward Europe and tangles over Germany's role in large-scale intelligence gathering by the United States, Chancellor Angela Merkel kicked off the final phase of her campaign for re-election on Tuesday with an unusual visit to a high school in the former East Berlin.
There the reflexively private chancellor gave select seniors a history lesson of a rarely personal kind, since Tuesday was the 52nd anniversary of the building of the Berlin Wall, which Ms. Merkel experienced as a 7-year-old girl living in East Germany. 
Just under 10 million of the almost 62 million Germans entitled to vote are aged 18 to 30, and Ms. Merkel, 59, who is seeking a third four-year term in national elections on Sept. 22, seems keen to win them for her center-right Christian Democrats.
On Monday, as she returned from a two-week vacation -- she hiked in the Alps with her husband, Joachim Sauer -- the youth magazine Neon published a lengthy interview with the chancellor, who let drop that her worst foible was once drinking too much cherry wine and underscored that love can be forever, despite divorcing her first husband, Ulrich Merkel, whom she married as a student.
Reflecting her central role in German politics -- even her Social Democratic opponents feature Ms. Merkel on their campaign posters -- a new Web page (www.angela-merkel.de) features pictures from her childhood and youth that seemed designed -- like Tuesday's school visit -- to dispel any whiff of closeness to the Communists who led East Germany.
She is still close, she says, to her brother, Marcus, a scientist, and her sister, Irene, bound by ''the Christian values and openness to the world'' of their childhood in Templin, about 60 miles northeast of Berlin, where her father was a pastor. Over a picture where she looks fondly at her husband, a quantum chemist, she writes of their common love of the open air, and of opera.
Left out are such matters as the woes of the euro, the uncertain future of the European Union, the rows over intelligence and the enmity of some leading intellectuals. The newsmagazine Der Spiegel, kicking off an election series last week, devoted several pages to this disdain for the chancellor, blaming her for a mood characterized by Peter Sloterdijk, Germany's leading philosopher, as ''lethargocracy.''
This past weekend, an opinion piece in the center-left newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung depicted Ms. Merkel as spreading ''poison'' by having essentially removed Europe from the election campaign. ''Europeans are looking to Germany, because it is clear to them that the future of the European Union essentially depends on this country,'' Daniel Brössler wrote. ''But what they get to see is a nation which is behaving at the moment as if this all has nothing to do with it.''
Paul Nolte, a history professor in Berlin who leans toward the Christian Democrats but is also critical of them, retorted that it was hard to blame Ms. Merkel for the national mood, which he characterized more as ''wait-and-see,'' even as Germany enjoys low unemployment rates and relatively high wages envied by many of its European neighbors.
''It is sometimes striking what kind of Merkel-hate you confront'' in the news media, Dr. Nolte said by telephone from Munich. ''It is hatred with a perfidy that I find astonishing,'' particularly, he said, when one contrasts the broad consensus on topics like gay marriage, or an expansion of kindergartens to allow German mothers to work, with the recent, sometimes violent, protests against gay marriage in neighboring France.
Regardless of whether, after the elections, Greece demands new bailout money or, more gravely, the euro is in fresh peril, Ms. Merkel knows that, for now, her future depends more on the campaign, and the almost 60 stops she already plans to make all over Europe's dominant country.
Judging by the teenagers she met in school on Tuesday, Ms. Merkel has hard work ahead. The schoolyard harbored some fans: Gordon Zückert, an 18-year-old senior, said he would vote for her in September. ''She has done her homework,'' he said. ''Her politics are good, and there is a reason why she has been elected more than once.''
But other seniors, like Louise Debatin, 18, who whipped out her cellphone as the chancellor arrived and snapped herself with Ms. Merkel, said they were more likely to vote Green. Like many young Germans, several pupils wore flower badges indicating their environmental engagement and opposition to nuclear energy -- something the physicist chancellor decided after the 2011 earthquake and nuclear accident in Japan that she, too, wants to phase out.
Political differences notwithstanding, Ms. Debatin was convinced that Ms. Merkel did the right thing in coming to give a personal view of the Communist East. Visiting Berlin museums on this city's turbulent history, Ms. Debatin said, is ''really frightening.''
Listening to her mother -- she ''was right there live when the wall fell,'' in 1989 -- and her grandmother -- ''she saw the wall go up, and come down'' -- really made her appreciate today's freedom of movement, Ms. Debatin said.
Exactly what Ms. Merkel imparted during almost an hour lesson with the seniors remained largely a secret. The youth magazine said to have invited her reported bland quotes from three participants about Ms. Merkel's warmth, humor and openness. The leader herself, emerging from the school, did not even repeat what she had told biographers in the past: her memory of Sunday, Aug. 13, 1961, when her father had to preach in church and ''everybody was crying.''
Tears and solemnity, of course, were featured at memorials around Berlin on Tuesday, commemorating the almost 140 people who lost their lives trying to cross the barbed wire, minefields and multiple barriers that made up the Berlin Wall.
Unlike beautiful, more manicured Paris, Berlin offers up its history raw, and ever-present. The chancellor, Ms. Debatin said, was right to recall ''what a journey this city has behind it.''
The cold war clash of capitalism and Communism ''included all of Germany, of course, but Berlin is special -- two lives in one city,'' Ms. Debatin said. ''That is Berlin, and that's what makes Berlin special.''

HEADLINE: Time to Stop The Mergers And Try To Compete

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Can the American airline industry turn a profit in a competitive market?
This question is probably not front-of-mind at the headquarters of American Airlines, where executives are justifiably upset that the Justice Department decided on Tuesday to oppose its merger with US Airways.
After all, antitrust regulators allowed Delta to swallow Northwest just five years ago. They let Continental merge with United in 2010. 
How could the Obama administration stop American -- the last of the airlines to file for bankruptcy as a means to wipe out debt and lower labor costs, the one that tried hardest to stay in the game by going it alone -- from doing the same thing?
But whether American and the other three so-called legacy carrier airlines that remain in operation can, in fact, learn to survive in a competitive market and make money without turning routes and networks into virtual monopolies, is the right question to ask.
Airline executives, it must be clear by now, seem to believe pretty strongly that they cannot. This is not only apparent in their penchant for mergers, which has led to capacity reductions and fare increases. Their preferred strategies over the years -- bulking up into closed allied networks, keeping customers via frequent flier systems and corporate loyalty programs -- all share a basic mistrust of open competition.
But they will have to learn fast. On Tuesday, the Justice Department sought to eliminate further oligopolization -- the control of the industry by a small number of dominant players -- from the airlines' strategic tool kit. Airlines in the United States need an alternative path.
The airlines' track record is dismal. From 1979 -- right after the deregulation of the industry -- through 2009, airlines lost $59 billion on their domestic operations (in 2009 dollars), according to Severin Borenstein from the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and $8 billion on international flights. Since the 1990s, US Airways, United, Northwest, Delta, Continental and American Airlines have all filed for bankruptcy -- a couple of them twice.
To some extent, it's not their fault. Airlines racked up most of their losses in the 2000s, when rising fuel costs and the drop in passengers following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, walloped their bottom line. The entry of low-cost carriers like JetBlue and Southwest, which had taken some 25 percent of the domestic market by the middle of the decade, also eroded profitability of the legacy carriers.
Still, Professor Borenstein points out: ''I don't think the fact that they've been losing money is justification for mergers. The reason they are losing money is they have much higher costs than smaller airlines.''
Eliminating competition has been their main strategic response. Delta has been making money recently: almost $2.5 billion in the last three years. United made almost $400 million over the period, even after losing more than $700 million last year because of problems in merging its systems with Continental's. US Airways made about $1.2 billion. Even American, in bankruptcy since 2011, managed to turn a profit in the second quarter of this year.
A big reason for the turnaround is that oligopolies work. Fares rose by 16 percent on top of inflation over the last three years, after falling fairly consistently through the previous decade. And airlines introduced a tattoo of additional charges, for services like making a reservation or taking a suitcase that used to be included in the price of a ticket.
In its complaint against the merger, the Justice Department quoted US Airways president, Scott Kirby, who noted that consolidation has ''allowed the industry to do things like ancillary revenues,'' which he called ''a structural permanent change to the industry and one that's impossible to overstate the benefit of it.'' Indeed, in 2012 domestic airlines chalked up $6 billion in fees from checked bags and flight changes alone.
For the Justice Department, whether it is unfair to prohibit American Airlines and US Airways from doing what it allowed Delta, United and friends to do before -- rightly or wrongly -- is beside the point. The officials' objective is to maintain some modicum of competition in the airline industry and -- perhaps -- promote even more.
''The airline industry is not the most competitive industry in the history of mankind,'' Bill Baer, assistant attorney general in charge of the department's antitrust division, told me on Tuesday. ''This oligopolistic structure is working in ways that don't really benefit consumers.''
This merger is special in two ways. First, the American deal with US Airways is particularly anticompetitive. The airlines share many routes and airports, so a merger would take out two rivals who are proving strong competitors. American, its books cleansed by bankruptcy, has an aggressive stand-alone plan to compete by buying new jets and opening new routes. US Air has proved to be a feisty low-fare competitor, saving passengers hundreds of millions of dollars, the D.O.J. says.
The other peculiarity, unfortunately perhaps for American and US Airways, is that this merger comes after the previous two. If Justice were to allow this to go through, only four airlines, including Southwest, would control 80 percent of the domestic air travel market.
Nothing has been decided yet. American and US Air said in a statement that they would fight the Justice Department in court. Yet, for the sake of passengers and even the industry itself, there is a good case for them trying to go it alone. They might actually make it.
There are profitable and competitive models for the industry to follow. The low-cost airlines are mostly profitable. And the lumbering legacy carriers are less lumbering than they used to be. They have shed costs, often at the expense of their own employees and retirees. They have gotten better at investing in the proper equipment and at hedging fuel prices. And they have shed much of the excess capacity that plagued them through much of the last decade.
This might cut against airline executives' instincts, focused as they have been on culling competition over more than 20 years. But perhaps competition won't kill them. They might even thrive.

HEADLINE: Rise of Inflation Eases in Britain

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- Consumer prices in Britain increased at a slower rate in July after hitting a 14-month high in June, relieving some pressure on households but remaining well above the central bank's inflation target. 
Inflation slowed to 2.8 percent in July from 2.9 percent in June, partly because clothing stores discounted prices and airfares were lower, the Office for National Statistics said Tuesday. A slowdown in consumer price increases would help households, which have been squeezed by more expensive utility costs and other living expenses just as many employees saw their salaries cut or frozen.
The Bank of England, which has its own inflation target of 2 percent, has been predicting that consumer price increases would remain at the current level before starting to ease toward the end of this year. But some economists warned that higher oil prices and a strengthening housing market might help to push prices up much further in the short-term.
Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a note to clients that consumer price inflation ''might touch 3 percent in the near term, but it should start heading gradually down towards the end of the year.'' He added, ''Much will clearly depend on oil price developments.''
Britain's economy has started to show signs of recovery after narrowly avoiding a triple-dip recession at the beginning of this year. Consumer confidence has been improving and the construction and manufacturing industries have returned to growth. The values of houses have been increasing, not just in London but across the country.
Still, the Bank of England's new governor, Mark J. Carney, warned last week that the recovery would be very slow and that headwinds persisted. To help speed up the recovery, Mr. Carney linked future decisions on interest rates, which are currently at a record low of 0.5 percent, to unemployment. He said that the Bank of England planned to keep interest rates unchanged until unemployment falls to 7 percent from 7.8 percent at the moment.
The plan, which is similar to steps taken by the United States Federal Reserve, is expected to eliminate some uncertainty for consumers and companies about the future cost of borrowing. But Mr. Carney also said the central bank was sticking to its main mandate of bringing down consumer price inflation. Unlike most of its neighbors, Britain continues to be plagued by relatively high inflation that is linked to several factors, including oil and gas prices.
Cathy Jamieson, a member of Parliament for the opposition Labour Party, said that despite the slowdown in inflation in July, ''prices continue to rise faster than wages as the Tory-led government's cost of living crisis continues.''
Some lawmakers and economists have started to warn that recent increases in the prices of homes could make them even more unaffordable for many. In a separate report Tuesday, the statistical office said house-price inflation rose annually to 3.1 percent in June compared to 2.9 percent in May, bringing prices to the highest level in five years.
The values of homes rose fastest in London, an 8.1 percent increase, helped by buyers from Asia and Europe looking for a haven for their investments.

HEADLINE: The Ad Campaign: Thompson Emphasizes His Roots

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Four years after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg defeated him in a closer-than-expected election, William C. Thompson Jr., a former comptroller, is back on the air with two advertisements as he tries to improve his position in a crowded Democratic primary. Both 30-second spots are heavily biographical and feature Mr. Thompson speaking directly to the camera. The more vivid of the two is titled ''Believe.'' 
PRODUCER The Campaign Group
THE SCRIPT Mr. Thompson: ''My grandparents were immigrants. They came from the Caribbean for opportunity. I grew up in Brooklyn. My father was a judge, my mother a teacher. We had good public schools, good jobs. That's the New York we believe in. More affordable, safer streets. Better schools in every neighborhood. I'm Bill Thompson. I'll always remember where I come from and who I'm standing up for.'' Narrator: ''Bill Thompson, Democrat for mayor. He'll make us proud.''
ON SCREEN The ad opens with a photo montage of Mr. Thompson's grandparents, Caribbean immigrants, as well as maps of the Caribbean and Brooklyn.
As Mr. Thompson narrates, a horn blares in the background, and peppy drums can be heard. The ad cuts to Mr. Thompson, dressed in a suit and tie, standing in front of the Bedford-Stuyvesant row house that he grew up in (and still owns).
As Mr. Thompson continues talking cheerfully about his family history, the camera shows him with schoolchildren, with laborers, with firefighters and on the street, as a graphic lists some of the groups he has been endorsed by.
ACCURACY Mr. Thompson emphasizes his Brooklyn roots; he does not mention that he now lives in Manhattan. And his rose-tinted description of his formative years overlooks the fact that in the mid-1970s, when Mr. Thompson was entering the job market, the city was in the throes of a fiscal crisis, with double-digit unemployment rates, and the schools were generally viewed as a disaster.
SCORECARD Mr. Thompson's mission is simple here: Even though voters may not remember him much from his 2009 run, he wants them to know that he is back. By mentioning his Caribbean roots, he indirectly highlights the fact that he is the only black candidate in the mayor's race, which could be an asset among black and Hispanic voters. He speaks more slowly than the other candidates who have broadcast advertisements, as if to reinforce his message that he is the calm, deliberate adult in the field. DAVID W. CHEN

''I grew up in Brooklyn. My father was a judge. My mother a teacher. We had good public schools, good jobs. That's the New York we believe in.''
A smiling Mr. Thompson, wearing a suit and tie, tries to project his sunniest and most homespun persona. Backed by a peppy, jazz-infused score, Mr. Thompson talks about his grandparents, both Caribbean immigrants. He is filmed standing in front of the Bedford-Stuyvesant row house in which he grew up, emphasizing his Brooklyn roots even though he now lives in Manhattan. His rose-tinted description of his formative years overlooks the fact that in the mid-1970s, when Mr. Thompson was entering the job market, the city was in the throes of a fiscal crisis, with double-digit unemployment rates, and the schools were generally viewed as a disaster.

''More affordable. Safer streets. Better schools in every neighborhood. I'm Bill Thompson. I'll always remember where I come from and who I'm standing up for.''
Mr. Thompson pledges to do what every candidate -- Democrat or Republican -- has focused on if elected: make the city more affordable and safer, and improve the schools. In a sign of his institutional support, he is seen walking with firefighters outside a firehouse, and talking with New Yorkers on the street, while a graphic notes that he has been endorsed by firefighters, Democratic leaders and teachers. The ad concludes with a smiling Mr. Thompson surrounded by his family: his father, a former judge; his wife; and his adult daughter.

HEADLINE: Summers Of Our Discontent

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- I have no doubt that Larry Summers can speak truth to power. Indeed, I've seen him yawn at power.
Once, when Vice President Biden was talking to a small group at a holiday party, Summers yawned, checked his watch and walked away while Biden was in midsentence.
While he's not exactly socialized -- he had a lot of unhappy colleagues when he ran the Obama White House's economic team -- I have no doubt that Summers is genuinely smart and gets some credit for the policies that produced the recovery. I'm sure the imperious economist is more mellow than he used to be, because life has taught him he has to be. 
But the idea that it is somehow historically inevitable that the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve should go to Summers, that it belongs to him, that he would be an enthusiastic enforcer of bank regulation to protect the little guy?
I have my doubts.
This idea is being pushed by the boys' club around President Obama, and also by the bullying cool kids, some of the Wall Street types like former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin who paved the way for the country's ruin. Larry's loyal former protégée Sheryl Sandberg aside, it evokes a sexism of complacency -- just a bunch of alpha males who prefer each others' company and who all flatter themselves that they're smart enough to know how smart Summers is.
These days, it's impolite to mention that all those cool bankers that President Cool didn't punish enough brought the country to the brink of disaster.
One person unafraid to recall it is the Divine Miss M, who has been trashing the Disheveled Mr. S in tweets this week, picked up by Washington Post economic columnist Neil Irwin.
@BetteMidler 2:34 AM -- 10 Aug 2013 HUH. The architect of bank deregulation, which turned straitlaced banks into casinos and bankers into pimps, may be next Head Fed: Summers.
@BetteMidler 11:26 PM -- 11 Aug 2013 Larry Summers, Mr. De-Regulation, has never stepped forward to say ... ''Oops! My bad!''
Even Bill Clinton has offered an ''oops,'' saying he got bad advice from Summers and Rubin.
In the late 1990s, when the prescient Brooksley Born, then chief of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, wanted to publicly examine derivatives, Summers, who was deputy Treasury secretary, worked with Rubin and Alan Greenspan to block her.
Michael Greenberger, a University of Maryland law school professor and former Born lieutenant, told The Post that Summers called and said: ''I have 13 bankers in my office, and they say if you go forward with this you will cause the worst financial crisis since World War II.'' Instead, these bankers were behind the policies that caused the worst financial crisis since before World War II.
As The Times reported this week, when the 58-year-old Summers came to the Obama White House, he was worth $7 million; when he left at the end of 2010, he ''jumped into a moneymaking spree'' at a hedge fund and at Citigroup -- a bank rescued by a government bailout -- so he could be a gazillionaire by the time Ben Bernanke retires and the job is open.
His stuffing of his pockets within hours of leaving the White House job now makes it unseemly for him to lead the Federal Reserve in enforcing the important new regulations from the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill.
He is an exemplar of, rather than a solution to, the obscenely lucrative revolving-door problem mocked by Mark Leibovich in his new book, ''This Town.''
The Fed is entering a new era when it is supposed to be getting tough on the banks, even if it means that the banks are smaller and less profitable and that shareholders make less.
Sure, Summers, the son of two economists and nephew of two Nobel laureates in economics, has a high I.Q. and inspired a great cameo bit in ''The Social Network.'' But there has to be somebody out there to run the economy who wasn't a part of the culture that ran the economy into the ground.
Janet Yellen, the Fed's vice chair, has generally been more publicly aligned with Bernanke than Summers has been in using monetary policy to revive the economy. If the president passes over the trailblazing and more temperamentally stable Yellen to appoint Summers, he'll be giving Larry some vindication on his infamous critique of women that helped get him ousted as president of Harvard -- a job he got thanks to Rubin.
Does the fact that we've had no female Fed chairs and no female Treasury secretaries mean that Summers was right when he said women are less likely to have the kind of brains that would allow them to get top jobs requiring math skills?
Is that what makes Larry Summers so brilliant?

HEADLINE: North Carolinians Fear the End of a Middle Way

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
EDEN, N.C. -- When Pat McCrory, a Republican former mayor of Charlotte, was elected governor last year, he pledged to ''bring this state together,'' and to focus on bread-and-butter issues amid an ailing economy.
But with Republicans controlling all branches of the state government for the first time in more than a century, the legislature pushed through a wide range of conservative change. The Republicans not only cut taxes and business regulations, as many had expected, but also allowed stricter regulations on abortion clinics, ended teacher tenure, blocked the expansion of Medicaid, cut unemployment benefits, removed obstacles to the death penalty, allowed concealed guns in bars and restaurants, and mandated the teaching of cursive writing.
Just this week, Mr. McCrory signed into law strict voter identification requirements, prohibiting same-day registration and cutting early voting. ''Many of those from the extreme left who have been criticizing photo ID are using scare tactics,'' he said in a video on his Web site. ''They're more interested in divisive politics than ensuring that no one's vote is disenfranchised by a fraudulent ballot.'' 
Lawsuits have been filed -- including one on Monday by the N.A.A.C.P. -- and protests are taking place almost weekly in Raleigh, the capital, and other cities, leaving North Carolinians across the political spectrum worried that the state's often-hailed political pragmatism may have given way to the ideological warfare of Washington.
''This is a definite break from what I would consider normal behavior for North Carolina,'' said David French, 27, who is looking for a job in industrial design here in rural Rockingham County. ''The whole political system nowadays is becoming more extreme.''
In an interview, Mr. McCrory said that critics had obscured what he called a pragmatic and fiscally responsible agenda. ''It's a combination of people on the two extremes wanting to bring up and exaggerate controversial issues,'' he said, adding that he had pushed back against earlier versions of the abortion and tax bills, and was planning to veto other bills this week.
But the agenda that did pass was unquestionably a right turn for a state that only five years ago voted for Barack Obama, the first Democratic presidential candidate to win here since Jimmy Carter. With a run of Democratic governors stretching back to 1993, North Carolina was considered such a promising state for the Democrats that they held their convention in Charlotte in 2012.
''It shocked everybody,'' said Sam Hummel, a 76-year-old retired investment adviser who was arrested last month in Raleigh wearing an Uncle Sam costume and taking part in the protests that have come to be known as ''Moral Mondays.''
North Carolina has long had a strong conservative strain, even when its political leadership was almost entirely Democratic. There have historically been libertarian-leaning Republicans in the western mountains, and social conservatives have been peeling away from the Democrats for years. The state was the home of Senator Jesse Helms, known for his small-government defiance as Senator No.
But it was also the home of Senator John Edwards, the Democratic populist who ran for president and became John Kerry's running mate. For decades, the state's contradictory inclinations came to something of a stalemate, resulting in its pragmatic political style.
Things began to change in 2010.
President Obama drew antipathy from rural white voters, and state Democrats were dogged by troubles: federal investigators were looking into the campaign finances of former Gov. Mike Easley, while the sitting governor, Bev Perdue, was dropping in the polls. The state's economy had been rocked more than most by the recession, and places like Rockingham County, on the Virginia border, which traditionally swung in its partisan allegiances, had been growing steadily more desperate after the loss of thousands of jobs with the closing of textile and furniture mills and tobacco plants.
The tipping point may have come in the suburbs. Conservatives and pro-business groups had been building a formidable organizational and donor structure, as part of a national Republican strategy to win control of statehouses in time to shape legislative redistricting.
Most active in these efforts in North Carolina was Art Pope, a retail magnate, who founded groups that put over $1.7 million into the 2010 elections and whose financing of conservative candidates and policy groups was described at length in a 2011 article in The New Yorker, as well as a series of articles by the Institute for Southern Studies, a liberal group based in the state.
John Hood, the president of the John Locke Foundation, which Mr. Pope helped found, said that Democrats had enjoyed a substantial spending and organizational advantage in the past, and that his effort ''was partly a response to a liberal party infrastructure that had been built over the previous decades.''
Other business leaders began leaping into the fray, like Allen E. Gant Jr., the president of Glen Raven, a 133-year-old textile company based in Burlington. He started a group called Carolina Business Coalition, which pushes for low taxes and pro-management policy.
''We finally found some people who are willing to listen to us,'' Mr. Gant said of the new Republican leadership.
With all of this brought to bear in the 2010 elections, a cycle deeply unfavorable for Democrats nationwide, North Carolina Republicans won both houses of the legislature for the first time in a century. More critically, they also won control of redistricting. One year later, they drew districts guaranteeing safe seats for a Republican majority for years to come.
In 2012, with Ms. Perdue's late decision not to run again, Mr. McCrory won the governor's office easily. Naming Mr. Pope as his budget director, he promised an agenda focused on economic growth, even pledging not to sign into law new restrictions on abortion. But Republicans in the legislature were not interested in half-measures.
''I think part of it was the frustration of being out of power for such a long time,'' Mr. Hood said.
Mr. McCrory, who was in Rockingham County on Tuesday morning to announce the coming of a gun manufacturing plant, said he had ''spent 95 percent of my time on jobs and the economy, but the media has probably spent 95 percent of the time on other issues.'' He added that he had met most of his major economic goals.
But many voters, those neither cheering nor protesting, are frustrated.
Doug Clark, a columnist for The News and Record of Greensboro, welcomed the partisan change, but he now sees the state's Republican leadership as fostering ''extreme partisanship and abuse of power.'' He questioned why the legislature, after passing laws governing abortion, guns and voter identification, and frequently trying to exert control over issues traditionally left to local governments, never got around to passing the governor's plan to overhaul job recruiting.
''That was his signature economic development initiative,'' Mr. Clark said. Mr. McCrory says that the money for the initiative is in the budget, and that he can proceed without new legislation.
Senator Phil Berger, the Republican president pro tem of the State Senate, who represents this region, takes issue with any suggestion that the legislature was overly aggressive or that it was not responding to voters' wants.
''There's not, in my view, an issue that we've addressed that was not articulated as this is something that needs to be done, changes that need to be made in North Carolina,'' he said.
But voters now seem to be souring on both parties. While the number of North Carolina voters over all has risen since 2008, the number who are registered as either Republicans or Democrats has shrunk.
Unaffiliated voters now make up more than a quarter of the voting population.
''Honest, I'm not much into North Carolina,'' said Cyril Seacat, 78, who moved here decades ago to work in a Glen Raven-owned mill and was sitting in his truck outside a Walmart. ''I don't think they're doing much of anything right.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 16, 2013

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the changing political landscape in North Carolina misspelled the surname of a retired investment adviser who was arrested wearing an Uncle Sam costume at a ''Moral Monday'' protest last month in Raleigh. He is Sam Hummel, not Hummell. The error was repeated in a picture caption with the continuation of the article.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Gov. Pat McCrory said that critics had obscured a pragmatic agenda.

HIGHLIGHT: Unable to admit having been wrong. 

 BODY:
More than four years ago Allan Meltzer issued a dire prediction: the Fed's policy of expanding its balance sheet will lead to high inflation. We're still waiting for that to happen. So it might behoove Meltzer to admit that he was wrong and ask where his analysis went wrong. 
OK, you can stop laughing now. What Meltzer does, instead, is complain that the Fed has undermined his perfectly fine analysis. You see, those dastardly officials are paying interest on reserves - a hefty 0.25 percent - and this has led to something totally unexpected:
The US Federal Reserve Board has pumped out trillions of dollars of reserves, but never have so many reserves produced so little monetary growth. Neither the hawks nor the doves (nor anyone else) expected that.
So the money supply broadly defined hasn't taken off - a complete surprise! - and hence no inflation.
Except that this isn't at all a surprise; it's exactly what those of us who had analyzed the liquidity trap predicted would happen when you expand the monetary base in an economy at the zero lower bound. From my 1998 paper on the subject (pdf):
The point is important and bears repeating: under liquidity trap conditions, the normal expectation is that an increase in high-powered money will have little effect on broad aggregates ...
Nor was it just theory. Meltzer claims support from the lessons of history; but the relevant history is of other liquidity-trap episodes. Consider, in particular, the case of Japan's quantitative easing in the early 2000s:
Unlike the Fed, the Bank of Japan didn't pay interest on reserves. Nonetheless, a huge increase in the monetary base just sat there, mostly in the form of increased bank reserves - the same as what happened in America later. 
We might add further that if the Fed can neutralize the supposedly awesome inflationary effect of quantitative easing by paying ¼ percent interest on reserves, it should be very easy to contain the inflationary threat in future.
Anyway, I do get kind of annoyed here. Some of us came into the global crisis with a well-worked-out theory of monetary and fiscal policy in a liquidity trap; the predictions of that theory have been completely consistent with actual experience. People like Meltzer chose to disregard all of that, insisting that terrible inflation (and high interest rates) were just around the corner. You almost never get that clear a test of rival economic views, and the results should be considered decisive.
Instead, the usual suspects stick their heads in the sand and pretend that they have been right all along.

HEADLINE: Morning Agenda: Hurdles in Making JPMorgan Arrests

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Federal investigators are facing logistical hurdles as they seek to arrest two former JPMorgan Chase employees. | William A. Ackman&#8217;s tenacity has underpinned both his successes and failures. | Special purpose acquisition companies are thriving despite a record of failure. | A contest to buy the maker of Steinway &#038; Sons pianos is ending in a diminuendo. 

 BODY:
Federal investigators are facing logistical hurdles as they seek to arrest and criminally charge two former JPMorgan Chase employees at the center of the bank's multibillion-dollar trading loss in London last year, Ben Protess and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook.
One of the employees, Javier Martin-Artajo, is on vacation, his lawyers said on Tuesday, adding that he would return to London "as scheduled." Another, Julien Grout, has returned to his native France, which typically does not extradite its citizens. But his lawyer said Mr. Grout "has absolutely no intention of fleeing." A third employee, Bruno Iksil, has reached a so-called nonprosecution deal with federal investigators in Manhattan that will protect him from charges as long as he cooperates against his two former colleagues, DealBook reports.
"The authorities need not wait for the employees to return to London to bring charges. Even without arrests, people briefed on the matter said, prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Manhattan could announce the charges this week," DealBook reports. 
ACKMAN'S WINNING QUALITIES PLAY OUT IN DEFEAT | One of William A. Ackman's big gambles, on turning around J.C. Penney, has blown up, leading him to make an embarrassing retreat, Michael J. de la Merced and Stephanie Clifford write in DealBook. The hedge fund titan resigned this week from Penney's board, just days after beginning an unusually public rebellion against his fellow directors. At the same time, he continues to bet against the nutritional supplements company Herbalife, a wager that has not gone his way in recent months. By some estimates, Mr. Ackman has lost about $1 billion on both companies.
Mr. Ackman's "three-year fight at Penney revealed many of the qualities that underpinned his successes and his failures, including tenacity and a willingness to seize the spotlight," DealBook writes. "The resolution of that struggle has made clear that Mr. Ackman can claim little in the way of victory."
Still, Herbalife has come under scrutiny for a product safety issue that it says it has resolved. In early 2011, the company detected fine shards of metal in its Formula 1 nutrition shake as it left the production line. Over five weeks, the company fixed that problem and a second bout of metal contamination, it said, and there is no evidence that any contaminated product was shipped from the factory. But the New York State attorney general's office has subpoenaed a former employee of Herbalife to produce internal documents about the issue, according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiry had not been publicly disclosed.
Mr. Ackman, as part of his campaign against Herbalife, has been meeting with the attorney general and the Securities and Exchange Commission in hopes of persuading them to pursue an action against the company.
A THRIVING FINANCIAL PRODUCT HAS A RECORD OF FAILURE | "On Wall Street, strange financial products sometimes exist not because they are good for investors or companies, but because they offer their promoters a way to profit. One of those products may be the Silver Eagle Acquisition Company, which just completed a $325 million initial public offering," Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. "Silver Eagle is a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which raises money through an I.P.O. and then casts a wide net in search of a private company to buy." Its I.P.O. "shows that these entities are thriving despite the record of failure," Mr. Davidoff writes.
ON THE AGENDA | Macy's and Deere & Company report earnings before the market opens. Cisco Systems reports earnings this evening. The producer price index for July is out at 8:30 a.m. Robert A. Profusek, the head of mergers and acquisitions at Jones Day, is on Bloomberg TV at 6 a.m.
KOHLBERG DECLINES TO RAISE BID FOR STEINWAY | A contest to buy the maker of Steinway & Sons pianos is ending in a diminuendo. But it may not have reached a finale. The private equity firm Kohlberg & Company, which offered last month to buy Steinway Musical Instruments, said on Tuesday that it would not seek to raise its bid in the face of a rival offer. That puts Steinway in a position to complete a buyout deal with the rival bidder, which offered this week to buy the company for $38 a share, or about $475 million. The rival bidder, not yet publicly identified, is the hedge fund Paulson & Company, in a rare foray into private equity, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly.
Kohlberg, which originally bid $35 a share, or $438 million, for Steinway, told the company that it waived its right to negotiate with the board about possibly increasing its bid, Kohlberg said on Tuesday in a regulatory filing. The original so-called go-shop period associated with that bid - during which Steinway could invite rival offers - ends on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: To His Collection of Steinways, Hedge Fund Titan Adds Their Maker

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: John A. Paulson, whose company has never before bought another company outright, said he was always enamored with Steinway pianos. 

 BODY:
 Updated, 9:16 p.m. | John A. Paulson, the hedge fund billionaire, already owns three Steinway & Sons pianos: the medium model M grand, the larger model O and the nearly seven-foot-long model B, together worth tens of thousands of dollars.
But Mr. Paulson, in investing parlance, was looking to increase his exposure. On Wednesday, his firm, Paulson & Company, agreed to buy the company that makes the pianos, Steinway Musical Instruments, for $512 million. 
 The move raised eyebrows both in the world of music and on Wall Street. Mr. Paulson made billions in 2007 largely with a bet against the housing market. His firm specializes in mortgages, gold and other financial assets.
And while Paulson & Company owns stakes in companies, it has never before bought one outright. But Mr. Paulson said that the calculation was rather simple - he loves the pianos.
"I've always been enamored with the product," Mr. Paulson said in an interview on Wednesday. "You have Mercedes in cars, and top brands in every other area. But no one has such a high share of the high end."
But while he got what he wanted within days of making his first offer, a bidding contest for Steinway broke out behind the scenes. In July, the private equity firm Kohlberg & Company said it had reached an agreement with Steinway to buy it for $35 a share. But Kohlberg bowed out of the running on Tuesday in the face of a bid from Paulson of $38 a share.
That same day, though, an additional challenger emerged - Samick Musical Instruments of South Korea, which is Steinway's biggest shareholder. Using the code name "Edelweiss," presumably in a reference to "The Sound of Music," Samick offered $39 a share.
But on Wednesday morning, Steinway, whose stock ticker symbol is LVB, for Ludwig van Beethoven, pronounced Mr. Paulson the winner after his firm had increased its bid to $40 a share.
"We're fortunate in this case that John is a personal fan of our product," Michael T. Sweeney, Steinway's chairman and chief executive, said on Wednesday. "His love for the instrument gives him the insight as to how we can build the business."
While the deal is done, there is still a chance that a higher bid may emerge, and Steinway is allowed to consider unsolicited offers.
In the world of music, Steinway is not just another company. Founded in 1853 by a German immigrant in Manhattan, Henry Engelhard Steinway, and his three sons, Steinway pianos became an icon in concert halls and living rooms. Steinway spends almost a year building each grand piano, and the result, its devotees say, is an unmatched quality of sound. The announcement in March that the company was selling its famous showroom on West 57th Street in Manhattan was greeted in many quarters with sorrow.
Still, the financial maneuvering left some of Steinway's devotees full of concern as they recalled difficult times in the past. With piano factories in Astoria, Queens, and Hamburg, Germany, the company was family-owned until 1972, when it was sold to the CBS Corporation, an owner that many aficionados believed sacrificed quality in pursuit of higher profits.
CBS cut costs, changed the management and pushed Steinway to produce more pianos, said Frank M. Mazurco, who started as a sales representative in Cincinnati and rose to become executive vice president of Steinway before he retired in 2007.
"We had to do a lot of damage control," Mr. Mazurco said. "It wasn't a good fit."
Leon Botstein, the musical director of the American Symphony Orchestra in New York and the president of Bard College, said the CBS period should be a "warning" to Mr. Paulson. Steinway was eventually sold in 1985 to investors in Boston, and, after changing hands again, it went public in 1996.
"Let's hope it's a hedge fund with some idealism, with interest in something more than the everlasting buck," Mr. Botstein said.
Mr. Paulson vowed to keep the business largely as it is. He indicated that he had no plans to close, relocate or change any of Steinway's manufacturing operations.
Instead, Mr. Paulson said his strategy centers on expanding Steinway's reach around the world. He is also betting that the improving economy and strengthening housing market will help the sales of Steinway pianos, a luxury item that proved to be out of reach in recent years, even for its usual wealthier clientele.
With the company's sales flagging in the aftermath of the recession, a team of executives offered in 2011 to buy everything but the piano business. But after reviewing its options - a period in which it fielded interest from two private equity firms - the company ultimately announced last December that it was not for sale.
Then, in July, Kohlberg made its offer to buy the entire company. That is when Mr. Paulson began to pursue Steinway in earnest. In the last several weeks, he read a book on the company to help bring himself up to speed.
One analyst, Arnold Ursaner of CJS Securities, said it was not surprising that Mr. Paulson - who donated $100 million to the Central Park Conservancy last year - was making a play for Steinway.
"You have a global luxury brand," Mr. Ursaner said. "It's no different from a painting or a magnificent Fifth Avenue apartment."
Today, Steinway has expanded beyond pianos to sell horns, clarinets, saxophones and drums. It so happens that that aspect of the business is right up Mr. Paulson's alley.
Though Mr. Paulson is not a pianist, he played the drums, clarinet and saxophone when he was a teenager and into his 20s, eventually setting them aside when he could not keep up the necessary commitment.
To Mr. Botstein, Mr. Paulson's musical background is a positive sign.
"He bought something with a huge moral responsibility," Mr. Botstein said. "It would be a tragedy if this were to be abused or exploited. It needs to be treated with love and with care."

HEADLINE: Wheelies: The Government Motors Edition

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: The federal government sold nearly $900 million worth of General Motors stock last month, and Chrysler will unveil a new performance pickup truck at the Woodward Dream Cruise in Detroit this weekend. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 The Government Motors label that detractors of General Motors have affixed to the automaker since the 2009 federal bailout has come a little closer to becoming an anachronism. According to a report from The Detroit News, the federal government divested itself of $877 million in G.M. stock last month. If all goes according to plan, the Treasury Department will be out of G.M. completely by early 2014. Based upon current share prices, The Detroit News estimates that the government still has 135 million shares to go. (The Detroit News) 
 Not to be outdone by competitors' muscle trucks, Chrysler will unveil a performance pickup truck concept at the Woodward Dream Cruise in Detroit this weekend. Automotive News surmises that it could be a modern day Power Wagon, but Chrysler remains tight-lipped about the truck. Ford is the only other manufacturer of full-size pickups to offer a performance model and will be showing off its two F-150 performance variants - the SVT Raptor and the new Tremor - at the Dream Cruise. Chrysler's truck would be its first performance pickup since the company ended production of the 510-horsepower V-10-equipped Ram SRT in 2006. (Automotive News)
 In other pickup-related news, electric and plug-in hybrid cars may help automakers sell pickups, where the real money is, according to a report from Bloomberg Businessweek. Pickups are big sellers, and the market for them has been booming. But increasingly stringent federal fuel economy standards means that the more fuel-thrifty E.V.'s and hybrids an automaker sells, the more inefficient trucks it can sell. By 2025, Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards imposed by the government will require a manufacturer's combined car and light truck fleets to achieve 54.5 miles per gallon, hence the deep price slashing on alternative fuel vehicles to spur sales. (Bloomberg Businessweek)
 Unsuccessful in their attempts to negotiate for higher pay and better benefits, Hyundai's workers in South Korea voted to strike Wednesday. A union spokesman said workers will determine the extent of the strike early next week. A strike could affect 46,000 workers at Hyundai; another 30,000 at its affiliate Kia are taking a similar action. The strike vote is the latest in a string of union problems the Korean automaker has faced over the last two years. According to a report from ABC News, Hyundai estimates it lost $1.5 billion in production because of walkouts in 2012. Hyundai said it offered to resume talks with the workers' union on Friday. (ABC News)
 Originally scheduled to lay dormant during the last week in August, the General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, will keep running in order to meet customer demand for the Chevrolet Cruze. G.M. said July sales of the compact car jumped 70 percent over the similar period last year, to 25,447 units. Compared with the first seven months of 2012, deliveries of the Cruze have grown 24 percent this year. (Automotive News)

HEADLINE: Baby-Sitter Robots and Population Growth

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The time costs of child care can influence decisions to have children, so machines &#8212; even robots &#8212; that can perform some child-rearing tasks could result in more births, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
Robots and other machines may someday transform child care without eliminating the human touch.
As any parent can attest, caring for young children is time-intensive. As a result, child care is one of the largest segments of , at least when the nonmarket household sector is included. 
Many parents treasure their children and feel the benefits outweigh the time and costs of having children. Many other adults decide not to have their own children, and the time costs are sometimes a factor in that decision. (To be sure, the influences are complex; a study by Satoshi Kanazawa of the London School of Economics, which suggests that women with higher IQs are less likely to have children, made waves in the blogosphere in recent days.)
The time costs of child care are also a factor limiting teenage pregnancy. Teenagers are encouraged to complete high school and higher levels of schooling, and students' parents, teachers and counselors - if not the teenagers themselves - understand that teenage motherhood takes time away from schoolwork and thereby makes academic success less likely.

The world would be very different if children did not need so much time. More people, perhaps especially teenagers, would have children if children did not require so much time and attention, especially from their mothers. People who already have children despite the cost might have more of them if they expected each child to require less time.
As the time costs of children limit population growth, the population would be likely to grow more rapidly if those costs were somehow reduced, whether you think that such growth is a good thing or a bad one.
If each child required less parental time, you might expect parents - especially mothers - to use their time on other things, like work more outside the home, pursue their own schooling or leisure activities. But it is possible that people would spend more of their lives caring for children and less time on those other things because they would be having more children.
Wealthy people have already had some of these opportunities, because they can afford numerous baby sitters, nurses and tutors. But technological progress may one day reduce child-care costs for the general population.
Because robots and other machines take on a number of tasks formerly done by people - even playing chess - and are expected to do others like drive cars, perhaps we should expect that robots will some day take care of children, too.
People today may believe that it would be inhuman or immoral to leave young children at home alone with a robot or to drop them off at a day care center staffed by machines. But economic and technological changes of the past have already transformed child-rearing attitudes and practices: take test tube babies, working mothers, screen time, fast food or children with their own telephones.
There is little need to worry that machines will take over all aspects of child rearing. People will always have a comparative advantage over machines, even if machines could in principle be better at just about anything. For the same economic reason that the world can produce more by assigning some tasks to unskilled people and other tasks to talented people, people will be doing tasks that are difficult for machines relative to other tasks.
But perhaps robots will make parenting easier and thus more popular.

HEADLINE: Social Security at 78

BYLINE: JARED BERNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: Social Security means the difference between sufficiency and poverty for a large share of the nation&#8217;s elderly, and it is important to find ways to bolster it, not retreat, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Jared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington and a former chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
Leave it to my estimable colleague at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Kathy Ruffing, to remind everyone that today is Social Security's 78th birthday. As she points out, and as can be seen in the chart below:
"This highly successful program pays benefits to 57 million Americans. It's the single most important source of income for its elderly beneficiaries, contributing on average two-thirds of income for recipients over age 65. For more than one-third of them, Social Security constitutes 90 percent or more of income." 
As the chart shows, Social Security is especially important to the minority elderly.
Moreover, absent Social Security benefits, 44 percent of the elderly would be poor. But when you factor in the program, their poverty rate falls to 9 percent. 
Speaking of milestones, next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the war on poverty, a set of anti-poverty initiatives including expanded Social Security benefits aimed at the poor elderly. So when you hear people like Representative Paul Ryan going on about how we've lost that war, please remember these numbers (and many others I'll be writing about in weeks to come). 
Clearly, this 78-year-old is playing a critically important role in maintaining some degree of retirement security for our economically vulnerable elderly. Social Security's finances are not nearly the basket case that opponents claim. 
As Ms. Ruffing notes:
"Social Security faces a long-term shortfall that's predictable and manageable. Those who fear that Social Security won't be around when today's young workers retire misunderstand the trustees' projections. Even if policy makers did nothing, the program could still pay three-quarters of scheduled benefits after the trust funds run out in 2033."
The menu of measures that would achieve solvency for the program are well known. I've gone through them myself. They involve increasing the revenues that flow to the program, by, for example, raising the salary cap on taxable benefits to offset the fact that the growth of earnings inequality has lifted a larger share of national earnings (about 6 percent) above the current taxable cap of about $114,000. Other fixes could involve reducing the benefits of high-income beneficiaries.
But what we must avoid is fixing Social Security by breaking it, i.e., by reducing the retirement security it provides to those who need it most, and as Ms. Ruffing's numbers above reveal, that's not some fringe group of poor elderly. That's a majority of its recipients.
If anything, I agree with the economist Brad DeLong, who wrote recently that in the face of increasingly insufficient private pensions and savings, along with the wage and income trends that have left large swaths of aging people less economically prepared for retirement, we should be considering expanding the program, not shrinking it.
Far too often, when I hear politicians and conservative advocates talking about Social Security in particular and social insurance in general, they inevitably talk about making "the hard choices" - by which they generally mean privatizing, voucherizing, or otherwise removing the critical insurance component of Social Security or Medicare. Such proposals, as in the House Republicans' budget, are usually coupled with large tax cuts favoring the wealthiest among us.
But that is anything but a "hard choice" for the beneficiaries of those tax cuts and the politicians they support. For them, these are shamefully easy choices.
That doesn't mean we can have all the social insurance we want without paying for it. But the "hard" message is not the one that purports to cut taxes and social benefits. It's the one that says, "Here's what we need to achieve retirement security for the vulnerable elderly, and here's what it will cost us." It's the one saying that based on both demography and inequality, we're going to need to strengthen these programs.
So happy birthday, Social Security. We don't just wish you many more happy returns. We're going to keep fighting to ensure that outcome.

HEADLINE: Made With You in Mind

BYLINE: By SHIVANI VORA

 BODY:
Temple St. Clair, a NoHo jewelry designer, has built her reputation on ready-made yellow gold amulets, which usually cost from $2,000 to $10,000 at places like Saks and Bloomingdale's.
But when she acquired a 10-carat Burmese sapphire earlier this year on a buying trip to Asia, she knew just the client who would want to commission her to transform the rare stone into something unique. It was a woman in her 40s living in TriBeCa who already owned many of Ms. St. Clair's signature pendants, and had a generous husband who wanted to buy her a gift to mark their 20th wedding anniversary.
After several weeks of discussion with the couple, which involved sending multiple sketches and three-dimensional molds, Ms. St. Clair created a ring for a fee, she said, of approximately $350,000. ''I have always been focused on finished pieces, but personalization is a natural evolution of my brand,'' she said. 
Ms. St. Clair is one of several fine-jewelry designers based in New York, including Kara Ross, Amrita Singh and Ippolita Rostagno, who are increasingly making pieces to order. This is after years of doing well among the fashionable set with relatively lower-priced off-the-rack items, along the lines of the Van Cleef & Arpels Alhambra motif, like Ms. Clair's amulets, stacking bangles (Ms. Rostagno), Indian-inspired bracelets (Ms. Singh) or statement cuffs (Ms. Ross).
So-called bespoke pieces (the term started in men's wear but has spread, like ''curate,'' to everything from bicycles to software) are standard among certain luxury jewelers likes Leviev or Graff, but aren't usually the norm for mid- to high-priced jewelry companies such as Ms. St. Clair's, according to Milton Pedraza, chief executive of the Luxury Institute, a research and consulting firm in New York.
But in a bid to attract a more high-end clientele, meet increased demand from existing customers and burnish their brands, these designers say they are increasingly spending weeks or months working with buyers to come up with pieces especially for them, with (in theory) more longevity than couture clothing.
The new interest in customization comes after a drop in spending on jewelry after the 2008 recession. According to data from Mintel, a research firm based in Chicago, sales of watches and jewelry declined 8 percent from 2008 to 2009.
Ms. Singh and Ms. Ross, who started selling their collections at Bergdorf Goodman about a decade ago, said that sales of their regular lines decreased dramatically during that period. ''I was down 75 percent,'' said Ms. Singh, who developed a reputation for Rajasthani-style works made in Jaipur, India.
''The world was collapsing, and the price of gold was astronomical, and people just weren't buying jewelry,'' said Ms. Ross, known for oversize pieces made from materials like hand-carved rock crystal quartz, ebony and volcanic rock.
Though they kept designing fine jewelry, the women said, their main focus became their costume lines, with considerable success. Ms. Singh's Bangle Bangle line, with pieces between $50 and $400, sold more than a half-million units last year, including on QVC, she said, and Ms. Ross's Kara by Kara Ross, which ranges from $100 to $300, is carried by nearly 70 stores, including Neiman Marcus.
There are now signs that the jewelry industry is rebounding somewhat; Mintel research shows that total retail sales of watches and jewelry grew almost 8 percent from 2010 to 2011, and the company predicts growth of 13 percent between 2012 and 2017, to reach $80.6 billion.
But Mr. Pedraza said that most of the improvement is on the higher end of the spectrum. ''The jewelry brands that are doing extremely well today are top-tier names like Cartier,'' he said, ''and the ones a level down can position themselves as more high-end through bespoke work.''
The designers say that the greater sums such pieces command reflect not just the uniqueness of the materials, but the considerable time (and sometimes airfare) that goes into putting them together.
Ms. Singh's custom items, for example, take at least six months because she finds all her stones in Jaipur and doesn't start searching for them until she is hired for a specific project. ''It can take months just to get the right gems,'' she said.
Ms. Ross said that she spends the majority of the time involved communicating with the women she is designing for. ''You have to go through a process where you become really intimate with your client, because you're trying to tap into what they want from something that is very personal to them,'' she said.
One such experience was with Regina Scully, 50, who runs a public relations and brand marketing firm in Midtown. Ms. Ross designed an oversized maple wood link necklace for her with a heart pendant and gold accents that cost $15,000.
''I was dating my now-husband, and it was a period in my life when I was falling wildly in love, so I wanted a very romantic piece of jewelry,'' Ms. Scully said.
Ms. Ross started by sending her a sketch with dimensions; Ms. Scully said she wanted a bigger heart. After the second drawing, she wanted a longer chain, and on the final, she asked for more gold on the centerpiece.
''I was trying to capture my emotion in this piece of jewelry, and every time I wear that necklace, I remember that really special time,'' Ms. Scully said.
She has since hired Ms. Ross for 10 additional custom pieces and says they have a different level of sentiment for her compared with ready-made ones, because they are connected to specific memories.
A memory is also what Dr. Erin Gilbert, a dermatologist who practices in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, wanted to capture when she hired Ms. Rostagno of Ippolita to create a wavy gold pendant for her with the engraving ''Welcome to the Club'' for her recent 40th birthday. It cost $1,000, less than much of Ippolita's ready-to-wear stock, and ''the piece has such a significance because it relates to a milestone moment in my life and is not like all the generic jewelry out there,'' she said.
Dr. Gilbert is among the 30 or so women for whom Ms. Rostagno has designed personalized pieces within the last year. To her friends and family, she has offered ''body imprinting'': sheets of wax draped on a part of the client's figure and then cast in metals, like a sterling silver ring she recently made modeled to someone's knuckle. The service will soon be offered to the public, with prices upon request (industry code for ''if you have to ask, you probably can't afford it'').
Despite the generally higher prices of custom work, the designers all say that their ready-to-wear collections bring in far more revenue, but the clamor for personalization has proved irresistible. ''My intent when I started my line wasn't to do custom work, but my clients are asking for it more and more,'' Ms. Ross said. And if a client isn't happy with the finished product? This is almost as rare an occurrence as a Burmese sapphire, the designers said.
''You're spending so much time with your customers throughout the process, and they are heavily involved,'' Ms. St. Clair said. ''In the end, they're usually thrilled to get a piece of jewelry that no one else in the world has.''

HEADLINE: Justice Dept. Alters View Of Mergers By Airlines

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
A day after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to block the merger of American Airlines and US Airways, regulators and industry officials continued to wrestle with a central question: What is the best way to protect consumers?
To the Justice Department, a merger between American and US Airways would increase the fares and fees that have been steadily rising.
But to the airlines, the merger would lower costs and provide more flexibility for many travelers. What is more, some industry analysts said that a hobbled American, which is still trying to emerge from bankruptcy protection, would struggle to compete against the two giants, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines. 
''What we are saying today is simply that they got this one wrong,'' Richard Parker, a lawyer for US Airways, told reporters on Wednesday.
The Justice Department's action comes after a decade of rapid consolidation in the airline industry, including the mergers of Delta and Northwest in 2008 and United and Continental in 2010. But antitrust officials said on Tuesday that despite the cost savings for the carriers from consolidation, domestic airfares, on average, had increased much faster than inflation over the last several years, prompting the department to revise its thinking about what was best for the consumer.
The Transportation Department has calculated that after adjusting for inflation, the average domestic airfare climbed to $379 in the first quarter of 2013 from $335 during the recession in 2009. And the fares varied greatly, often depending on the level of competition. For example, passengers in Huntsville, Ala., paid the highest fare, $543, in the first quarter while Atlantic City had the lowest, $169.
''I think the economics of the Justice Department is correct,'' said George Hoffer, a transportation economics professor at the University of Richmond. ''However, they are a day late and a dollar short. This should have been their decision in the Delta-Northwest case.''
But Mr. Hoffer said the airlines could prevail in court because the earlier mergers created ''a structural disequilibrium'' in the industry, with United and Delta having more flexibility to reroute passengers, especially lucrative corporate customers, when trouble arises.
Another issue is American's ability to compete as a stand-alone airline. The Justice Department's Antitrust Division argued that American could come out of bankruptcy as a strong competitor without the merger. It pointed to American's order of 460 new airplanes over the next decade, worth $38 billion and billed as the largest single order in history, as well as its recent return to profitability.
But some financial and aviation analysts see it differently. American's domestic network and hubs are considered weaker than Delta's or United's, and its international network is smaller. The airline is also part of Oneworld, the smallest of the three global airline alliances. American, which is owned by A.M.R., cut its costs through bankruptcy, but it did little to bridge the gap in revenues with its peers, which can command higher fares and attract more business travelers.
''Apparently, the Justice Department takes the position not held by most analysts, who viewed A.M.R.'s proposed stand-alone plan as unlikely to be competitive or to succeed,'' said Robert W. Mann, an aviation consultant.
If the merger is blocked, the clear winners will be United and Delta, which have global ambitions, some analysts say. A smaller American will struggle to attract business travelers with its smaller domestic network and smaller international footprint.
John Godyn, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley Research, wrote in a note to investors that Delta and United ''would have a duopoly on corporate travel, superior networks and more valuable frequent flier programs.''
Professor Hoffer, however, said that American had done enough cost-cutting in recent years to hold on to its spot as the nation's fourth-largest carrier. ''Because the industry is more concentrated, it would be easier for American to raise capital and grow itself,'' he said.
If US Airways and American prevail and the merger goes forward, they will most likely have to make significant concessions to the Justice Department -- perhaps agree to carve out some routes, sell landing rights at Washington's Reagan National Airport, or keep a low-fare program for a period of time. Antitrust officials and the airlines' lawyers suggested they were not interested in a deal, though they would have ample opportunity to talk as they moved toward a trial, possibly by the end of the year.
Southwest, which merged with AirTran in 2011, is the nation's third-largest airline. The combination of American and US Airways, the fifth-largest airline, would create the world's largest.
One crucial factor in analyzing the deal is US Airways' current role as a something of a spoiler. Because it operates out of smaller hubs than its competitors, it often offers sharply lower fares for last-minute passengers willing to make a connection rather than fly nonstop.
The Justice Department argues that the merger with American would prompt US Airways to shift more travelers to higher-priced flights at American's larger hubs. But the airlines argue that if the merger goes through, they would offer more flights each day at many airports and could negotiate better for business from big corporations that now favor United and Delta.
The combination of American and US Airways had gained the backing of American's creditors, a federal bankruptcy judge, and the unions representing the airline's pilots, flight attendants and mechanics.
Ironically, the Justice Department has endorsed the strategy initially championed by American's own executives, when they filed for court protection in November 2011. American's chairman, Tom Horton, said at the time that American would emerge as a stronger independent airline. The expectation after that was that Mr. Horton would pursue an acquisition on his own terms, most probably with US Airways.
That provided an opening for Doug Parker, the chief executive of US Airways. By advocating for a quick merger of the carriers, while American was still in bankruptcy, he managed to outmaneuver Mr. Horton, with the support of American's three labor groups.

HEADLINE: Old Economies Rise as Emerging Markets' Growth Falters

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER; Dan Horch contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The balance of world economic growth is tipping in another direction. Just as economists have begun lowering their forecasts for China and many other developing economies, the American economy is bouncing back. Japan appears to have turned a corner and is ending almost two decades of grinding deflation. Economic data out of Europe on Wednesday provided the first solid indication that many countries in the euro zone may be escaping the clutches of recession.
The gross domestic product of the 17-nation euro zone grew at an annualized rate of about 1.2 percent in the second quarter. It is certainly not clear, based on only three months of data, that Europe's recession has ended. But it is further evidence that the older engines of growth are revving into gear as the most recent sources of growth have been slowing down.
''The general proposition for much of the last generation has been that emerging markets grow faster. That's what's changed,'' said Neal Soss, the chief economist at Credit Suisse. 
''The acceleration such as it is happening is in the first-world economy rather than the emerging markets.''
The growth of the BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- has raised living standards in those nations and in others in Southeast Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. Those four nations had an even broader global impact by also providing new markets for American products while its citizens made the electronics and other products wanted by consumers in the United States and other developed economies.
So a decline in their growth rate should be worrisome to the United States. But Jim O'Neill, the Goldman Sachs economist who coined the term BRIC more than a decade ago, thinks one of the new beneficiaries of the shift in the global economy is most likely to be the United States. ''I find myself thinking the U.S. is going to be one of the biggest winners,'' said Mr. O'Neill.
It could gain from the Chinese government's stated intention to shift from big government investment projects to a more consumer-driven economy. That could create demand for American products, while making commodities cheaper for American companies. Rising wages in China could also encourage manufacturing in the United States.
There were signs in recent trade statistics that this shift may already be under way. Exports from the United States to China grew in June while imports from China declined. The overall United States trade deficit dropped to its lowest level since 2009. China's newfound restraint is at the fulcrum of the shift. Its government is trying to temper the economy, the largest among the developing nations. In doing so, it shoulders much of the blame for the slowdown elsewhere in Asia and in Latin America. The price of commodities like iron and copper, which previously buoyed the developing countries producing them, are now sinking as Chinese leaders are reining in the grand developments that needed metals.
Brazil was growing largely because of commodities like iron ore and soybeans, which it was exporting to China. Two years ago, the Brazilian economy grew 7.6 percent. This year, however, economists predict the number will be around 2.3 percent.
''After years of strong growth, many Brazilians grew optimistic, but for many people who improved their lot, there is now a sense that their potential to rise further is limited,'' said Samuel Pessoa, a researcher with the Brazilian Institute of Economics at the Fundação Getúlio Vargas, an elite university in Rio de Janeiro. ''People are worried.''
There is little prospect that the BRIC economies will ever return to the roaring growth that had come to seem normal.
''Many superficial observers just assumed that the BRIC countries would keep growing at the rate they did in the first decade, which was very unlikely,'' said Mr. O'Neill, who recently retired from Goldman.
Mr. O'Neill said that as China moved to a more consumer-based economy, ''the winners and losers of the new China are probably going to be quite different than the winners and losers of the old China.''
Even the most optimistic forecasts do not see the United States or Europe reaching the double-digit levels of growth that China and India have enjoyed over the last decade. Analysts are expecting that growth in the United States will rise from less than 2 percent this year to nearly 3 percent next year. Because the developed economies still account for nearly 60 percent of the global economy, even a slower pace of growth can provide more economic activity than faster growth in the developing world. There are fears that even the lackluster recovery in United States, Japan and Europe could be derailed if China's problems grow significantly worse. Some economists in China are warning that Communist Party leaders may not be able to smoothly wean the country off years of government-fueled development.
For emerging economies, analysts say that the current cooling of growth is taking some of the countries to a more sustainable pace of expansion after years of acceleration that some considered unhealthy. In China, the 14.2 percent expansion seen before the peak in 2007 is not likely to be reached again, though the expected growth of 7.5 percent next year is still impressive.
''Even though it's slowed down some, there is still a big opportunity,'' said Barry P. Bosworth, a China expert at the Brookings Institution.
Brazil and India have deeper problems. India has not been hurt by falling commodity prices, but the economy has been constrained by corruption and inefficiency. The value of the Indian rupee fell recently to a record low against the dollar.
In Brazil, many economists say the declining value of the country's iron ore and soybeans has revealed that Brazil's leaders failed to invest in infrastructure when the money was pouring in.
Silvésio de Oliveira, a soybean farmer in the midwestern state of Mato Grosso and a vice president of his state soy and corn farmers' association, said years of insufficient investment in highways and ports finally caused a crisis this year.
Mr. Oliveira said an ''infrastructure collapse'' drove up freight costs and led several big foreign purchasers, tired of waiting for deliveries that never came, to cancel their orders.
Carlos Langoni, a former governor of Brazil's central bank, said that infrastructure had become a significant constraint on growth. But he also noted that some of the country's problems are similar to those in other developing economies.
''Expectations were too high,'' said Mr. Langoni, who is now the director of the Global Economics Center at the Fundação Getúlio Vargas. ''The new emerging countries are no different from the old ones: once you reach a certain income level, it becomes harder to grow.''

HEADLINE: Cisco Plans to Cut 4,000 Jobs, as It Posts Profit Gain

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM; Ashwin Seshagiri contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Cisco Systems, the technology industry's biggest computer infrastructure equipment maker, said on Wednesday that it planned to cut 4,000 jobs, or roughly 5 percent of its work force, in an effort to trim costs and reorganize during what executives described as a ''challenging'' global economic climate. 
The cuts were announced even as Cisco, which sells networking software and services and videoconferencing systems, reported better-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year.
John Chambers, the company's chief executive, said that despite the promising figures, the company still faced significant challenges in the coming months.
In a conference call on Wednesday with investors and analysts, he said that Cisco needed to improve its ability to react quickly to market changes.
''We've got to take out middle-level management,'' he said. ''What I'm really after is not speed of decisions but speed of implementation.'' He said that the company's performance had improved over the last year, but that ''it's just been slow.''
Cisco reported that it earned $2.27 billion, or 42 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, up from $1.92 billion, or 36 cents a share, during the previous year. Revenue rose 6 percent, to $12.42 billion, from $11.69 billion. Analysts had expected the company to report revenues of $12.41 billion. Sales in the United States were strong, but international sales were a concern.
Cisco's forecast for the current quarter was lower than what analysts had predicted. The company said it expected revenue to increase by no more than 5 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts had expected a gain of 7 percent.
The news sent Cisco's shares tumbling almost 10 percent to $23.87 in after-hours trading. Shares of rival companies like Juniper Networks also fell.
Cisco is considered one of the crucial indicators of the technology industry's health because of its dominant share of the routers that connect data centers. But in recent years that market's growth has cooled, and Cisco has not improved sales in other categories, like cloud-computing services, to compensate.
Amitabh Passi, an analyst at UBS, said Mr. Chambers, who has a reputation for cutting aggressively in the face of a worsening economy, surprised him with the size of the cuts, but he did not take them as a sign of significant problems at Cisco, which is based in San Jose, Calif.
Cisco was one of the first companies to aggressively cut costs at the end of the dot-com boom, a move some say allowed the company to rebound more quickly when the economy improved.
Given Cisco's dominant position and Mr. Chambers's reputation for spotting trouble early, Mr. Passi said the news was likely to be interpreted as a bad sign for the entire industry.
''The gas will come out of the tank tomorrow,'' he said. ''This is going to permeate across the tech sector.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt in U.S. Fell by 0.7% Last Quarter

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Americans trimmed their overall indebtedness in the latest quarter, continuing a nearly five-year trend as mortgage balances fell further, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed on Wednesday. 
Total consumer debt stood at $11.15 trillion in the second quarter, down 0.7 percent from the previous quarter, the New York Fed said in its quarterly household debt and credit report.
While student debt and auto loans rose, the country's postrecession deleveraging cycle appeared intact as household delinquency rates dropped to 7.6 percent in the three months to June, from 8.1 percent in the first quarter of the year.
Americans have consistently deleveraged in the years since the housing collapse and financial crisis, and credit is now well below the peak of $12.68 trillion in the third quarter of 2008.
The Fed bank acknowledged the overall trend but highlighted a $20 billion increase in auto loan balances, the ninth consecutive quarterly rise, reflecting a rebound in a crucial sector of the American economy. Loan originations in this area reached $92 billion, the highest level since 2007.
''Although overall debt declined in the second quarter, households did increase nonhousing debt, led by rising auto loan balances,'' Andrew Haughwout, a New York Fed research economist, said in a statement. ''Households improved their overall delinquency rates for the seventh straight quarter, an encouraging sign going forward.''
Reflecting another national trend, student debt rose again, with outstanding balances up $8 billion to $994 billion in the second quarter. Still, student loan delinquency rates improved with 10.9 percent of loans behind by 90 days or more, down from 11.2 percent in the first quarter.
The report also showed outstanding mortgage balances fell by $91 billion to $7.84 trillion, while 1.5 percent of existing mortgages fell into delinquency. Mortgages are by far the largest segment of consumer debt.
Lenders made more mortgages, with originations rising to $589 billion.
Elsewhere, credit card balances edged up by $8 billion, while the number of credit account inquiries over six months, an indicator of consumer credit demand, was flat at 159 million.

HEADLINE: With Energy Costs Lower, Producer Prices Were Flat in July, Evidence of Little Inflation

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Producer prices were flat in July, providing further evidence of very little inflationary pressure in the economy.
The Labor Department reported on Wednesday that a drop in natural gas and gasoline costs left its seasonally adjusted producer price index unchanged for the month. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 0.3 percent increase. 
But the very slight increase in the producer price index outside of the volatile energy and food sector components is likely to attract attention at the Federal Reserve, which has recently noted the risks to the economy from inflation that is too low.
The so-called core producer prices, which are seen as indicators of trends in inflation, rose just 0.1 percent during the month, below the 0.2 percent gain expected by analysts.
Inflation has been trending lower for much of the last year despite signs of growing strength in the economy and the Fed warned last month that low inflation could hurt the economy.
The data on Wednesday showed that the core index was up 1.2 percent in the 12 months through July, the lowest reading since November 2010. Analysts had expected a 1.4 percent annualized increase, down from 1.7 percent in June.
The Fed is concerned about low inflation because it can encourage businesses and consumers to put off purchases in anticipation of lower prices. This undermines the Fed's efforts to increase consumption by lowering borrowing costs.
Policy makers are also concerned about extremely low inflation because it raises the risk that a major shock to the economy could send prices and wages into a downward spiral known as deflation. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, pointed out this risk in July.
But Mr. Bernanke has argued that temporary factors could be behind some of the low inflation and many private sector economists agree.
A steady decline in the unemployment rate appears to have the Fed nearly ready to begin winding down its economic stimulus program, which has kept interest rates historically low. The Fed has been buying $85 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities each month.
A number of economists expect the Fed to begin reducing its monthly bond purchases in September. This has led to an increase in interest rates for home mortgages.

HEADLINE: Recession Ends in the Euro Zone, But Vigor of a Recovery Is Questioned

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY and ALISON SMALE; David Jolly reported from Paris, and Alison Smale from Berlin. Alissa J. Rubin and Scott Sayare contributed reporting from Paris, and Gaia Pianigiani from Siena, Italy.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Bolstered by stronger consumption and investment in Germany as well as growth in France, Europe broke out of recession in the second quarter, ending its longest postwar contraction, official data showed on Wednesday. But the weak upturn, high unemployment and other problems on the Continent left open the question of whether the nascent recovery can last.
The two biggest economies in the 17-nation euro zone each helped pull the region as a whole out of its doldrums, with Germany posting 2.8 percent annualized growth in the second quarter and France 2.0 percent. Over all, gross domestic product in the zone grew 1.2 percent, according to Eurostat, the official statistics office of the European Union. The second quarter's growth slightly exceeded the 0.8 percent growth forecast by economists.
The euro zone's growth fell short of the 1.7 percent second-quarter showing by the United States and 2.6 percent in Japan. 
But even modest growth is a relief in a region where unemployment has risen to 12.1 percent and there are still fears of a new debt crisis and existential questions about the euro.
The meager growth rate will not make a serious dent in the problems of the 26 million people Eurostat says cannot find work, said Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
''I wouldn't look for a significant reduction in unemployment in the next year,'' he said. ''At best, we can hope for a stabilization of the job market.''
The fact that households in Germany and France helped to drive the rebound ''suggests that the recent period of relative calmness in the euro zone is encouraging core consumers to spend money and might raise hopes of a narrowing of the economic imbalances within the currency union,'' said Jonathan Loynes, an economist in London with Capital Economics.
A surprisingly strong showing came from Portugal, where the economy grew 4.4 percent in the second quarter, the highest rate in the 28-nation European Union. The return to growth after two years of deep recession was hailed by the center-right government in Lisbon as proof that austerity policies, imposed in return for a bailout of 78 billion euros ($104 billion) negotiated in May 2011, were finally bearing fruit.
Besides Portugal, there were signs of life elsewhere in the battered ''periphery'' of the euro zone. Spain's economy shrank by 0.4 percent, improving on a 2.0 percent slide in the first quarter.
The economy of Cyprus, still reeling from the collapse of its banks and the troika's remedy, shrank 5.6 percent at an annualized rate, the worst showing of any union member but a modest improvement from its 6.8 percent first-quarter decline. Even the hapless Greek economy, which has suffered 20 consecutive quarters of decline, got a small glimmer of hope with signs that the pace of contraction is slowing.
Economists say that cleaning up bad loans at Europe's banks and getting them to lend again would help the economy gain firmer footing. Politicians are not expected to act until after Germany's elections. The European Central Bank said last month that it would seek to encourage lending to Southern Europe by making it easier for banks to use certain securities as collateral.
Still, Mr. Loynes wrote, the weaker European economies ''remain a very long way from the rates of expansion required to address their deep-seated problems of mass unemployment and cripplingly high debt.''
''The recession may be over,'' he added, ''but the debt crisis is decidedly not.'''
In the August vacation season, with much of Europe preparing for a long holiday weekend, politicians were generally muted in their reaction to the G.D.P. report. Officials said that there was no reason for complacency, but added that they saw some chance at longer-term growth.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who is seeking a third term in Sept. 22 elections, had no immediate comment. But her economics minister, Philipp Rösler, wasted no time in proclaiming that ''there is every reason for people in Germany to look optimistically into the future.'' Ms. Merkel has been the main proponent of structural reform in the weaker economies of Southern Europe. But neither economists nor politicians used Wednesday's figures to proclaim a victory for pro- or anti-austerity camps.
''It's a very good sign that we are not declining into a longer recession,'' said Jürgen Matthes, senior economist at the Cologne Institute for Economic Research. But, he added, ''We can only really say what is successful when the numbers prove it.''
As for an election benefit for Ms. Merkel, he noted: '' 'It's the economy, stupid' holds true everywhere. These numbers are not a decisive factor -- but they help.''
Germany's federal statistics office and several analysts attributed the boom in Germany to stronger consumption, investment and activity in the construction industry after a severe winter. From January through the end of March, the euro zone economy over all contracted 1.2 percent, according to Eurostat.
Investor reaction to the G.D.P. figures was understated in Europe, where stocks and the euro barely budged.
The expansion of the region's economy had been foreshadowed by recent indicators showing that factories have been increasing output and consumers and businesses were gaining confidence.
''You can see that things have gotten better in Europe because foreigners are coming and spending more money,'' said Irene Sassi, an assistant in a souvenir store in downtown Siena, Italy. ''But Italians are still coming in smaller numbers than they used to, and they buy food and drinks, not contrada flags or scarves. In our pockets, the situation has not improved recently, that I can tell you.''
France, whose economy declined in the two previous quarters, saw household spending grow and companies increase exports of goods and services, though investment declined slightly.
The French government was quick to welcome the news and to take credit for the stronger-than-expected growth, which came after several less optimistic economic assessments from both the International Monetary Fund and Insee, the French statistics agency.
President François Hollande refrained from making a statement, but both his finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, and his prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, were quick to interpret the growth in G.D.P. as an endorsement of the government's strategy to bring down the deficit, which was 4.8 percent of G.D.P. last year, to meet the European Union target of 3 percent. The strategy has included raising taxes and a labor deal aimed at encouraging employment.
Mr. Moscovici said in a statement that the growth ''results at once from an improvement in the European economic context and from a firming up of interior demand.''
Mr. Moscovici, who just days ago predicted that there would be no growth this year, sounded pleasantly surprised, noting that the volume of French exports had increased 2 percent and that consumer spending rose 0.4 percent. Opposition politicians said they were pleased to see growth, but warned against reading too much into the number. ''I see this number as a technical correction that does not erase the general sluggishness of the French economy,'' said Luc Chatel, a member of the French Parliament and a former government minister from the center-right Union for a Popular Movement party.
Economists were more cautious, arguing that structural changes are needed in France for a lasting economic turnaround. The government is considering changes in the pension program as well as other measures to encourage job creation, but has not yet taken the steps needed to enact them, they said.
''We don't know if this kind of recovery from quarter to quarter will last,'' said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, an economics professor at the Institute of Political Studies at the Sorbonne, adding that since he had seen no new ''engine of growth''' the improvement was surprising.
''I don't yet see any strong policies at work to get out of the present situation,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Chance to Own a Home For $1 in a City on the Ropes

BYLINE: By STEVEN YACCINO

 BODY:
GARY, Ind. -- As a tower of black smoke rose above this blighted city last week, a group of neighbors huddled across the street from a burning house, trying to guess which other vacant properties on their block would be arsonists' next target.
''There's so many,'' said Tasha McMiller, 50, a resident dismayed by the estimated 10,000 abandoned homes here. ''They're a burden.'' 
Officials say that a third of the houses in Gary are unoccupied, hollowed dwellings spread across a city that, like other former industrial powerhouses, has lost more than half its population in the last half-century.
While some of those homes will be demolished, Gary is exploring a more affordable way to lift its haggard tax base and reduce the excess of empty structures: sell them for $1.
The program, announced in June, will offer Gary residents a chance to pay less for a house than for their morning coffee, as long as they meet a minimum income threshold (starting at $35,250 for one person) and demonstrate the financial ability to bring the neglected property up to code within six months. Those selected would have to live in the home for five years before receiving full ownership.
Nearly 400 people picked up applications on the first day they were available. After an extensive preselection process, the city will choose 12 out of 25 finalists in a lottery next month.
''My target would be to sell 50 houses a year,'' Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson said. ''We're getting these people to contribute as taxpayers. They can be part of the group that moves out, or they can be part of the group that invests.''
Efforts to revive distressed postindustrial cities across the country are being watched closely since last month when Detroit became the largest American municipality to file for bankruptcy. Indiana is one of 21 states that does not allow its cities to file for bankruptcy protection, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. While Gary does not carry the same debt load that led the Motor City into bankruptcy court -- officials say its liabilities are around $8.4 million compared with Detroit's estimated $18 billion -- the decline of both manufacturing hubs are strikingly similar.
Just 30 minutes from downtown Chicago, Gary was once a vibrant steel town with close to 180,000 residents in the 1960s. It is now home to less than 80,000 people and battered by decades of industry layoffs and racial friction that caused waves of suburban flight, shrinking city coffers drastically.
Gary, which is 85 percent black, has since wrestled with high rates of unemployment, crime and fleeing businesses, as well as fewer resources to invest into 50 square miles of infrastructure that continues to decay. The city department that handles road repair, snow removal and other public maintenance has reduced its staff to 17 employees from 100 employees in 2006.
A graduate of Harvard Law School and former attorney general of Indiana, Ms. Freeman-Wilson is seen as taking a different approach to saving Gary, coming on the heels of her recent predecessors, whose plans for urban revival hinged primarily on blockbuster projects like building an independent league baseball stadium and hosting Miss USA beauty pageants. A proposed museum dedicated to Michael Jackson, who grew up here, has yet to become more than a pipe dream.
Ms. Freeman-Wilson has some big projects, too. She has invested heavily in the city's airport to attract more commercial and freight traffic. But other initiatives, like the $1 housing program, have also put a strong emphasis on smaller neighborhood stabilization projects that she hopes will slowly increase property values and local ownership in the city's future.
''It's not flashy,'' S. Paul O'Hara, a historian and author of ''Gary: The Most American of All American Cities,'' said about the so-called Dollar Home program. ''It doesn't come with promises, but it does come with possibilities.''
The effort was modeled after a similar program by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development that sells foreclosed homes to local governments. Not all of those were resold to residents, but Mayor Freeman-Wilson did get her first home as a result of that program decades ago for $1.
Critics say Gary's problems are too great for the approach to make a noticeable dent. Many of the people who could afford to fix up a dilapidated home have already left the city, said Maurice Eisenstein, a political scientist at Purdue University Calumet. ''Nobody wants to live there.''
Felicia Goodman does. A lifelong Gary resident, Ms. Goodman, 50, has rented the same two-bedroom apartment in the city for 13 years and only seriously considered buying a home when she heard about the Dollar Home program, which she applied for last month.
She said her brother and his son have been living with her since an injury left him unemployed two years ago. He owes around $35,000 in medical bills, which Ms. Goodman wants to help him pay with the money she would save by buying a $1 house.
''You have no mortgage,'' she said. ''All you to do is pay the taxes, utilities. It's the American dream.''

HEADLINE: How to Really End Mass Incarceration

BYLINE: By VANITA GUPTA. 
Vanita Gupta is a deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- IN 2003, I represented dozens of African-American residents in Tulia, Tex., who had been convicted after a botched drug sting. Jason Jerome Williams, a 22-year-old with no prior criminal record, had been sentenced to 45 years in prison for four sales of an eighth of an ounce of cocaine. Freddie Brookins Jr., 25, had received 20 years for a first-time offense of selling less than four grams of cocaine. Joe Moore, a 56-year-old hog farmer, had gotten 90 years for two cocaine sales totaling under five grams. Others accepted plea deals to try to avoid such lengthy prison terms.
The convictions, in 1999 and 2000, were based on the flawed testimony of an undercover officer. The prosecution offered no physical evidence of marked bills, weapons, narcotics or drug paraphernalia -- things you would expect to find in a sophisticated drug ring. 
It took years of advocacy by many lawyers to win their release, but this hard-fought vindication was just a flash in the pan. Starting in the 1970s, a domestic ''war on crime'' dominated by antidrug policies and racial profiling fueled a prison-building binge that is morally -- and now financially -- bankrupt. Both political parties embraced draconian policies like mandatory minimum sentences, three-strikes laws and wide disparities in sentences for possession of crack versus powder cocaine. The result: by 2003, the United States had 4.6 percent of the world's population but 22.4 percent of its prison population -- even though violent crime started dropping in the 1990s. Prospects for reform looked bleak.
So I was elated when Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced on Monday that the government would commit to reducing the bloated prison population. This is without precedent: the nation's top law enforcement official directed all federal prosecutors to exercise their discretion toward ending the relentless warehousing of inmates -- the vast majority of whom are minorities -- in federal prison for low-level drug crimes.
But the immediate impact will be very limited at best. First, federal inmates accounted for just 14 percent of the nation's 1.6 million prisoners last year. Second, Mr. Holder has limited authority to enact permanent reforms without Congressional action. Third, it's unclear how federal prosecutors will enforce his plan. To maximize its impact, the Justice Department needs to track implementation by the 93 United States attorneys around the country and hold them accountable for enforcing the policy.
For lasting national impact we need to look at the states, where most criminal defendants are sentenced. Over the past few years, a quiet revolution has been brewing in state capitals. Historically low crime rates and shrinking state coffers have led to a nascent consensus among lawmakers and advocates across the ideological spectrum that our addiction to incarceration is not sustainable, effective or humane. Republican governors in cash-strapped states have been among those leading the charge. States as varied as Texas, New York, Colorado and Michigan have passed reforms that have stabilized or significantly reduced prison populations without increasing crime.
What Mr. Holder has done is turn up the dial, lending his imprimatur to a growing sense of national urgency and moral necessity. The muted reaction to his announcement from ardent conservatives is a reflection of the shift in debate.
But this is no time to rest. Those who seek a fairer criminal justice system, unclouded by racial bias, must at a minimum demand that the government eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, which tie judges' hands; rescind three-strikes laws, which often make no distinction between, say, armed assault and auto theft; amend ''truth in sentencing'' statutes, which prohibit early release for good behavior; and recalibrate drug policies, starting with decriminalization of marijuana possession and investment in substance-abuse prevention and treatment. Federal aid to state and local agencies, like the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant and the Community Oriented Policing Services, must prioritize diversion and rehabilitation over arrest and incarceration.
I am not naïve about the challenge, or of the needs of crime victims. In 1992, as I was finishing high school, my 71-year-old paternal grandmother was murdered in a house robbery in Sahibabad, India. The killing remains unsolved, and the anguish it caused my family will never fade away. But in America, our criminal justice system has too often focused on vengeance and punishment (and racial suspicion) rather than on crime prevention, restitution for victims and the social and economic reintegration of released prisoners into our communities so that they do not turn to crime again.
The buildup of our prison-industrial complex was a bipartisan process that unfolded over decades, and digging ourselves out of this hole will require unlikely political alliances. (For instance, the American Civil Liberties Union is working on sentencing reform with Right on Crime, a conservative initiative, and the American Legislative Exchange Council, an organization whose stances on immigration, voting and other civil rights policies we are fighting tooth and nail.) And where there is a lack of political will, we need to bring litigation of the kind that drove down prison populations in California and New Jersey and organize to make our voices heard.
The work ahead is daunting, but Mr. Holder's announcement holds out hope that we have crossed a threshold, that there is no longer any serious argument about whether there is a problem with criminal justice in America. It's sad it took so long for this moment to arrive -- and that the impetus has come as much from budget pressures as from concerns about justice -- but we need to seize it.

HEADLINE: Reservation Counts Votes On Ending Alcohol Ban

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
For practically as long as the Oglala Sioux have lived on the Pine Ridge reservation, alcohol has been seen as one of the tribe's greatest enemies.
Over the years, it has been illegally smuggled onto the reservation and blamed for crime, poverty, family estrangements, fatal car accidents, suicides and unemployment.
Now, alcohol is sowing resentment and division within the tribe as the people of Pine Ridge have voted to legalize its sale. 
Tribal election officials on Wednesday evening confirmed that tribal members, in a public referendum, had voted to overturn the ban on possessing and selling alcohol on the reservation. The vote tally was 1,843 in favor of legalization and 1,678 against it, according to the election commission.
Tribal members will have three days to challenge the result, but the election chairman, Francis Pumpkin Seed, said the burden to get a vote struck down was high in that whoever complains would have to prove that election law was violated.
While supporters say legalization will allow them to regulate alcohol and earn money from sales, critics worry that it will only worsen the tribe's problems.
''How far are we going to let it go?'' asked Bryan Brewer, the tribal president, who is staunchly against legalizing alcohol. ''How many more children are going to be murdered because of this?''
There have been protest marches by those opposed to ending prohibition, and the police have said people had received death threats.
Because of threats, the ballots were transferred to a secure location after the polls closed Tuesday so they could be counted.
Those supporting the initiative said opening shops that sold alcohol on the reservation would allow the tribe to keep a share of Pine Ridge's money on the reservation that is now being spent in liquor stores in towns bordering it. Further, they argued that the tax proceeds from alcohol sales could be used to bolster the Oglala Sioux's alcohol treatment programs. It remained unclear how much money allowing alcohol sales would produce for the reservation, which is one of the poorest places in the country and has unemployment rates estimated at more than 80 percent.
''Not legalizing it is just the status quo,'' said Robert Ecoffey, 58, who worked in law enforcement on the tribe and served as a superintendent for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. ''You have all of the issues and none of the resources to help deal with it.''
But that argument was unconvincing to Mr. Brewer.
''We're going to use alcohol money to spend on alcohol issues,'' he said. ''That doesn't make sense to me. I consider this blood money that the tribe will be getting. I hate to accept it.''
Solving the alcohol problem, he said, requires educating children, returning to the roots of tribal culture and creating jobs through economic development. Instead, he said, the tribal council, the federal government and the people of Pine Ridge have turned a blind eye to the problem.
The United States government has traditionally banned alcohol on reservations, but during the past 20 years, as more tribes have opened casinos -- which are the leading economic drivers on many reservations -- those prohibitions have been relaxed by tribes. Still, many reservations continue to limit alcohol sales and consumption to casinos.
Even the smell of alcohol on a person's breath in Pine Ridge has been cause for arrest. But despite the ban, alcohol -- particularly beer -- is plentiful on Pine Ridge. Most comes from stores that sell alcohol in the tiny town of Whiteclay, just across the Nebraska border from the reservation. Four stores in Whiteclay sell millions of cans of beer and malt liquor a year, almost all of it to the Oglala Sioux of Pine Ridge. Lawsuits, boycotts, police safety checks and protests organized by the tribe have all failed to close the stores or to put a significant dent in their business.
Ron Duke, Pine Ridge's chief of police, said that while he did not personally support opening the reservation up to alcohol sales, legalizing it would free his officers from responding to calls in which there is a complaint about an inebriated person or the presence of alcohol inside a home -- which he said took up the vast majority of an officer's time.
But Chief Duke said that he expected the easier availability of alcohol to lead to a sharp rise in violence, which will challenge a department whose 37 officers are responsible for patrolling an area larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined.
Like the majority of families on the reservation, Chief Duke, 63, said alcohol has had a devastating impact on his family. He said that he managed to avoid alcohol until he was 16, but was soon drinking heavily, like many among his family and friends.
During his 20s, he said, it was common for him to leave work at a beef packing plant in Nebraska, spend hours in a bar drinking until closing time at 2 a.m. and then return to work at 6 a.m.
Chief Duke said he finally gave up alcohol when he turned 31. But alcohol's ill fortune caught up to some members of his family. Two of his daughters, he said, were killed in drunken-driving accidents in the 1990s.

HEADLINE: Jordan Asks For Assistance In Securing Syrian Border

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
AMMAN, Jordan -- With no end in sight to the violence in Syria, which has already sent a half-million refugees into Jordan, authorities here appealed to the United States on Wednesday for surveillance airplanes and intelligence help to secure a border that is favored by arms smugglers.
In daylong meetings, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, King Abdullah II of Jordan and Gen. Mashal al-Zaben, the country's top military officer, also discussed the need to increase humanitarian assistance to help Jordan cope with a refugee population that is straining water and food supplies, as well as schools and hospitals. 
About 550,000 Syrians are officially registered as refugees in Jordan, with about 130,000 congregating in the Zaatari camp, making it the fourth-largest city in Jordan. Most of the refugees are women and children.
Although debate in Washington, especially in Congress, has focused on the risks and benefits of ordering American military intervention or supplying advanced weapons to opposition militias in Syria, General Dempsey said the Jordanians did not raise the issue.
''We did not talk about direct military intervention,'' he said. ''That actually never came up. What did come up was discussions about what we could do to help them build their capability and capacities, whether it was border surveillance and I.S.R.,'' which stands for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.
If Jordan were offered surveillance systems, General Dempsey said, they would be piloted airplanes, not remotely piloted drones.
Other assistance could help Jordan in combining intelligence gathered by like-minded nations across the region to better understand the threat from the violence in Syria.
Although no decisions about any aid have been made, the general said, the United States' close partnership with Jordan probably means that more help will be forthcoming, which could include increased training for Jordanian Special Operations forces to improve their counterterrorism skills and their preparation to defend against the use of chemical weapons. There is a fear that Syria's arsenal of those weapons may spread in the chaos of civil war.
The Pentagon has deployed air-defense missile batteries to Jordan, along with F-16's to train with the Jordanian air force in patrolling its border and air space.
A few hundred American military planners, including communications experts and logisticians, are also in the country.
Senior Jordanian officials have expressed grave, even existential, concerns that the refugee crisis could tax the country's infrastructure so badly -- especially its desert aquifer -- that civil unrest could result.
''For Jordan, it is very clearly the refugee issue,'' General Dempsey said, ''not only the number but the challenge that it puts on their economy and their critical infrastructure, especially commodities like food and water.''
General Dempsey arrived in Amman after meetings in Israel with the country's political and military leadership.
The view there, according to senior Israeli military officers, is that while outside military intervention is possible in the Syrian civil war, it is not advisable without understanding the full responsibilities that would come in the aftermath.
General Dempsey said Israel's security fears growing from the Syrian conflict include the flow of arms that could eventually be turned against Israel, and the prospect of growing Iranian influence in Syria and throughout the region.
After his meetings with Israel's prime minister, defense minister and military chief of staff, General Dempsey said, he ''sensed agreement'' that diplomatic initiatives and economic sanctions ''were having an effect'' on Iran, which is accused of seeking to develop nuclear arms, an accusation it strongly denies.
The Israelis ''of course want us to continue to present a credible military threat to support those diplomatic and economic efforts,'' General Dempsey said, adding that he told them, ''since I was here last year, we have better military options than we did a year ago.''
''That's because we've continued to refine them,'' he said. ''We've continued to develop technology, we've continued to train and plan.''
He declined to provide details.

HEADLINE: Koreas Agree To Reopen Factory Park In North

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North and South Korea agreed on Wednesday to reopen a joint industrial complex in a sign that the two sides are inching toward a thaw after months of high tension earlier this year.
The breakthrough came during what the South billed as a final round of make-or-break negotiations on whether to restart or permanently shut down the Kaesong factory park, which had been the last remaining symbol of the two countries' earlier economic cooperation.
The complex had been in operation for almost a decade, surviving through other periods of tension unlike other cross-border projects set up during a period of rapprochement and then halted one by one as relations soured in recent years. Kaesong's future was thrown into uncertainty this year after North Korea pulled its workers out in April amid a crisis that began with the North's third nuclear test and the resulting international sanctions. The South responded to the withdrawal of the workers by recalling its factory managers. 
Relations have been less strained in recent months, which analysts attribute partly to pressure on the North from China, the country's main benefactor, to stop provoking South Korea and the West. The United States had warned China that a failure to rein in the North would lead to a further buildup of American military in the region, anathema to the Chinese. The North may have had other reasons for re-engaging with the South, including that Pyongyang has long relied on the factory complex for much-needed hard currency and for tens of thousands of jobs. South Korea also recently promised $7.3 million worth of humanitarian aid for its impoverished neighbor, a conciliatory gesture that coincided with a call by the South for ''one last round'' of talks on restarting Kaesong.
Since last month, North and South Korea had held six earlier rounds of talks but had been unable to agree on the terms under which they could resume operations at the complex. They could find no compromise on the South Korean demand that the North take responsibility for monetary losses caused by the suspension of production and take steps to ensure that it would not shut the complex again for military or political reasons.
The breakthrough came Wednesday, when North Korea accepted an agreement under which the two Koreas ''guarantee that the normal operation of the Kaesong industrial complex will not be affected by political situations under any circumstance.'' The two sides also agreed to set up a joint panel to discuss compensating the South Korean companies for damages.
In another significant gain for the South, North Korea agreed to invite foreign investors into Kaesong and honor ''international business standards'' there, including allowing use of mobile phones and the Internet by South Korean factory managers. South Korea has insisted on bringing in foreign investors, saying that would make it more difficult for the North to use the complex as a political bargaining chip against the South.
At stake in the talks was more than the future of the Kaesong complex, where 123 South Korean companies employing 53,000 North Korean produced $470 million worth of textiles, electronic parts and other labor-intensive goods last year.
Analysts say that an agreement to reopen the complex will be an important test for inter-Korean relations under the young North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and the new South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, after a decidedly rocky start.
''Kaesong is the one thing left,'' John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul, said of the significance of the factory complex in inter-Korean relations. Its failure to reopen would have had ''severe implications'' for North-South ties, he said.
The agreement Wednesday did not specify when the complex would resume operations.
In a statement released by her office, Ms. Park said, ''I hope that the agreement today will be an occasion for South-North relations to make a fresh start.''
Pak Chol-su, the top North Korean negotiator, called the breakthrough ''great news for our nation.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Asks for Arrest of Mexican Kingpin Who Was Freed in American's Murder

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Randal C. Archibold from Mexico City. Karla Zabludovsky contributed reporting from Mexico City.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States has formally asked Mexico to re-arrest a drug kingpin who was released from prison in the middle of the night last week despite his conviction for masterminding the murder of an American drug agent nearly 30 years ago, officials from both governments said Wednesday.
The Justice Department sent Mexico a provisional arrest warrant for the drug lord, Rafael Caro Quintero, as a prelude to an extradition request. The officials, who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential collaboration, said Mexico's attorney general privately encouraged the United States to send the request, a sign that the government there would act on it. 
The case has stirred strong feelings among American law enforcement officials and become a fresh test of the relationship between the two neighboring countries at a time when they are trying to broaden it beyond the issues of crime, drugs and immigration. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to visit Mexico next month to talk about ways to expand economic ties, and both governments appear eager to avoid any enduring damage over the release of Mr. Caro Quintero.
Brian Fallon, a Justice Department spokesman, said that he could not comment on any arrest request but that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had personally involved himself in discussions. ''The attorney general is in contact with top Mexican authorities to convey concerns about the release and figure out steps forward,'' Mr. Fallon said.
The American authorities are also searching for other ways to go after Mr. Caro Quintero, who was convicted in the murder of Enrique Camarena, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent known as Kiki, who was abducted, tortured and killed in 1985. The Treasury Department is examining whether it can squeeze Mr. Caro Quintero financially while the Justice Department prepares an Interpol arrest request.
Mexico's attorney general, Jesús Murillo Karam, has expressed concern about the decision by a Mexican court to release Mr. Caro Quintero, who had served 28 years of a 40-year sentence, and said he would appeal the ruling to the country's Supreme Court. He told United States authorities on Monday that they should file their arrest request, and lawyers worked overnight to draft it, according to an American official. A Mexican official said that Mr. Murillo Karam encouraged the American arrest request in case he was unsuccessful in reversing the ruling in a Mexican court.
Whether Mexican authorities can find Mr. Caro Quintero again remains an open question. When he was released from prison in Jalisco State at 2 a.m. Friday, security agents monitoring the facility decided to follow him, but they lost him, the Mexican official said. The official said security agents now have an idea about his whereabouts and are looking into that.
American and Mexican officials have said they were caught off guard by the court's ruling, with legal experts saying that Mr. Caro Quintero's lawyers outflanked prosecutors with a technical, but often successful, argument that the case was improperly prosecuted in federal court rather than state court.
Mexico's foreign minister, José Antonio Meade, reiterated Mexico's disagreement with the decision and said it would work to ensure ''it is corrected,'' but he sidestepped questions about whether the United States had filed an extradition request. Foreign Ministry officials declined to comment.
Mexican legal experts said Mr. Caro Quintero could not be extradited for Mr. Camarena's killing because of a double jeopardy provision in the extradition treaty that bars turning anyone over on a charge that has been heard in trial. American lawyers could argue that the judge's ruling effectively meant that he never was legitimately tried and that double jeopardy does not apply.
The United States could also seek his extradition on other crimes he is suspected of committing. The government has long maintained that Mr. Caro Quintero continued his ties to an extensive drug and money-laundering network even from prison, and in June the Treasury Department leveled sanctions against 18 people, including six members of his family, and 15 businesses or other entities tied to him.
If the United States found a crime for which Mr. Caro Quintero had not been prosecuted, it would have to fall within the statute of limitations in Mexico, and the United States would have to assure that he would not face the death penalty, a condition that Mexico has insisted on in the past because it does not have capital punishment, said José Antonio Caballero, a law professor at the university known as CIDE who has reviewed the Caro Quintero case.
Mr. Caro Quintero was indicted by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles in January 1988, accused of masterminding the killing of Mr. Camarena to protect his drug-trafficking organization, which was smuggling marijuana and cocaine into the United States.
In January 1989, Mr. Caro Quintero and another man were convicted in Mexico of killing Mr. Camarena and two other Americans, John Walker and Alberto Radelat, who were living in Mexico and whom his henchmen had mistaken for D.E.A. agents.
At the time, Mexico rarely extradited its citizens to face trial abroad, but under President Felipe Calderón, who forged close ties with the United States on fighting drug crime, extraditions of major cartel figures soared. During President Enrique Peña Nieto's eight months in office, the pace has slowed considerably; the Justice Department has not released a tally.
American officials are worried that the second man convicted in the Camarena case, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, may also be freed under the legal tactic. If the federal court did not have jurisdiction in the killing, then Mr. Fonseca Carrillo's conviction might also be moot.
Although Mr. Caro Quintero also faced state charges, the court decided he had already served time in prison commensurate with whatever sentence he might receive.

HEADLINE: Appeals Court Blocks Attempt by Vermont to Close a Nuclear Plant

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- States cannot shut down nuclear plants over safety worries, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled on Wednesday, upholding a lower court's decision that allowed the Vermont Yankee plant to keep running despite a seven-year effort by the Vermont Legislature to close it.
''The nuclear power industry has just been delivered a tremendous victory against the attempt by any state to shut down federally regulated nuclear power plants,'' said Kathleen Sullivan, a lawyer for Entergy, which owns Vermont Yankee. 
The court found that states are ''pre-empted'' from regulating safety by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, which made safety a federal responsibility. The Legislature had sought to shut the plant by denying Entergy a ''certificate of public good'' that is required for all power plants. But the court said Vermont was unpersuasive when it said that the reasons for the denial were that the reactor was too costly and unreliable, and that closing it would encourage the development of renewable energy from wind or wood.
In hearings and floor debate, Vermont legislators referred often to the idea that they could not legislate over the safety of the plant, which is on the Connecticut River near the Massachusetts border, and would have to find other reasons to close it.
''Vermont tried to escape the prohibition by saying, 'Oh, no, we were really trying to encourage energy diversity,' '' Ms. Sullivan said.
The court also found that because the reactor operated in a competitive market for electricity, Vermont could not close it because it was too expensive.
The appeals court struck down one finding by the lower court, related to the Constitution's interstate commerce clause, that would have given Entergy the ability to seek reimbursement from Vermont for its legal costs.
The state has not decided whether to appeal, said Christopher Recchia, the commissioner of the Vermont Public Service Department, which represents consumers before the body that regulates electricity rates. It has also not yet issued the ''certificate of public good,'' he said.
''We're still moving forward, and obviously we have been focusing on the areas that the state does have jurisdiction over,'' he said, including environmental issues and the economic impact of employment at the plant.
Sandra Levine, a senior lawyer at the Conservation Law Foundation, a nonprofit group that entered the case as an ally of the state, said the court should not have looked at what motivated the lawmakers.
''The legislation speaks for itself,'' she said.
But because the appellate judges reaffirmed the ability of courts to examine the record and divine the real reasons for state actions, it could be relevant in New York, where the governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, is seeking to close the Indian Point reactors, which are also owned by Entergy, on the Hudson River in Westchester County.
New York is appearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on whether the two operating reactors there should be allowed 20-year extensions to their initial 40-year operating licenses. But it is also seeking to close the plants by imposing new limits on the use of water from the Hudson.
Other states have made it difficult for reactors to build additional storage for their nuclear waste; several have banned the construction of reactors until the nuclear waste problem is resolved.
While the court decision on Wednesday appears to keep Vermont Yankee safe from local political pressure, financial analysts say that it and other reactors have become far less profitable because the price they get for their electricity has fallen.
Entergy recently announced that it would cut 30 jobs, out of 650, at Vermont Yankee by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Publicis Groupe, Awaiting a Big Deal, Makes Another

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
The urge to merge on Madison Avenue is intensifying as evidenced by an acquisition made on Wednesday by an advertising holding group that has already agreed to a blockbuster deal to form the world's biggest ad company. 
The acquisition is being made by the Publicis Groupe, based in Paris, which agreed late last month to merge with the Omnicom Group, based in New York, to form the Publicis Omnicom Group, which will be a new industry leader in revenue. Publicis is acquiring Engauge Marketing, an advertising and digital-services agency based in Columbus, Ohio, with offices in Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Orlando, Fla. The price was not disclosed.
Engauge was formed in 2007 by Stan Rapp, a longtime direct marketer, and Halyard Capital, a private equity firm in New York, which was the majority owner. Their goal was to acquire agencies in fields like direct marketing, behavioral targeting and data analytics, then roll them into one agency under the Engauge name.
But the plans to grow much larger through acquisitions slowed after the recession, while the giants of the industry kept expanding. Examples include the Publicis-Omnicom merger, the acquisition of the Aegis Group by Dentsu and the acquisition of LBi by Publicis. The trade publication Advertising Age reported that the owners of Engauge, which had revenue last year of $39 million, had been shopping the agency to various ad holding groups for about a year.
''As we explored opportunities,'' Nick Bandy, chief executive of Engauge, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday, it became apparent that Publicis was ''the group we felt most the aligned with, the most comfortable with, the best home for our associates and our clients.''
Engauge has more than 250 employees and clients that include Cisco Systems, Coca-Cola and Nationwide Insurance.
Engauge will keep its name and report to a Publicis agency named Moxie, which is a division of the ZenithOptimedia Group at Publicis. Moxie has about 350 employees at its headquarters in Atlanta and offices in Los Angeles and New York.
Engauge is ''a fantastic complement to Moxie,'' said Suzy Deering, chief executive of Moxie, who joined Mr. Bandy for the interview. ''Engauge has a very strong list of clients,'' she added.
How Engauge and Moxie will be staffed and located in Atlanta is ''to be sorted out,'' Ms. Deering said. She and Mr. Bandy played down suggestions of possible cuts. Both agencies ''are very busy'' and ''there's plenty to do together,'' he said.

HEADLINE: To His Collection of Steinways, Hedge Fund Titan Adds Their Maker

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ALDEN

 BODY:
Updated, 9:16 p.m. | John A. Paulson, the hedge fund billionaire, already owns three Steinway & Sons pianos; the medium model M grand, the larger model O and the nearly seven-foot-long model B, together worth tens of thousands of dollars.
But Mr. Paulson, in investing parlance, was looking to increase his exposure. On Wednesday, his firm, Paulson & Company, agreed to buy the company that makes the pianos, Steinway Musical Instruments, for $512 million. 
The move raised eyebrows both in the world of music and on Wall Street. Mr. Paulson made billions in 2007 largely with a bet against the housing market. His firm specializes in mortgages, gold and other financial assets.
And while Paulson & Company owns stakes in companies, it has never before bought one outright.But Mr. Paulson said that the calculation was rather simple -- he loves the pianos.
''I've always been enamored with the product,'' Mr. Paulson said in an interview on Wednesday. ''You have Mercedes in cars, and top brands in every other area. But no one has such a high share of the high end.''
But while he got what he wanted within days of making his first offer, a bidding contest for Steinway broke out behind the scenes. In July, the private equity firm Kohlberg & Company said it had reached an agreement with Steinway to buy it for $35 a share. But Kohlberg bowed out of the running on Tuesday in the face of a bid from Paulson of $38 a share.
That same day, though, an additional challenger emerged -- Samick Musical Instruments of South Korea, which is Steinway's biggest shareholder. Using the code name ''Edelweiss,'' presumably in a reference to ''The Sound of Music,'' Samick offered $39 a share.
But on Wednesday morning, Steinway, whose stock ticker symbol is LVB, for Ludwig van Beethoven, pronounced Mr. Paulson the winner after his firm had increased its bid to $40 a share.
''We're fortunate in this case that John is a personal fan of our product,'' Michael T. Sweeney, Steinway's chairman and chief executive, said on Wednesday. ''His love for the instrument gives him the insight as to how we can build the business.''
While the deal is done, there is still a chance that a higher bid may emerge, and Steinway is allowed to consider unsolicited offers.
In the world of music, Steinway is not just another company. Founded in 1853 by a German immigrant in Manhattan, Henry Engelhard Steinway, and his three sons, Steinway pianos became an icon in concert halls and living rooms. Steinway spends almost a year building each grand piano, and the result, its devotees say, is an unmatched quality of sound. The announcement in March that the company was selling its famous showroom on West 57th Street in Manhattan was greeted in many quarters with sorrow.
Still, the financial maneuvering left some of Steinway's devotees full of concern as they recalled difficult times in the past. With piano factories in Astoria, Queens, and Hamburg, Germany, the company was family-owned until 1972, when it was sold to the CBS Corporation, an owner that many aficionados believed sacrificed quality in pursuit of higher profits.
CBS cut costs, changed the management and pushed Steinway to produce more pianos, said Frank M. Mazurco, who started as a sales representative in Cincinnati and rose to become executive vice president of Steinway before he retired in 2007.
''We had to do a lot of damage control,'' Mr. Mazurco said. ''It wasn't a good fit.''
Leon Botstein, the musical director of the American Symphony Orchestra in New York and the president of Bard College, said the CBS period should be a ''warning'' to Mr. Paulson. Steinway was eventually sold in 1985 to investors in Boston, and, after changing hands again, it went public in 1996.
''Let's hope it's a hedge fund with some idealism, with interest in something more than the everlasting buck,'' Mr. Botstein said.
Mr. Paulson vowed to keep the business largely as it is. He indicated that he had no plans to close, relocate or change any of Steinway's manufacturing operations.
Instead, Mr. Paulson said his strategy centers on expanding Steinway's reach around the world. He is also betting that the improving economy and strengthening housing market will help the sales of Steinway pianos, a luxury item that proved to be out of reach in recent years, even for its usual wealthier clientele.
With the company's sales flagging in the aftermath of the recession, a team of executives offered in 2011 to buy everything but the piano business. But after reviewing its options -- a period in which it fielded interest from two private equity firms -- the company ultimately announced last December that it was not for sale.
Then, in July, Kohlberg made its offer to buy the entire company. That is when Mr. Paulson began to pursue Steinway in earnest. In the last several weeks, he read a book on the company to help bring himself up to speed.
One analyst, Arnold Ursaner of CJS Securities, said it was not surprising that Mr. Paulson -- who donated $100 million to the Central Park Conservancy last year -- was making a play for Steinway.
''You have a global luxury brand,'' Mr. Ursaner said. ''It's no different from a painting or a magnificent Fifth Avenue apartment.''
Today, Steinway has expanded beyond pianos to sell horns, clarinets, saxophones and drums. It so happens that that aspect of the business is right up Mr. Paulson's alley.
Though Mr. Paulson is not a pianist, he played the drums, clarinet and saxophone when he was a teenager and into his 20s, eventually setting them aside when he could not keep up the necessary commitment.
To Mr. Botstein, Mr. Paulson's musical background is a positive sign.
''He bought something with a huge moral responsibility,'' Mr. Botstein said. ''It would be a tragedy if this were to be abused or exploited. It needs to be treated with love and with care.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: An Ode to a City Overcoming Its Usual Summer Doldrums

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Something strange has happened this August. The tomatoes sold in the nation's capital are far better than those available at the farmers markets in Los Angeles. No one in Southern California may wish to admit this, but that is really the way it is.
The myriad miseries of Washington in August are well documented: Humidity that rivals a rain forest. The absence of friends and neighbors, who have all repaired to the Chesapeake Bay, Rehoboth and points north. Scandals break out, wars can erupt and debt ceiling fights sometimes ensue. Or boredom. 
But the late-summer pleasures of this city are, empirically speaking, vast and undercelebrated, a bit like being in a newfangled city, with the restaurants peppered with locals. Aggressive acceleration is needed far less often in encounters in the city's stressful traffic circles.
Then, there is the produce: sweet, delicate corn; eggplants the size of small weapons; peaches from West Virginia and the aforementioned tomatoes, which have emerged late thanks to a cool spring. The Metro system has emptied of the throngs of Jos. A. Bank-swathed first-jobbers, leaving a seat or two extra in both directions.
Our fellow Americans who elected the members of Congress they claim to loathe now have them home for an entire month. President Obama is on vacation with the first lady on Martha's Vineyard and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., is chilling in his home state of Delaware. So motorcade delays are a thing of the past, and the future.
On the Potomac River, there is quieter kayaking. In the trendy restaurant corridor of 14th Street, reservations are possible at 8 p.m.
For those who are here in August, the clearing out of many who earn their money in the corridors of Congress and K Street is a blessing, and what is left behind is life in vibrant neighborhoods that are far less dependent on the federal work force to fill cafes and movie theaters than they were two decades ago.
''Parisians say the same thing about their city, so it makes you feel superior that the boulevard-esque plan isn't the only thing that makes D.C. similar to Paris,'' said Amy Albert, a magazine editor who lives near Capitol Hill. ''The Hill is emptied of loud men in bad suits and it is so hot, you don't feel guilty going to the movies midday.''
Actually on Wednesday, it was downright Seattlelike, cool and breezy, with a brilliant sky -- a reprieve for runners who are left to take advantage of trails usually populated by overcaffeinated commuting bikers, who zoom along dinging horrid little bells and screeching, ''ON YOUR LEFT.''
We're O.K. on sports, too. National Football League training camps are under way and the Redskins have welcomed back their quarterback, Robert Griffin III, early from injury. The Nationals even stink a little less.
Yes, the city government is under a cloud, but our local scandals are still eclipsed by those roiling Manhattan. (Oh, hi New York. Also, are your subway stations air-conditioned?)
Also, let's talk about the crabs. ''Oh, we got beautiful crabs, baby,'' said Chester Ford, the chef at the Moruss Seafood and Crab House in Southeast Washington. ''We have jumbo, medium, all of it. August is about prime time for crabs.'' Traffic at the crab house slows a bit after the 15th, Mr. Ford said, ''because the kids are getting ready to go back to school, you have to be careful with your money this time of year.'' But sometimes the lines still form. It's that way.
Restaurants generally are easier to get into during August, another joy for those still here. You still can't snag a table at Le Diplomate, the new French bistro on 14th Street, this Saturday night, but there are some 8 p.m. spots available next week. The lines at Little Serow have not lessened, but the bar at BLT Steak beckons with empty seats downtown.
If Washington feels full in its own way even as it empties in August, that may be because fewer people here are tied to the ways of Congress and the White House. Since 1970, the number of workers employed here by the federal government has fallen seven percentage points, to what is now a mere 27 percent.
''If you look at where the growth has been, it has not been in federal employment in the District proper,'' said Jonathan Rothwell, an associate fellow at the Brookings Institution who is an expert on the local economy. ''There has been huge growth in the tech sector, at universities, in medical-related business and business professional services. So there is no reason for everyone else to take a vacation just because men and women from other parts of the country leave to go back to their districts.''
So buy the tech dude sitting next to you at your local watering hole a beer, preferably one made locally. That's gotten better here in recent years, too.

HEADLINE: Is There a 'Better' Worthy Cause?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Good Charity, Bad Charity'' (Sunday Review, Aug. 11):
Peter Singer writes that when it comes to charity and philanthropy, a dollar spent on preventing blindness in developing countries is ''a better value'' than a dollar spent on a new wing at a local art museum. His reasoning is that not going blind is far more important to us than having a better art museum.
The logical implication is that we are ethically obligated to spend whatever we have to give on charities that produce the greatest world benefit per dollar, a formula where ''arts, culture and heritage'' will almost always lose out to ''health and security.'' 
This is not a plausible contention. Are we ethically prohibited from enhancing our communities by giving to the cultural, educational, spiritual or recreational institutions that mean the most to us so long as more urgent problems exist anywhere in the world? To state the proposition is to refute it.
For that matter, are we ethically prohibited from spending money for the benefit of ourselves and our families beyond bare necessities so long as those same problems persist? Of course not. A spirit of empathy and charity is ethically required. Perfect altruism -- where every act and omission is calculated to produce the greatest good for the greatest number -- is not.
Unless Mr. Singer lives in a shack, subsisting on gruel, water, a typewriter and one kidney, I'm sure he agrees. Meanwhile, if Mr. Singer wishes to impress upon the fortunate a duty to train their philanthropic eye on world poverty and disease, I don't think his worthy cause is well served by suggesting that local cultural giving is a relative waste.
JAKE HILDNER Chicago, Aug. 12, 2013
To the Editor:
An effective attack on the scourges that Peter Singer cites, and so many other endemic diseases, will be mounted only by an ethical society with an educated, broadly aware populace. It is a society's cultural institutions -- its libraries, museums, universities -- that provide the foundations for such a society. A rich cultural heritage enables us to develop the ''better angels of our nature.''
Can anyone doubt that Andrew Carnegie's gifts to establish a system of public libraries have been far more meaningful to society than if he had given that money to fight a particular disease?
It is not a choice of giving to one or the other; neither is a ''bad charity.''
ROBERT S. GREEN New York, Aug. 11, 2013
To the Editor:
Peter Singer encourages us to use a quantitative framework ''used by economists'' to help us make decisions about charitable giving. But the goods he attempts to evaluate -- sight and art -- are inherently unquantifiable. How can we place a numerical value on curing blindness or on providing space for a work of art?
These are indeed ''priceless,'' and the numbers he cites -- 50 years, 100,000 visitors, 15 years, 1 person -- are of little help when evaluating them.
PETER RICHARDS Brooklyn, Aug. 12, 2013
To the Editor:
If Peter Singer wants to be a secular saint, more power to him. Personally, I'm extremely grateful to the people who have made donations that allow me to see great art, listen to opera and symphonic music, read library books free of charge and watch excellent public television.
The amount of suffering in the world is limitless; diminishing my ability to enjoy the arts is not the answer to curing poverty and disease. Without the arts, life is not worth living.

HEADLINE: Morning Agenda: Oversight at JPMorgan Is Scrutinized

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Criminal charges against two former traders for JPMorgan Chase intensify scrutiny of the bank&#8217;s executives. | Eike Batista has taken further steps to dismantle his business empire. | John A. Paulson has bought the company that makes his favorite pianos. | The reinsurance arm of Third Point is expected to begin trading. 

 BODY:
Criminal charges on Wednesday against two former traders for JPMorgan Chase intensified the scrutiny of the bank's executives in New York, where, federal authorities say, lax controls and the pressure for profits made the problem worse, Ben Protess and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook.
The employees - Javier Martin-Artajo, a manager who oversaw the trading strategy, and Julien Grout, a low-level trader in London - were accused of manipulating the books to disguise hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, operating for months with scant supervision and with the impression that higher-ups supported them.
When, for example, Mr. Martin-Artajo directed Mr. Grout to record losses only in extreme circumstances, he claimed the directive came from New York, meaning the senior management of the bank. People inside the bank, however, dispute that notion.
"This was not a tempest in a teapot but rather a perfect storm of individual misconduct and inadequate internal controls," Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said at a news conference to announce the charges. It was a reference to a comment made by Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, who originally dismissed concerns about the trades as a "tempest in a teapot" before later saying he was "dead wrong." 
The criminal complaints offered a window into how Wall Street values huge derivatives trades, a process that involves a considerable amount of guesswork, DealBook's Peter Eavis writes. "One way that traders value their holdings is to use pricing data from a range of banks," Mr. Eavis writes. "The problem with using this approach is that it may not be fully based on prices that occurred in actual transactions."
BATISTA GIVES UP CONTROL OF A COMPANY | Eike Batista, the troubled Brazilian businessman, has taken further steps to dismantle his empire of energy, logistics and mining companies, Dan Horch writes in DealBook. Mr. Batista announced on Wednesday night that he would sell a controlling stake in one of his companies, the LLX logistics firm, for about $560 million to EIG Global Energy Partners, an energy investment firm based in Washington.
"People briefed on the matter confirmed on Wednesday that another of his companies, the petroleum firm OGX, has hired the Blackstone Group as a financial adviser," Mr. Horch writes. "The move may indicate that OGX, which has over $3 billion in debt trading at under 20 cents on the dollar, is planning to either sell some assets or restructure its debt."
PAULSON'S BID FOR STEINWAY | 
John A. Paulson, the hedge fund billionaire, already owns three Steinway & Sons pianos: the medium Model M grand, the larger Model O and the nearly seven-foot-long Model B, together worth tens of thousands of dollars. But Mr. Paulson, in investing parlance, was looking to increase his exposure. On Wednesday, his firm, Paulson & Company, agreed to buy the company that makes the pianos, Steinway Musical Instruments, for $512 million.
The move raised eyebrows both in the world of music and on Wall Street. Mr. Paulson made billions in 2007, largely with a bet against the housing market. His firm specializes in mortgages, gold and other financial assets. And while Paulson & Company owns stakes in companies, it has never before bought one outright. But Mr. Paulson said that the calculation was rather simple - he loves the pianos.
"I've always been enamored with the product," Mr. Paulson said in an interview on Wednesday. "You have Mercedes in cars, and top brands in every other area. But no one has such a high share of the high end."
ON THE AGENDA | The Consumer Price Index for July is out at 8:30 a.m. Data on industrial production in July is out at 9:15 a.m. Wal-Mart Stores and Kohl's report earnings before the market opens. Nordstrom and Applied Materials report earnings this evening.
THIRD POINT REINSURANCE ARM PRICES I.P.O. | The reinsurance arm of Third Point, the hedge fund run by Daniel S. Loeb, is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, after pricing its initial public offering at $12.50 a share, at the bottom end of an estimated range. The size of the offering was trimmed slightly, to just under 22.1 million shares from 22.2 million shares, reducing the proceeds to about $276.3 million, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced reports.

HEADLINE: Europe's Slow Financial Reforms

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: By relying on lowest-common-denominator regulatory standards, Europe&#8217;s banking regulators are stopping well short of prudent reforms, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
To many Americans, financial reform in Europe may seem like a faraway issue about which they care little, but any such perception would be a mistake. The ability of the European Union - and particularly the euro area - to make its financial system safer is of fundamental importance not just for its economic prospects but also for what happens next around the world.
Europe accounts for more than a quarter of the world's gross domestic product and its banks are big, with more than $25 trillion in total assets. (The G.D.P. of the United States is around $16 trillion, and the E.U. is slightly bigger, depending on which exchange rate you use.) 
There are two perspectives on what is happening.
The first is that of the European Commission and others who spend time in continental conference rooms: "We have done a lot" and "we are making progress."
The second view is more widely held among skeptical outsiders: there is a great more deal to do; Europe is at risk of falling behind even the United States, where reforms have hardly been carried out with alacrity; and, most worrying, Europe may be on course to settle for lower equity capital in its banks than the United States ultimately will. Without question, the European Commission and its allies have guided through a great deal of change. The question is not the diligence or hard work of the people involved but rather the obstacles they face, particularly at the national level, including some in France and Germany.

The European Commission has an extensive set of materials on its Web site, with this colorful chart that shows reforms in progress and on the planning board (the font is small but it is highly informative). And there are helpful lists of initiatives and reforms with regular updates (e.g., on financial supervision).
Perhaps understandably, most of the constructive euro area official attention has been focused on repairing crucial defects of its currency union, which created one monetary system without integrating fiscal policy or creating a unified approach to bank regulation, supervision and resolution.
Without doubt, it makes complete sense to set up a Single Supervisory Mechanism for the euro zone, as is now under way. And in July the European Commission proposed a Single Resolution Mechanism for the Banking Union. Resolution in this case means how the failure of banks is handled, to ensure losses are fairly allocated while the system as a whole is not disrupted.
The commission, working with national authorities, should press further in this direction, as recommended by André Sapir, Martin Hellwig and Marco Pagano (leading European academics, respectively chairman and vice chairmen of the Advisory Scientific Committee of the European Systemic Risk Board - see their October 2012 contribution and the longer July 2012 report by their full group.)
Unfortunately, however, once we turn to more universal weaknesses that cause potential dangers in any financial system, three serious issues seem likely to remain insufficiently addressed in Europe for the foreseeable future.
First, any analysis of a financial system should start with the facts on bank capital (the equity funding of banks, which serves as a buffer against losses). But the facts are hard to come by today for Europe today. You can complain about how bank stress tests have been handled in the United States to date (and I have complained, including in this space), but they are a paragon of transparency compared with what happened in Europe.
In principle, such stress tests are intended to reveal what losses may occur and the extent to which banks have sufficient equity to withstand pressure without collapsing or becoming some sort of dysfunctional zombie (a quasi-technical term in banking circles, if you can believe that).
I recommend "Behind Smoke and Mirrors: On the Alleged Recapitalization of Europe's Banks," by Jakob Vestergaard and María Retana of the Danish Institute for International Studies, a searing indictment of European stress tests and the broader European approach to ensuring their banks have enough capital.
As with any cross-borders discussion of banking, I strongly advise consulting the numbers put together by Thomas M. Hoenig (current vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and former president of the Kansas City Fed). Mr. Hoenig has done a great service by converting the generally accepted accounting principles accounts used in the United States (the standard for financial reports from American banks) to I.F.R.S. (the accounting standard used by European and other international banks); see Table 1 in this speech.
(The crucial assumption in this conversion is how to treat derivatives. In the United States, under GAAP, derivatives positions can be netted in a way that is relatively generous, i.e., reducing the total balance sheet size of the bank in question. The I.F.R.S. procedure is more cautious about how much netting to allow and, I contend, better suited to regulatory purposes - when you want to see what kind of shadow a bank casts and how far the shock waves would reach if there is some kind of problem.)
The bottom line is that while United States banks do not have as much equity funding relative to total assets as is commonly supposed, some of the largest European banks are in significantly worse shape. Deutsche Bank has loss-absorbing equity that is less than 1.5 percent of its total assets (known as its leverage ratio), Société Générale and Crédit Agricole are under 2 percent and Barclays is not much better.
These banks are under pressure to raise more capital, and Deutsche Bank and Barclays have announced plans that move in the right direction. But the amounts involved do not change the broader assessment.
And, more worryingly, European officials seem content to settle at or around a 3 percent leverage ratio. There is also a serious proposal to set a cap on this ratio (i.e., limiting how much equity a bank is "allowed" to have relative to its assets) for European banks, supposedly to help maintain a common market in financial services. From the F.A.Q. for the relevant new rules:
Higher levels of capital requirements in one member state would also distort competition and encourage regulatory arbitrage. For example, institutions could be encouraged to concentrate risky activities in member states that only implement the minimum requirements. Therefore, capital requirements need to be set at a level that is appropriate for the E.U. as a whole.
The F.A.Q. adds that capital requirements cannot be increased by national authorities "unless a specific add-on is justified following an individual supervisory review or based on systemic risk or macro-prudential concerns."
Such a policy of capping equity is folly. Countries should be competing to strengthen their financial systems, not being held back by some lowest common denominator.
Second, there needs to be much more progress with handling the resolution of banks with cross-border operations. This remains an Achilles heel in the current European situation, as was demonstrated recently and most painfully by what happened in Cyprus.
The irony is that on bank capital, it is Germany (and France) that hold down equity requirements, in part because their banks are so undercapitalized. Yet on resolution it is also the German government that drags its feet, saying it fears the cost of bailing out weaker banking systems. As Professors Vestergaard and Retana lay out in convincing detail, "The core of the problem is in the core of the Euro zone: German and French banks" (Page 42).
Given the weight of those countries (and their financial interests) in European decision-making circles, it is hard to expect a rapid acceleration of reform.
Third, the organization of banking remains problematic. There were many sensible ideas in the European Commission's recent Liikanen Report, which recommended a form of firewall between relatively risky trading activities and those relatively boring but essential features of banking, like running the payments system:
The group has concluded that it is necessary to require legal separation of certain particularly risky financial activities from deposit-taking banks within the banking group. The activities to be separated would include proprietary trading of securities and derivatives, and certain other activities closely linked with securities and derivatives markets (see Page iv).
Again, I recognize that discussions continue (e.g., see this commission Web page), but little real progress is evident or - in my assessment - likely. (In contrast, Britain seems on course to carry out at least the spirit of similar recommendations from the British government's Vickers Report.)
The French and German governments, with others, like having universal banks that do a bit of everything. The Vickers and Liikanen reports made a convincing case for moving away from this model.
Unfortunately, politics will trump economics in the euro area, and financial sector reform will remain slow or even glacial on this dimension.

HEADLINE: Auto Loans and Risky Borrowers

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A new analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York finds that the increase in auto lending is not primarily driven by loans to risky borrowers. 

 BODY:
Auto lending is up, which has brought concerns about whether risky loans are driving the trend. A new analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York finds new auto loans to borrowers with low credit scores have indeed risen, but are still well below the levels seen during the credit bubble years leading up to the financial crisis. 
In the second quarter of this year, about 23 percent of new auto loans were issued to borrowers with credit scores under 620. Historically, the share of newly issued auto loans going to this riskier group was about 25 to 30 percent. The share of newly issued auto loans going to the borrowers with the best credit - scores over 720 - peaked at more than half during the recession. It's about 45 percent now. 
Auto loans over all, you'll notice, are still not back to their pre-crisis highs. That is largely because young people are borrowing less frequently than they used to. 
The reduced appetite for mortgage and auto loans among the young has been attributed to higher student debt burdens, though the link between the two is disputed.

HEADLINE: Bipartisan Group Offers Recommendations on Immigration Overhaul

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The Bipartisan Policy Center&#8217;s immigration task force released a set of recommendations on Thursday for an overhaul of the nation&#8217;s immigration laws and called on members of Congress to participate in a civil discussion aimed at finding areas of consensus. 

 BODY:
The Bipartisan Policy Center's immigration task force released a set of recommendations on Thursday for an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws and called on members of Congress to participate in a civil discussion aimed at finding areas of consensus.
"We should refrain from demonizing individuals or organizations for positions that may not align directly with either our views or our opinions on the best method for resolving these important matters," the center wrote in a statement Thursday. "Instead, we encourage a respectful dialogue that acknowledges these concerns and moves forward to find common ground." 
In an op-ed article in Politico written by the task force's four co-chairmen - Haley Barbour, the former Republican governor of Mississippi; Henry Cisneros, a housing secretary under President Bill Clinton; Edward G. Rendell, the former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania; and Condoleezza Rice, a secretary of state under President George W. Bush - they said they saw "real progress" on the issue of repairing the nation's immigration system, in an otherwise "seemingly gridlocked" Congress. 
"We have been encouraged by the constructive debate that has occurred around immigration reform," the task force wrote. "As the debate continues, we must avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good: Our current system is fundamentally flawed and broken. If we can focus on where there is agreement and then work conscientiously to narrow our differences, then real and durable reform is possible."
The task force also outlined four guiding principles: controlling the flow of unauthorized immigration, offering a pathway for legalization and citizenship, creating a strong system to encourage and promote legal immigration, and recognizing the positive economic impacts of overhauling the nation's immigration laws.
"Traditionally, August is a period where members go home and have discussions with constituents, and it's a time for reflection and debate all across the country," Michael Chertoff, a Homeland Security secretary under Mr. Bush and a task force member, said on a conference call Thursday. The group's goal, he added, is to "frame the issues, demonstrate that there is a path forward that should address the major concerns raised and can do it in a way that appeals to a broad spectrum of people."
Though the immigration bill that recently passed the Senate devotes billions of dollars to border security, the task force called for a "scientifically valid set of measures that are audited by an independent commission," in order to help stanch the flow of illegal immigrants and ensure that the government is held accountable for the security of the nation's borders.
On the question of legalization and a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, the task force recommended an earned path to citizenship for immigrants willing to pay all fines and penalties and pass a criminal background check. The task force also said that "undocumented immigrants should not be forced to choose between a green card and leaving the country," but added, "Automatic citizenship should not be the default position."
Though the group's recommendations largely align with the immigration legislation that already passed the Senate, which includes a 13-year path to citizenship, they seem to go a bit further than some of the alternatives being considered in the Republican-controlled House, where many conservative members are hesitant to offer any path to legalization.
After noting that he was probably the "most conservative" voice on the conference call, Mr. Barbour said, "I believe if there is a rigorous path to citizenship, that does have rigorous requirements, I am comfortable with it."

HEADLINE: Could the Hyperloop Really Cost $6 Billion? Critics Say No

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: While physicists agree that technically, on paper, Elon Musk&#8217;s vision for the Hyperloop is possible, economists seem to agree that technically, on paper, the price tag of $6 billion is impossible. 

 BODY:
Elon Musk, a serial entrepreneur who was a co-founder of PayPal and the electric car company Tesla Motors, sent people in California into a tizzy on Monday when he released a white paper outlining a hypothetical high-speed transportation system called the Hyperloop.
There were a number of curious questions about the Hyperloop, which Mr. Musk's white paper claims will be able to travel at up to 800 miles an hour and transport people from San Francisco to Los Angeles in 30 minutes. While physicists agree that technically, on paper, this is possible, economists seem to agree that technically, on paper, the price tag of $6 billion is impossible. 
Richard White, a professor of American history at Stanford and author of "Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America," said Mr. Musk's project was "dramatically overblown and the price is drastically underestimated." He said in an interview that Mr. Musk's document outlining the price of the project was "just pie in the sky."
Just how pie in the sky is it?
Alexis Madrigal, a senior editor at The Atlantic, points out that one reason California's high-speed rail project has been projected to cost $68 billion is that "they have to acquire 1,100 different pieces of land."
"Just Fresno to Bakersfield, a little over 100 miles, is supposed to cost $7 billion for high-speed rail," he writes.
Although Mr. Musk has stated that he would save money on land parcels by setting up pylons for the Hyperloop along Interstate 5 in California, he isn't taking into account the legal hurdles the currently planned, high-speed train had to go through just to acquire land.
As Brad Plumer of The Washington Post noted, one of the major factors for the California high-speed rail price's ballooning to 10 times Mr. Musk's projected price is that local communities along the train route demanded extra viaducts and tunnels. "Other towns, meanwhile, have insisted they not be bypassed even in cases where it would be cheaper to do so," Mr. Plumer wrote.
The 400-mile Hyperloop would not be immune to these issues.
Putting aside the cost of construction, critics said the projected cost for people to use the Hyperloop was impossible, too.
Mr. Musk projected that the Hyperloop would be able to transport 840 people an hour, each paying $20 a ticket. But as Dan Sperling, founding director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, said: "There's no way the economics on that would ever work out."
Mr. Sperling told Al Jazeera that when you factor in capital, labor and maintenance of the Hyperloop, the numbers, "even in the most outlandish visionary way, do not make any sense at all."
"The whole technology is unproven," he said. "I know he's a brilliant guy, but it just doesn't pencil out."
Michael L. Anderson, an associate professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Berkeley, predicted that the cost of the entire project would be closer to $100 billion.
No one seems to be arguing whether it is possible, or even if Mr. Musk could technically build the Hyperloop - this is, after all, the man who created Tesla and SpaceX - experts seem to be focused on how he plans to build this invention, then operate it, at the costs he proposes.
"People laud him for creating Tesla," said Mr. White of Stanford. "But let's be realistic; he's not Henry Ford creating the Model T. Musk is creating $60,000 to $100,000 electric cars for rich people."

HEADLINE: Favoring Wanderlust Over Fame

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
DECADES ago, a man named Garry Davis provocatively renounced his American citizenship and declared himself a citizen of the world. Now, Tumi, which sells luxury suitcases, bags and other products for travelers, is proclaiming the arrival of the ''global citizen.''
In a worldwide campaign scheduled to begin on Sunday, Tumi is saying, in effect, that it will let competitors that include Louis Vuitton go to market with famous faces like Angelina Jolie, Keith Richards, Madonna and even Mikhail S. Gorbachev. According to Tumi and its creative agency, Yard, potential buyers of Tumi's wares are more likely to respond to less-well-known figures who, though not megastars, are still men and women of distinction and achievement. 
''It just felt more interesting, more authentic'' to pass up ''celebrity-level people'' in favor of people for whom ''travel is basically a way of life,'' said Stephen Niedzwiecki, chief creative officer at Yard, which is based in New York.
Dialing down the fame quotient by selecting endorsers whose accomplishments ''seem more achievable'' helps make the campaign, and Tumi merchandise, ''aspirational,'' he added.
The initial batch of global citizens, as Yard and Tumi describe them, are Alexandra Cousteau, an environmentalist and explorer who is the granddaughter of Jacques-Yves Cousteau; Paolo Ferrari, North American chairman and chief executive of Pirelli Tire; and Amanda Sudano-Ramirez, a songwriter and singer. They were all photographed in Los Angeles.
The global citizen is ''our target customer,'' said Alan Krantzler, senior vice president for brand management at Tumi in South Plainfield, N.J., ''real people who are hyper-travelers, across time zones, across borders.''
(Mr. Niedzwiecki defined ''hyper-traveler'' as the 21st-century successor to the road warrior: ''They're not about schlepping anymore. It's more about being a world traveler.'')
Mr. Krantzler described the participants in the campaign as ''very reflective of our consumer base at large.'' Spending for the ads, estimated at $3.5 million through the rest of the year, represents a ''significant investment'' for the company, he added.
The campaign includes print ads in publications like Esquire, Interview, Paper, New York and The New York Times T Magazine; video clips; ads on Web sites and blogs like the Condé Nast Digital Network, The Huffington Post, Refinery29 and UrbanDaddy; ads in outdoor places like phone kiosks, bus shelters, bus wraps and billboards; and a presence on social media like Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter.
In addition to appearing in the United States, the campaign will also run in places like China, Hong Kong, Japan and Russia, Mr. Krantzler said.
''We have a lot of people very interested'' in appearing in the next iteration of the campaign, he added. Mr. Niedzwiecki said, ''We're in production right now for the next round,'' which will be photographed in another location that, like Los Angeles, is a gateway city for global citizens.
As part of the desire for the campaign to be deemed authentic, said George Esquivel, creative director at Tumi, it was important that the people in the ads actually be Tumi customers because ''at the core of the brand is that it's a very real brand.''
''Some of these people have been using Tumi for 10 or 15 years,'' he added, and ''we tried to marry the product'' that appears in each ad ''with what they're using'' as travelers.
Madison Avenue's ardor for celebrities ebbs and flows, depending on factors like the economy (the rich getting richer from endorsement deals may turn off cash-squeezed consumers), whether there is a perception that too many campaigns are using stars simultaneously and whether the value of celebrity is being diminished by a spate of stars getting into trouble at the same time, as in the recent lost endorsements for Lance Armstrong, Ryan Braun, Paula Deen and Lil Wayne.
Featuring less-familiar faces in ads has been a popular trend for over a decade, particularly people who are known in narrowly focused fields. The idea is that an effective way to cultivate a cutting-edge image may be to sign endorsers known only to an in-crowd.
The relative obscurity of such people was a drawback in the past, but now the Internet makes it easy to learn more about Tumi's global citizens or other far-from-famous ad figures.
''If you Google Amanda,'' Mr. Niedzwiecki said, referring to Ms. Sudano-Ramirez, ''you'll find out a lot about her that's extremely interesting.'' Referring to Ms. Cousteau, he added, ''And Alexandra's story is also worth digging deeper into.'' Such research by consumers can increase their engagement with an ad -- if they decide it is worth spending the time.
Global citizens probably have lots of time for online reading, with all those delayed flights and lost luggage (Tumi or otherwise). But then, perhaps hyper-traveling means never having to say you fly commercial.

HEADLINE: Syria War Fueling Attacks by Qaeda Inside Iraq, Officials Say

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and TIM ARANGO; Michael R. Gordon reported from Washington, and Tim Arango from Baghdad.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The spiraling conflict in Syria has provided a sanctuary for leaders of Al Qaeda's Iraq affiliate who are orchestrating attacks in Baghdad and other cities, posing a fresh challenge for efforts to maintain security there, American officials said Thursday.
''They are flush with jihadi recruits, which are coming into Syria, and we think they are sending a number of them into Iraq,'' a senior administration official told reporters. 
In 2011 and 2012, suicide bombings in Iraq averaged 5 to 10 a month. But over the past 90 days, the number has approached about 30 a month, the official added.
Concerns that the chaos in Syria may destabilize Iraq were at the top of the agenda on Thursday when Secretary of State John Kerry met with Hoshyar Zebari, Iraq's foreign minister, for consultations on security, political and economic issues.
''Sunni and Shia extremists on both sides of the sectarian divide throughout the region have an ability to be able to threaten Iraq's stability if they're not checked,'' Mr. Kerry said.
The leader of Al Qaeda's Iraq affiliate, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and other senior members of the group are operating from Syria, according to the State Department. ''Al Qaeda, as we have seen, has launched a horrific series of assaults on innocent Iraqis,'' Mr. Kerry added, referring to an attack on Sunday that killed more than 60 people during the holiday that marks the end of Ramadan.
Hours before Mr. Kerry spoke, another string of car bombs were detonated across Baghdad during the morning commute, killing at least 30 people and wounding more than 60. Among the targets were a hospital and a cafe. Immediately after the bombings, the army and the police tightened security across the capital, bringing traffic to a halt in many areas.
''We have seen the new violence or terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda more frequently, and it has cost many, many lives,'' Mr. Zebari said.
Throughout the Iraq war, Syria was a gateway for Sunni suicide bombers who sought to undermine the Shiite-led government and to attack American troops. When the last of the United States forces left Iraq at the end of 2011, Obama administration officials said they believed that the country would be able to cope with terrorist attacks largely on its own.
But the upheaval in Syria, which has attracted a stream of Sunni extremists, has called that assumption into question.
With none of its own military forces in Iraq, the ability of the United States to train and help the Iraqis fight Al Qaeda is limited. But the United States is trying to assist on several fronts, including the sharing of intelligence to help the Iraqis uncover terrorist cells and avoid indiscriminate wide-scale dragnets that fuel Sunni resentment. During the war, Iraq's counterterrorism forces depended heavily on American military intelligence, which used sophisticated reconnaissance systems and had the ability to locate terrorist threats by intercepting communications.
The Obama administration has also notified Congress in recent weeks that it plans to sell Iraq more than $4 billion in arms, including Stryker armored vehicles and other military systems that are suited for internal security operations.
The country's prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, has pressed the United States to sell Apache attack helicopters to his government. The Obama administration has been considering a number of options, leasing some Apaches to the Iraqis that they could field quickly. Some American lawmakers have been anxious about providing the helicopters for fear they might be used by Mr. Maliki to intimidate political opponents.
''They certainly would help with internal security, but they can also be used to crack down on the population.'' said Nora Bensahel, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. ''The more the terrorist threat increases, the more likely the sale is to go through.''
The Obama administration has also been trying to broker a meeting between the Maliki government and the moderate Syrian opposition. The United States hopes such a meeting will ease the Iraq prime minister's concerns that if President Bashar al-Assad of Syria is ousted, his government will be replaced by a hostile Sunni-dominated government on Iraq's doorstep. It is also hoped that such a meeting would encourage Iraq to be more cooperative in pressing for a transition to a post-Assad administration.
As he did during his visit to Baghdad in March, Mr. Kerry urged the Iraqis to inspect Iranian flights that have been flying weapons to Damascus through Iraqi airspace.
Those deliveries have strengthened Mr. Assad's military position and, critics say, have been quietly tolerated by the Maliki government.
Mr. Zebari insisted that Iraq is not taking sides in the Syria crisis. In a joint statement issued on Thursday, Iraq restated its commitment to prevent ''the transit of weapons through its territory.''
''There has been some progress in this area since my visit to Iraq in March,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''There is very significant progress yet to be made.''

Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Bill Traylor: Drawings From the Collections of the High Museum of Art and the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts' and 'Traylor in Motion: Wonders From New York Collections' (through Sept. 22) The achievement of this great American artist -- a former slave and sharecropper -- unfolds in exceptional side-by-side exhibitions. The hundreds of drawings Traylor made starting in 1939, at 85, while living on the streets of Montgomery, Ala., reveal a natural stylist and a born storyteller who pushed stories of everyday life toward abstraction with no loss of vivacity. At once modern and archaic, Traylor's indelible vision is rich both in its formal invention and its witnessing of the South before the civil rights movement. American Folk Art Museum, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) 
&#x2605; Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'State of Mind: New California Art Circa 1970' (through Sept. 8) California in the 1960s and '70s was one of the weirder places on the planet, home to radical strains of both right- and left-wing politics, a hub of the national defense industry and a breeding ground for alternative cultures from Beat to hippie. It also produced its own strain of Conceptualism, the international art style that valued ideas and actions over things. This Bronx Museum show gives a vivid sense of the West Coast version, with its gawky rawness, sense of moral purpose, humor, and dovetailing of braininess and zaniness. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, the Bronx, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'The Bruce High Quality Foundation: Ode to Joy, 2001-2013' (through Sept. 22) The New York collective of anonymous young artists known as the Bruce High Quality Foundation has generated much buzz and some puzzlement since emerging in 2004. This messy retrospective answers few questions, but brings enough together for provisional assessment. Mostly there are not very provocative parodies of works by famous artists like Picasso and Warhol. The group's best efforts are videos, including a short zombie movie called ''Isle of the Dead'' that exudes an affecting, generational pathos. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Divine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt' (through Dec. 2014) If your dream of heaven is eternity spent with the pets you love, ''Divine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt'' is a show for you. All of its 30 objects, sifted from the museum's renowned Egyptian collection, are of cats, big and little, feral and tame, celestial and not. Whether cast in bronze or carved in stone, their forms and personalities were meant to outlast time, and so they have. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'James Turrell' (through Sept. 25) At once ravishing and hokey, ''Aten Reign,'' the show's centerpiece, turns the museum's famed rotunda into the bliss-out environmental art hit of the summer: an immense, elliptical, nearly hallucinatory play of light and color achieved with elaborate scrims and computerized lighting that might oxymoronically be called a meditative spectacle. Four other installation works from the 1960s and '70s outline the single-minded trajectory of this leading proponent of the Light and Space movement and also provide a simpler, more direct, more mindful experience of, in his words, ''seeing yourself see.'' 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'A Different Kind of Order: The ICP Triennial' (through Sept. 22) The fourth, and best, edition of the International Center of Photography's triennial turns out to be that extremely rare thing in New York City these days, an exhibition of contemporary art for adults. The up-to-the-minute emphasis is on the continuing and enveloping impact of digital technology on photography. The results, as seen here, couldn't be more varied and gripping in content. This is a show that's in touch with the big, live, real world out there beyond Frieze New York. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'Jack Goldstein x 10,000' (through Sept. 29) The first American museum retrospective of this brilliant but elusive artist, organized by the Orange County Museum of Art, is both a celebration and a cautionary tale. It revels in Goldstein's posthumous influence as it reveals the tragic disconnect of his life and his art, the desire to disappear complicated by an intense careerist drive. This exhibition offers (in addition to paintings, sculptures and Goldstein's signature films of the late 1970s) a rare look at the early, performance-based films: works like ''Milk,'' in which the persistent banging of a fist on a table finally topples a glass, or ''Spotlight,'' in which a beam chases the artist around an empty room. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Civil War and American Art' (through Sept. 2) If you've seen ''Photography and the American Civil War'' at the Met, you might suppose that viewing another exhibition about the war would be redundant. It's not. With outstanding works by Frederic Edwin Church, Sanford Robinson Gifford and Winslow Homer, this gripping show sheds expansive light on the nation's experience of its own fratricidal conflict. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Photography and the American Civil War' (through Sept. 2) As intellectually fascinating as it is emotionally wrenching, this exhibition is sure to be remembered as one of the great museum photography shows ever. Its more than 200 photographs include expansive images of battlefields and war-ruined towns; wallet-size portraits of soldiers; preciously framed daguerreotypes; political campaign buttons; a doctor's documents of horrifically wounded soldiers; portraits of loved ones in lockets; and a series depicting the hanging of five co-conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by the photographer Alexander Gardner. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Ken Price: A Retrospective' (through Sept. 22) Tableware? Toys? Genetic accidents? Objets d'art? The ceramic sculptures of Ken Price suggest all these possibilities. To the market's old, divide-and-label query ''Is this art or craft?,'' Price offered one, finessing answer: ''Yes.'' And right he was. You see the rightness instantly in the Met retrospective, which is one of those ideal shows: perfect size, great design (by Frank Gehry), pretty near faultless art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. Ideal, too, in a plainer way, is a concurrent survey of the artist's works on paper, ''Ken Price: Slow and Steady Wins the Race,'' running through Sunday at the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Roof Garden Commission: Imran Qureshi' (through Nov. 3) Visitors to the Met's rooftop will discover something shocking: the stone terrace is splattered with paint the color of dried blood so that it resembles the scene of some terrible crime. Looking closer at the areas of spillage, viewers will find they have been delicately altered. With deft white and red brush strokes, the Pakistani artist Imran Qureshi has worked into the raw paint a pattern suggestive of leafy shrubbery and flower petals, turning the whole into a politically fraught, allegorical mix symbolizing dualities of life and death and hope and despair. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Expo 1: New York' (through Sept. 2) A sprawling, multisite extravaganza including a multitude of installations, shows-within-shows and events, ''Expo 1: New York'' offers few answers but raises many provocative questions about the current and future state of our planet's unsettled human and natural ecology. Attractions at PS1 range from a beautiful show of pictures by the beloved nature photographer Ansel Adams to a refrigerated room containing chunks from an Icelandic glacier by Olafur Eliasson. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Illuminating Faith: The Eucharist in Medieval Life and Art' (through Sept. 15) Spring-into-summer was the season for open-air processions in medieval Europe. The one staged annually for the feast of Corpus Christi, celebrating the bodily presence of Jesus Christ in the bread and wine of the Mass, was among the most ardent, elaborate and politically loaded of all. And it retains all those qualities in this ravishing, superbly documented survey of sacramental imagery, mostly in the form of exquisitely painted books. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Old Masters, Newly Acquired' (through Oct. 6) This celebration of new acquisitions includes about a hundred pre-1900 drawings, all donated, bequeathed or purchased from 2009 to 2012. Dispensing with themes and chronology, the show groups works by patron: Astor, von Bülow and so on. The late-19th-century selections are especially strong; here are not one but two early Degas self-portraits in black chalk; prismatic watercolors by Cézanne and Renoir; a vibrant Gauguin pastel of two Breton girls; and a Seurat horse and landscape in his mossy shadings of conté. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street; (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Subliming Vessel: The Drawings of Matthew Barney' (through Sept. 8) With its Gospels and reliquaries, the Morgan Library is at the right place for the first survey of graphic work by the most medievalizing of American contemporary artists. Encased in thick, pale, plastic frames, Mr. Barney's drawings of the past two decades have the look of precious pages from sacred books displayed on iPads. His images, with their emphasis on redemption through fleshly mortification, suggest sources in heroic epics and penitential religion, filtered through Sade and extreme sports. A display of collagelike storyboards for his films confirms the occult glamour of the personal cosmology he has developed, which feels as artificial and addictive as a video game. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; El Museo del Barrio: 'La Bienal 2013: Here Is Where We Jump' (through Jan. 4) Much of the work by the 37 artists in the seventh edition of El Museo's Bienal is budget-conscious in its materials and modest in size, scaled to small studios. Maybe exactly because of such restrictions, the show is thoughtful and personal, uneven in parts, solid as a whole. It's also a product of that old-fashioned thing, the ethnically specific museum. Even with definitions of ethnicity stretched all kinds of ways -- what does ''Latino'' really mean anymore, anyway? -- the issue of identity remains at the core of such institutions and informs much of the work in this show. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Against the Grain: Wood in Contemporary Art, Craft and Design' (through Sept. 15) This sixth show in the museum's Materials and Process series is a big improvement on its predecessors, mostly because it feels more artist- and designer-driven. Representing the Chelsea gallery contingent are Alison Elizabeth Taylor, with marquetry installations; Phoebe Washburn and Leonardo Drew, with scrap-wood sculptures; and Roy McMakin, with slyly repurposed found furniture. From the design-fair circuit come functional works like Mark Moskovitz's ''Facecord,'' a sideboard that looks like a stack of firewood when the drawers are closed, and Maarten Baas's knife block in the shape of a head (which seems destined for the MoMA design store). 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Ellsworth Kelly: Chatham Series' (through Sept. 8) Together again for the first time in 40 years, the 14 two-panel Chatham paintings from 1971 offer giddy instruction in the weights, measures and balances of strong color -- red, blue, green, yellow, black and white. The works -- abutting rectangles that form an inverted L -- seem to expand or contract as you move around the gallery. An adjoining display of 40 small collages from 1951 shows Mr. Kelly laying out some of the stringent abstract vocabulary that he has mined ever since. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Soundings: A Contemporary Score' (through Nov. 3) Throughout the 20th century, sound art was frontier terrain, staked out by crazies and visionaries: pro-violence Futurists, war-addled Dadaists and out-there beings like Antonin Artaud. You won't find such intensity in this mild-mannered show, which is largely about sculpture and video with sound components. Even so, there's some beautiful work by Jacob Kirkegaard, Camille Norment, Susan Philipsz, Jana Winderen, and the team of Luke Fowler and Toshiya Tsunoda. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Walker Evans: American Photographs' (through Jan. 26) In 1938, the Museum of Modern Art mounted its first one-person photography exhibition: ''American Photographs,'' by Walker Evans. This gripping, 75th-anniversary reprisal of that show presents more than 50 images from that body of work. It is accompanied by a reissue of the original catalog, which includes a wonderfully insightful essay by Evans's friend and supporter Lincoln Kirstein. Together, the show and the book reverberate now in a time when the idea of America is subject to debates as fractious and far-reaching as at any time since the Civil War. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
National Academy Museum: 'Jeffrey Gibson: Said the Pigeon to the Squirrel' (through Sept. 8) The work of Mr. Gibson, an abstract painter who often works on animal hides in homage to his American Indian heritage (he is a member of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and is half Cherokee), embodies two sweeping trends in contemporary art: feverishly bright geometric abstraction and the creative reuse of found objects. The animal hides are stretched over antique mirrors and ironing boards, and even wrapped around fluorescent light tubes in a nod to Dan Flavin. His works have plenty of visual pizazz but can be weak conceptually; the better ones evoke performance of various kinds, from raves to traditional American Indian dances. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Neue Galerie: 'Koloman Moser: Designing Modern Vienna 1897-1907' (through Sept. 2) Along with his better-known colleague, Josef Hoffmann, Moser was a founder of the Wiener Werkstätte, the consortium of designers and artisans that produced some of the 20th century's most beautiful objects. Focusing on Moser's most productive years, this gorgeous exhibition presents more than 200 exquisitely elegant works, including books, glassware, metal pieces, ceramics, jewelry and furniture. 1048 Fifth Avenue at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
New Museum: 'Ellen Gallagher: Don't Axe Me' (through Sept. 15) Ellen Gallagher emerged in the early 1990s with memorable paintings that yoked Minimalism to minstrelsy by scattering tiny caricatures of eyes and mouths across creamy expanses of paper and canvas. More recently she has branched out from painting and collage to film, and from pop-culture imagery to literary and science-fiction references. For ''Osedax'' (2010), made with her partner, Edgar Cleijne, visitors crouch to enter a black-box theater and settle in to view two simultaneous projections: one of glass slides hand-painted with watery abstractions, the other a 16-millimeter film incorporating footage of a shipwreck off Rhode Island. It's the most interesting part of a piecemeal, sometimes arbitrary-feeling show that coincides with a larger retrospective at Tate Modern. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
New Museum: 'Llyn Foulkes' (through Sept. 1) Although poorly organized, this exhibition devoted to a great American original contains several one-of-a-kind masterpieces. Displayed in a small, dark corner room where it glows uncannily, partly by virtue of real lights built into it, ''Pop'' (1985-91) is a 10-foot-wide marvel of comic magic realism and meticulous craftsmanship. In a homey, wood-paneled living room, the main character, a portrait of the middle-aged artist, sits in a paisley-patterned armchair, staring with bugged-out eyes, evidently driven to catatonic paralysis by what he sees on the television. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
New-York Historical Society: 'Swing Time: Reginald Marsh and Thirties New York' (through Sept. 1) A Social Realist with satiric leanings, Marsh (1898-1954) painted the seamy side of life in New York during the Great Depression. Using egg tempera with a skittery touch, he made flickering, cartoonish images in a palette ranging from sooty to garishly bright; he painted burlesque performers, people on busy sidewalks and crowded subway stations, Coney Island amusement seekers and the homeless and destitute. His voyeuristic eye for fiercely self-assertive, full-figured young women adds an intriguing, creepy psychology. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
Rubin Museum of Art: 'Fiercely Modern: Art of the Naga Warrior' (through Sept. 16) The Naga were a diverse collection of peoples speaking similar languages and residing in a mountainous area in northeastern India. Headhunting was one of their most prized pursuits until they were almost entirely Christianized in the early 20th century. They also created extraordinarily beautiful textiles, jewelry and ceremonial objects, as this intriguing, introductory show demonstrates. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Hopper Drawing' (through Oct. 6) With more than 200 drawings, two dozen sketchbook pages and an essential bonus of 21 paintings, this landmark exhibition takes us behind the curtain of stillness that makes Hopper's art so riveting to reveal as never before how he used preparatory studies to synthesize reality, memory and imagination. Some of his greatest paintings -- ''New York Movie,'' ''Nighthawks'' -- and other gems are here. An overview indicates how the young Hopper shaped and toughened his versatile gifts into a singular vision. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'I, YOU, WE' (through Sept. 1) The Whitney's latest collection show (and the last one for the Breuer building before the museum decamps to the meatpacking district) finds artists reacting to AIDS, Reagan-era social policies, urban blight and gentrification, and a stock market boom and bust. Everything here dates from the 1980s and early '90s, otherwise known as the era of identity politics. Included are numerous self-portraits, a room of AIDS-related artworks, and Nan Goldin's 45-minute slide installation ''The Ballad of Sexual Dependency.'' (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Robert Irwin: Scrim Veil -- Black Rectangle -- Natural Light' (through Sept. 1) Before handing its Breuer building over to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney installs one of the masterpieces of Light and Space, if not all Minimalism: an eye-filling yet barely-there low-tech mirage from 1977 that is spectacular in size, but not in its means. Overseen by the chief curator Donna Salvo, it uses a bit of black paint and some polyester scrim anchored by a gallery-long black aluminum beam; it illuminates the very act of perception by simply riffing on the architecture. 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org.

Galleries: Chelsea
'Reinventing Abstraction: New York Painting in the 1980s' (through Aug. 30) This worthy show reconsiders 15 painters who did not fit into fashionable categories in the 1980s. It includes humorously updated Surrealism by Carroll Dunham and Elizabeth Murray; canny play with Modernist devices by Thomas Nozkowski, Jonathan Lasker, Mary Heilmann and David Reed; botanical imagery by Bill Jensen and Terry Winters; gesture and process by Louise Fishman and Pat Steir; abstracted landscapes by Joan Snyder and Stanley Whitney; and enigmatic symbolism by Gary Stephan, Jack Whitten and Stephen Mueller.

Galleries: Other
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info/nyevents. (Smith)
'Lat. 41° 7' N., Long. 72° 19' W' (through Sept. 2) The annual campground-casual show organized by the independent curator Bob Nickas in the Bridgehampton summer home of Jose Martos, an art dealer, and Servane Mary, an artist, was always an odd fit for the fussy, privet-hedged Hamptons. Fortunately, this seasonal event (now in its fourth year) has found a more suitable home on the North Fork, in East Marion, where the couple bought a late-19th-century Victorian on 10 acres abutting the idyllic Dam Pond Maritime Reserve. The show includes many outdoor projects that call attention to the beauty of the landscape. Aaron Suggs's ''Untitled (Transparent Dinghy),'' an almost invisible vessel made of clear acrylic, floats on the pond; nearby, G. William Webb's thin steel hoop frames the water view.

Public Art
&#x2605; Thomas Hirschhorn: 'Gramsci Monument' (through Sept. 15) With the paid help of local residents, Mr. Hirschhorn has built a scruffy, ramshackle complex out of plywood, two-by-fours, blue tarps, brown tape and plexiglass on the grass outside the Forest Houses apartment complex. Resembling a home for postapocalyptic survivors, it has a library stocked with books of political and social theory; a radio station; a space for producing a daily newspaper; a snack bar; a computer room; and a stage for musical and theatrical performances. Improbably, it is all dedicated to the Italian communist and Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci. On the grounds of Forest Houses, Tinton Avenue between 163rd and 165th Streets, Morissania, Bronx; gramsci-monument.com. (Johnson)
Out of Town
Thomas Houseago: 'As I Went Out One Morning' (through Nov. 11) Mr. Houseago's obstreperous, monumental sculptures of exaggeratedly masculine figures rendered in early Modernist styles are too often weighed down by art historical reverence, but the best ones are funny and outlandish. At 15 and a half feet tall, ''Striding Figure II (Ghost)'' is a broad-shouldered, barrel-chested, block-headed colossus made of bronze and steel. It resembles a cinematic monster emerging from a junkyard where some extraterrestrial energy brought it to life. Storm King Art Center, 1 Museum Road, New Windsor, N.Y., (845) 534-3115, stormking.org. (Johnson)
Helen Marten: 'No Borders in a Wok That Can't Be Crossed' (through Sept. 22) The American solo debut of an immoderately gifted young British artist is light, airy and seductive, like rococo postmodernism, and oh-so smart. Sleekly beautiful sculptural arrangements flit among different mediums, segue seamlessly from analog to digital and evoke a world of suave design rife with dazzling new materials. This perfection is thankfully disturbed by well-used found objects and even trash. The totality exposes unexplored territory along the well-worn path between ready-made and remade ready-made. Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Smith)
'Angels, Demons, and Savages: Pollock, Ossorio, Dubuffet' (through Oct. 27) This all-too-rare meeting of Ab-Ex and Art Brut sweeps away myths surrounding both movements and their central figures, Jackson Pollock and Jean Dubuffet, who never met but interacted through the artist and collector Alfonso Ossorio. It pivots around Ossorio (1916-90), a go-between who is fascinating in his own right. His frantic, radiant, spontaneous works on paper -- some made on pieces of torn Tiffany stationery, or whatever was at hand -- are one of the show's revelations. In them, angels, heads of Christ and other Christian icons give off orange and magenta auras or vibrations. Parrish Art Museum, 279 Montauk Highway, Water Mill, N.Y., (631) 283-2118, parrishart.org. (Rosenberg)
Haim Steinbach: 'Once Again the World Is Flat' (through Dec. 20) This overdue 40-year survey celebrates a sculptor who put his own spin on the Duchampian ready-made, and anticipated the current interest in unattached assemblage by displaying domestic items and toys, along with the odd artifact, on jutting Formica-clad shelves. The 80-work show includes many unfamiliar early works and is inserted into a selection of works from the museum's collection, some of which have been absorbed into new Steinbachian arrangements. Hessel Museum of Art at the Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Winslow Homer: Making Art, Making History' (through Sept. 8) Winslow Homer (1836-1910) was America's first great post-God landscape painter. Before the Civil War, successful artists like Frederic Church and Asher B. Durand made pictures of unpopulated New World vistas bathed in transcendental light. In Homer's early landscapes, done when the barbarous war was over, ordinary people -- chic young ladies, sportsmen-hunters and farm kids -- are center stage. Later, the ocean, dark and unfathomable, is his subject. The Clark is especially interesting for its wealth of Homer's journalistic prints. And for a taste of transcendentalism living on, see a blissful selection of landscapes by George Inness (1825-94) in an adjoining gallery.

Last Chance
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (closes on Sunday) Born in Ghana and long a resident of Nigeria, where he maintains a productive studio, El Anatsui has for the past decade been creating spectacularly large, fabriclike sculpture from countless numbers of liquor-bottle caps linked together with twists of copper. The work weaves together ideas about colonialism, politics and economics, and it is absolutely gorgeous. The Brooklyn show, which originated at the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, also includes a number of the artist's earlier and now-overlooked carved wood pieces, which are well worth studying. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; The Cloisters: 'Search for the Unicorn: An Exhibition in Honor of The Cloisters' 75th Anniversary' (closes on Sunday) The lonely subject of the ''Unicorn Tapestries'' is united with others of its species in ''Search for the Unicorn,'' honoring the 75th anniversary of the Cloisters. Drawn from the Met's holdings and from other public and private collections, it includes manuscripts, paintings, decorative objects and ''unicorn horns'' (actually the tapered, spiral-patterned tusks of the narwhal). The show is a gateway to various fantasy worlds, some of them beyond the scope of medieval Western Europe; a page from the ''Shahnama,'' the Persian ''Book of Kings,'' shows the monarch Iskandar (otherwise known as Alexander the Great) fighting off the one-horned, equine Monster of Habash. 99 Margaret Corbin Drive, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 923-3700, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
'Conspicuous Unusable' (closes on Saturday) Deriving its title from the 20th-century philosopher Martin Heidegger, this show of seven artists attests to the persistent romance with art that is barely art, but elegant nonetheless, at least within the frame of the white-walled art gallery. Found objects, industrial materials and assisted ready-mades dominate. High points include six beautiful but blunt-spoken works in crude oil on pasteboard and paper that Dorothea Rockburne made in 1970. Miguel Abreu Gallery, 36 Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 995-1774, miguelabreugallery.com. (Smith)
Jimmy DeSana: 'Party Picks' (closes on Friday) Mr. DeSana's funny and mysteriously erotic photographs from the 1970s and '80s are sampled here. In an image luridly illuminated by red and green lights, a naked man bends over with his feet and hands inserted into red cones. The figure looks like a quadruped in a dream David Lynch might have. ''Sweatshirt'' depicts two pantless men wearing motorcycle helmets with their bodies joined back to back by a single, stretchy red shirt. It appears as if they are performing a goofy gymnastic exercise. Salon 94 Bowery, 243 Bowery, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 979-0001, salon94.com. (Johnson)
Martín Gutierrez: 'Martin(e)' (closes on Friday) Just a year out of Rhode Island School of Design with a bachelor of fine arts in printmaking, Martín Gutierrez is having a strong first New York show, and printmaking has nothing to do with it, though photography, video, performance, fashion, music do. In a series of photographs, he acts the roles of female sex dolls that are dressed and posed to fulfill specific fantasies. In three short videos he stars as Martine who, after introducing herself with the mantralike statement ''There's something to be said for those who get what they want,'' wanders an empty-looking city in search of fulfillment. Ryan Lee Gallery, 527 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 397-0742, ryanleegallery.com. (Cotter)
Luis Molina-Pantin: 'Modus Operandi' (closes on Saturday) Luis Molina-Pantin's photographs of Disneyesque drug-baron mansions in Colombia are standouts in the International Center of Photography's terrific 2013 triennial. In a solo show at Henrique Faria Fine Art we are given a larger context for an artist, based in Caracas, Venezuela, who specializes in images that simultaneously project and undercut illusions of confident social and political power. 35 East 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 517-4609, henriquefaria.com. (Cotter)
'Photo Brut: As Collected by David Winter' (closes next Friday) This often tumultuous array of anonymous photographs collected by a private dealer has considerable social, psychological and aesthetic reach. It includes mug shots, images of car crashes and a chain gang, and small snapshots, the best of which show people experimenting with mirrors. Commercial photographs promote candy, trailer frames, chairs and tightly coiffed hairdos. The rough and random snapshot of America at midcentury or earlier that accumulates is perfectly characterized by the title. ZieherSmith, 516 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 229-1088, ziehersmith.com. (Smith)
Eliot Porter (closes on Friday) Trained in medicine, the photographer Eliot Porter (1901-90) brought a quiet naturalism to the dye-transfer print, a technique more closely associated with in-your-face colorists like William Eggleston. His muted shots, which have been published in photography books alongside Thoreau's writings, seem to flatten out the landscape without reducing its meditative complexity. (In that, they have much in common with the paintings of his brother, Fairfield Porter.) This exhibition of vintage prints, organized by Jack Macrae and Kristoffer Haynes, includes some lush, accomplished and wonderfully unobtrusive images of nesting birds and unruly thickets of foliage. Paula Cooper, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Rosenberg)
'Snap Noir: Snapshot Stories From the Collection of Robert E. Jackson' (closes on Wednesday) The 51 anonymous snapshots in this exhibition, arranged in six groupings, explore photography as a private act while reflecting an impeccable eye. Some groupings feature images of one person taken by another, often in the same setting, providing especially intimate glimpses of relationships. Others were assembled and arranged by Mr. Jackson, including a sequence of 21 especially strange, often surreal images whose stand-alone power traduces most notions of short story. Pace/MacGill Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, ninth floor, Manhattan, (212) 759-7999, pacemacgill.com. (Smith)
Hank Willis Thomas (closes next Friday) This show includes some recent sculptures and photographic pieces by an artist who has made the complexities of race and the pathologies of racism his subject. These themes are directly addressed in the exhibition's major piece, the five-channel video installation ''Question Bridge: Black Males,'' conceived by the artist Chris Johnson, and created in its present form by him, Mr. Thomas, Bayeté Ross Smith and Kamal Sinclair. Consisting of interviews with some 150 African-American men, the video grapples, optimistically and pessimistically, with questions about why racism in America exists, and how, and if, it can be changed.

HEADLINE: Easy Credit Dries Up, Choking Growth in China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Patrick Zuo contributed research.

 BODY:
SHENMU, China -- As the Chinese economy boomed, few cities soared faster or higher than Shenmu, a community of nearly 500,000 in northwestern China.
Top luxury clothing stores in this city's downtown were recording as much as $500,000 a day in sales. Tables at the best restaurants had to be reserved weeks in advance. The new Fortune Garden Club for the city's business elite made headlines by paying $1 million for a king-size mahogany bed, to be used by members and their companions.
But a painful credit crisis is now spreading across Shenmu and cities nearby, as thousands of businesses have closed, fleets of BMWs and Audis have been repossessed and street protests have erupted.
Now the leading purveyors of Western fashions are deserted, monthly sales at restaurants are down as much as 97 percent and the marble entrance to the Fortune Garden Club is shuttered. All but one of the city's car dealerships have failed. 
The owner of the city's largest jewelry store was detained by the authorities a week ago after creditors found him secretly packing millions of dollars' worth of gold and jewels into cases and accused him of preparing to flee the city without settling his debts. A top restaurant closed a day earlier, and its owner left town, as have the founder of the Fortune Garden and many other executives.
''It's an economic crisis just like the United States has had; just like it,'' said Wang Ting, an operator of an illegal casino in Fugu, near Shenmu. ''There's no cash, everyone stays home without a job, there's no way the economy can recover.''
Shenmu, and nearby cities like Ordos and Fugu, are at the leading edge of broader troubles that are beginning to afflict the entire Chinese economy. Across China, growth has slowed. With the slowdown have come rising defaults on loans made outside the conventional banking system, chronic overcapacity in many industries like coal mining and steel production and, in particularly troubled cities like Shenmu, a sharp decline in previously debt-fueled prices for real estate and other assets.
The cracks are showing in many sizable cities like coastal Wenzhou, where informal lending, a big part of so-called shadow banking, has dominated for a quarter-century. Cities with economies linked to commodities with falling prices have also been affected, as more people have defaulted on loans. The biggest, most economically diverse metropolitan areas like Beijing and Shanghai seem considerably less affected, but also have many small and medium-size businesses that depend on informal lending.
Lending has collapsed here in northern Shaanxi Province, where it was particularly speculative and frenzied, and where the local coal industry has also been crippled by steeply falling prices.
As some borrowers began defaulting early this year, worried lenders in the informal sector raised interest rates for small and medium-size businesses, previously 25 to 40 percent a year, to as much as 125 percent a year. The increase set off a much broader wave of defaults in recent weeks, as owners found themselves unable to repay billions of dollars in bad debts, many of them handwritten and hard to enforce in court.
''Almost no one will give you a loan,'' said a construction executive who gave only his surname, Xie, as he stood next to his white Toyota Land Cruiser outside a project that had been halted.
Although changes are being slowly introduced, state-owned banks have long been allowed to lend only at low, regulated rates barely above the inflation rate, with the total value of loans controlled by quarterly quotas. All over China, these loans go overwhelmingly to large state-owned businesses, government officials and politically connected individuals, who then relend the money at much higher interest rates to small and medium-size businesses in the private sector that need money to grow.
Liu Linfei, a government official from nearby Yulin, stood on a Shenmu street corner in a T-shirt and shorts on a recent weekend afternoon, outside two high-rise hotels where construction had been stopped just before the windows could be installed. He said he had borrowed 600,000 renminbi, almost $100,000, from a bank shortly before the collapse, at an interest rate of 4.1 percent a year.
Mr. Liu then lent the cash to moneylenders here at an interest rate of 10.4 percent, planning to pocket the difference.
The moneylenders who borrowed from Mr. Liu defaulted, and now he is struggling to repay the bank. ''I'm not going to lose my house, because I'm repaying it little by little with money I borrow from my relatives,'' he said.
The Chinese are finding it harder to repay loans because the economy is slowing. Most analyses of China's economy look only at the real economic growth rate, around 7.5 percent this year. But for companies' sales and profits, which determine their ability to repay debts, what really matters is the nominal growth rate, which is real economic growth plus inflation.
Private sector businesses could afford to borrow at double-digit interest rates because nominal growth of 16 to 23 percent a year from 2004 through 2011 exceeded the rates. But nominal growth slowed last year to 9.8 percent and fell again in the first half of this year, to an annual pace of 8.8 percent.
At the same time, overinvestment led to overcapacity. Dozens of new mines opened around Shenmu in the last decade and older mines expanded. But demand has grown much more slowly than expected for electricity and steel, the two main users of coal.
Coal prices have dropped by half in the last three years as a result. Now, out of 90 mines near Shenmu, practically the only ones still operating are nine that are state-owned and do not need to show a profit.
The popping of the real estate bubble has been the most serious blow to the local economy. Real estate prices had soared in cities across China. In Shenmu, 1,200-square-foot apartments that sold for less than $20,000 a decade ago reached $330,000 by last winter.
Local real estate brokers say that they are advising sellers to avoid price cuts of more than 10 percent. But local business owners who buy and sell apartments say that deals are now being done for as little as $115,000 for a 1,200-square-foot apartment, a decline of 65 percent.
Public discontent is fueling street protests. Several thousand residents turned out in mid-July for a demonstration in the expensively paved square across the street from city hall, demanding that municipal officials revive the stalled economy. More recently, a smaller group of migrant workers protested, demanding that the local government pay their back wages after construction was halted on a row of high-rise apartment buildings.
Yet a Shenmu merchant, who insisted on anonymity because of local tensions, said that he had a lot of sympathy for officials, who even put up banners on city streets last year warning residents of the dangers of participating in informal lending schemes.
''It's a national problem, it's not a local issue,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Debut of School Standards Is Rocky, and the Critics Are Pouncing Left and Right

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
The Common Core, a set of standards for kindergarten through high school that has been ardently supported by the Obama administration and many business leaders and state legislatures, is facing growing opposition from both the right and the left even before it has been properly introduced into classrooms.
Tea Party conservatives, who reject the standards as an unwelcome edict from above, have called for them to be severely rolled back.
Indiana has already put a brake on them. The Michigan House of Representatives is holding hearings on whether to suspend them. And citing the cost of new tests requiring more writing and a significant online component, Georgia and Oklahoma have withdrawn from a consortium developing exams based on the standards.
At the same time, a group of parents and teachers argues that the standards -- and particularly the tests aligned with them -- are simply too difficult. 
Those concerns were underscored last week when New York State, an early adopter of the new standards, released results from reading and math exams showing that less than a third of students passed.
''I am worried that the Common Core is in jeopardy because of this,'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. ''The shock value that has happened has been so traumatic in New York that you have a lot of people all throughout the state saying, 'Why are you experimenting on my kids?' ''
Supporters worry that opposition could start to snowball as states face new exams in 2014-15.
''The danger here is that you have two kinds of problems going on,'' said Kati Haycock, president of the Education Trust, a nonprofit group that works to close achievement gaps. ''One is a Tea Party problem, which doesn't have deep roots but does have lots of political muscle behind it, and then you've got a bit of anti-test rebellion coming from the left. The question is what's going to happen if they both get together. That's the more terrifying prospect.''
The standards, which were written by a panel of experts convened by governors and state superintendents, focus on critical thinking and analysis rather than memorization and formulas.
The idea is to help ensure that students generally learn the same things in public schools across the country.
One goal is to reduce high remediation rates at colleges and universities and help students compete for jobs that demand higher levels of skills than in previous generations.
According to some estimates, about 40 percent of students entering college must take remedial courses before they can enroll in credit-bearing classes. Nancy L. Zimpher, chancellor of the State University of New York, said the system spends about $70 million a year conducting catch-up courses for students.
The Obama administration promoted the Common Core by giving priority to states that adopted ''college and career ready'' standards when it awarded grants under its Race to the Top program. By last summer, 45 states and the District of Columbia had adopted the standards.
But even many who support them are wary about how they have been adopted. David Cohen, an English teacher at Palo Alto High School in California who described the standards as ''reasonable,'' said that among colleagues, ''the resistance and the anger and frustration are still coming largely, but not entirely, from the process.''
Secretary of Education Arne Duncan has repeatedly emphasized that states, districts and teachers have broad flexibility to devise their own curriculums and lesson plans based on the standards.
Speaking about the Common Core to the American Society of News Editors in June, Mr. Duncan said: ''The federal government didn't write them, didn't approve them, and doesn't mandate them. And we never will. Anyone who says otherwise is either misinformed or willfully misleading.''
Last year Kentucky became the first state to give new math and reading tests based on the Common Core, and as in New York, the levels of students deemed proficient fell sharply compared with a year earlier.
Such results have spooked teachers watching from afar, particularly as more states are moving to evaluate teachers in part on student test scores.
''Looking at the types of questions on these tests, I'm scared for my kids,'' said Lisa Mims, a fifth-grade teacher at Pleasantville Elementary School in New Castle, Del. ''It just seems to me that it's what they're asking us to do in such a little bit of time, and then saying we're going to test this.''
In an interview, Mr. Duncan acknowledged that the transition would be difficult. ''It's easier to keep saying everything's looking great,'' he said. ''Potemkin village, whitewash the walls. That's the easy way to do it, but I'm not quite sure that changes kids' lives or helps our country remain competitive economically.''
According to a report from the Center on Education Policy at George Washington University, teachers in 30 states are already teaching some lessons based on the standards. But only 10 states reported that more than three-quarters of teachers had received any Common Core training in the most recent school year.
Supporters of the new standards say critics are too impatient.
''It's going to take time, and it's going to take a lot of work,'' said David Driscoll, former commissioner of education in Massachusetts, which raised its own standards in the late 1990s and faced a falloff in state test scores before seeing them steadily climb. Today, Massachusetts leads the country in scores on exams administered by the federal Department of Education and ranks close to some countries frequently cited as world leaders in academic performance.
Several states have conducted teacher training as well as public outreach. In Tennessee, state education officials offered sessions to about 30,000 teachers this summer, and in Delaware, Mark Murphy, the secretary of education, said that school districts would be hosting ''back to school'' nights where legislators can ''take part in a Common Core lesson to see and experience the type of learning that the students will be getting.''
Some critics say the new standards are simply unrealistic. ''We're using a very inappropriate standard that's way too high,'' said Diane Ravitch, an education historian who served in President George W. Bush's Education Department but has since become an outspoken critic of many education initiatives. ''I think there are a lot of kids who are being told that if they don't go to college that it will ruin their life,'' she said. ''But maybe they don't need to go to college.''
By contrast, Kristal Doolin, a middle school English teacher in Corbin, Ky., a rural area in the southeast corner of the state, said teachers should expect more of their students.
''I feel like if we lower our expectations, they will follow what we model,'' said Ms. Doolin, who was selected Kentucky Teacher of the Year for 2013. ''If you teach the way we've taught for years and years, basically we're robbing our kids of the future.''

HEADLINE: Dell's Profit Declines 72% On Sluggish Sales of PCs

BYLINE: By BRIAN X. CHEN

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Decades ago, Dell gained fame as a maker of affordable, customizable computers. But it missed the industrywide shift toward smartphones and tablets.
The company's financial earnings report on Thursday reflected that mistake.
Dell reported net income of $204 million for its fiscal second quarter, down 72 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Revenue was $14.5 billion, about flat from the same period a year ago, but better than the $14.18 billion that Wall Street had expected, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.
On an adjusted basis, excluding certain costs, charges and other items, Dell's net income was 25 cents a share, a penny better than expectations, according to Thomson Reuters. 
''In a challenging environment, we remain committed to our strategy and our customers, and we're encouraged by increasing customer interest in our end-to-end solutions offerings and continued growth in our Enterprise Solutions, Services and Software businesses,'' Brian Gladden, Dell's chief financial officer, said in a statement.
Dell's shrinking income mirrors slowing sales of personal computers at a time when many people are buying tablets instead. To keep its momentum going, Dell cut prices for many of its products but sacrificed profit margins.
The company's revenue for its end-user computing business, which includes personal computers, accessories and third-party software, was $9.1 billion, down 5 percent from the year-earlier period.
Shipments of PCs were down slightly from last year. For the second quarter, Dell shipped about 8.98 million PCs, compared with 9.35 million in the year-earlier period, according to Gartner, the research firm. Dell remains the No. 3 PC seller with about 12 percent of the market, trailing Lenovo, which has 16.7 percent and Hewlett-Packard, with 16.3 percent.
IDC, another research firm, noted that Dell's shipments over the quarter improved in the United States, where it climbed above 3.8 million units for the first time since 2011. However, sales struggled in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan, IDC said.
The one area that showed strong growth for Dell was enterprise computing, which brought in revenue of $3.3 billion, up 8 percent from the quarter a year ago. Revenue grew from sales of networking hardware and server equipment.
Dell is not the only company that is watching computer sales evaporate. Sales of personal computers worldwide dropped to 76 million in the second quarter, a 10.9 percent decrease from the year-earlier quarter, according to Gartner.
Mikako Kitagawa, a Gartner analyst, said low-cost tablets were eating into the sales of low-end PCs in mature markets. In economically disadvantaged markets, a cheaper tablet is the first computing device many people buy, she added.
''While Windows 8 has been blamed by some as the reason for the PC market's decline,'' Ms. Kitigawa said, ''we believe this is unfounded.''
She said Windows 8 did not explain why the decline had been happening for several quarters, nor did it address why sales of Apple's personal computers, which run exclusive Mac software instead of Windows, were shrinking as well.
Dell reported earnings against the backdrop of a proposal from its founder, Michael Dell, to take the company private. His plan is to refocus the company on cloud computing by selling crucial components like networking hardware, servers, storage and software, without the pressure of Wall Street.
Mr. Dell's offer has run into opposition, namely from Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire activist investor who says the founder is trying to buy the company for less than it is worth. Mr. Icahn recently sued the board over its decision to accept a higher buyout offer from Mr. Dell in exchange for changing the rules for voting on the deal.
The company's shareholders are scheduled to vote on Mr. Dell's bid of $24.4 billion, or $13.65 a share, on Sept. 12.

HEADLINE: Job and Price Data May Signal the End for Federal Stimulus

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell close to a six-year low last week, and consumer prices rose broadly in July.
Government reports on Thursday suggested an acceleration in job growth in early August and hinted at pockets of pricing power in the sluggish economy. The data could ease concerns among some Federal Reserve officials that inflation has been too low and the job market too weak, drawing the central bank closer to tapering off its economic stimulus program.
While statistics on manufacturing were less encouraging, economists were little fazed and said they merely suggested that the improvement in factory activity was slower than anticipated. 
''It looks like the weakness in employment last month was a fluke, and the breadth of gains'' in the Consumer Price Index suggest that ''there will be less pushback against tapering because of low inflation,'' said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics. ''A September taper is still on the table.''
The Fed has indicated that it wants to wind down its monthly purchase of $85 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, perhaps by September.
First-time applications for state unemployment benefits dropped 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 320,000, the lowest level since October 2007, the Labor Department said. Economists had expected initial claims to come in at 335,000 last week.
The four-week moving average of new jobless claims, which irons out week-to-week volatility, fell to its lowest level since November 2007.
Carl Riccadonna, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said the drop in new jobless claims to prerecession levels was consistent with a pickup in the pace of hiring, if not in August, then at some time in the next couple of months.
''The critical component is going to be the August jobs report,'' he said. ''If that comes in at least where it was in July, then this is going to keep the Fed on track to initiate tapering at the September meeting'' of the Fed's policy makers.
Employers added 162,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, with the unemployment rate dropping to 7.4 percent.
In another report, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent last month, in line with economists' expectations, as the cost of goods and services including tobacco, apparel and food increased.
The C.P.I. gained 0.5 percent in June. In the 12 months through July, the C.P.I. advanced 2 percent, the largest annualized increase since February, after rising 1.8 percent in June.
The rise in inflation to the Fed's 2 percent target suggested that the downward drift in prices seen early in the year was over, which could comfort some central bank officials who have warned about the potential dangers of inflation running too low.
Even stripping out energy and food, the core rate of consumer prices still rose 0.2 percent for a third consecutive month. That took the increase over the last 12 months to 1.7 percent after core C.P.I. gained 1.6 percent in June.
The uptick in prices fits with the view of Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, who has said he considers the low inflation temporary.
James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who has voiced concern that inflation was still too low, said he was encouraged by July's rise in consumer prices.
''To the extent that you have got higher inflation numbers in this report, that would be bolstering the notion that inflation would be naturally moving back toward target,'' Mr. Bullard told reporters in Louisville, Ky.
Last month, there were increases in the prices of gasoline, transportation and shelter. Medical care services recorded a second month of gains in July. Medical care, which makes up about 10 percent of the core C.P.I., was subdued in April and May.
The news on the factory sector was a bit downbeat, with the Fed reporting that manufacturing output slipped 0.1 percent last month, held down by a 1.7 percent fall in the production of motor vehicles and machinery. That, together with a drop in utilities production, left industrial output unchanged in July.
Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its Empire State general business conditions index fell to 8.24 in August from 9.46 in July. A reading above zero indicates expansion. But details of the report were fairly encouraging, with strong gains in the labor market.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Bring Gas Mileage Rules to Era Of Hybrids

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Federal regulators are planning changes to vehicle fuel-economy ratings after the Ford Motor Company said Thursday that it was cutting the miles-per-gallon rating on one of its popular hybrid models.
The Environmental Protection Agency said it would update its labeling rules -- which date to the 1970s -- to resolve disparities among the growing number of hybrid and electric vehicles on the market.
''E.P.A. welcomes this emerging trend and will be working with consumer advocates, environmental organizations and auto manufacturers to propose revised fuel-economy testing regulations to ensure that consumers are consistently given the accurate fuel economy information on which they have come to rely,'' the agency said in a statement. 
The move comes as more consumers and analysts are challenging the accuracy of government fuel-economy stickers on new models. At the same time, automakers are pushing to improve fuel economy as strict new government mileage standards are phased in.
In Ford's case, the automaker said it would reduce the stated fuel economy of its C-Max hybrid utility vehicle to 43 miles per gallon from 47 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving.
A Ford executive said Thursday that the company was voluntarily reducing the rating, and would offer cash payments to C-Max owners as reimbursement for additional fuel consumption.
Raj Nair, Ford's head of global product development, said that reducing the rating would allay the concerns of consumers who are not achieving the previously stated fuel-economy number.
''We are taking actions with our popular C-Max hybrid so that customers are even more satisfied with their vehicle's on-road fuel efficiency performance,'' he said.
Ford said it would make a good will payment of $550 to any customer who bought the current C-Max model and $325 to consumers who leased one.
Industry analysts said Ford had to address the growing concerns over the reliability of its fuel-economy claims.
''Ford wouldn't take such a drastic step if it didn't feel that it was absolutely necessary, even if it's just to protect its image,'' said John O'Dell, green-car analyst at the auto-research site Edmunds.com.
It is not clear how much the consumer campaign will cost Ford, the nation's second-largest automaker behind General Motors.
Mr. Nair said the company had sold about 32,000 C-Max hybrids since it was introduced last year.
Like most conventional hybrids, the C-Max hybrid is alternately powered by a gasoline engine and a battery. The system allows the vehicle to consume considerably less fuel than a car equipped solely with a gas engine.
The current fuel economy rules specify that automakers can use the same fuel-economy numbers for similar-size vehicles equipped with the same engines and transmissions.
The government requires automakers to test the fuel economy of the biggest-selling model in a specific category. In its midsize hybrid class, for example, Ford tested the Fusion sedan version because it was the top seller.
When the Fusion hybrid achieved 47 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving, Ford was allowed to apply that rating to the C-Max hybrid as well.
But consumers and automotive publications have questioned whether the C-Max hybrid could achieve that rating. Ford also faces several lawsuits that challenge the vehicle's fuel-efficiency claims.
Mr. Nair said that many variables can affect the real-world fuel economy of a hybrid vehicle, including weather conditions and driving behavior. ''With hybrids, there is a lot more variability,'' he said.
He added that it was difficult to make an exact comparison between the C-Max, a utility vehicle with a chunky design, and the sleeker-looking Fusion passenger car.
Ford expects to improve the C-Max hybrid's fuel efficiency when a revamped version of the vehicle is introduced at the end of this year.
In the meantime, the company hopes the cash payments to consumers and its revised mileage sticker will defuse the controversy surrounding the C-Max.
''Our actions enhance Ford's commitment to fuel-economy leadership, Mr. Nair said.
The competition among auto companies on fuel-economy claims is intense, particularly as more hybrid models and electrified vehicles are introduced.
Last year, the South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia had to back down on inflated fuel-economy claims after the government found the companies had submitted flawed test results.
Automakers are also rapidly changing their vehicle fleets to meet more stringent government fuel-economy requirements in the future. Besides bringing out more hybrids and electric models, the companies are shrinking the size of regular gas engines and trimming weight wherever they can.
But the emphasis on fuel economy also comes at a time when consumers are becoming more sophisticated and aware of vehicle performance -- including gas-mileage targets. On newer electric and hybrid models, for example, drivers can see on the dashboard display exactly how many miles per gallon the vehicle is achieving.
The E.P.A. did not specify a time frame for proposing changes to fuel-economy labeling requirements. But the agency said revisions were necessary because of the rapid pace of innovation in the industry, particularly for hybrid models.
''These vehicles are more sensitive to small design differences than conventional vehicles because advanced, highly efficient vehicles use to so little fuel,'' the agency said.

HEADLINE: Report Finds a City Incentive Is Not Producing Enough Affordable Housing

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
For years, New York City has tried to create more affordable housing by encouraging developers to include apartments for low- and middle-income households in return for being allowed to construct bigger buildings.
But a new report by the office of City Councilman Brad Lander, a Brooklyn Democrat and housing expert, says that that strategy is producing too few affordable units and that the city should require developers to build more of them.
The report, to be released on Friday by Mr. Lander and the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, which represents nonprofit groups that promote affordable housing, found that the optional program known as inclusionary zoning had generated about 2,700 permanently affordable units since 2005, or less than 2 percent of all apartments developed in the city during the same period. 
Under the program, the city allows developers of market-rate housing to build more units than would normally be allowed when neighborhoods are rezoned for new development, as long as they make 20 percent of the new homes affordable.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the real estate industry have favored the exchange of more density for affordable set-asides on a voluntary basis. But affordable housing advocates and some mayoral candidates argue that the time has come for mandatory programs to make a dent in the housing shortage for low-income New Yorkers.
Figures released this year by New York University's Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy show that the median monthly rent in New York City rose by 8.5 percent from 2007 to 2011, even as real wages -- wages that have been adjusted for inflation -- dropped in the recent recession. As a result, 31 percent of New Yorkers paid 50 percent or more of their income in rent and utilities by 2011 and were considered ''severely'' rent burdened, according to the center.
''It's a moment of crisis,'' said Mr. Lander, an advocate for low-income housing and a former director of the Pratt Center for Community Development, a policy and planning group. ''People are desperate for affordability, and there's a mismatch between the anxiety people have and the policy tools that are available.''
Among the front-runners in the mayoral race, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, said she supported the idea of mandatory set-asides but has said that there may be questions about the legality of such a program. Some lawyers said it could be challenged by developers because the value of the affordable units might be less than their construction cost.
But Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate, argues in his housing platform for ''converting incentives to hard-and-fast rules,'' saying that 50,000 additional affordable units could be built over 10 years with a mandatory program.
The report by Mr. Lander's staff, which used city data from 2005 to June of this year, found that most of the affordable units built under inclusionary zoning provisions were on Manhattan's West Side and along the waterfront of the Williamsburg and Greenpoint sections of Brooklyn, where they represented 13 percent to 19 percent of total units built. But in two dozen other areas where the zoning was allowed, the report said, only 6 percent of residential development was deemed affordable, defined as suitable for those with incomes of $68,700 or less.
Officials with the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development said that the economic downturn of recent years had affected participation from developers but that interest in the program had been picking up of late. They said that any discussion of making it mandatory would need to address how the requirements might affect development in certain neighborhoods. ''Would it be an incentive to develop?'' Eric Bederman, a spokesman for the department, said. ''We stand by the success we've had with the inclusionary program.''

HEADLINE: Iran's Clerics Remain the Problem

BYLINE: By RAY TAKEYH

 BODY:
One of the enduring aspects of Washington's Iran debate is its wild oscillations between the hysteria of war and the euphoria of reconciliation.
The Islamic Republic has a new president: He smiles and pledges soothing moderation. The jaded envoys who have been struggling with the Iran issue for the past decade -- a period that included Hassan Rouhani's stewardship of the nuclear file -- are suddenly optimistic.
It is important to remember, however, that the American diplomats dealing with Iran suffer from a fundamental confusion about the nature of the Islamist state. The United States is accustomed to dealing with opportunistic Arab rulers but not with clerics who take their ideologies seriously. At times, reasonable men have reached high office in the Persian theocratic state only to have their pragmatism numbed by its founding ideology. It remains to be seen whether Rouhani can transcend the obstacles that bedeviled his predecessors. 
The Arab world has seen many despotic rulers whose lust for power was expressed in language of ideologies they did not fully understand. Gamal Abdel Nasser spoke of Arab socialism, while the essence of his plan was the glorification of Egypt and himself as the region's strongman. Saddam Hussein and both Assads unfurled the banner of Baathism to justify their blood-soaked regimes, even though there is scant evidence they had read the Baathists' turgid tomes.
Given these dictators' shallow ideological commitments, their strategic alignments often proved fluid. All these rulers were willing to deal with the United States if it served their aims.
But the Iranian revolution of 1979 introduced a regime unique in the modern Middle East. The Islamic Republic has a mission of redeeming the region for the forces of righteousness. Despite the costs and burdens, Persian Iran has struggled against a range of what it perceives to be iniquitous forces, particularly the United States and its allies. It sees itself as a vanguard state led by a dedicated cadre that will lead the subjugated masses toward justice and salvation. Anti-imperialism and anti-Zionism are the touchstones of its orthodoxy.
And yet no country can live on ideology alone. Iran has had to operate its economy, deal with regional demands, and even transact unsavory bargains with adversaries. When granted the opportunity, Iran's youth and middle class vote for politicians who promise relief. A segment of the theocracy has sought to smooth the hard edges of their creed and respond to the populace's yearning for a normal life. Presidents ranging from the corrupt Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to the reformist Mohammad Khatami hoped to chart a new course and balance the revolution's mandates with their constituents' tangible concerns. All of them failed to square this circle.
Enter Rouhani, the latest politician to undertake this most difficult of balancing acts. Unfortunately, his guile and initiatives are bound to be circumscribed by the regime's ideology.
One of the tragedies of the Islamic Republic is that its pragmatism often emanates from offices subordinate to the unelected power centers. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and his Praetorian Guard continue to proclaim the virtues of resistance and are mindful of those who don't share their zeal. Iran's shattered economy and simmering discontent may have caused Khamenei to concede to Rouhani's election. He may even offer him some leeway in mitigating the nuclear crisis. But the supreme leader will remain an important obstacle to the president's designs.
America is used to dealing with cynical Arab rulers who casually betray whatever principle they proclaim for their own benefit. As the saying goes, these are men one can do business with. Rather, it is the ideologues who have often puzzled Washington, for they seldom engage in judicious cost-benefit assessments. The Islamic Republic may not be the radical actor it was in the 1980s, but neither is it a state ruled by modest men who happen to drape themselves in clerical garb.
In the coming months, Rouhani and his diplomats will inevitably profess their readiness to deal in earnest. The possibility of a limited deal addressing some of the more urgent aspects of Iran's nuclear program should not be ruled out. If such a deal is done, then it must be welcomed. But standing behind these deliberations will be the untrusting Ayatollah Khamenei and his allies who will always need an American nemesis to justify their ideology to themselves.

HEADLINE: Fracking Debate Fractures Britain

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
LONDON -- Over the years, Britain has shown itself to be cozy enough in its trans-Atlantic ties to follow the United States into all kinds of dangerous spots, from Iraq to Afghanistan. Now, eyeing the American energy revolution that has come with ''fracking'' to unlock a bonanza of oil and natural gas, Prime Minister David Cameron has again lofted his banner to tread where America has led.
But this newest campaign resonates in a different, not-in-my-backyard kind of way. His quest to emulate the United States' success in hydraulic fracturing to tap underground reserves is much closer to home, touching the emotive ties that bind an island nation to its land and evoking a resistance to technological advance recalling the Luddites who battled change in the textile industry in the early 19th century. 
The prime minister's vision of bountiful energy supplies from subterranean shale rock plays into the delicate politics of persuading his Conservative followers in the well-padded southeast of the country to accept his argument that, as he put it, ''the huge benefits of shale gas outweigh any very minor changes to the landscape.''
And his advocacy of the new technology, which opponents say risks poisoning groundwater and damaging the environment in other ways, has provoked a collision of faith and economics. Clerics in the northwest -- seen as an abundant source of shale gas -- have called on congregants to answer to their God and ''engage in biblical and theological discussion about their responsibility as stewards of the earth.''
Politically speaking, thus, the debate over fracking may be just as perilous as the hazards of military adventures in far-flung lands.
Robert Woollard, the head of a network of the party's supporters, said recently that Conservative leaders risked ''alienating their own voters by going hammer and tongs for fracking.''
Mr. Cameron offered his most unequivocal endorsement of fracking in an article in The Daily Telegraph.
''If we don't back this technology, we will miss a massive opportunity to help families with their bills and make our country more competitive,'' Mr. Cameron said, promoting the new technology as a means of reversing dependence on energy imports as Britain's North Sea reserves dwindle.
''Even if we see only a fraction of the impact shale gas has had in America, we can expect to see lower energy prices in this country.''
But the discussion of fracking and its potential environmental impact is not limited to economics. If Continental Europeans bond with their lands in almost mystic ways, from the invocation of La France Profonde to the somber pull of Germany's forests, Britain's approach has always been marked by a struggle between tradition and revolutionary technology and by the competing claims of rich and poor.
In the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, a sharp-elbowed material culture -- evoked, for some, in the poet William Blake's depiction of ''dark Satanic Mills'' -- supplanted an earlier generation's reverence for unspoiled nature.
Coal mines and steel plants, railroads and cramped row houses spread a patina of modernity across the land, particularly in the industrial north.
Those enamored of older ways bridled at the transformation wrought by the steam engine and the factories.
As William Wordsworth, the high priest of Romantic Britain's worship of natural phenomena, wrote:
The world is too much with us; late and soon, Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers; Little we see in Nature that is ours; We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
As in that era, the fracking debate has conjured social distinctions between the hardscrabble north and the more bucolic south, where protests against fracking in leafy West Sussex have already signaled a broader opposition.
Last month, a conservative peer, Lord David Howell of Guildford, south of London, declared blithely that ''there are large, uninhabited and desolate areas, certainly in parts of the northeast, where there is plenty of room for fracking, well away from anybody's residence, and where it could be conducted without any threat to the rural environment.''
The fact that Lord Howell is the father-in-law of Britain's Conservative chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, an advocate of fracking, only deepened the impression of a north-south contest cemented in place by political rivalries. The southeast is generally seen as part of the Conservative heartland, while the Labour opposition trawls for votes in the north.
''Neville Chamberlain spoke of pre-war Czechoslovakia as a faraway country of which we know nothing,'' a Labour peer, Lord Jeremy Beecham, snapped back in response to Lord Howell's comments, referring to the pre-war British leader accused of appeasing Adolf Hitler in his annexation of the Sudetenland.
''Lord Howell clearly has a similar view on the northeast, and his comments once again highlight the Tories' problem with the north.''
Such was the outcry from people living in the northeast that Lord Howell withdrew his remarks, although a couple of days later he said that what he had really meant to say was that fracking should take place in the northwest -- the location of, among other things, the Lake District National Park and areas under the diocesan tutelage of those same Anglican clerics who threatened their own crusade against fracking.
''Natural gas extraction is increasingly presenting people with a choice between economic gain and a healthy environment,'' the clerics in Lancashire said. Their complaint had a particular point: Fracking tests in the northwest, near the blue-collar resort of Blackpool, in 2011 were found by investigators to be the probable cause of small earthquakes.
The north-south brouhaha was enough to persuade Mr. Cameron to insist that ''we want all parts of our nation to share in the benefits: north or south, Conservative or Labour.''
The challenge facing him is to convince people that, as he put it, ''we are all in this together.''

HEADLINE: South Korea Proposes Talks to Reunite War-Divided Families

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- President Park Geun-hye of South Korea said Thursday that South and North Korea should resume arranging reunions of families separated by the Korean War six decades ago, and she renewed a proposal to build an ''international peace park'' straddling their heavily armed border.
Ms. Park's conciliatory overtures came a day after the Koreas agreed to reopen an idled joint industrial park in the North Korean border town of Kaesong, a deal indicating that they were moving toward a thaw after months of tensions this year. The Kaesong agreement also appeared to give impetus to Ms. Park's ''trustpolitik'' policy, which calls for building trust with the North as a foundation for more serious negotiations on ending the North's nuclear weapons programs in exchange for helping the country rebuild its economy. 
''South and North Korea must leave mistrust and confrontation behind and open the door for a new era of peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula,'' Ms. Park said in her nationally televised speech on Thursday, in observance of the anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule with the end of World War II. ''If North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons program, we can open a new era on the peninsula.''
The two Koreas have restarted governmental dialogue in recent weeks, after tensions on the divided peninsula over the North's nuclear program this year raised fears of a worsening confrontation between the longtime enemies. As North Korea has pulled back from particularly incendiary threats, however, it appeared to allow Ms. Park to revert cautiously to the more conciliatory stance she took before taking office.
Ms. Park, a conservative, promised during her presidential campaign last year to take something of a middle course on North Korea: more demanding than the liberal governments that never succeeded in getting North Korea to pull back from the nuclear program despite years of aid and investment, but less strict than her immediate predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, a conservative who had curtailed trade and aid shipments in retaliation against the North's nuclear program and other provocations. But just before Ms. Park took office, the North's new young leader, Kim Jong-un, ordered his country's third nuclear test in defiance of international warnings, leading her to take a stronger stance.
Despite the moves in recent weeks by both sides to ease tensions, relations between the two countries have a history of abrupt reversals, and if the North reacts angrily to joint South Korea-United States military exercises later this month, it could easily set back any advances.
In announcing her proposals Thursday, Ms. Park suggested that reunions of separated families be held around the autumn holiday of Chuseok on Sept. 19, traditionally a time for family gatherings in both Koreas. So far, North Korea has not responded.
Since the division of Korea in 1945 and the Korean War of 1950-53, which ended in a stalemate, millions of Koreans have been separated from family members across the border, with no direct mail service or telephone links. Family reunions have been a highly emotional issue, as many aging Koreans who lived through the war have died without seeing their relatives again.
A series of family reunions was held during a period of inter-Korean reconciliation between 1998 and 2008, but there have been none since 2010, with relations between the Koreas having soured in recent years.
Last month, North Korea proposed talks to arrange more family reunions. But it withdrew the offer after the South rejected a separate proposal to discuss resuming South Korean tours to a North Korean mountain, a program that ended in 2008 after North Korean soldiers shot and killed a South Korean tourist.
The South says it will discuss resuming that jointly operated tourism project only if the North apologizes for the killing of the tourist. Many South Korean conservatives also oppose the tourism program itself, which had served as an important source of hard currency for the North Korean government.
Ms. Park first proposed an international peace park inside the two-and-a-half-mile-wide demilitarized zone in May, during a speech before the United States Congress. The zone, a neutral area bisecting the Korean Peninsula that was created to keep the rival Korean armies apart after the war, is guarded on both sides by minefields, barbed wire, tank traps and two million battle-ready troops.
''The standoff around the DMZ has the potential to endanger global peace. We must defuse that danger,'' Ms. Park said in her speech in May, urging Washington to join in the creation of such a park. ''The demilitarized zone must live up to its name, a zone that strengthens the peace, not undermines it.''
Her government has yet to reveal details of her plan, and North Korea has yet to respond.

HEADLINE: Lewis Kornfeld, 97, Dies; Made Radio Shack an Early Player in PCs

BYLINE: By DANIEL E. SLOTNIK

 BODY:
Lewis Kornfeld, who as president of Radio Shack helped the company become a major player in the early personal computer market in 1977 by releasing the TRS-80, one of the first mass-market and relatively affordable computers, died on Sunday in Fort Worth. He was 97.
The cause was complications of lymphocytic leukemia, his wife, Rose Ann Kornfeld, said. 
When Radio Shack unveiled the TRS-80, personal computers mainly came in kits for aficionados to cobble together. Mr. Kornfeld presented a finished product that consumers could just plug in and use.
The market for home computers was virtually untested at the time, but Mr. Kornfeld prided himself on having recognized their potential.
''Nobody had a personal computer,'' Mr. Kornfeld told The Fort Worth Star-Telegram in 2006. ''I didn't know about them. I walk into a buyer's office, and I see him using a cathode ray tube screen and a typewriter keyboard. I said, 'You let me know when I can play chess on it, and if it will, I'm going to put the damned thing in our line.' ''
The TRS-80's CPU was contained in its keyboard. It used a cassette deck to load and save data and came with a 12-inch monitor. The computer had four kilobytes of memory, the equivalent of about two double-spaced typed pages.
It retailed for $600 (about $2,300 in today's dollars). Comparable computers released in 1977, like the Apple II and the Commodore PET, cost from $200 to more than $1,000 more, though costlier models often had more memory.
The TRS-80 was an immediate hit. The Tandy Corporation, Radio Shack's parent company at the time, initially planned to manufacture about 1,000 of the computers, but by the end of the year 5,000 had been delivered.
By 1983, computers and accessories, marketed under the slogan ''The Biggest Name in Little Computers,'' were Tandy's biggest sellers. That year the company released the TRS-80 Model 100, one of the earliest portable computers. Priced at $800 (nearly $1,900 adjusting for inflation), it could run on four AA batteries and was the last machine for which Bill Gates wrote much of the code.
I.B.M. broke into the market with its own PC in 1981, and by the late '80s Tandy had stopped manufacturing its own computers and begun stocking I.B.M.'s in Radio Shack stores.
Lewis F. Kornfeld Jr. (he used a middle initial though he did not have a middle name) was born in Boston on July 31, 1916. He received degrees in English and journalism from the University of Denver and served in the Pacific with the Marines in World War II.
Mr. Kornfeld became Radio Shack's advertising manager in 1948, when the company had only one store in Boston. In 1963 the Tandy Corporation, formerly a leather company based in Fort Worth, acquired what had become the Radio Shack chain.
He became the chain's president in 1970 and retired in 1981, when Radio Shack had more than 7,000 locations.
After retiring he served on Radio Shack's board until 2003. He wrote ''To Catch a Mouse Make a Noise Like a Cheese,'' a book on small-business marketing, published in 1983.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Kornfeld, who lived in Fort Worth, is survived by two sons, Nicholas and Hardy; two stepchildren, Ann and John McReynolds; two grandsons; a great-granddaughter; three step-grandchildren; and a brother, John. His first wife, the former Ethel Hardy, died.

HEADLINE: Moment Of Truthiness

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
We all know how democracy is supposed to work. Politicians are supposed to campaign on the issues, and an informed public is supposed to cast its votes based on those issues, with some allowance for the politicians' perceived character and competence.
We also all know that the reality falls far short of the ideal. Voters are often misinformed, and politicians aren't reliably truthful. Still, we like to imagine that voters generally get it right in the end, and that politicians are eventually held accountable for what they do. 
But is even this modified, more realistic vision of democracy in action still relevant? Or has our political system been so degraded by misinformation and disinformation that it can no longer function?
Well, consider the case of the budget deficit -- an issue that dominated Washington discussion for almost three years, although it has recently receded.
You probably won't be surprised to hear that voters are poorly informed about the deficit. But you may be surprised by just how misinformed.
In a well-known paper with the discouraging title, ''It Feels Like We're Thinking,'' the political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels reported on a 1996 survey that asked voters whether the budget deficit had increased or decreased under President Clinton. In fact, the deficit was down sharply, but a plurality of voters -- and a majority of Republicans -- believed that it had gone up.
I wondered on my blog what a similar survey would show today, with the deficit falling even faster than it did in the 1990s. Ask and ye shall receive: Hal Varian, the chief economist of Google, offered to run a Google Consumer Survey -- a service the company normally sells to market researchers -- on the question. So we asked whether the deficit has gone up or down since January 2010. And the results were even worse than in 1996: A majority of those who replied said the deficit has gone up, with more than 40 percent saying that it has gone up a lot. Only 12 percent answered correctly that it has gone down a lot.
Am I saying that voters are stupid? Not at all. People have lives, jobs, children to raise. They're not going to sit down with Congressional Budget Office reports. Instead, they rely on what they hear from authority figures. The problem is that much of what they hear is misleading if not outright false.
The outright falsehoods, you won't be surprised to learn, tend to be politically motivated. In those 1996 data, Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to hold false views about the deficit, and the same must surely be true today. After all, Republicans made a lot of political hay over a supposedly runaway deficit early in the Obama administration, and they have maintained the same rhetoric even as the deficit has plunged. Thus Eric Cantor, the third-ranking Republican in the House, declared on Fox News that we have a ''growing deficit,'' while Senator Rand Paul told Bloomberg Businessweek that we're running ''a trillion-dollar deficit every year.''
Do people like Mr. Cantor or Mr. Paul know that what they're saying isn't true? Do they care? Probably not. In Stephen Colbert's famous formulation, claims about runaway deficits may not be true, but they have truthiness, and that's all that matters.
Still, aren't there umpires for this sort of thing -- trusted, nonpartisan authorities who can and will call out purveyors of falsehood? Once upon a time, I think, there were. But these days the partisan divide runs very deep, and even those who try to play umpire seem afraid to call out falsehood. Incredibly, the fact-checking site PolitiFact rated Mr. Cantor's flatly false statement as ''half true.''
Now, Washington still does have some ''wise men,'' people who are treated with special deference by the news media. But when it comes to the issue of the deficit, the supposed wise men turn out to be part of the problem. People like Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, the co-chairmen of President Obama's deficit commission, did a lot to feed public anxiety about the deficit when it was high. Their report was ominously titled ''The Moment of Truth.'' So have they changed their tune as the deficit has come down? No -- so it's no surprise that the narrative of runaway deficits remains even though the budget reality has completely changed.
Put it all together, and it's a discouraging picture. We have an ill-informed or misinformed electorate, politicians who gleefully add to the misinformation and watchdogs who are afraid to bark. And to the extent that there are widely respected, not-too-partisan players, they seem to be fostering, not fixing, the public's false impressions.
So what should we be doing? Keep pounding away at the truth, I guess, and hope it breaks through. But it's hard not to wonder how this system is supposed to work.

HEADLINE: New York City's Jobless Rate Held Steady in July

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate held at 8.4 percent in July, despite a summertime surge in hiring on Wall Street, the State Labor Department reported on Thursday. 
The city's investment banks and brokerage firms added over 2,000 jobs last month, before any adjustments for usual seasonal fluctuations in hiring and layoffs, according to the labor department. Wall Street has traditionally been the main engine of the city's economy, but it has lagged behind other industries in rebounding from the financial crisis that began about five years ago.
The number of jobs on Wall Street is still about 1 percent lower than it was a year ago, while employment in the city's private sector has risen by about 90,000 jobs, the department's data show. Since July 2012, the city's unemployment rate has dropped a full percentage point, but it is still significantly higher than the national rate of 7.4 percent.
New York State's unemployment rate was 7.5 percent in July, unchanged from June. Statewide, the number of private-sector jobs fell slightly in July, after seasonal adjustments. With a small upward revision in the June total, though, the state added almost 130,000 in the past year and is one of only nine states to have regained all of the jobs lost in the last recession, said Bohdan M. Wynnyk, deputy director of the Division of Research and Statistics at the Labor Department.
New Jersey lost even more jobs in July, a decline of 11,800, but that state's unemployment rate edged downward to 8.6 percent, from 8.7 percent in June, according to its Department of Labor and Workforce Development. New Jersey has gained back less than two-thirds of the jobs it lost during the recession.
The changes in employment and a state's unemployment rate often seem to contradict each other because they are derived from separate monthly surveys. The jobs numbers come from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate is calculated from interviews of residents.
In New York City, the unemployment rate has persistently remained higher than the national rate, even though hiring has been relatively strong. One reason is that the city has continued to attract job-seekers. There are more people working or looking for work in the city than there have ever been.
For many of them, finding a job is still difficult: there are about 350,000 city residents without jobs -- about half of the unemployed residents of the state. And as the federal government has reduced emergency spending, unemployment benefits are available to fewer of them. Only 4 of every 10 unemployed New Yorkers were collecting unemployment insurance payments in July, the state's Labor Department said.

HEADLINE: Worst Day in 2 Months as Investors Fret

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market was pummeled on Thursday after two big companies issued grim sales forecasts and economic data added to investors' concerns that the Federal Reserve would soon start winding down its economic stimulus program.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 225 points, its worst day in nearly two months. Investors also sold off bonds, driving the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to its highest level in more than two years.
Before the start of trading, Wal-Mart Stores cut its estimates for annual revenue and profit, warning that cautious shoppers are spending less. The news followed a disappointing revenue forecast from Cisco Systems late on Wednesday. 
In a twist, more signs of resilience in the nation's economy weighed on the stock market. Reports on inflation and the job market appeared to raise the odds that the Fed would begin winding down its $85 billion monthly program of buying Treasury and mortgage-backed securities as early as next month. Many investors think that the Fed's effort to keep interest rates extremely low has underpinned the stock market's record run.
''People are worried that this move up in interest rates will kill the recovery, and we won't see the anticipated second-half improvement in growth and corporate earnings,'' said Alec Young, global equity strategist at S.& P. Capital IQ.
The Dow industrials lost 225.47 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 15,112.19. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 24.07 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,661.32. The selling swept across all 10 industry groups in the S.& P. 500.
The Nasdaq composite index dropped 63.16 points, or 1.7 percent, to 3,606.12.
''It seems like an overreaction today,'' said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.
Mr. Frederick said many investors were speculating that the improving economy meant that the Fed would start pumping less money into the financial system in the coming months. If that results in lower bond prices and even higher yields, it could lead more investors to dump dividend-paying stocks in favor of bonds.
''Some of the stocks getting hit hardest recently are big companies paying dividends,'' Mr. Frederick said. Utilities stocks are down 3 percent this week, for example, the worst of the S.& P. 500's industry groups.
The government said on Thursday that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits dropped to 320,000 last week, the lowest level since October 2007, two months before the start of the recession.
A slowly improving economy should eventually lead to higher spending and more sales for big companies. But right now, investors are more focused on the Fed's next move, said Natalie Trunow, the chief investment officer at Calvert Investments.
''There's this counterintuitive reaction to economic news,'' Ms. Trunow said. ''Positive data comes out and markets aren't excited about it. They say, 'Uh-oh, the stimulus will be removed.' ''
Wal-Mart fell $1.99, or 3 percent, to $74.41 after the company cut its profit and revenue forecasts for 2013. It also reported second-quarter results that missed Wall Street's estimates.
Shares of Cisco Systems fell $1.89, or 7 percent, to $24.49, for the biggest drop of the 30 big companies in the Dow, after the company announced plans late on Wednesday to cut 5 percent of its work force, roughly 4,000 employees, as its sales slow.
Cisco's announcement led to selling in other technology stocks, as it is widely regarded as a bellwether for the entire industry. That is because the company sells a wide range of products to corporations and governments and its fiscal quarters end a month later than most major technology companies', which gives investors an early look into current conditions.
The Dow has slumped 2 percent so far this week, and the S.& P. 500 is down 1.8 percent. However, the Dow is up 15.3 percent for the year so far, while the S.& P. 500 is up 16.5 percent. Both indexes closed at nominal highs on Aug. 2.
In the bond market, interest rates climbed, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for interest rates on mortgage loans, jumped as high as 2.81 percent in early trading. The selling in the 10-year note eased a bit later in the day and its price ended down 15/32, to 97 22/32, giving it a yield of 2.77 percent, up from 2.71 percent late on Wednesday.
Higher long-term interest rates could cool housing sales. ''A sharp increase in long-term rates translates into a sharp increase in mortgage rates,'' Ms. Trunow said. ''That's bound to impact the housing market.''

HEADLINE: Puzzle Awaits The Capital: How to Solve 3 Fiscal Rifts

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- On the endgame for the budget showdown looming in Washington this fall, only this is clear: President Obama thinks Republicans cannot risk another debt crisis or government shutdown, and Republican leaders agree.
That consensus suggests that the odds of an economy-damaging stalemate are relatively low, despite rising jitters in the capital. Yet everything else about how the White House and Congressional negotiators will try to strike a deal, and then coax majorities to approve it, remains opaque.
''Even those of us quite close to it have a hard time saying how the movie ends,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. 
The showdown encompasses three interlocking fiscal disputes that will challenge Mr. Obama and his Republican interlocutors to bridge seemingly irreconcilable goals.
Perhaps easiest to resolve is the effort by some conservative Republicans to eliminate financing for the new health care law in return for keeping the government open beyond Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. As expected, Mr. Obama is unyieldingly opposed to undercutting his signature domestic policy achievement.
The House Republican leader, Eric Cantor of Virginia, has already rejected the Republican strategy as doomed to fail. Most Senate Republicans have not signed on, and Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina has called it ''the dumbest idea I've ever heard.'' Even one supporter, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, recently suggested that the threat was simply a tool to provoke negotiations.
A second challenge is determining the fate of the across-the-board budget cuts known as the sequester if Congress avoids a shutdown by extending government financing.
Republicans remain adamant that the level of budget cuts required by the sequester, about $90 billion per year, be continued. But with increasing complaints about the effects of those cuts on the Pentagon and elsewhere -- shown by House Republicans' inability to pass their own transportation spending bill last month -- some party leaders want to rearrange the burden of those cuts so they fall instead on entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.
The White House and Congressional Democrats, however, rule out that trade, except as part of a larger long-term deal that also includes new tax increases. And Republican resistance to tax increases, which has precluded such a ''grand bargain'' in recent years, has stiffened since the Bush tax cuts for top-earning Americans expired at the end of 2012.
The third challenge may be the most worrisome. While the sequester pinches particular constituencies, and a government shutdown would inconvenience millions, economists warn that a default resulting from a failure to raise the government's debt limit could tip the economy back into recession.
That challenge also appears, at least on the surface, the most intractable. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio has reiterated that Republicans will not raise the debt limit without offsetting spending cuts.
Mr. Boehner's demand would require fewer cuts than during the 2011 debt crisis, when the debt ceiling needed to rise by about $110 billion per month to avoid default. That amount has shrunk to around $70 billion, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, because the top-end tax increases and revenue from a stronger economy have helped shrink the deficit substantially.
But Mr. Obama, burned by the downgrade of the United States debt rating after those 2011 negotiations, insists he will not negotiate on the issue this time. It is as imposing a fiscal puzzle as veterans of Washington budget fights have seen in years.
''This is, for me, very, very difficult to figure out,'' said Stephen Bell, a longtime Senate Republican budget aide now at the Bipartisan Policy Center.
No formal negotiations have begun, although the White House chief of staff, Denis R. McDonough, has been meeting with a few Senate Republicans in search of common ground.
Congressional aides have also started exploring potential stopgaps. They begin with a temporary extension of government funding to allow budget talks to continue through year's end.
Under one situation sketched out by Democrats, temporary funding for discretionary programs like Pentagon spending would be set just below $1 trillion -- closer to the $967 billion in the House Republican budget than to the $1.058 trillion in the Senate Democratic budget.
The aim of negotiations after that would be to come up with new savings approaching $200 billion.
Part of the savings would come from entitlements, but programs like farm subsidies, rather than the more politically volatile Social Security and Medicare. Part would come from new revenues, but ''user fees'' tied to special government services, rather than broad-based tax increases.
That could allow both sides to tell key constituencies that they did not violate core principles. And it would be enough to replace cuts in military and domestic programs for about two years, without increasing the deficit.
It would not, however, allow Republicans to argue that they achieved their own condition for raising the debt limit. On this issue, both sides are counting on bitter memories from the 2011 crisis, which damaged the Republican Party's reputation, to help Mr. Boehner and Mr. Cantor rally enough of their caucus to vote ''aye.''
One path would be returning to the mechanism that the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, came up with in 2011, which allows most lawmakers to vote against a higher debt limit if the president takes responsibility for raising it.
Another path is the option Republicans accepted temporarily earlier this year, which simply suspended enforcement of the debt limit without raising it.
A third is linking a debt limit increase to the effort to achieve a different, if potentially quixotic, Republican priority: overhauling the federal tax code.
None of that would go down easily for conservative Republican activists, who in the early days of the current Congressional recess have urged their lawmakers to fight.
Some Republicans point, if sometimes nervously, to the shared determination of their leaders to avoid political damage as they seek to hold the House and recapture the Senate in 2014.
''There are two things they all agree on: you can't shut down the government, and you can't default on the debt,'' said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. ''At some point, leaders have to lead.''

HEADLINE: Magis Theater Offers a Riff on Aristophanes

BYLINE: By A. C LEE

 BODY:
At the Edinburgh Festival Fringe a few weeks ago, the English playwright Mark Ravenhill delivered a scathing opening address, taking his contemporaries to task for accommodating themselves to the political and economic culture responsible for the global financial crash while abandoning their role as seekers and tellers of truth. 
The Miser imagines that Mr. Ravenhill would be heartened by the Magis Theater Company of New York, which has spent the last 18 months developing a show that seems to offer a precise example of the kind of vision he is calling for. In adapting Aristophanes' satirical play ''Plutus, God of Wealth,'' the company has sought to draw parallels between the socioeconomic situation of Athens around 400 B.C. and our own society's post-Occupy moment.
This weekend, ''Occupy Olympus,'' as Magis has retitled its version, explores the idea that alongside classical political, philosophical and artistic traditions, our society has also inherited Athenian socioeconomic inequality. The show, which will play three times on the Lower East Side at Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural and Educational Center's Flamboyán Theater as part of this year's FringeNYC, features original music by the writer, composer and director Elizabeth Swados, and is directed by the company's artistic director, George Drance.
Tickets are $15 if bought 24 hours in advance, and $18 at the door. Those over 65 may buy tickets for $10 at the door. Coupons for discounts at local restaurants are on the Fringe Web site.
(Friday and Saturday at 7 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m.; 107 Suffolk Street, near Delancey Street; 212-279-4488, fringenyc.org.)
HARLEM'S TENNIS HOPEFULS
Tennis fanatics impatient for the impending annual pilgrimage to Flushing Meadows for the U.S. Open can get a fix elsewhere this weekend, when the Harlem Junior Tennis and Education Program, whose alumni include James Blake, presents its annual Tri-State Junior Tennis Classic. Promising young talent from across the region will convene at the new Stadium Tennis Center at Mill Pond Park in the Bronx, near Yankee Stadium. Quarterfinal matches start Friday afternoon and continue on Saturday. Semifinals and finals are on Sunday. Admission is free. The tournament is part of Harlem Week, a monthlong (yes, it's a misnomer) series of cultural, athletic and family events celebrating the neighborhood's history and diversity.
(Friday, from 2:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.; Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; 725 Gateway Center Boulevard, at East 152nd Street, South Bronx; 212-491-3738, hjtep.org, harlemweek.org.)

HEADLINE: Obama's Remarks on Violence in Egypt

 BODY:
Following is the text of President Obama's remarks about the military crackdown on protesters in Egypt, as transcribed by Roll Call.
MR. OBAMA: Good morning, everybody.
I just finished a discussion with my national security team about the situation in Egypt, and I wanted to provide an update about our response to the events of the last several days.
Let me begin by stepping back for a moment. The relationship between the United States and Egypt goes back decades. It's rooted in our respect of Egypt as a nation and ancient center of civilization, and a cornerstone for peace in the Middle East. It's also rooted in our ties to the Egyptian people, forged through a longstanding partnership. 
Just over two years ago, America was inspired by the Egyptian people's desire for change as millions of Egyptians took to the streets to defend their dignity and demand a government that was responsive to their aspirations for political freedom and economic opportunity. And we said at the time that change would not come quickly or easily, but we did align ourselves with a set of principles: nonviolence, a respect for universal rights, and a process for political and economic reform.
In doing so, we were guided by values, but also by interests, because we believe nations are more stable and more successful when they're guided by those principles as well.
And that's why we're so concerned by recent events. We appreciate the complexity of the situation. While Mohammed Morsi was elected president in a democratic election, his government was not inclusive and did not respect the views of all Egyptians. We know that many Egyptians, millions of Egyptians, perhaps even a majority of Egyptians were calling for a change in course.
And while we do not believe that force is the resolve differences, after the military's intervention several weeks ago, there remained a chance for reconciliation and an opportunity to pursue a democratic path.
Instead, we've seen a more dangerous path taken through arbitrary arrests, a broad crackdown on Mr. Morsi's associations and supporters, and now, tragically, violence that's taken the lives of hundreds of people and wounded thousands more.
The United States strongly condemns the steps that have been taken by Egypt's interim government and security forces. We deplore violence against civilians. We support universal rights essential to human dignity, including the right to peaceful protest. We oppose the pursuit of martial law, which denies those rights to citizens under the principle that security trumps individual freedom or that might makes right. And today, the United States extends its condolences to the families of those who were killed and those who were wounded.
Given the depths of our partnership with Egypt, our national security interests in this pivotal part of the world, and our belief that engagement can support a transition back to a democratically- elected civilian government, we've sustained our commitment to Egypt and its people. But, while we want to sustain our relationship with Egypt, our traditional cooperation cannot continue as usual when civilians are being killed in the streets and rights are being rolled back.
As a result, this morning we notified the Egyptian government that we are canceling our biannual joint military exercise, which was scheduled for next month. Going forward, I've asked my national security team to assess the implications of the actions taken by the interim government and further steps we may take as necessary with respect to the U.S.-Egyptian relationship.
Let me say, the Egyptian people deserve better than what we've seen over the last several days. And to the Egyptian people, let me say, the cycle of violence and escalation needs to stop. We call on the Egyptian authorities to respect the universal rights of the people. We call on those who are protesting to do so peacefully, and condemn the attacks that we've seen by protesters, including on churches.
We believe that the state of emergency should be lifted, that a process of national reconciliation should begin, that all parties need to have a voice in Egypt's future, that the rights of women and religious minorities should be respected and the commitments must be kept to pursue transparent reforms of the constitution and democratic elections of a parliament and a president.
And pursuing that path will help Egypt meet the democratic aspirations of its people while attracting the investment, tourism and international support that can help it deliver opportunities to its citizens.
Violence, on the other hand, will only keep the cycle of polarization that isolates Egyptians from one another and from the world and that continues to hamper the opportunity for Egypt to get back on the path of economic growth.
Now, let me make one final point. America cannot determine the future of Egypt. That's a task for the Egyptian people. We don't take sides with any particular party or political figure. I know it's tempting inside of Egypt to blame the United States or the West or some other outside actor for what's gone wrong.
We've been blamed by supporters of Morsi. We've been blamed by the other side as if we are supporters of Morsi. That kind of approach will do nothing to help Egyptians achieve the future that they deserve. We want Egypt to succeed. We want a peaceful, democratic, prosperous Egypt. That's our interest. But to achieve that, the Egyptians are going to have to do the work.
We recognize that change takes time and that a process like this is never guaranteed. There are examples in recent history of countries that are transitioned out of a military government towards a democratic government, and it didn't always go in a straight line, and the process was not always smooth. There are going to be false starts. There will be difficult days.
America's democratic journey took us through some mighty struggles to perfect our union. From Asia to the Americas, we know that democratic transitions are measured not in months or even years, but sometimes in generations.
So in the spirit of mutual interests and mutual respect, I want to be clear that America wants to be a partner in the Egyptian people's pursuit of a better future, and we are guided by our national interest in this longstanding relationship. But our partnership must also advance the principles that we believe in, and that so many Egyptians have sacrificed for these last several years, no matter what party or faction they belong to.
So, America will work with all those in Egypt and around the world who support a future of stability that rests on a foundation of justice and peace and dignity.
Thank you very much.

HEADLINE: His Options Few, Obama Rebukes Egypt's Leaders

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and PETER BAKER; Mark Landler reported from Chilmark, and Peter Baker from Washington. Eric Schmitt and Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting from Washington, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.

 BODY:
CHILMARK, Mass. -- President Obama announced Thursday that the United States had canceled longstanding joint military exercises with the Egyptian Army set for next month, using one of his few obvious forms of leverage to rebuke Egypt's military-backed government for its brutal crackdown on supporters of the ousted president, Mohamed Morsi.
Though the decision is an embarrassment to Egypt's generals, and will deprive Egypt of much-needed revenue, it lays bare both the Obama administration's limited options to curb the military's campaign against Islamists in Egypt and the United States' role as an increasingly frustrated bystander.
Repeated pleas from administration officials to the generals to change course have gone unheeded, and the United States' first punitive measure, a Pentagon delay in the delivery of four F-16 fighter jets to the Egyptian Air Force, also had no effect. 
Mr. Obama, interrupting his vacation on Martha's Vineyard to address the violence, struck a now-familiar balance. He expressed outrage at the harrowing scenes this week in Cairo and other cities, while taking pains to preserve the American relationship with the Egyptian armed forces, which are underwritten by the vast bulk of the $1.5 billion a year in military and economic aid.
With the death toll in Egypt soaring and no sign that the country's generals are heeding American calls to stop the violence, however, administration officials said they now faced a more wrenching choice: to keep backing the generals, whatever the cost, or to admit that the current relationship is no longer tenable.
''While we want to sustain our relationship with Egypt, our traditional cooperation cannot continue as usual when civilians are being killed in the streets and rights are being rolled back,'' Mr. Obama said, reading a statement in front of his rented vacation house here, the sun-splashed trees an incongruous backdrop for his stark message.
In his remarks, Mr. Obama noted ''it's tempting'' inside Egypt to blame the United States, saying that protesters accused it alternately of backing Mr. Morsi or colluding with those who ousted him. But Mr. Obama's reluctance to be drawn into conflicts in the Mideast, from Syria to Bahrain, has frequently been criticized.
Until the latest eruption of violence, White House officials were still uncertain whether the Egyptian military might yet rewind history and give democracy a fresh chance, or if it was simply restoring the sort of autocracy that has dominated Egypt in the past. Now they said they seem to have the answer.
But while their frustration is palpable, officials said there were voices in favor of working with Egypt and of cutting off its aid, and they expected the debate would take time to play out.
White House officials said Mr. Obama issued the order to pull the United States out of the military exercises, known as Bright Star, in a phone call with his national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, on Wednesday evening. The Egyptians were notified before the president's announcement, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel later spoke by telephone with Egypt's defense minister, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi.
Despite the large scale of the exercises, and the fact that they date to the 1980s, administration officials said they had few illusions that the decision would by itself stop the crackdown. Egypt's military leaders, they said, regard the Islamist protests as an ''existential threat'' to the nation, which they must crush at all costs.
Mr. Obama said he had instructed his national security staff to weigh additional measures. He did not specify what those could be, though he said nothing about suspending the military aid. ''We'll be looking at both the case-by-case examples but also the more fundamental relationship,'' said a senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. ''There's a basic threshold where we can't give a tacit endorsement to them.''
Given the deep schism in Egypt, this official said, the White House is still skeptical that cutting off aid would compel the generals to return the country to a democratic transition. And it could destabilize the region, particularly the security of Israel, whose 1979 peace treaty with Egypt is predicated on the aid.
For weeks, officials from Israel and several Arab countries have pressured the administration to maintain the flow of aid. If it were cut off, they said, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates would move quickly to make up the shortfall -- and then some.
Saudi Arabia and the emirates pledged $8 billion in grants and loans to Egypt's post-Morsi government last month: $5 billion from Saudi Arabia in grants and loans; $3 billion from the emirates. That is more than enough, analysts say, to offset any cutoff from the United States, even if the two countries do not fulfill their entire pledges.
Shutting off the aid spigot now would not have an immediate impact on the Egyptian military, defense officials say, because this year's military assistance has already been delivered. Beyond money, Arab officials worry that a rupture between Washington and the Egyptian military would further erode American influence in a country that has historically been a bellwether in the Arab world, and would open the door to rivals like Russia or China.
''If the aid gets cut, you can be sure that Putin will arrive in Cairo in two or three months,'' one senior Arab official said. ''And he will give aid with no strings attached.''
Still, even with the aid flowing, Defense Department officials fear that whatever leverage the Pentagon might have had with Egypt's military leadership is ebbing quickly. Since the military's ouster of Mr. Morsi on July 3, Mr. Hagel has had more than 15 phone calls with General Sisi, pleading in vain for him to change course.
Mr. Hagel, in a statement on Thursday, said that in his latest exchange with the general, ''I made it clear that the violence and inadequate steps towards reconciliation are putting important elements of our longstanding defense cooperation at risk.''
While administration officials acknowledge that Egypt could replace the lost American military aid, they said it would pay a long-term price in lost foreign investment and a ruined tourism industry -- a point that Mr. Obama made in his statement on Thursday.
Some analysts said the administration had hurt itself by not undertaking a thorough review of its policy toward Egypt after the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. The United States, they said, was too wedded to the privileges it gained from the relationship, like fly-over rights and fast-track transit through the Suez Canal.
''They've limited their own options by believing the idea that in order to influence things, you need to remain engaged,'' said Steven A. Cook, an expert on Egypt at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''We've never tested the proposition of cutting them off.''
Other experts said Mr. Obama had few attractive alternatives and mainly wanted to keep out of the situation.
''Anything they do that is dramatic puts the United States in the middle of a story that we really don't want to be in the middle of,'' said Steven Simon, a former National Security Council official under Mr. Obama who is now head of the Washington office of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
Heather Hurlburt, a former Clinton White House official who is now the executive director of the National Security Network, said the administration should cut off ''targeted'' cooperation with Egypt's military without halting all aid. ''No matter where you're coming from ideologically,'' she said, ''the playing field we face in the Middle East is not the playing field we faced a month ago.''
Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who just returned from a trip to Cairo at Mr. Obama's request, was sharply critical of the president for not acting more forcefully against the military takeover, citing a law requiring the cutoff of American aid to countries where a military coup has dislodged an elected government. Mr. McCain has said the Muslim Brotherhood needs to accept that Mr. Morsi will not be returned to power, but he has also urged the military to establish a democratic process. ''We violated our own rule of law by not calling it for what it is,'' Mr. McCain said on CNN. ''We undercut our own values.''

HEADLINE: What Really Ails Detroit

BYLINE: By STEPHAN RICHTER. 
Stephan Richter is publisher of The Globalist, an online magazine.

 BODY:
IS Detroit's collapse the story of one American city gone awry? Or is it indicative of a more profound nationwide problem? The facts point to the latter.
Though Detroit's bankruptcy is exceptional in many ways -- notably, its size and its disproportionate impact on African-Americans -- the overall decline of America's manufacturing centers is evident in the deterioration of many smaller cities and towns throughout the Midwest and Northeast.
What accounts for this sad turn of events? 
The traditional narrative holds that globalization, outsourcing and, after 2007, the recession have been responsible for devastating American manufacturing by moving jobs out of the country in enormous numbers. But at best, that is a convenient half-truth.
American manufacturing has been in trouble even since its heyday, in the 1950s and 1960s, when the United States was the global economic powerhouse and American assembly-line workers earned very decent middle-class wages.
That era of prosperity was not, as is so often claimed, the manifestation of the American dream. Rather, it was, or should have been, a warning sign that America was riding a fleeting wave of progress. Almost nobody was looking hard enough to the future and asking what it would take to sustain success.
The reason so many manufacturing-sector workers in the United States received such high pay at that time was not that they had exceptional skills or had received superior training; it was that the corporations for which they worked were unsurpassed in their dominance and generated huge revenues.
But that dominance was, to a considerable degree, a momentary quirk of history: the absence, in the wake of World War II, of any real competition from other nations. Once foreign competition was re-established, in Europe and Asia, only the superior skills of a nation's workers and a focus on long-term workers' training would allow a country to stay ahead.
For the United States, the day of reckoning came as other nations recovered from the war. In the 1970s, for example, American car manufacturers began facing competition on their home soil for the first time. Belittling the Japanese and their funny little cars was not an effective competitive response, though not for want of trying.
In that moment, American companies, communities and employees should have started taking the competition seriously. That did not happen. Companies like General Motors continued to shower blue-collar workers with handsome pay and benefits.
Who was to blame for this? Not the unions. They did what they were supposed to do: ask for higher pay and more benefits. No, the fault lay with the top corporate managers: it was their job, as capitalists, to deny such increases if they were not justified by productivity trends.
But with a fatal arrogance, executives at American manufacturing companies did allow those increases, in part to maintain a society of contented, trouble-free workers, though executives would also use those increases as cover for their own rapidly swelling compensation. In the 1960s, the average compensation of an American C.E.O. was about 25 times the average compensation of a production worker. That ratio rose to about 70 times by the end of the 1980s, and to around 250 times these days.
It is tragic to hear voices from Detroit declaring themselves ready for a resuscitation of the city. Revival is a question not just of will but also of the available skills base, which unfortunately has deteriorated as a result of a failure to invest in training.
That skills deteriorated is, to a considerable extent, the fault of the unions. Unfortunately, they shared the management class's shortsighted focus on extracting the maximum amount of compensation from companies, even in the face of the underlying businesses' failing strength.
Developing the necessary skills base is not a short-term project. It requires decades of concerted effort on many fronts, by many national, regional and local actors, including collaboration among companies, government, trade associations, schools, colleges and universities.
This kind of common purpose, however, is not something that American society, with its ethos of individualism and personal independence, seems capable of undertaking. Doing the right thing for the long haul is typically put off for a later time, if it ever happens.
That such a ''strategy'' is self-defeating ought to be obvious. Sadly, it is not -- not in an instant-gratification world.
Globalization, in many ways, serves as an early warning system for the changes required in a domestic society. No society should have been better prepared to utilize this tool than the United States, given its traditional -- but at least for now largely lost -- proclivity to embrace change. That it didn't work out that way is a tragedy of the nation's own making.

HEADLINE: Grim Picture Of Recovery In Forecasts By Retailers

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
A lot of Americans are still spending their money only on socks and other essentials, highlighting the disparity between younger and poorer consumers and those who are benefiting from the economic recovery.
Major retailers, like Walmart and Kohl's, that cater to budget-conscious customers with lower incomes cited sluggish sales this week as they decreased their annual forecasts. Macy's, with a slightly higher-income clientele, did not meet analysts' expectations for the first time in 25 quarters.
But even upper-income consumers do not seem to be spending as freely as some hoped. While Nordstrom's, which reaches a middle-to-luxury-end market, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, it too said sales ''remained softer than anticipated'' and lowered its forecast. 
The latest sales reports painted a bleak picture for a sizable swath of the retail sector even as other economic indicators, like an increase in auto loans, showed signs of consumer confidence.
''There is a certain segment of the population that is faring well in this economy and have seen their net worth rise sharply with stock and housing market gains,'' said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. ''Then there is the much larger segment of Americans that are working in low-wage jobs, part-time jobs, that are struggling to make ends meet and are living paycheck to paycheck. They are not spending beyond necessities.''
In a call with reporters Thursday, Walmart's chief financial officer, Charles M. Holley Jr., said there was ''a general reluctance of customers to spend on discretionary items right now.''
As the back-to-school season reaches its peak, some retailers are not optimistic that they could see a big revival among shoppers. ''The expectations through the end of the year are really through the lens of the cautious consumer,'' Mr. Holley said.
A few major factors have impeded progress for a lot of Americans as the country wades out of the recession. Job-market growth has been decent, but the jobs added have not.
''A lot of the gains have been in extremely low-paying sectors: retail, health care, temporary employment,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at MFR. When it is not full-time work, he said, benefits are low to nonexistent.
''If you dig below the surface, it's not that wonderful of a picture,'' he said.
Retailers also singled out the payroll-tax increase as one reason consumers were feeling thrifty.
''If you're making around $50,000 a year, that's $40 a paycheck that our customer doesn't have that they would've had last year'' Mr. Holley said.
While retailers tend to offer excuses for missing quarterly results -- good weather, bad weather, sporting events -- economists agreed that the tax increase was affecting stores' sales.
''In terms of people who are paycheck to paycheck, which is a good chunk of this country, and certainly a good chunk of lower-end retailers' customers, it has a significant effect,'' Mr. Shapiro said.
Other economic indicators, like the upswing in the housing and stock markets, have not meant much to low-income shoppers.
In the housing market, ''first-time buyers, in particular, have been waning,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial.
Mr. Shapiro said many sales are due to ''speculative institutional demand,'' not typical home buyers.
Teenagers, too, are having a rough time, as shown by a recent earnings report from Aeropostale and an earnings warning from American Eagle.
''Teenagers have not had jobs for a while, and have to compete with older workers, and the back-to-school market's not looking terrific this year,'' Ms. Swonk said. ''It's about the unevenness of the recovery across both age and income groups.''
For Wal-Mart Stores, profit increased by 1.3 percent, to $4.07 billion, for the quarter and sales rose 2.4 percent, to $116.2 billion, both missing analyst estimates. The key measure of same-store sales dropped 0.3 percent in the United States; analysts had expected a 0.7 percent increase.
The company's international unit, which had until recently been growing at a fast clip, also turned in sluggish quarterly results, with sales growing 2.9 percent, to $33 billion.
''We've seen customers both in mature and emerging markets curb their spending,'' said C. Douglas McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart International. ''We believe that environment is going to remain through the end of the year.''
The company decreased its full-year guidance for net sales growth to 2 percent to 3 percent, from 5 percent to 6 percent.
Also, ''somewhat uncharacteristically for Wal-Mart,'' according to a Sanford Bernstein analyst, Colin McGranahan, the company lowered its annual earnings per share forecast, to $5.10 to $5.30 from a previously issued $5.20 to $5.40.
Nordstrom's quarterly profit of $0.93 per share was above analyst expectations for $0.88 a share. But it, too, lowered its annual forecast, to $3.60 to $3.70 a share versus its earlier outlook of $3.65 to $3.80.
Kohl's, which also reported results Thursday, said its quarterly profit fell 3.5 percent, and also lowered its annual earnings-per-share forecast, to $4.15 to $4.35, down from $4.15 to $4.45.
The results added to worries about the retail sector.
''We believe that much of our weakness is due to the health of the consumer,'' Macy's chief financial officer Karen Hoguet told analysts.
Macy's on Wednesday lowered its annual forecast, to $3.80 to $3.90 a share from $3.90 to $3.95 a share.
''When we do see good things in the economy, sometimes they don't immediately flow through to a paycheck. Remember how the average American lives,'' said Mr. McMillon of Walmart.

HEADLINE: Getting a Close-Up of the Silent-Film Era

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
FROM the days of Thomas Edison, the New York area has been a big part of the film industry, and now modern technology is turning some of the strip malls and storage sheds of New Jersey and New York into silent-movie shrines. With help from the Web, fans of those films can hike along parking lots, weedy streambeds and gritty alleys where early screen actors posed as American Indians, Confederate soldiers, Soviet spies, Dickens characters and escaped convicts.
This summer, expert local historians and preservationists drove me around to look at a few that appear in recently rediscovered film clips. Now I can actually picture Theda Bara beguiling suitors on rock outcroppings in Fort Lee, N.J., or Lionel Barrymore's being followed by star-struck extras on the Cornell campus in Ithaca, N.Y., or D. W. Griffith using hand-forged iron gadgets to produce fade-outs while filming along an eroded canal towpath in Cuddebackville, N.Y., in Orange County.
''It's like hallowed ground,'' Ben Model, a silent-film historian and piano accompanist for films, told me, referring to the Cuddebackville blacksmith workshops where Griffith commissioned his newfangled closeable tubes. 
Forgotten movie artifacts keep turning up in these towns, museum displays are expanding, and silent films made locally are playing at festivals while townspeople try to pinpoint which real sites are flickering in the backgrounds.
''The audience just loves sitting there, trying to identify these places,'' Barbara Davis, the city historian for New Rochelle, N.Y., another of the silent-movie towns, told me as we finished leafing through a newly acquired boxful of movie stills and headed off to the photogenic coastline.
We were following the trail of the film tycoon Edwin Thanhouser, known as the Wizard of New Rochelle. His studio, founded in 1909, produced over 1,000 films with irresistible titles like ''Shep's Race With Death'' and ''In the Hands of the Enemy.'' By 1917, World War I's economic doldrums and the acting crowd's exodus to Hollywood put the company out of business. (Ned Thanhouser, a descendant, has documented its rise and fall at thanhouser.org.)
''Imagine no I-95 here,'' Ms. Davis said, pulling up to a one-story bread factory hemmed in by highway ramps at 30 Grove Avenue, where the Thanhouser studio once sprawled. Fire destroyed that plant in 1913; the staff resourcefully filmed the pyrotechnics and released a movie called ''When the Studio Burned.'' The company's stuccoed second building, at 320 Main Street, is now a car repair shop in the shadow of a brick apartment tower and gabled houses where Thanhouser stars lived.
The former studio property backs onto a sleepy Long Island Sound inlet. ''You see how ideal it was for them to do their waterfront scenes,'' Ms. Davis said.
Then she drove me to a rowing club headquarters in Hudson Park, where the silent-movie dance stars Vernon and Irene Castle first met, and to a stuccoed yacht club on Harbor Lane West that was home to Lillian Gish.
The aura of silent stars, their thick makeup and over-the-top gestures captured in grainy black and white, and their often tragic fates, seem to captivate people who live near filmed sites.
''The ghosts are alive, there's no doubt about that,'' Tom Meyers, the executive director of the Fort Lee Film Commission, told me during a two-hour sweep around that town. (A map of his favorite haunts is downloadable at fortleefilm.org.)
Exhibitions at the Fort Lee Museum and plaques around town commemorate the origins of media giants like Fox and Universal in long-vanished greenhouses, and the youthful stints of artists like Edward Hopper and Al Hirschfeld in the studios' set and publicity departments.
We drove past rocks visible in Theda Bara stills, partly submerged in an apartment house lawn at 429 Main Street. We peered into a shuttered printing plant on a dead end of Fifth Street, just over the Englewood Cliffs border, where an ancestor of Universal was founded. A nitrate-film storage warehouse on Jane Street, Mr. Meyers explained, is built to withstand the kind of fire that destroyed the Thanhouser plant.
''We haven't had one of those gigantic explosions since about 1925,'' he said, reassuringly.
A plaque near a supermarket at 2160 Lemoine Avenue notes that around 1912, the filmmaker Alice Guy Blaché set up a studio there called Solax. It went bankrupt a decade later, soon after her husband ran off to Hollywood with a starlet.
''You do get a sense of Alice when you're shopping for your groceries,'' Mr. Meyers said, only a little dryly. This fall, she will be inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame; a grass-roots campaign called her a ''Reel Jersey Girl.''
This summer, Fort Lee film lovers' protests staved off demolition of a white gabled house at 2423 First Street that once housed Rambo's Tavern. Griffith and the comedy producer Mack Sennett were among those who gathered often in its backyard orchard, now a plane of pavement and grass.
''This was a real incubator for the film industry,'' Mr. Meyers said.
The Barrymore family lived near Rambo's, on Hammett Avenue. In 2001, their house was razed, despite outcry, to make way for brick town houses.
Outdoor movies (silents and talkies) are shown at the Fort Lee Community Center. Galleries for film artifacts are under construction near the George Washington Bridge.
''We're getting a sense of our own history that's very marketable,'' Mr. Meyers said.
In Ithaca, enthusiasts plan to install a movie museum in an unprepossessing storage building in Stewart Park, on Cayuga Lake. It is the sole architectural trace of a 1910s studio compound founded by the filmmaker brothers Leopold and Theodore Wharton. With Cornell students as extras, they made hundreds of now underappreciated movies like ''The Hermit of Lonely Gulch'' and ''The Pawn of Fortune.''
''Why are you looking at that building?'' is the refrain that Diana Riesman, a founder of the Ithaca Motion Picture Project, often hears. ''When you tell them why, people are so engaged,'' she told me. Tracks for set walls, with the cryptic markings ''DUNE-GRIP,'' run along the ceiling of the future Wharton Studio Museum.
Ms. Riesman and her co-founder of the museum project, Constance Bruce, showed me stills and clips (material unearthed partly through the local historian Terry Harbin, who posts findings at ithacamademovies.com) and showed me movie sites on steep slopes.
At Ithaca Falls, I could conjure up Wharton villains skulking along the banks. A Cornell frat house, at 106 Cayuga Heights Road, was briefly the home of Irene Castle. After her husband died in a World War I fighter plane crash, she married Robert E. Treman, an Ithaca businessman. Townspeople would gawk at her fur stoles and pet monkey. Her second husband squandered much of her fortune in the stock market, so the match was short-lived.
Leopold Wharton's own half-timbered house, at 116 Kelvin Place, has scarcely changed since the actress Olive Thomas was photographed on its porch during the filming of a detective flick. Ms. Thomas died in 1920, at 25, after poisoning herself with syphilis medication prescribed for her husband, the actor Jack Pickford, who was Mary Pickford's brother.
The Ithaca ghosts are kept alive with screenings and exhibitions. On Aug. 24, the Motion Picture Project is showing a 1916 Wharton comedy, with Oliver Hardy in drag. More screenings will be held in October, Ithaca's official Silent Movie Month.
In the hamlet of Cuddebackville, about 10 miles from Port Jervis, N.Y., and the Pennsylvania border, the half-serious lament I heard from Gretchen Weerheim, the executive director of the Neversink Valley Museum of History and Innovation, was, ''Why isn't this Hollywood?'' Griffith described the bend in the Neversink River there as ''altogether the loveliest spot in America,'' with skies at twilight that were ''transcendently illuminative.''
The museum occupies an 18th-century farmstead, with a blacksmith's shop that may have been the one that made the experimental fade-out equipment.
The galleries display a letter from Mary Pickford and a hotel register signed by Cecil B. DeMille and his wife, Constance. Across the street, stone aqueduct abutments provided ominous backdrops for Griffith scenes of Jack Pickford playing a boy rescued from drowning.
Ms. Weerheim and a museum trustee, Seth Goldman, also showed me ''Comata, the Sioux,'' a 1909 drama about an American Indian who protects a young mother from her unfaithful cowboy lover. The climactic confrontations take place on scrubby Neversink Valley hillsides and a porch with scrollwork brackets.
''I'm desperate to find that house,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''Every time we show this, we say: 'Does anybody know? Has anybody seen?' ''
On Sept. 19, Mr. Model, the pianist, will play during a screening of five recently digitized movies made in Cuddebackville, mostly Mary Pickford comedies. The museum staff is hoping for outbursts from audience members, recognizing a particular cliff or porch post or gable on screen, intact just down the road.

HEADLINE: For Stringer, Stint as a Barkeeper Proved Humbling

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Scott M. Stringer's career in politics seemed preordained: the son of a city councilwoman and a former City Hall counsel, he campaigned for his cousin Bella Abzug before his bar mitzvah and won a spot on a local planning board at age 16.
But at the cusp of middle age in the winter of 1991, disappointed by a failed bid for City Council, Mr. Stringer decided to pursue an entirely different path: restaurateur.
In madcap New York fashion, friends signed on, fathers chipped in and a celebrity folk singer lent his name to the enterprise, a Manhattan bar and saloon called the Uptown Local.
But after a year, Mr. Stringer's maiden voyage into the private sector was in disarray, mired in bankruptcy and an acrimonious dispute with the landlord, records show. 
For Mr. Stringer, 53, a Democrat who is now seeking to become the next comptroller, New York City's chief financial officer, it was a humbling education in the vicissitudes of the free market -- and an unequivocal sign that the rest of his career might be better spent in public office, where he has climbed the ranks for the past two decades.
''He was not the most successful businessman,'' Robert Ginsberg, one of Mr. Stringer's three partners in the venture, said.
A two-story dive on a not-quite-gentrified patch of the Upper West Side, Uptown Local was an amiable but chaotic operation, with a dimly lighted barroom and a glowing neon sign in the window. The kitchen served up rib-eye steaks and chicken Marsala beneath black-and-white photographs of Tammany Hall.
Boldface names -- by City Hall standards, anyway -- made cameos, including Jerrold L. Nadler, David A. Paterson and Ms. Abzug, who occasionally dropped by for a beer. There were cash-bar parties on presidential primary nights and a local campaign consultant performed jazz on weekends.
All that was missing, it seemed, were the patrons.
''It was quiet, slow,'' recalled Jerry Skurnik, a veteran Democratic strategist whose firm co-sponsored events at the restaurant. ''It was a bar that didn't have a lot of people in it.''
In an interview, Mr. Stringer, now the Manhattan borough president, conceded that his youthful ambitions had collided with a total lack of experience.
''I don't think there was a plan involved,'' he said with a lopsided grin, acknowledging that, even as a bartender, ''I wasn't particularly good at that stuff.''
But sitting a few storefronts away from the bar's old home, he looked back on Uptown Local as an eye-opening experiment in entrepreneurism.
''As somebody who was immersed in politics since I was a little boy,'' Mr. Stringer said, ''it was exciting to think about doing something a little different.''
Mr. Stringer and his partners, friends from the local political scene, envisioned a sophisticated spot in a neighborhood -- the West 90s -- then on the verge of an upswing. But their day jobs quickly proved distracting.
''We were always busy with other things,'' recalled Alan Handell, a partner who designed petition ballots for municipal campaigns. ''We didn't have time to focus on being at the restaurant very often.''
Seeking publicity, the proprietors arranged for a friend, Peter Yarrow, of the folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary, to stop by and draw a crowd. The bar apparently left little impression; reached by telephone, Mr. Yarrow said he had no recollection of the place.
The food was not especially memorable either, guests said.
''It was nothing to brag about,'' Mr. Ginsberg, the largest shareholder in the restaurant, said.
Mr. Stringer shrugged off the middling reviews. ''I ate there; I liked it,'' he said flatly, adding, ''The chicken was good.''
Despite an occasional busy weekend, the restaurant was struggling to find its niche. (It did not help that the partners ate many of their meals there free, according to Mr. Handell.) By January 1992, the owners could barely make their rent.
The landlord, claiming tens of thousands of dollars in missed payments, filed a lawsuit in city housing court. A payment plan was worked out, but Mr. Stringer and his partners failed to meet that deadline, too. Fed up, the landlord, Johny Melohn, moved to oust Uptown Local in June, but days before the eviction date, the partners declared bankruptcy.
At the time, Uptown Local was nearly $75,000 in debt, or about $125,000 in today's dollars. While hardly unusual in the restaurant world, the financial troubles left many of the bar's vendors, big and small, with sizable unpaid bills.
There was the restaurant's insurance company in White Plains, which was left hanging for $9,000. A linens outfitter on Long Island sued for $3,000 in missed payments, and a New Jersey store was still waiting for $200 worth of chocolate velvet mousse cakes and tiramisù, documents show.
When a kitchen supply company in Queens tried to cash three checks from the business, all bounced.
In an affidavit prepared by Mr. Stringer's father, a lawyer, the partners cited the economic downturn and a tough location as the cause of their bar's demise.
''The restaurant originally was designed to cater to an upper middle class crowd and had a sophisticated menu,'' the affidavit says, adding, ''The clientele for this type of restaurant did not develop.''
Chastened, the owners contemplated an abrupt culinary turnabout, switching from broiled lobster to ''a 'sandwich' menu with much lower prices.''
Mr. Stringer sought out new investors to no avail. A ladies' night promotion, advertised in the student paper at Columbia University, was also unsuccessful.
Soon, the more familiar waters of the political world began to beckon: a State Assembly seat in Mr. Stringer's district came open in fall 1992.
For the would-be barkeep, it was a clarifying moment.
''I said, 'That's my passion,' '' Mr. Stringer recalled thinking when he learned of the open seat. ''There's no doubt that's the thing I want to do.''
Mr. Stringer would go on to win the seat, although Uptown Local played a fateful role in that, too. When the local party committee met to choose a nominee, he was initially declared the loser; stricken, he retreated to the bar, where his staff determined the ballots had been miscounted. A committee official arrived and, after reviewing the evidence on the restaurant's second floor, agreed, later declaring Mr. Stringer the winner.
Mr. Stringer's opponent, who later sued, called it a back-room recount in a bar, which, technically speaking, it was, although a judge ultimately determined that Mr. Stringer was the true victor.
His return to political life, Mr. Stringer recalled, was greeted by his parents with sheer relief.
''I remember my mother saying, even back then: 'You know what? You're a better legislator than you were a restaurant owner, and that's just a fact,' '' he said.
These days, Uptown Local's old storefront is shuttered again; the most recent tenant, a French restaurant called Alouette, closed last year. Mr. Stringer does not dwell on his misfortune -- and has avoided any mention of it in his campaign biography. He said he could provide no photographs from those days, and declined to pose for a portrait in front of the vacant space.
Still, as he walked past, Mr. Stringer could not resist a moment's indulgence in what might have been.
''If this restaurant had been successful, there could be 150 Uptown Local franchises around the country right now,'' Mr. Stringer said, a glint in his eye. ''And we'd be talking about my small time in politics.''

Previews and Openings
'Avi Hoffman's Still Jewish After All These Years' (in previews; opens on Monday) You really needed to be told? After all, Mr. Hoffman began performing at the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater at the age of 10 and has enjoyed long runs in shows like ''Too Jewish?'' After a 15-year hiatus from the New York stage, the bigger news is that he is still performing through story and song after all these years. Stage 72, 158 West 72nd Street, Manhattan, (800) 838-3006, brownpapertickets.com. (Eric Grode) 
'The Awake' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Aug. 28) Have you ever watched Jonathan, Jack Donaghy's rabidly sycophantic assistant on ''30 Rock,'' and said to yourself, ''I'd really like to see him tackle existential drama''? Your wait is over: Maulik Pancholy, who played Jonathan, is part of this new, Orwellian-sounding play by Ken Urban (''The Private Lives of Eskimos'') about a mysterious corporation that connects three different people. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'Awake & Sing!' (previews start on Friday; opens on Wednesday) The National Asian American Theater Company kicks off its 24th season with this revival of Clifford Odets's 1935 classic about three generations of an impoverished Jewish family in the Bronx. Stephen Fried directs an Asian-American cast that includes the estimable Mia Katigbak. Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, naatco.org. (Grode)
'The Cheaters Club' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Aug. 27) If your neighborhood restaurant is suddenly a little short on servers, there's a good chance the Amoralists are presenting another play. Known for hiring actors by the dozens, the dependably pungent company will feature no fewer than 26 actors in its staging of Derek Ahonen's latest piece. This one is about a group of siblings who meet for an annual excursion of sexual release, but this year's destination -- a haunted inn in Savannah, Ga. -- proves to be a bit different. Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (866) 811-4111, theamoralists.com. (Grode)
'The Hill Town Plays' (in previews; opens on Sept. 5) Seemingly every space in the West Village that isn't hosting the New York International Fringe Festival will be part of this ambitious cycle of five related plays by Lucy Thurber (''Scarcity,'' ''Ashville,'' ''Where We're Born,'' ''Killers and Other Family,'' and ''Stay''). In addition to Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, Ms. Thurber's most reliable base of operations in New York (three of these plays have previously been staged there), Axis Theater and the New Ohio Theater and both Cherry Lane Theater spaces will present important stages in one fictional woman's life. Various locations, (866) 811-4111, theatervillage.com. (Grode)
'The Old Friends' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Sept. 12) The Signature Theater's devotion to Horton Foote continues with the premiere of this drama by Foote, who died in 2009 and whose late-career success was fueled in no small part by the Signature's season-long retrospective in 1994. Michael Wilson (''The Trip to Bountiful'') directs two fellow Foote veterans, Lois Smith and Horton's daughter Hallie Foote, as well as Betty Buckley in this play about an uneasy meeting between two Texas farming families. 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Grode)
'stop. reset.' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Sept. 8) The future of the written word is very much on the minds of the employees of a Chicago publishing house in this new play written and directed by Regina Taylor (''Crowns''). In the course of trying to find an answer, the company's owner meets what the press materials describe as ''a mysterious youth plugged into the future,'' which seems like a pretty good description of young people in general these days. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Grode)
Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may occasionally feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Anthony Warlow and Faith Prince as Miss Hannigan (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'First Date' The winning Zachary Levi and Krysta Rodriguez star in this cliché-ridden romantic comedy, with a book by Austin Winsberg and a score by Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner. Mr. Levi is the nice Jewish boy who's had his heart kicked around, Ms. Rodriguez is a boho chick with lots of experience. They're all wrong for each other, right? Sorry, but no prizes will be given for guessing how this familiar story ends (1:30). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Kinky Boots' Cyndi Lauper has created a love-and-heat-seeking score that performs like a pop star on Ecstasy. This Harvey Fierstein-scripted tale of lost souls in shoe business, in which a young factory owner (Stark Sands) teams up with a drag queen (Billy Porter), sometimes turns into a sermon. But it's hard to resist the audience-hugging charisma of the songs in this Tony winner for best new musical (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Let It Be' Another Beatles tribute on Broadway? But this concert is the best of the bunch by far, with a rotating cast, 40 or so songs, and a burst of musical magical realism (2:20). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, letitbebroadway.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'Matilda the Musical' The most satisfying and subversive musical ever to come out of Britain. Directed by Matthew Warchus, with a book by Dennis Kelly and addictive songs by Tim Minchin, this adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel is an exhilarating tale of empowerment, told from the perspective of that most powerless group, little children. Bertie Carvel is priceless as their schoolmistress nemesis (2:35). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Motown: The Musical' A dramatically slapdash but musically vibrant joy ride through the glory days of the Detroit music label founded by Berry Gordy. Mr. Gordy's book is sketchy and obvious -- you want to plug your ears whenever the music stops. But the music is, of course, some of the greatest R&B ever recorded, and the performers mostly electric (2:40). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Pippin' Diane Paulus sends in the acrobats for her exhaustingly energetic (and now Tony-winning) revival of Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson's 1972 musical. As for the 99-pound story at the center of this muscle-bound spectacle -- the one about the starry-eyed son of Charlemagne (Matthew James Thomas) -- that's there too, if you look hard. With Patina Miller and a delightful Andrea Martin (2:35). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella' This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us ''Oklahoma!,'' has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Trip to Bountiful' Michael Wilson's slow-handed staging of Horton Foote's 1953 drama about an old woman's journey into the past is most notable for its remarkable star, Cicely Tyson, who seems thoroughly rejuvenated by her return to Broadway. The attractive supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Vanessa Williams and Adepero Oduye (2:10). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Portraying a woman mired in what appears to be a permanent midlife crisis, the marvelous comic actor Kristine Nielsen provides much of the laughing gas in Christopher Durang's uneven but intermittently delightful riff on Chekhovian themes. David Hyde Pierce and Julie White also star in this Tony-winning play directed by Nicholas Martin (2:30). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Around the World in 80 Days' This stage version of the Jules Verne novel is an odd combination of steampunk and vaudeville. The actors' shameless mugging grows annoying after a while, but the pace stays brisk and the energy level high (1:30). New Theater at 45th Street, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, aroundtheworldinnyc.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Bill W. and Dr. Bob' Making the story of the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous 99 percent preachiness-free is quite an accomplishment. Samuel Shem and Janet Surrey's purpose-driven script, which never forgets the humor of the human experience, goes a long way toward making this a satisfying revival (2:15).

&#x2605; 'Buyer & Cellar' Jonathan Tolins has concocted an irresistible one-man play from the most peculiar of fictitious premises -- an underemployed Los Angeles actor goes to work in Barbra Streisand's Malibu, Calif., basement -- allowing the playwright to ruminate with delicious wit and perspicacity on the solitude of celebrity, the love-hate attraction between gay men and divas, and the melancholy that lurks beneath narcissism. In the capable hands of the director Stephen Brackett and the wickedly charming actor Michael Urie, this seriously funny slice of absurdist whimsy creates the illusion of a stage filled with multiple people, all of them with their own droll point of view (1:30). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (David Rooney)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). Fridays and Saturdays only. St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gates)
'Cuff Me: The Fifty Shades of Grey Musical Parody' What can I possibly say that isn't said by the title of this production? Here's one thing: It's not exactly great theater, but I'd still rather see ''Cuff Me'' than read the novel upon which it's based (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Claudia La Rocco)
&#x2605; 'The Designated Mourner' This revival of Wallace Shawn's anatomy of a survivor in a totalitarian country makes the definitive case for its author as one of the most complex and uncompromising moralists of the American theater. André Gregory, who directed the New York premiere in 2000, returns with the same first-rate cast: Deborah Eisenberg, Larry Pine and Mr. Shawn (3:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'The Great Society' Beginning just after the Kennedy assassination in 1963, Alexander Harrington's play follows President Lyndon Baines Johnson as he seeks to win passage of civil rights and antipoverty legislation even as the growing involvement in Vietnam swamps his administration and forces him to not seek re-election in 1968. Mitch Tebo makes a fine L.B.J., but the play has trouble keeping up with the sheer number of issues it tries to cover. Events are mostly headlines, dialogue is limited to exposition and the opportunity to understand Johnson is diminished (2:40).

'Harbor' Family and children are on the playwright Chad Beguelin's mind in this comedy about a gay couple and the manipulative sister who came to stay. ''Harbor'' doesn't quite succeed as social satire -- the humor often feels overfamiliar and the sister's quips about gayness start to grate the audience as well as their intended targets. But the play, a Primary Stages production, does better as a study of characters realigning family loyalties in a changing world (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (Rachel Saltz)
'I Forgive You, Ronald Reagan' This overwrought new play, about the aftermath of the 1981 air-traffic controller strike, wants very much to be a modern-day ''Death of a Salesman.'' It has its own working-class hero who loses his identity (and ultimately his sanity) after being forced out of his livelihood, and who compensates by pinning unrealistic hopes on his coddled, lazy offspring. But problems with John S. Anastasi's script keep us from fully empathizing with its Everyman protagonist and agreeing that attention must be paid (2:00).

'It's Just Sex' Jeff Gould's lightweight comedy, a long-running hit in Los Angeles, is about three married couples whose party turns into an evening of spouse-swapping and postcoital navel-gazing (metaphorically). The cast is personable, but the script's only deep thought is that if women were told they could talk only to one person for the rest of their lives, they would understand why sexual fidelity is so stifling for men (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gates)
'Me and Jezebel' Kelly Moore (that's Mr. Kelly Moore) is great fun to watch as Bette Davis in Elizabeth Fuller's real-life ''Man Who Came to Dinner'' story. Too bad Ms. Fuller, who plays herself, isn't really an actress. This comedy about a movie star taking over the guest room and the lives of a Connecticut family one month in 1985 is admirably self-deprecating (1:45).

&#x2605; 'Murder for Two' A virtuosic Jeff Blumenkrantz plays all the suspects, and Brett Ryback the investigating officer, in this nifty mystery musical comedy by Joe Kinosian and Kellen Blair. The actors also provide the music, taking turns at the piano, under Scott Schwartz's fleet direction (1:30).

'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place: the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic neighborhood in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30).

&#x2605; 'Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812' Dave Malloy's transporting pop opera dramatizes an emotionally potent slice of Tolstoy's ''War and Peace.'' Rachel Chavkin directs a superb young cast who bring the loves and losses of 19th-century Russian aristocrats to vibrant, intimate life in a stylish cabaret setting expressly built for the production (2:30).

&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10).

&#x2605; 'Potted Potter' With no new Harry Potter adventures to pore over, what's a Muggle in need of a fix to do? One answer: this gloriously goofy parody by Daniel Clarkson and Jefferson Turner, which compresses a retelling of the seven books into 70 minutes, complete with a game of Quidditch. Clearly the two comics attended Professor Flitwick's charms class, because they cast the perfect spell over the audience: reductio ad absurdum (1:10). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gold)
&#x2605; 'rogerandtom' From a conventional start -- Penny waits in her apartment for Roger to arrive so they can go see the new play by their brother Tom -- Julien Schwab's witty absurdist comedy quickly gets surreal, with a subtle plot that twists and folds back on itself. Smartly using meta-theatrical devices like a broken ''fourth wall'' and benefiting from excellent performances, the play reminds us that acting doesn't only take place onstage (1:10). Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101, here.org. (Gold)
'Shida' This one-woman musical, written and performed by Jeannette Bayardelle, is an earnest portrait of Shida, a young woman who survives sexual abuse and drugs to reach adulthood with new-found hope. The structure, though, racing from scene to scene and song to song, doesn't allow Shida to emerge as a distinct individual; she feels instead like a generic compilation (1:10).

&#x2605; Summer Shorts 2013 (Series A) The first set in this year's edition of short plays at 59E59 Theaters -- a tasty and astringent foray into show-business rivalry by Neil LaBute, an imagining of Sarah Palin's job interview with John McCain by Lucas Hnath, and a fairy tale satire by Tina Howe -- is consistently entertaining without dramatic histrionics or knee-slapping hilarity (1:45). 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Andy Webster)
Summer Shorts 2013 (Series B) The three comedies in Series B of 59E59 Theater's annual roundup of short plays are a mixed bag. Marian Fontana's heartfelt, if predictable, ''Falling Short'' has great one-liners but mines familiar territory to win sympathy for its online-dating heroine; Paul Weitz's ''Change'' lampoons drug burnouts and the bourgeoisie in such scrupulously equal measure that its criticism of the characters neutralizes itself. But Alan Zweibel's ''Pine Cone Moment'' -- about lovers in their autumn years haunted by their dead spouses -- is a deliciously goofy, romantic and sometimes joyously antic confection. You'll leave the theater smiling (1:45) 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Webster)
&#x2605; 'The Two-Character Play' Playing strung-out sibling theater troupers in Tennessee Williams's rarely seen fever dream of an eternal folie à deux, Amanda Plummer and Brad Dourif don't just strike sparks. They're a raging conflagration that keeps changing form and direction. Gene David Kirk directs this revival of a demented, messy and oddly affecting self-portrait from an American master (2:10).

'The Unavoidable Disappearance of Tom Durnin' David Morse gives a precise, chilling performance as the title character, a mini-Madoff, in Steven Levenson's downbeat drama about a man trying to make amends for the damage his crime inflicted on his family (1:40).

'Unbroken Circle' Eve Plumb, a k a Jan of ''The Brady Bunch,'' demonstrates a flair for grown-up comedy as a born-again Christian with drinking and divorce habits in James Wesley's comic drama. Too bad the production is uncertainly paced and a little unpolished, because this story of a 1970s Texas family dealing with the death of an abusive patriarch has a lot going for it (1:50).

&#x2605; 'The Vaudevillians' The drag performer Jinkx Monsoon (real name: Jerick Hoffer) and her accompanist, Major Scales (Richard Andriessen) turn a simple conceit into a hilarious evening. They are vaudeville performers who were frozen in an avalanche in the 1920s. Thawed out in the present, they find that many of their songs -- ''I Will Survive,'' for instance -- have been repurposed by more recent performers. They reclaim them, vaudeville style (1:25).

&#x2605; 'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended.

'Wanda's Monster' Making Books Sing, which turns children's books into musicals, has adapted Eileen Spinelli's 2002 picture book about Wanda, a little girl who knows that a monster lives in her closet. Barbara Zinn Krieger, who wrote the script, has transformed Wanda's Granny -- the only adult who acknowledges the truth of Wanda's perception -- from a sensible soul into a kick-out-the-jams rocker. This characterization works beautifully with the show's upbeat score and lyrics by the children's pop star Laurie Berkner. This charming production brings home a point worth considering at any age: embrace what you fear, and you just may find a friend (1:00).

Last Chance
&#x2605; 'The Civil War' (closes on Friday) Presented by Theatreworks USA's free summer theater program, this earnest and absorbing musical for families illuminates history through period songs and the perspectives of a handful of well-chosen characters: a girl who disguises herself as a man to join the Confederate army; a struggling Irish immigrant and Union corporal; a plantation owner's son and his former best friend, who was also his father's slave. With a book by Arthur Perlman and musical arrangements and one new Broadway-style number by Jeff Lunden, the production is stronger in its intense, intimate moments than in its bids for comic relief. You sense the weight of the carnage in America's bloodiest war: the Union, fortunately, won, but everybody lost (1:15). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, twusa.org. (Graeber)
'King Kong' (closes on Thursday) This free musical, part of the SummerStage festival in parks around the city, is set in 1978 and very loosely based on the classic story. It finds the owners of a record label venturing into the Bronx to find a mythical musician (1:30). Various city parks; summerstage.org. (Jaworowski)
'Love's Labour's Lost' (closes on Sunday) A splashy, hit-or-miss musical from the talented writer and director Alex Timbers and the composer Michael Friedman, this adaptation of Shakespeare's early comedy about passion-addled students passes muster as a silly diversion for the silly season. Filled with spirited pastiches of a variety of pop songs, the show keeps trying on different stances like an attention-deficient kid in a Halloween costume shop (1:30). Delacorte Theater, Central Park, enter the park at 81st Street and Central Park West, (212) 539-8750, shakespeareinthepark.org. (Brantley)

'Storyville' (closes on Saturday) This Ed Bullins and Mildred Kayden musical may begin with a funeral procession, but in this production, set in New Orleans in 1917, the mood is not mournful. The contrived plot concerns a boxer-trumpeter and a singer trying to escape the confinements of the Crescent City demimonde. But the show is really about atmosphere and music, which its costume and scenic designers and spirited cast generously deliver (2:15).

HEADLINE: A Federal Program to Ease Congestion at Border Crossings

BYLINE: By JULIÁN AGUILAR. 
jaguilar@texastribune.org

 BODY:
LAREDO -- Pedestrians waited in a long line on the bridge between Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and this South Texas city one recent day, as one vehicle after another in slow procession was inspected by United States Customs and Border Protection officials.
Partly as a result of increased traffic after the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect and because of a post-9/11 security buildup, the time it takes to cross into Laredo from Mexico is typically several hours. 
But local governments have begun to sort out details of a new program aimed at reducing long backups. Under the plan, local governments will be able to request extra staffing at border choke points from the federal customs agency. They would then reimburse the federal government for extra services provided.
Four of the five ports chosen for the program are in Texas: the South Texas Assets Consortium, which includes international bridges in Laredo as well as Cameron County, McAllen, Pharr and Rio Grande City; international bridges in El Paso; George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston; and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
Proponents say the local and federal partnerships will benefit Texas' growing trade with Mexico. In 2012, more than $229 billion in trade passed through the Laredo customs district, up from $207 billion the previous year. In the El Paso district, trade was $86 billion, up from $78.1 billion a year earlier, according to WorldCity, which tracks global trade patterns.
Under the program, local governments can create port staffing proposals tailored to their needs, and customs officials can then assign agents to satisfy the proposals.
''Each individual will have an opportunity to do what's best for their community,'' said Sam Vale, the president of South Texas Assets Consortium.
''A decision will have to be made on a case-by-case basis,'' Mr. Vale said. ''That's the way you enter this game -- you start with something, and that's the only thing that's clear.''
A proposal by the City of El Paso, for instance, will make seasonal adjustments for the number of agents in pedestrian and passenger vehicle lanes, according to information the city sent to Thomas S. Winkowski, the acting federal customs commissioner.
Mr. Vale said the program was a way to increase security for a seasonal events. For example, he said, during a winter celebration that Nuevo Laredo and Laredo stage together, Laredo could submit a proposal for increased staffing to handle the larger numbers of people crossing the border.
Laredo could decide to use sales tax revenue to pay for three additional lanes based on an overtime rate, Mr. Vale said. ''So they would send a request to C.B.P. asking for that,'' he said. ''If they agree, they would sign a work order number, then they will deliver the services.''
Adjustments could be negotiated for bus lines or commercial vehicles that crossed during off-peak hours, he said.
United States Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Laredo, said that in its early stages, the program would include only financing for overtime pay. Mr. Cuellar was part of a bipartisan Congressional group that sponsored the new program.
Similar arrangements are in place at several airports across the country, he said. Under the User Fee Airport Program, an airport can ask the customs agency for help in processing aircraft entering the United States from abroad. Airports in Addison, Dallas, Fort Worth, Harlingen, McKinney, Midland, San Antonio and Sugar Land are already enrolled and reimburse customs for the cost of the service.
The pilot program ''is only service, not for infrastructure,'' Mr. Cuellar said. ''It's been done in the past. The private sector can stand their ground.''
Mr. Cuellar said four of the five sites chosen for the program are in Texas because the people who run them ''know what they're doing.'' But others said that the government was playing favorites.
''We don't need the government picking winners and losers,'' Lance Jungmeyer, the president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, based in Nogales, Ariz., said in a statement. ''What we need is recognition that security at our southwestern ports of entry also entails economic security.''
But Mr. Vale said the program should be viewed as a benefit to consumers and travelers.
''Is that picking a winner or loser, or is that good public policy -- to maximize the locations where you can export your products?'' he said.
Mr. Cuellar acknowledged that private sector groups had raised concerns, but he said those fears were overblown.
Oversight, he said, ''is service overtime only. If air cargo can do it, and they are big boys that handle themselves, then certainly land ports can handle themselves.''
The program was in the federal appropriations bill signed in March and was proposed as part of the Cross-Border Trade Enhancement Act of 2013, a bipartisan effort by United States Representatives Cuellar; Michael McCaul, Republican of Austin; Pete Gallego, Democrat of Alpine; Filemon Vela, Democrat of Brownsville; Blake Farenthold, Republican of Corpus Christi; and Beto O'Rourke, Democrat of El Paso. Senator John Cornyn filed a companion bill.
Mr. Cuellar said the House of Representatives had already passed a measure approving 1,600 more customs agents, which could mean that the pilot program will be only a stopgap measure.
He dismissed assertions that the federal government was skirting its responsibility and leaving staffing to local entities.
''This isn't mandatory,'' Mr. Cuellar said. ''If a local entity or a pilot entity wants to put a little extra so they can move things faster because time is of the essence, then I think they should be allowed to.''

HEADLINE: No Banker Left Behind

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
The Detroit bankruptcy case has been cast as a contest between bondholders and pensioners that can be resolved only by shared sacrifice.
In principle, we have no problem with that, though in practice, the pensioners' fair share will have to take into account their extreme vulnerability: Public pensions are not federally insured and many municipal retirees do not receive Social Security. 
What we do have a problem with is shared sacrifice that does not seem to apply to the big banks that abetted Detroit's descent into bankruptcy.
Last month, just days before its bankruptcy filing, Detroit reached its first settlement with creditors. The settlement was with UBS and Bank of America, and though the precise terms will not be nailed down until the bankruptcy judge weighs in, Detroit is set to pay an estimated $250 million to terminate a soured derivatives transaction from 2005.
The derivatives, known as interest-rate swaps, were supposed to protect Detroit from rising interest payments on a chunk of its variable rate debt. The banks would pay Detroit if interest rates rose, and Detroit would pay the banks if rates fell. By 2009, both interest rates and the city's credit rating were falling, forcing Detroit to pay the banks some $50 million a year and to pledge roughly $11 million a month in casino-tax revenue as additional collateral.
In the settlement, Detroit will keep the casino-tax revenue. It will also reduce its debt load, according to city officials, because the banks have agreed to a discount of as much as 25 percent off what they are owed. But the haircut doesn't mean that the banks will suffer. They have already made money on the swaps; the true extent of any discount will not be known until the deal is finalized.
This much is clear:
â- The banks' 25 percent hit is nothing compared with the city's suggested 90 percent cut to the pensions' unfunded liability -- which will result in benefit cuts that would be disastrous in both human and political terms and that the State of Michigan must prevent from happening.
â- Municipal officials are prey for Wall Street. The Dodd-Frank financial reform law called on regulators to establish ''enhanced protection'' for municipalities and other clients in their dealings with Wall Street, but the Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet completed rules, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's rules are so weak as to virtually invite the banks to exploit municipalities.
â- The special treatment banks receive when debtors are in or near bankruptcy is unfair and economically destabilizing. Detroit's agreement with the two banks requires court approval, but, in general, swap deals by banks are not subject to the constraints that normally apply in bankruptcy cases; in effect, the banks are paid first, even before other secured creditors and certainly before pensioners. That privilege, dating to the heyday of derivatives deregulation in the 1990s and 2000s, is destabilizing because the assurance of repayment fosters recklessness.
Detroit's problems are a reminder of broader challenges, identified but still unmet: protecting pensions; protecting municipalities from Wall Street; and, at long last, revoking the obscene privileges of banks that allow them to prosper on the failings of others.

HEADLINE: What to Do With a Windfall

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
MIDLAND, Mich. -- As Dow Chemical's chief executive, Andrew N. Liveris has made himself into something of an outcast among his fellow business leaders.
The reason? He is spearheading a public campaign against increased exports of natural gas, which he sees as a threat to a manufacturing renaissance in the United States, not to mention his own company's bottom line. But many others say such exports would provide far more benefits to the country than drawbacks, all part of a transformation that promises to increase the nation's weight in the global economy.
The debate has grown personal. In the words of Charif Souki, an energy industry executive promoting a new natural gas export facility, Mr. Liveris is both ''self-serving'' and a ''hypocrite.''
Now it seems that one constituency where Mr. Liveris had gained a sympathetic ear, the federal government, may also have turned against him. Last week, the Energy Department approved another planned project to export natural gas, the second such proposal it has accepted since May. 
The battle over natural gas exports reflects just how starkly the nation's economic landscape is being reshaped by newfound energy supplies -- much of the discoveries in the form of oil and gas being freed up by unconventional methods like horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing.
As environmentalists and industry advocates debate the merits and risks of fracking, as the practice is frequently called, its consequences are increasingly visible. Last week, the government reported a sharply improved trade balance for June, largely because of lower oil imports.
By 2020, new oil and gas production could increase the country's economic output by 2 to 4 percent beyond what it otherwise would be, add as many as 1.7 million jobs and perhaps reduce the bill for energy imports to zero, according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute.
''This is a giant turnaround,'' said Daniel Yergin, a longtime energy expert and author of a recent book, ''The Quest: Energy, Security and the Remaking of the Modern World.'' ''This is fundamentally improving the competitive position of the United States in the world economy.''
But that windfall is at risk if the government permits natural gas exports to increase quickly, Mr. Liveris warns.
''What a hand the United States has been dealt!'' he said in an interview in his office here.
To nurture the nation's good luck, he says, the government needs to plan an energy policy that carefully balances the interests of the oil and gas companies that want to freely export natural gas with those of industries like Dow Chemical that fear that an export boom could outpace domestic gas supplies and bring higher energy prices.
An Australian by birth and citizenship, Mr. Liveris has emerged as the principal opponent of unfettered natural gas exports. Mr. Liveris has founded a lobbying organization to promote his cause, and he sharply criticized an Energy Department report last December that said liquefied gas could produce $30 billion a year in export earnings without meaningfully driving up domestic gas prices for consumers.
''Why should we gamble?'' he asked. ''I think we should be out of the gambling business on energy policy. I mean, we're not in the gambling business on food policy. We're not in the gambling business on defense.''
After spiking in the last decade, natural gas prices in the United States have hovered between $3 and $4 per million B.T.U.'s this year. That is down from a high of $12 before the recession, and a fraction of what it costs in Asia and Europe.
That price differential is one reason exports are so appealing for domestic energy companies, who are willing to spend billions to build export facilities to ship liquefied natural gas in tankers in the hopes of selling it overseas.
On the other hand, cheap domestic supplies mean Dow -- one of the biggest private consumers of natural gas in the country -- and other chemical companies are now paying much less than their foreign competitors for the raw material they turn into products like plastic, raising profit margins. It could also bring back jobs to the United States as manufacturers that use natural gas for energy benefit, Mr. Liveris says, although that renaissance is just in its infancy.
Mr. Liveris withdrew his company from the National Association of Manufacturers this year when his ideas clashed with those of other members, particularly Exxon Mobil, which hopes to convert a Louisiana gas terminal that was built to import the fuel to process exports instead. In an interview, Ken Cohen, an Exxon Mobil vice president, said that having a major business leader like Mr. Liveris supporting ''protectionism'' is so incongruous that ''it's almost like man bites dog.''
Mr. Liveris even came close to withdrawing Dow Chemical from the American Chemistry Council over the export issue, until the trade group modified its pro-export position.
So far, the Obama administration has granted permits to three terminal projects, two in Louisiana and one in Texas, and it appears to be on a gradual path to approve a handful more over the next several years to avoid risking the natural gas price spike Mr. Liveris fears.
But there is increasing pressure to move more quickly, because Canada is planning to build a few export terminals on the Pacific Coast, which could compete for Asian markets.
In the United States, roughly 15 proposed gas projects await regulatory approval; if all were approved they could export the equivalent of more than a third of the domestically consumed natural gas. Along with an expected future increase in natural gas consumed by vehicles and industry, such an export boom would undoubtedly push prices up.
But few experts say they believe most of those terminals will be approved. They say only a handful of the companies applying have the deep pockets to attract sufficient financing to build the facilities, which can cost $7 billion or more each.
Credit Suisse estimates that by 2017 United States gas exports will reach 3.6 billion cubic feet a day, or 5 percent of current domestic demand, and most experts say export levels could reach between 8 billion and 10 billion cubic feet a day well into the 2020s. At the same time, gas producers say they can easily pump more natural gas, especially if prices go up from the current low level of between $3.30 and $3.40 per million B.T.U.'s.
Not surprisingly Mr. Liveris has become a lightning rod among economists and business leaders, particularly those in the oil and gas drilling business, who say he is espousing protectionism merely to promote the interests of his own company.
''He is coming across as a hypocrite and a self-serving person,'' said Mr. Souki, chief executive of Cheniere Energy, which won the first permit to export gas, from its Sabine Pass, La., terminal. ''He wants free trade for everything he manufactures but no free trade for anybody else.''
Mr. Liveris concedes that the interests of his company coincide with his views. But he says that as the chief executive of Dow Chemical he also represents the interests of energy consumers at large, and he understands better than most what high gas prices can mean for the economy.
He says he remembers the impact of escalating domestic natural gas prices between 2001 and 2005, when the company was forced to cancel plans to build a $4 billion chemical plant in Texas.
''I'm protecting my shareholders,'' he said, adding that $5 billion to $6 billion in new Dow Chemical investments were depending on the continuation of low gas prices ''and not repeating the '01-to-'05 movie.''
''What would make that repeat movie occur?'' he asked rhetorically. He pointed to his native Australia, which he said exported 90 percent of its gas. That has caused, he said, ''the collapse of the manufacturing sector -- and, by the way, the retail sector's paying through the nose. We're paying Japanese electricity prices in Australia, yet Australia is gas-rich.''
Dow Chemical has assembled a list of more than 120 manufacturing projects, representing investments of $100 billion, that are being planned or are already under construction in the United States at least partly because of lower gas prices. The beginnings of the manufacturing renaissance Mr. Liveris imagines for petrochemicals, fertilizers, steel, aluminum, pulp paper and cement can be seen at its giant complex of plants in Freeport, Tex., the largest of its kind in the world.
The complex is a wonder of chemical engineering that has 6.5 million miles of pipe, employs more than 8,000 people and consumes enough electricity to power a city of three million people. And it is growing bigger.
The company is investing $4 billion to build a ethylene plant to manufacture a vital building block for adhesives, plastic packaging and sealants; a propylene plant that will produce a chemical used to make mattresses, toys and shampoo; a chlorine plant; and a herbicide plant. More could come -- if prices for natural gas, the vital feedstock for all the chemicals, remain low.
As he surveyed workers setting rebar and installing framing for concrete to build a control room for two new plants, Earl Shipp, Dow Chemical's vice president for United States Gulf Coast operations, said, ''You know, we can't do this without affordable natural gas.''
Some others who are investing heavily in the gulf region, however, do not agree with Mr. Liveris.
Peter L. Cella, chief executive of the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, said that there was a risk that domestic natural gas prices could rise in the future, but that prices also could fall. ''We need enough demand growth to keep the supply coming,'' he said. ''We believe markets work best when there are no artificial constraints or stimulants to supply and demand.''
Mr. Liveris says that he also favors free markets, but that energy, like defense and food, requires special care to protect the national interest. Exporting natural gas is fine, he says, but not at the price of importing it back in the form of goods made with cheap gas elsewhere.
''The paint ingredients need the paint can,'' he said. ''The paint supply chain needs trucks. The trucks go to warehouses. Warehouses go to retail. I'm not importing finished goods. I'm making them in the United States of America.''

HEADLINE: Morning Agenda: Icahn's Fight Over Dell Heads to Court

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Carl C. Icahn is heading to the Delaware Court of Chancery in his effort to stop a buyout of Dell. | Two private equity investors agreed on Thursday to buy the New Jersey Devils hockey team. | In the wake of scandals, India is aiming to overhaul its corporate oversight laws. 

 BODY:
ICAHN'S FIGHT OVER DELL HEADS TO COURT | Carl C. Icahn is heading to the Delaware Court of Chancery in his effort to stop a buyout of Dell by its founder. On Friday, the court is scheduled to consider whether to expedite Mr. Icahn's lawsuit against the board of the computer maker. (The hearing had originally been planned for earlier this week.) Mr. Icahn is seeking to have the court schedule a hearing to consider his claims that two meetings planned for Dell - to vote on the buyout and to elect directors - should be held on the same date. Steven M. Davidoff wrote in DealBook about the case this month.
On Thursday, Dell reported earnings that highlighted its continuing challenges. The company reported that net income in its fiscal second quarter fell 72 percent to $204 million from $732 million a year earlier. Revenue was $14.5 billion, virtually flat from a year earlier but better than the $14.18 billion that analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected. The adjusted earnings per share of 25 cents were a penny better than analysts' expectations. 
The results might motivate shareholders to support the effort by Michael S. Dell and Silver Lake to take the company private. "The PC market continues to trend below expectations. It will play into Michael Dell's plea to take the company private," Jayson Noland, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company, told Bloomberg News.
A DEAL FOR THE DEVILS | Two private equity investors - Joshua Harris, a co-founder of Apollo Global Management, and David S. Blitzer, the head of tactical opportunities for the Blackstone Group - agreed on Thursday to buy the New Jersey Devils hockey team for about $320 million. Both men are members of the group that bought the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, with Mr. Harris serving as principal owner, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced writes.
"Though neither man is a native of Philadelphia, both graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and have long rooted for the city's teams. But both men are part of the latest generation of financiers to buy pro sports organizations as trophy properties," Mr. de la Merced writes. "Part of the selling point for bringing in private equity owners - other than their big bank accounts - is their expertise in turning around troubled enterprises."
ON THE AGENDA | Investors in SAC Capital Advisors have a deadline tonight to ask for their money back. Data on housing starts in July is out at 8:30 a.m. The Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for August is out at 9:55 a.m. Matthew Maloney, the chief executive of GrubHub Seamless, is on Bloomberg TV at 8:45 a.m. 
INDIA SEEKS TO OVERHAUL CORPORATE OVERSIGHT | "In the wake of global scandals involving kickbacks and accounting fraud, one unlikely country, India, is aiming to set a tone in overhauling its corporate oversight laws," Jen Swanson reports in DealBook. "This month, the nation's upper house of Parliament passed the Companies Bill, 2012, sweeping legislation meant to overhaul auditing, impose stiffer penalties for fraud and create more government oversight of businesses."
"The lower house had passed the bill last year. Once India's president, Pranab Mukherjee, signs it into law, it will replace India's 57-year-old corporate legislation that critics say had failed to keep up with changes in business practices."

HEADLINE: Controlling Health Care Spending, Revisited

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: It is unlikely that health care spending in the United States will grow more quickly than gross domestic product, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
A hotly debated question among health policy wonks is whether the decline in the year-to-year growth in health spending in the United States, which started in 2002 (see Figure 1), will leave that growth rate at a permanently lower level. 
I had a blog post on this question in January 2012, drawing no conclusion but noting that over the longer term the growth rate just had to come down closer to the level of growth in gross domestic product. 
An intriguing question is what drives the fluctuations in the growth of health spending clearly visible in Figure 1. It was a topic at a recent symposium convened by the Altarum Center for Sustainable Health Spending.

In a joint effort, Thomas Getzen, professor emeritus of economics at Temple University; Gary Claxton and Larry Levitt, senior vice presidents of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, and Charles Roehrig, vice president of the Altarum Institute, developed a statistical model in which the annual growth rate in nominal national health spending (not adjusted for inflation) in any given year over the long period 1965-2012 is assumed to be driven primarily by two macroeconomic variables: (1) the inflation rate in the current and the previous two years, measured by the G.D.P. deflator, and (2) the growth rate in real G.D.P. in the current year, as well as in the previous five years. The approach is called "lagged regression analysis."
The model was able to explain 85 percent of the observed variation in the annual growth of national health spending, as is illustrated in the authors' chart, which depicts the actual and the predicted growth rate in nominal health spending.
One concludes from this analysis that both year-to-year fluctuations in national health spending and the longer-term trend in that growth rate are driven primarily by current and prior-year changes in macroeconomic conditions.
One also infers from the model that if either inflation or the growth in real G.D.P. in the United States should pick up again, then the growth of national health spending should be expected to pick up again as well. 
There is an emerging consensus among health economists, however, that other factors within United States health care itself have contributed to the decline in health spending growth and will prevent that growth rate from returning to levels observed in previous decades.
, which devoted most of its May 2013 issue to health spending, the Harvard economists David Cutler and Nikhil Sahni explore health spending during the last decade only. They conclude that the recession of 2007-9 contributed only 37 percent of the decline in the growth rate in health spending during 2003-12, that another 8 percent can be explained by certain structural changes in the United States health system and that about 55 percent of the decline remains unexplained. 
Among these other factors they list more cost-sharing by patients, less rapid development than was seen in the 1980s and 1990s of expensive new medical technology, including pharmaceutical products, and greater efficiency in the delivery of health care in response to downward pressure on revenue growth (in this connection, see also a paper by Kenneth Kaufman and Mark Grube). 
In a similar vein, John Holahan and Stacey McMorrow of the Urban Institute conclude from their review of health spending trends in the last decade that macroeconomic conditions certainly were a primary factor in the lower health spending growth in recent years, but that other factors played a role as well, among them growing income inequality and the resulting decline of real income for millions of Americans, a decline in the number of Americans with employment-based health insurance and an accompanying increase in Medicaid enrollment as well as greater cost sharing by patients under private health insurance.
Now it will be noted in Figure 1 that a pronounced decline in the annual growth of health spending is not unique to the period 2002-12. There was a similar decline during 1989-96, only to end up in a sharp reversal. So is this time different?
In 1989-96, it was widely thought that "managed care" would be able to permanently subdue what was called the "health care cost monster." Private health plans had gained leverage over the providers of health care through selective contracting, which meant that the plans would channel their insured only to a restricted network of doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and other providers of health care who were willing to make price concessions and tolerate external utilization control by the plans. Health plans could not, of course, actually dictate what physicians and patients could or could not do, but they could refuse to pay for particular procedures or added inpatient days in the hospital.
These various strictures imposed on doctors and their patients worked for about half a decade. By the mid-1990s, though, a nationwide backlash rose against managed care, swiftly seized upon under the banner of "Patients' Bill of Rights," by political entrepreneurs including President Clinton, who, ironically, had earlier based his own health reform plan on managed care. I describe it all in a paper, "The Predictable Managed Care Kvetch on the Rocky Road From Adolescence to Adulthood" (which, by the way, begins with a fake White House memorandum that apparently fooled more than few people). 
To preserve industrial peace among employees chafing under the strictures of managed care, employers swiftly asked their agents in the health care market - the health plan - to relent, to substantially broaden their networks of providers and to ease up on utilization controls. By the end of the decade, it was business as usual in health care in the United States, as can clearly be seen in Figure 1.
Although I cannot be sure, I speculate that two developments since then have made a repeat performance of the later 1990s unlikely in the years ahead.
First, there have been enormous advances in health information technology, putting more and more of the traditionally opaque health care industry into statistical fishbowls that reveal to the world information on both the quality and the prices of health care. As I noted in my previous post, this greater transparency will make it possible to force real price competition on the supply side of the health system, including the powerful instrument of reference pricing.
Second, for the foreseeable future - in contrast to the late 1990s, when the American economy was booming and labor markets were tight - economic growth is likely to be relatively sluggish, as will be labor markets for all but highly skilled workers. It is my theory, forged by the experience of the 1990s, that under employment-based health insurance attempts at cost control will fail unless there is high unemployment.
Employees who worry about keeping their jobs or unemployed workers desperately seeking jobs are more likely to accept limits on their health insurance, along with higher levels of cost sharing, including reference pricing.
In the three decades preceding 2002, health spending in the United States tended over the longer run to grow two percentage points a year faster than did G.D.P. Absent periods in which G.D.P. declines sharply, I would be surprised if health spending in the future grew even one percentage point faster than G.D.P. The actual differential may well be south of that.

HEADLINE: Deflation in the Ticket Line

BYLINE: JOHN ROBBINS


HIGHLIGHT: Metropolitan Diary: A fan of Shakespeare in the Park thought he was receiving a compliment from someone 40 years younger. 

 BODY:
 Dear Diary:
 Scene: Sunday, July 28, waiting for tickets to "Love's Labour's Lost" at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. 
I was waiting alone, and overheard hours of conversation from the pair ahead of me and the fivesome behind me.
When at noon we stood to form a line, one of the young men behind me (Brooklyn native and soon to be 21 years old, musician, arranger and songwriter, I had heard) approached me (60 years old, out-of-town visitor) and said that he really really liked my shirt, that he had noticed how great I looked in the shirt, that yellow was perfect with my skin tone, and that he and I had similar skin tone. 
I thanked him for the compliment, and basked for a brief moment in praise from a hip 20-year-old New Yorker.
Then he continued, "If I saw that shirt in a thrift store, I would totally buy it!"
My out-of-town sense of style suffered a sudden deflation.

"I got rid of gratuities at my restaurant, and our service only got better," Jay Porter writes in Slate. "I can hear your objection now: How could servers be motivated to do a good job without tips? This is a common question, but it is also a silly question. Servers are motivated to do a good job in the same ways that everyone else is. Servers want to keep their jobs; servers want to get a raise; servers want to be successful and see themselves as professionals and take pride in their work. In any workplace, everyone is required to perform well, and tips have nothing to do with it. The next time you see your doctor, ask her if she wouldn't do better-quality work if she made minimum wage, with the rest of her income from her patients' tips."

HEADLINE: Wheelies: The Diminutive Mustang Edition

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Ford&#8217;s new Mustang may be 400 pounds lighter, and Berkshire Hathaway buys more G.M. stock. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 According to a report from Edmunds, the yet-to-be-revealed redesigned 2015 Ford Mustang will be smaller and about 400 pounds lighter than the outgoing model. Edmunds said it learned that the new car's frame, which will use more aluminum, will be engineered differently, making the car about 15 inches shorter. Equipped with a V-6 engine, the 2014 Mustang is 188.5 inches long and weighs about 3,500 pounds. The 2015 model is expected to be introduced at the 2014 Detroit auto show.
 Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's investment firm, disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday that it bought 40 million shares of General Motors stock during the second quarter of this year, increasing its share in the automaker by 60 percent. Mr. Buffett's firm picked up the stock as the federal government continues to unload G.M. shares after the company's 2009 bailout. According to a report from Automotive News, Berkshire Hathaway's stake in G.M., which has a market cap of nearly $48 billion, stands at $1.4 billion. (Automotive News)

 New York City isn't the easiest place to drive in the world, but it also isn't the worst. One of its upsides is that many people who own cars in the city don't need to drive them often because of its abundant public transportation. Vintage cars are another story. Ask anyone if they'd own a vintage car in a city known for door dings and bumper taps, and they'd say you're crazy. Not so, say the three Big Apple-based vintage car owners featured in this video by Petrolicious; owning a vintage car in New York is unique and even pleasurable. (Petrolicious)
 Roelant de Waard, Ford's head of sales in Europe, has stated confidently that the worst of the European recession is over, according to a report from Bloomberg. With bad economic times on the wane, auto sales in Europe finally seem to be on the way back up. Sales in England, France, Germany and Spain increased in July, and even Italy's car market decline slowed. However, Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Renault, said that new vehicle demand in the Eurozone might continue to shrink, over all, through 2015. (Bloomberg)
 Lincoln unleashed "the next step in the brand's reinvention" upon attendees of Pebble Beach concours events this week: the Black Label. No, it has nothing to do with Scotch whiskey. Black label is, according to a press release sent out Thursday, "a collection of ultrapremium exterior and interior themes mated to an even higher level of personal services and experiences." That means fancier interior and exterior trim and an upgraded level of customer service; what Lincoln has been equating to a concierge service of late. The Black Label treatment was introduced on the MKZ and the MKC Concept. (Lincoln Motor Company)
 Several thousand vintage and classic cars will gather in and around Carmel, Calif., this weekend for the Pebble Beach Concours d'Élégance and its attendant events, but about 1,000 vehicles and more than 3,000 people showed up in Burbank, Calif., Tuesday evening for a social media-fueled flash mob. The Burbank police said the crowd, which featured muscle cars, lowriders, imports and exotics, was generally peaceful. Only a handful of tickets were issued, mostly for minor infractions that could be expected of a car-nut crowd, including for missing license plates and dim headlamps.

HEADLINE: Winning the Lottery, but Keeping Your Job

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Two-thirds of Americans say they would continue working even if they won $10 million in the lottery, a Gallup survey finds. 

 BODY:
Call me a cynic, but this trend surprised me:
According to Gallup, two-thirds of American workers say they would continue working even if they won $10 million in the lottery. 
I suppose it would not surprise me if that many people said they wanted to continue working, but would switch to a new, fantasy career that they had forgone because it did not pay enough or was too risky (nonprofit work, opening a cupcake bakery, etc.). But most people who say they would continue working specified that they would like to continue in their current jobs. 
I guess this means people just really enjoy their jobs much more than I had expected, which would be heartening.
Note that the share of survey respondents who say they would continue working is higher than it was the last three times Gallup asked this question, all before the recent recession (2005, 2004, 1997). I wonder if the recession has changed people's attitudes about work, or at least how people want their work ethic to be perceived. Perhaps unemployment has been so high for so long that survey respondents feel obligated to tell strangers about how very much they love their jobs. No one wants to be idle, or a member of the idle rich. 
"It may be that workers today have a renewed appreciation for the value of having a job - even if they were to become independently wealthy," writes Frank Newport on Gallup's site.
Gallup broke down the responses by other demographics, which were also informative.
While Gen Y (like every generation of youth before it) is often accused of being lazy good-for-nothings, young people are most likely to say they would continue working if they won the lottery. 
The responses vary by education, too, with the least and the most educated most likely to say they would keep their current jobs in the event of a financial windfall. 
About half of respondents with postgraduate degrees and half of respondents with no more than a high school diploma said they would stick with their current positions if they won the lottery. Only about a third of respondents with some college or a college degree but no postgraduate work said they would stick with their current jobs.
Of course, surveying people about what they would do in very low-probability situations can produce distorted results. We also know that people who win the lottery tend to be bad at managing their financial situations afterward.

HEADLINE: Bank of America May Merge Merrill Lynch With Parent

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN and PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The move would simplify Bank of America&#8217;s organization and reduce costs but would not be noticeable to most outsiders. 

 BODY:
Bank of America is still trying to get its arms around the big acquisitions it did amid the financial crisis.
The bank may combine its Merrill Lynch subsidiary with the parent company as part of an effort to simplify its organization and reduce costs, Merrill Lynch said in a regulatory filing on Aug. 2. The merger could come as soon as the fourth quarter. 
Since buying Merrill Lynch at the start of 2009, Bank of America has operated it as a subsidiary. But a full merger with the parent company would allow Bank of America to assume Merrill's obligations and debt, the filing said.
It would also make corporate life simpler for the company, by reducing the number of legal entities and regulatory filings. For the last four and a half years, Merrill Lynch has filed quarterly and annual reports alongside Bank of America. With a merger, that would cease.
But to most outsiders, the corporate reorganization would not be noticeable. The company has no plans to retire the Merrill Lynch brand for its retail brokerage and investment banking operations.
"This will have no impact on how we serve our customers and our clients, and it will have no impact on the Merrill Lynch branded businesses that operate around the world," Jerome F. Dubrowski, a spokesman for Bank of America, said on Friday.
Bank of America's plans were reported earlier on Friday by Bloomberg News.
Bank of America's intention to subsume Merrill stands in contrast to its handling of Countrywide, the large mortgage company it bought in 2008.
After the purchase, Bank of America placed Countrywide in a separate subsidiary, a decision that has much relevance today. Bank of America is still swamped in expensive litigation related to Countrywide's loans. The subsidiary has just less than $5 billion of assets, but the claims based on Countrywide loans will result in payouts that likely exceed $5 billion by a significant amount.
Bank of America could place assets into the Countrywide subsidiary to pay off claims above $5 billion. But Countrywide's legal separation may strengthen Bank of America's hand as it tries to limit the cost of the litigation. If the claims against Bank of America start to climb even higher, the bank could in theory threaten not to put more assets into the subsidiary, which could result in sharply lower payouts to the plaintiffs.
For instance, Bank of America has proposed an $8.5 billion settlement with bond investors over Countrywide loans. In June, a lawyer for the bank that helped negotiate the settlement told a New York state court that there was about $4.8 billion in the Countrywide entity to pay claims. Disputing the arguments of those who oppose settlement, the lawyer told the judge: "But, your honor, all those coulda, woulda, shoulda are irrelevant if the pot of gold isn't going to be there."

HEADLINE: Libertarian Populism and Its Critics

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: How critics underestimate the hot new right-of-center idea, and how they get its weaknesses right. 

 BODY:
Let me assume, one more time, the mantle of libertarian populism's friendliest critic, and say something about the ongoing arguments that the concept has inspired. (The latest round-up includes Ben Domenech vs. Ezra Klein, Conn Carroll vs. Brian Beutler, Jonathan Chait vs. Will Wilkinson ... and I could easily go on.) In particular, I'd like to address what seems like the core critique of the lib-pop idea, common to its left-wing, centrist and conservative critics alike, which is that it might call itself populist but it's too, well, libertarian to ever be truly popular. 
My sense is that this critique underestimates libertarian populism in two ways, but gets some of its weaknesses right in a third.
The first underestimation reflects the critics' tendency to miss the potential breadth of the libertarian populist idea, which many of them are assessing purely through the lens of economic policy even though it has obvious implications for social issues and foreign policy as well. On these fronts, it's fairly easy to see how lib-pop emphases might well broaden the G.O.P.'s electoral appeal (assuming that the internal coalition politics could be finessed, of course, which is no sure thing). 
Retreating to a federalist, relatively-latitudinarian stance on gay marriage and marijuana, for instance, would take the party a step closer to the emerging millennial-generation consensus on those issues. Doubting the wisdom of foreign aid and foreign interventions places the libertarian populists squarely in the center of post-Iraq War public opinion. And the libertarian enthusiasm for criminal-justice reform offers a potential bridge to minority communities that have sound historical reasons to distrust Republicans. Given his background and recent associations, a leading lib-pop figure like Rand Paul is a poor messenger to those communities, but the Paul message on drug laws and sentencing reform - and, for that matter, on foreign policy, where blacks and Hispanics tend to be relatively anti-interventionist - could serve a Republican Party interested in outreach pretty well.
The second underestimation has to do with how many economic issues and policy controversies potentially map onto the libertarian populist "insider vs. outsider" framework. Jonathan Chait, for instance, in his exchange with Wilkinson, goes on a long riff about how our political debates "mainly revolve" around straightforward issues of redistribution - "how much to tax the rich and regulate business, what level of social services the government ought to provide" - while waving away the kind of "court vs. country" cronyism and rent-seeking and corporatism that libertarian populists are most interested in attacking as a relatively small part of the pantomime.
But the insider-vs.-outsider question is actually much pervasive than he suggests, and it weaves its way through many of the major Obama-era policy battles. The state-level fight over public sector unions, the various bailout debates, the battle over the sequester, the ongoing immigration debate, the 2009 cap-and-trade struggle, the controversy over the internal workings of the stimulus ... in each of these cases (and others), the Obama era has featured a clash of interests in which the winners from liberalism's preferred policies are just as likely to be insiders of various sorts - well-salaried bureaucrats, even-better-salaried contractors, employers who want low wages and energy companies with the right lobbyists - as they are to be either the middle class writ large or the genuinely disadvantaged. Not coincidentally, many of these arenas are places where Obama-era liberalism has been less-than-politically successful ... which suggests that the right-wing populist critique of the contemporary Democratic Party does have at least some actual popular appeal. (If libertarian populism lacked any populist credibility, Waxman-Markey would be the law of the land, Scott Walker would have been recalled, and the sequester would have been unwound already.)
Meanwhile, even on issues like health care reform where straightforward redistribution is much more front and center, the insider/rent-seeking/corporatist element in Obama-era policymaking still looms large. Yes, Obamacare clearly redistributes from the rich to the poor, but even this redistribution doesn't quite fit what Chait describes as a "clean upward-downward economic tug-of-war." The money that pays for the uninsured isn't just being taken from wealthy taxpayers and bar-hopping "bros" - it's also coming from a potentially-much-larger population of middle-class Americans who may end up paying higher premiums for a product they're now required to buy. (How large and how high remains to be seen, of course) The subsidies aren't only being given to the disadvantaged - because they're a subsidy for a specific product, they're also being given, ultimately, to the (massive, powerful, wealthy) industries that stand to benefit from both a dedicated public revenue stream and government mandate to spend on what they're selling. The (now-delayed) mandate on businesses wouldn't just redistribute money from CEOs to their employees: It would benefit established companies at the expense of start-ups, gives employers a reason not to hire low-wage employees, and so on.
Nor, again, is it a coincidence that this corporatist side of Obamacare has been the place where Republicans have launched their most effective recent attacks, and even peeled off some Democratic votes in the House along the way. The deep popularity of the individual mandate, in particular, is a sign that even in a policy arena where liberalism has a clear claim to the populist mantle, libertarian populism can marshal an effective critique.
So that's what you might call the anti-anti-libertarian populism case. Now on to the point where the critics are mostly right: There really is a big fiscal-policy hole in libertarian populism as currently defined, and to the extent that hole is filled by actual lib-pop politicians like Paul, it's filled with ideas like the flat tax that are neither populist nor likely to be popular in my lifetime or yours.
I've made a version of this point before, and since then I've been heartened to see writers like Carroll and Tim Carney make supportive noises about (for instance) breaking with the longstanding conservative emphasis on slashing the top marginal tax rate and focusing on payroll taxes instead, which would be a solid step toward a more plausible right-of-center domestic policy. And I understand, of course, that a still-aborning movement can't be expected to have detailed blueprints and a clear consensus on every policy question immediately.
But I also have the strong sense that lib-pop writers are very, very intent on defining themselves against the compassionate conservatism of the Bush era - which is reasonable up to a point, but which becomes a problem if it means worrying so much about the dangers of getting into "a bidding war over who can run the life of Julia more efficiently and inexpensively" (to quote Domenech) that you aren't willing to focus on the issues that voters actually prioritize, and the places where the welfare state actually spends most of its money, and the problem of how to run a federal government that isn't just going to disappear tomorrow.
And the American right does need to focus on those issues, because that's where the action is, and where it often deserves to be. Right now, Republicans lack a clear alternative to Obamacare and/or a strategy for reforming the health care law if it can't be overturned; they lack a clear vision for tax reform that's both pro-growth and responsive to the anxieties of middle and lower-income voters; they lack an approach to federal spending that sets plausible targets for discretionary spending; and they lack any kind of immediate response to the problem of mass unemployment. And then more broadly, they lack a policy portfolio that's clearly connected to the strongest right-of-center analysis of the social challenges facing 21st century America - the Charles Murray/Brad Wilcox vision of a downscale social crisis slowly working its way upward into the middle class.
These are not small issues, and they are places where libertarian populism, in many cases, generates stronger critiques of Obama-era liberalism than it does policy alternatives. Or alternatively, they're places where lib-pop writers would endorse a policy alternative notionally (as in health care, I think), but without making it a central priority of their emerging movement.
They are, however, places where other, perhaps slightly more technocratically-minded conservative thinkers and writers (I believe "Beltway Burkeans" is how Domenech occasionally describes us) have done at least some provisional work, and where many plausible proposals need not conflict - and might even mesh - with a libertarian-conservative critique of "bigness" and corporatism and the rest. Which is why I retain my initial impression that what the intra-conservative debate needs at the moment is not some sort of struggle to the death between libertarian populism and other varieties of conservative reform, but a quest for a populist, reformist synthesis instead.

HEADLINE: Ford's Big Payout on the C-Max Hybrid

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: After Ford&#8217;s fuel-economy downgrade on the C-Max Hybrid, the company will pay owners $550 each and lessees $325. 

 BODY:
Dominic Franchella, owner of Stamford Ford Lincoln in Connecticut, has some satisfied C-Max hybrid customers. "We haven't had one customer complain to us about not getting the mileage," he said in a telephone interview. 
Still, Mr. Franchella said he was happy about Ford's announcement on Thursday that, as part of the voluntary downgrade of that model's combined fuel economy rating from 47 miles per gallon to 43, it would also make goodwill payments to 2013 C-Max hybrid owners and lease customers.
"Anytime you do something positive to enhance customer service, it's a great idea," Mr. Franchella said.
In announcing the payments, Raj Nair, group vice president of global product development at Ford, said that owners of the 2013 model would get checks for $550, and those who leased $325. He said the amounts were determined by the estimated average extra fuel cost to C-Max hybrid drivers of the difference between the two labels.
Ford has been hit with lawsuits related to its hybrid mileage claims, but Mr. Nair declined to comment on pending litigation.
A spokesman for Ford, Todd Nissen, said in a telephone interview that the payments would be made until the 43 m.p.g. combined stickers were on car windows in dealer lots. "The new stickers are being printed now and shipped to dealers as we speak," he said.
Jack Nerad, executive market analyst at Kelley Blue Book, said he thought Ford's response was a good thing.
"It's a bit of a black eye for Ford and has been for a while, that the C-Max Hybrid doesn't seem to get the mileage the E.P.A. numbers say it should."
Obviously, on-the-road results vary. Mr. Nerad said that people drove cars differently, and how they drove them is "one of the biggest factors in fuel economy."
Ford has sold about 32,000 of the 2013 C-Max hybrids since the vehicle's debut last year, so based upon that number the payout will vary from about $10 million to $17 million, depending on the mix of owned and leased cars.

HEADLINE: Bank Of America May Merge Merrill With Parent

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ALDEN and PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
Bank of America is still trying to get its arms around the big acquisitions it did amid the financial crisis.
The bank may combine its Merrill Lynch subsidiary with the parent company as part of an effort to simplify its organization and reduce costs, Merrill Lynch said in a regulatory filing on Aug. 2. The merger could come as soon as the fourth quarter. 
Since buying Merrill Lynch at the start of 2009, Bank of America has operated it as a subsidiary. But a full merger with the parent company would allow Bank of America to assume Merrill's obligations and debt, the filing said.
It would also make corporate life simpler for the company, by reducing the number of legal entities and regulatory filings. For the last four and a half years, Merrill Lynch has filed quarterly and annual reports alongside Bank of America. With a merger, that would cease.
But to most outsiders, the corporate reorganization would not be noticeable. The company has no plans to retire the Merrill Lynch brand for its retail brokerage and investment banking operations.
''This will have no impact on how we serve our customers and our clients, and it will have no impact on the Merrill Lynch branded businesses that operate around the world,'' Jerome F. Dubrowski, a spokesman for Bank of America, said on Friday.
Bank of America's plans were reported earlier on Friday by Bloomberg News.
Bank of America's intention to subsume Merrill stands in contrast to its handling of Countrywide, the large mortgage company it bought in 2008.
After the purchase, Bank of America placed Countrywide in a separate subsidiary, a decision that has much relevance today. Bank of America is still swamped in expensive litigation related to Countrywide's loans. The subsidiary has just less than $5 billion of assets, but the claims based on Countrywide loans will result in payouts that likely exceed $5 billion by a significant amount.
Bank of America could place assets into the Countrywide subsidiary to pay off claims above $5 billion. But Countrywide's legal separation may strengthen Bank of America's hand as it tries to limit the cost of the litigation. If the claims against Bank of America start to climb even higher, the bank could in theory threaten not to put more assets into the subsidiary, which could result in sharply lower payouts to the plaintiffs.
For instance, Bank of America has proposed an $8.5 billion settlement with bond investors over Countrywide loans. In June, a lawyer for the bank that helped negotiate the settlement told a New York state court that there was about $4.8 billion in the Countrywide entity to pay claims. Disputing the arguments of those who oppose settlement, the lawyer told the judge: ''But, your honor, all those coulda, woulda, shoulda are irrelevant if the pot of gold isn't going to be there.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Brown Cheered In Second Act, At Least So Far

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- When Jerry Brown became governor of California again, three years ago, this state was on a steep decline, crushed by budget deficits, deep spending cuts, governmental paralysis, high unemployment and a collapsing housing market. California, a place that once symbolized promise and opportunity, seemed caught in an intractable reversal of fortune.
But these days, Mr. Brown -- who at 75 is the oldest governor in the nation and about to become the longest-serving governor in the history of California -- is enjoying a degree of success and authority he and his opponents could scarcely have imagined when he returned to Sacramento to begin a second tour as governor in 2010.
The state's budget problems are largely resolved, at least for the short term. Mr. Brown is the dominant figure in Sacramento, strengthened by overwhelming Democratic control of the Legislature and the decline of the Republican Party. He has pushed through major initiatives on education financing and prison reorganization. Even Republicans say his re-election next year seems considerably more than likely. 
''Some people were ridiculing California, and some were calling it a failed state,'' Mr. Brown, a Democrat, said in an interview. ''The unemployment came down from 12.2 to 8.5. Real estate is rebounding. There's a lot of confidence out there. That's what happened.''
Mr. Brown has his share of problems. He unsuccessfully resisted a federal court order to move inmates out of overcrowded prisons. Changes in the state employee pension system approved last year do not, in the view of most analysts, come close to addressing the long-term pension liabilities over the horizon.
His latest proposal to overhaul California's water distribution system is smacking up against the same entrenched geographical and business factions that defeated him when he tried to address the problem as governor from 1975 to 1983. Mr. Brown's signature plan to build a high-speed rail line from Los Angeles to San Francisco remains a target of skepticism and ridicule. In a setback Friday night, a superior judge in Sacramento ruled that the agency overseeing the project failed to comply with the cost and environmental requirements in a ballot measure authorizing the project.
And the governor has so far shown little inclination to use his considerable political capital to take on some of the most divisive problems that have long plagued this state, among them a dysfunctional governmental structure and tax system. ''He's done a good job -- he doesn't want to be great,'' said Antonio R. Villaraigosa, a Democrat and former speaker of the State Assembly, who just finished two terms as mayor of Los Angeles. ''He wants to be solid. And he's been solid.''
Yet by almost every measure, Mr. Brown, the son of another California governor, has accomplished a turnaround in a state where his family has been a dynasty for more than 50 years. He has defied critics who questioned how someone who last served as governor in a wholly different era could thrive today, much less rescue a state that had gone from being a model for American aspiration to a case study in governmental dysfunction.
''He's proven better at the job than perhaps his critics anticipated,'' said Bill Whalen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. ''In 2010, his critics wanted to criticize him as a flaky moonbeam,'' he said. ''Instead we have a governor who is very serious and sober about his choices. You can't find a governor in recent history who has a smoother road to re-election.''
Mr. Brown is not saying whether he will seek re-election, but it seems nearly unthinkable that he will not. He does not appear to be even slightly worried about his prospects. ''The opposition candidates,'' he said, ''are rather few and far between.''
Mr. Brown is as quirky as ever. Lawmakers speak with frustration of an insular and enigmatic executive circle where most decisions are made by Mr. Brown and his wife and special counsel, Anne Gust Brown, and where he is so consumed with details that he reads every bill put on his desk before signing it. He has gone for weeks with barely a public appearance (his office asked that a 30-minute interview for this article be done by phone).
''He is informal,'' said Darrell Steinberg, the president pro tem of the State Senate. ''He decides things and solves problems in very iterative ways. I think I have as many phone conversations as I have face-to-face meetings. He conducts business informally, which is great: it's all about the bottom line.''
John A. Pérez, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, said he had no quarrel with Mr. Brown's style. ''I think most people would have a larger staff than he does -- but the results speak for themselves,'' he said. ''I am the last person who is going to second-guess him when he has achieved so many good results.''
Mr. Brown has certainly benefited from a playing field sloped in his favor. The economy began to rebound as he took office. Term limits are in full force, which means that the era of entrenched legislative powerhouses like Willie Brown, the legendary Assembly speaker, is gone. And the Republican Party has been almost marginalized, removing the presence of any kind of opposition, loyal or not.
''We have a weak Republican Party that is not challenging him,'' said Abel Maldonado, the former lieutenant governor who is seeking the Republican nomination to challenge Mr. Brown. ''Nobody questions anything. We need to stand up.''
Mr. Brown acknowledged that some of his successes have been the result of lucky circumstances, including powerful Democratic leaders in the Legislature, but said he also benefited from having been governor before. ''To get anything done you need the political will, and you need the political skill, and you need the knowledge'' he said. ''I do feel a certain command of the process.''
He might need that more than ever now. The issues Mr. Brown has turned to -- among them, building two new water tunnels and moving state inmates to county jails -- have sharply divided the state and are fraught with political risks.
''He has gotten through the first part of his governorship in real strong shape, and now he is moving into some really, really tough territory,'' said Raphael J. Sonenshein, the executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University. ''But he's got assets going into it.''
Mr. Brown's father, Pat -- for whom the institute was named -- was governor from 1959 to 1967 and was considered one of the most effective chief executives in this state's history, championing the development of its higher education, highway and water systems. Mr. Brown frequently invokes a lesson he said he learned from his father. ''Timing is important, my father always told me,'' he said once, discussing his legislative agenda.
Observers of this governor suggest that his father's penchant for legacy-defining projects has rubbed off on the younger Mr. Brown. His sister Kathleen Brown, a former state treasurer, was defeated in a run for governor by Pete Wilson, a Republican.
Mr. Brown disputed any suggestion that he was not making full use of his political standing to move on the tougher problems, be it inequities in the tax system or pensions. Mr. Brown said he would proceed on his own schedule. ''There are some people who are writing, 'Well, everything wasn't done in the first year, and therefore this seems to be a failed situation,' '' he said. ''But it's not just one year. It's many years.''
''I've said there needs to be more pension reform,'' he said. ''Well, when to do that is a matter of my prudential judgment. People who want to do everything all at once generally don't get anything done.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Slips From 6-Year High

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Consumer confidence ebbed in August and residential construction rose less than expected in July, potentially dimming hopes of an acceleration in economic activity in the second half of the year. 
Data reported on Friday suggested that a recent jump in interest rates, in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's tapering its bond purchases as early as next month, was starting to weigh on households.
''People have been shocked by how much mortgage rates have risen in the past couple of months. The chatter about the Federal Reserve is also a big deal,'' said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment slipped to 80.0 from July's six-year high of 85.1. August's reading was the lowest in four months.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions fell to 91.0 in August from 98.6 the month before. The gauge of consumer expectations slipped to 72.9 from 76.5 in July.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts rose 5.9 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 896,000 units. That was just below economists' expectations for a 900,000-unit rate.
Permits to build homes rose 2.7 percent in July, to a 943,000-unit pace. Economists had expected them to rise to a 945,000-unit pace.
''I think we are looking at a situation where some air is coming out of the housing recovery given the higher mortgage rates,'' said Michael Hanson, senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.
Long-term interest rates have risen by more than a full percentage point over the last three months on the view that the Fed will soon start trimming the $85 billion in monthly bond purchases that it has been making to keep borrowing costs low and stimulate the economy.
That in turn has prompted a rise in mortgage rates, which threatens to sap some of the strength from a housing recovery that has been pushing prices higher for more than a year.
Economists expect the Fed to make an announcement on tapering next month.
Data this week for industrial production, residential construction and employment have missed market forecasts, which could lower expectations for a significant pickup in growth in the second half of the year.
The economy grew at a rate of only 1.4 percent in the first half of 2013, held back by tighter fiscal policy.
Aside from higher mortgage rates, the residential construction figures last month could reflect supply constraints. Builders have been complaining about a shortage of labor and materials.
Still, home building remains on a firmer footing and should again contribute to economic growth this year.
A report on Thursday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders neared an eight-year high in August, with builders fairly upbeat about sales prospects over the next six months.
Though residential construction accounts for only about 3.1 percent of gross domestic product, housing has a wider reach in the economy. Analysts estimate that for every single-family home built, at least three jobs lasting a year are created.
Economists expect average monthly housing starts for the whole of 2013 to top one million.

HEADLINE: Rwanda Needs to Behave

BYLINE: By DAVID KAMPF

 BODY:
Collective guilt over the genocide in 1994 has shaped the world's relations with Rwanda ever since. Without question, the systematic killing of 800,000 people is one of the foremost historic blights of the last century. And the international community deserves blame for ignoring facts and avoiding action when intervention could have saved thousands.
But it's time to take off the kid gloves when dealing with this tiny, landlocked country with outsized influence in East Africa. If there's any hope of Rwanda winning truly lasting stability, it must change course and stop fueling conflicts across its borders. 
The progress Rwanda has made since the genocide is nothing less than remarkable. Any visitor to Kigali today will immediately note the clean new streets. The capital is filled with new malls catering to the wealthy, restaurants offering panoramic views of the city and cafés brewing Rwanda's own world-renowned coffee.
Over the last decade, Rwanda's economy has averaged above 8 percent growth per year, according to the I.M.F., and it is considered the best place in Africa to start a business, according to the World Bank's latest rankings. Millions have been pulled out of poverty, people live more than 20 years longer than they did in the 1990s, maternal and child mortality rates have dropped dramatically, and health care coverage is nearly universal. When I was working with the U.S. Agency for International Development on health and economic projects in Rwanda, I couldn't help but be impressed by how quickly the country was developing.
All of this has made Rwanda a darling of aid donors, and Rwandan leaders are deft at handling them. Officials feel at home at international summit meetings and President Paul Kagame -- one of the most popular African leaders on Twitter -- exudes confidence on the global stage.
This combination of international sympathy, impressive economic growth and political savvy has caused the United States, Britain and other powers to largely turn a blind eye to Kigali's transgressions.
Simmering under the surface and threatening to explode after Kagame's departure are ethnic and political tensions that now go mostly unaddressed. The hostility between Tutsis and Hutus is far from ended, and the governing system is entrenching one-man rule instead of building effective checks and balances. Progress is stunted by a lack of freedom, a repressive media environment, little protection for human rights and the sidelining of political opponents.
Nowhere is the need for international pressure on Rwanda to change its ways more evident than in Kigali's stance toward its neighbor, the Democratic Republic of Congo. Many of the Hutu perpetrators of the 1994 genocide fled to eastern Congo after a Tutsi-led opposition army seized control of Rwanda. Looking to prevent any future threat to their rule, Kigali's leaders have been active in the Congo ever since. While Rwandan interference is largely due to a longstanding ethnic rivalry and the desire to create a protective buffer along the border, control of the region's mineral wealth is another key factor.
In April 2012, a rebel group with ties to Kigali launched a campaign to liberate Congo. The group, known as M23, briefly held the city of Goma next to the border with Rwanda. Despite an international peace agreement in February, fighting flared again in May and July. Since the violence began, some 800,000 people have been displaced.
Rwanda's meddling has been known for years, but public criticism is mounting. Last year, the United Nations accused Kigali of actively supporting M23, and last month Human Rights Watch warned that despite Kigali's repeated denials the Rwandan military continues to support the rebels.
The crossing between Rwanda and Goma, the heart of the violence, is one of the starkest borders I've ever seen. Rwanda's side has a man-made beach, a five-star hotel and beautifully paved roads; immediately across the border a potholed road leads to a land where the feeling of insecurity is palpable.
Rwanda cannot be blamed for all of Congo's problems. This region has endured the world's most deadly conflict since World War II, a war that left the country in ruins, its economic troubles and ethnic tensions compounded by inept and corrupt governance.
But Rwanda has come far enough to start acting differently toward Congo; it should work to ease that country's problems rather than fuel them.
The United States, Britain and the rest of Rwanda's supporters need to use their leverage -- foreign funds make up around 40 percent of Kigali's budget -- to demand better behavior. They should forcefully and publicly condemn Kigali for its links to militant groups in Congo and its undemocratic tendencies at home. Although some countries froze assistance last year after allegations about Rwanda's activity in Congo surfaced, more needs to be done.
Rwanda's leaders recognize how critical it is to maintain international good will. They need to know that they risk losing more financial support. Further sanctions should be put on the table, along with additional incentives to reward good behavior.
The obvious concern, if Kigali doesn't respond properly, is for the Rwandan people. The progress in health and economic well-being could be lost if the region spirals downward. The best way to exorcise the demons of Rwanda's past is to minimize the risk of future turmoil. ''Never again'' must be the priority.
The Rwandan government deserves credit for making swift economic and political progress in the years since the 1994 genocide -- progress that no one thought possible. But now Rwanda needs to become a more responsible regional actor, and deal forthrightly with the issues that threaten its future. The international community must put pressure on Kigali to do so.
David Kampf is director of communications at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He worked on development projects in Rwanda from 2006 to 2008.

HEADLINE: For the Dow, the Week Goes From Bad to Worst

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks fell Friday, closing out what was the worst week of the year for the Dow Jones industrial average.
The market was dragged lower by a weak performance from retailers and companies sensitive to higher interest rates. Home builders and banking stocks were among the best performers.
Stocks had a decent start to the week, but were hit hard the last three days. The Dow retreated 2.2 percent in its worst week in 2013. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.1 percent for the week, its second-worst performance of the year. 
The possibility of a cutback in the Federal Reserve's huge bond-buying program in September has roiled the bond market, which has spilled over into stocks. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.83 percent, its highest level since July 2011, from 2.77 percent late Thursday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction of the yield, fell 16/32 to 97 6/32.
''When yields are going up like this, that's scary for most equity investors,'' said Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at Rosenblatt Securities.
Rising bond yields have a direct impact on the cost of borrowing for everyone -- from homeowners trying to refinance their mortgages to companies trying to sell debt -- making them a potential long-term drag on the economy. The Federal Reserve's bond-buying programs were intended to keep the cost of borrowing as low as possible.
On Friday, the S.& P. 500 lost 5.49 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,655.83. The Dow fell 30.72 points, or 0.2 percent, to 15,081.47, and the Nasdaq composite lost 3.34 points, or 0.1 percent, to 3,602.78.
Shares of utilities and telecommunications companies, which typically perform poorly in a higher interest-rate environment, closed broadly lower. Consolidated Edison fell 75 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $56.64, and PG&E of California was down 71 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $42.64. Verizon Communications fell 1.7 percent, and AT&T, 0.5 percent.
Stocks in companies like utilities, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications are often purchased because they provide a higher-than-normal dividend. As Treasury yields rise, it makes all dividend-paying stocks less attractive to investors because Treasuries can provide a similar return with significantly less risk.
''You try to focus on stocks that usually benefit from higher interest rates -- banks are a good example,'' said John Fox, who oversees $873 million as co-manager of the FAM Value Fund.
The Dow has fallen 3.7 percent from its high of 15,658.36, which it hit two weeks ago. Even so, it is up 15 percent this year, and the S.& P. 500 has climbed 16 percent.
''Keep it in perspective -- we're down modestly from what was an all-time high,'' Mr. Fox said.
A multiday sell-off continued for retailers. Nordstrom gave a bleak sales outlook late Thursday that echoed forecasts this week from Walmart and Macy's. The outlooks have raised worries that American shoppers might be curtailing spending.
Nordstrom's stock fell $2.90, or 4.9 percent, to $56.43, making it the biggest decliner in the S.& P. 500.
The retail industry is a closely watched part of the American economy because consumer spending makes up roughly 70 percent of economic activity. The disappointing outlooks are worrisome because they take into account the lucrative back-to-school shopping season.
''It's left us scratching our heads,'' Mr. Fox said. ''It really forces you to ask the question: 'Is the consumer slowing down?' ''
Investors have also been concerned about what will happen to the stock market -- and the economy -- if the Fed begins winding down its bond-buying program in September. Some investors think that the Fed's program has been a large contributor to the stock market's record run.
''The big question is, will the Fed eliminate the bond-buying program in September, and, if so, how they will they remove the bond buying,'' said Frank Davis, director of sales and trading for LEK Securities.
With the markets declining, investors shifted into a safer asset -- gold. Its price rose $10.10, or 0.7 percent, to $1,371.70. Gold had its third-best week this year, rising 3.7 percent.
Also in focus were home builders. The government reported that new home construction was up 6 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted rate of 896,000.
Shares of the home builder PulteGroup closed up 2.3 percent, and Lennar was up 1.8 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Ally Holding Cards

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and ERIC SCHMITT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Most nations, including many close allies of the United States, require up to a week's notice before American warplanes are allowed to cross their territory. Not Egypt, which offers near-automatic approval for military overflights, to resupply the war effort in Afghanistan or to carry out counterterrorism operations in the Middle East, Southwest Asia or the Horn of Africa.
Losing that route could significantly increase flight times to the region. 
American warships are also allowed to cut to the front of the line through the Suez Canal in times of crisis, even when oil tankers are stacked up like cars on an interstate highway at rush hour. Without Egypt's cooperation, military missions could take days longer.
Those are some of the largely invisible ways the Egyptian military has assisted the United States as it pursues its national security interests across the region -- and why the generals now in charge in Cairo are not without their own leverage in dealing with Washington in the aftermath of President Obama's condemnation Thursday of the military's bloody crackdown on supporters of the former president, Mohamed Morsi.
In his first overtly punitive step, Mr. Obama canceled the Bright Star military exercise, the largest and most visible sign of cooperation between the armed forces of the two nations. But given the growing violence in Egypt, it might have been impossible to guarantee the safety of the thousands of American troops scheduled to deploy for the war game, and the decision to call it off might have been the wise move regardless of the politics.
For the Pentagon, which had earlier delayed the delivery of four F-16 fighter jets to the Egyptian Air Force, other steps might be more difficult.
''We need them for the Suez Canal, we need them for the peace treaty with Israel, we need them for the overflights, and we need them for the continued fight against violent extremists who are as much of a threat to Egypt's transition to democracy as they are to American interests,'' said Gen. James N. Mattis, who retired this year as head of the military's Central Command.
While a cozy relationship with the Egyptian military might be preferable for American interests to a radicalized, hostile government in Cairo, there is also a threshold of violence -- still unknown -- that, if passed, would make it impossible for the Defense Department to continue its dealings there.
As Egyptian generals familiar with the American military are no doubt aware, there have been instances when the United States restricted or even severed military-to-military relations with a useful ally, for periods both long and short, because of authoritarian practices, human rights violations or security policies at odds with those of the United States. Among the examples are Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines.
In the meantime, Obama administration officials are taking a hard look at possible incentives and punishments that might compel the generals in Cairo to end the crackdown and open a dialogue on transition to democratic governance.
''The violence is intolerable, but clearly they feel the nation of Egypt is facing a sovereign, existential crisis,'' said one Obama administration official. ''So while the violence is intolerable, we may be able to eventually accept these decisions if the violence ends, and quickly.''
The risk is that the United States may be left standing by as its allies in the Egyptian military lose control of the crisis.
For decades the Egyptians have helped the American military in ways that are largely unknown to the American public, said Robert Springborg, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., and an expert on the Egyptian military. Mr. Springborg noted that in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- after the Turkish Parliament refused to allow the American military to use Turkish territory for crossing into Iraq from the north -- Egypt gave the Pentagon immediate access for two aircraft battle groups and accompanying aircraft through the Suez Canal and across its territory.
Given the number of countries in the region that do not allow American military overflights, especially for combat missions, Egypt's location makes it a vital, and relatively direct, access route to an unstable crescent of strategic importance.
Egypt's role in the Camp David agreements has also been of critical value for America's closest ally in the region, Israel. In the four decades before Camp David, Israel and Egypt fought several major wars; in the nearly four decades since, none. Even in the current crisis, the military communications systems established by Camp David to link Israel and Egypt have helped defuse tensions. When Egypt recently moved additional troops into the Sinai Peninsula -- in violation of the accords -- Israel quietly assented, knowing that the extra forces were to secure the border and tamp down rising militant activities.
The Obama administration has notably avoided threatening to cut off the $1.3 billion in annual military assistance to Egypt, recognizing that the money has helped guarantee peace with Israel for the past 35 years. All of the aid for this year already has been authorized, so even an order to halt the financial assistance would not have an impact until next year. In the meantime, Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Persian Gulf nations have increased their financial support to Egypt, far surpassing the American contribution.
Beyond delaying shipment of the F-16 warplanes, officials said, there are few unfulfilled weapons contracts that could be held up as a punitive measure.
American officials looking at ways to punish the Egyptian military for the order to clear Muslim Brotherhood protest sites have looked to the lesson of Pakistan, which came under economic sanctions for its nuclear program.
Among the actions taken was ending a program of inviting young Pakistani military officers to attend armed service academic programs in the United States. One result has been a generation of Pakistani officers with no affinity for -- and, more often, hostility toward -- the American military. A similar result could occur if the next generation of promising Egyptian officers were not invited to American military schools.
In the end, one powerful incentive for the generals to quickly end the civil unrest and establish order -- and try to make good on promises to begin a transition to legitimate governance might be economic -- to attract tourism and investment. And also to preserve Egypt's relationship with the United States.
''Both sides have a strong interest in preserving it and will work to that end,'' Mr. Springborg said. ''The Egyptian military will take steps to clothe the military's behind-the-scene rule with suitable civilian trappings, making it possible for the U.S. and others to deal with it.''

HEADLINE: One Dip Into a 401(k) Often Leads to Another

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
Some people can't seem to stop at just one.
After workers borrow money from their 401(k) retirement account, they may find that it becomes easier to come back for another loan -- and perhaps even another. And yet another one after that.
Fidelity, which houses the 401(k) plans of more than 12 million workers, recently studied the behavior of these so-called serial borrowers. It found that this sort of repeat borrowing can put a serious dent in long-term savings, especially if the employees cannot continue to save as much while they pay the loan back.
And that's what tends to happen with this group. ''Once they broke the barrier, they went back and took more and more,'' said Jeanne Thompson, vice president for market insights at Fidelity. ''They find it's probably easier than going to the bank to get a loan, so it becomes a bad habit.'' 
This type of borrowing can be a most attractive alternative to banks: the average interest rate for a 401(k) loan right now is about 4.25 percent (most plans add one percentage point to the prime rate, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America's 2011 report, though the formula does vary across plans). With the exception of a mortgage refinance, and perhaps a home equity line of credit, it is hard to beat that rate. Compared with credit cards and personal loans, which now average 15.31 percent and 11.41 percent, according to Bankrate.com, it seems prudent.
The government does not take a 10 percent penalty on the amount borrowed, as it does when a person cashes out of a 401(k) before retirement.
By and large, it looks like sensible people are using this vehicle. Repeat customers, Fidelity found, were typically in their 40s and 50s: people who have saved enough to actually take multiple loans and who also have a lot of competing needs: college tuition, perhaps, and aging parents to look after.
Ms. Thompson also suspects they're using the money to pay off medical bills and credit card debt, though call center representatives reported that at least some people are using the money for luxury items like Jet Skis and vacations. A small fraction of borrowers even took out loans as little as $200. On average, someone who took three or more loans over the 12-year period earned $80,000.
But how sensible is it? Fidelity studied the patterns of 180,000 borrowers who were active participants in a 401(k) plan over the last 12 years. Among this group, the majority -- two-thirds of employees -- took more than one loan over that time period. But 25 percent of borrowers came back for a third or fourth loan, while 20 percent came back to their retirement account five times or more.
Even though borrowing appears to beget more borrowing, other experts cautioned that these workers may not be lacking self-control, but are simply using the loans to absorb some long-lasting financial shocks, like a spouse who lost a job. Over all, the number of 401(k) loans hasn't significantly changed: about 10.6 percent of Fidelity plan participants took out new loans in the first three months of this year, which tracks close to the industry average. About 30 percent of all participants who took out two or more loans, or more than 1.7 million workers, still had more than one loan outstanding at the end of June.
''That a lot of people have more than one loan doesn't mean that they are dysfunctional,'' said David Laibson, an economics professor at Harvard who focuses on behavior. ''It could mean a lot of things. It could mean that the household is in some financial distress. And for that household it might be a perfectly legitimate response.''
Fidelity didn't survey the borrowers. It just observed their behavioral patterns. But it did find that the amounts that people borrowed decreased over time, particularly when they had taken at least three loans. ''It's almost a different mind-set versus the people who take just one,'' Ms. Thompson posited.
Whatever the reason, it's clear that serial borrowing can permanently impair your long-term savings. The money is no longer invested, so you may lose investment earnings. (When you borrow from a 401(k), the money is taken from your account, without penalty, and you pay yourself back with interest, typically through payroll deductions.)
But while borrowers are paying the loan back, they also tend to dial back their savings by about two percentage points -- to about 6.5 percent from 8.4 percent -- on average, according to Fidelity. Borrowers didn't typically resume their original savings rate until two years after the loan was paid off. ''It's a double whammy,'' Ms. Thompson said. ''The money is out of your account and while you are paying it back, you can't afford to contribute as much.''
Consider a worker who took two five-year loans -- at ages 30 and 37 -- and who also reduced his savings by two percentage points for the five-year loan term, plus an additional two years (since that's what Fidelity found people tend to do). That person ends up with 13.8 percent less at retirement compared with a person who took no loans, according to calculations by Fidelity and the Employee Benefit Retirement Institute. Taking a third loan would reduce savings nearly 19 percent. A fourth cut into retirement savings 23 percent. (For more details on their assumptions, see the accompanying chart.)
''Taking one loan out and paying it back and maintaining your deferral rate isn't going to have a significant impact,'' Ms. Thompson said. ''It's when you start taking multiple loans that will, and that's where we are starting to see employers want to protect employees from themselves.''
Still, there are other hidden costs that many borrowers may not realize they're paying. You actually end up paying taxes twice on the interest: the interest you pay yourself comes from after-tax wages and you pay taxes on that amount again when you withdraw the money in retirement.
Loan defaults obviously have the potential to inflict even more serious damage. The vast majority of those who default -- about 10 percent of 401(k) borrowers -- do so after leaving an employer (you're typically required to pay the loan back in full within about 60 days).
Most companies have restrictions in place and allow employees to take only one or two loans at a time (generally speaking, you can borrow half of your account balance, up to $50,000, though some plans impose stricter restrictions).
There's a reason people are permitted to take the loans in the first place: it encourages more people to save because the money can be tapped if the need arises. In fact, when I ran Fidelity's findings past several seasoned retirement experts, several of them thought 401(k) loans often got a bad rap, and said they didn't believe the loans should be reflexively frowned upon. Nor were they entirely surprised that borrowers went back for second and third loans. After all, the 401(k) loan is generally a good deal.
''If people have taken a 401(k) loan and have successfully repaid it, they come to discover it is an easy way to borrow cheaply,'' said Steve Utkus, principal at Vanguard's Center for Retirement Research. ''They realize, 'I am going to need another chunk of money for college expenses, and it's a lot cheaper than the loans I can get privately.'''

HEADLINE: Merge Is What Airlines Do

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA. 
Charles M. Blow and Gail Collins are off today.

 BODY:
Hey, wait a minute. Wasn't airline deregulation supposed to bring lower prices and increased competition?
So how is it that 35 years after the law was passed that deregulated the airline industry, we stand today with two megacarriers, United and Delta, while a third proposed megamerger -- of American and US Airways -- was all but done before the Justice Department sued to block it earlier this week? In the last few years especially, ticket prices have skyrocketed and consumer choice has diminished. As for what it's like to fly these days, well, the less said the better.
The answer, in part, is that deregulation worked all too well at first, and then it didn't work well at all. The natural tendency of companies to seek monopoly power took over, and nobody tried to stop it until now, when it is really too late. 
Remember those early years after deregulation? Everybody seemed to be starting up an airline. The legacy carriers like United and American expanded into dozens of new markets. The number of people who flew increased geometrically. Indeed, with the rise of discount tickets, flying became something many Americans could finally afford, at least once in a while. Supporters of deregulation could proudly say that it had worked as envisioned: It had brought about lower prices and greater consumer choice.
The only problem was that the competition was ruinous for airline profitability. This, in fact, has been the eternal struggle of the industry. Just a few months ago, Warren Buffett described airlines as ''a death trap for investors.'' As the big airlines fought fiercely to hold on to their turf -- losing money in the process -- many of the smaller start-ups went out of business. Even large airlines like Eastern and Pan Am failed. Others entered bankruptcy proceedings and engaged in protracted battles with their unions to lower their employee costs.
The first decade of this century was, if anything, even tougher. First came 9/11, which caused people to stop flying. Then came volatile fuel prices -- between 2000 and 2012, fuel costs for the industry rose from $16.8 billion to more than $50 billion. Then came the Great Recession. Over the last decade, according to Robert Mann, an airline consultant, ''the industry has destroyed about $70 billion in capital.''
The airlines responded to these problems by doing exactly what you would expect. They began consolidating. There have been four major mergers since 2005, when AmericaWest and US Airways joined forces. After the merged airline cut some routes and streamlined, its stock went through the roof. Then others followed suit: Delta bought Northwest in 2008, Southwest bought AirTran three years ago, and that same year, United merged with Continental. Delta and United are now the largest airlines in the country, with a global network that appeals to the big corporate customers who are the lifeblood of the industry.
What did consolidation give the airlines? Pricing power, as it's called. As the number of airlines dwindled, so did the number of routes and flights, as the airlines concluded that their health depended on cutting back the number of seats they offered. That's why when you fly today, the plane is likely to be full; there are simply fewer flights available. And that's also why airlines have been able to raise prices: Demand hasn't slackened nearly as much as supply has. Thus, says Mann, ''Every month in 2010 and 2011, there was a bump'' in the price of airline tickets. Even Southwest Airlines, long a low-cost airline, began raising prices.
What the American airline industry is today is an oligopoly, with two dominant carriers. (Southwest is No. 3.) And oligopolies, by their very nature, are anticompetitive. But it's a little late to be complaining about oligopolies. The government could have attempted to prevent such an outcome when the Delta and United mergers were announced. Instead, it stood passively by and let the industry consolidate.
Will consumers be further harmed if American and US Airways merge? It's certainly possible, especially since they have so many overlapping routes. But just about every industry analyst says that prices will continue to rise regardless, and limiting the supply of seats will continue to be central to the airlines' strategies. They also say that American, which counted on this merger to emerge from bankruptcy, will struggle to compete successfully with United and Delta if it can't establish that same kind of global network those two have put together. (US Airways, which is extremely well run, is a different story. It makes money consistently.)
''We learned what happened to competition in prior acquisitions,'' said Bill Baer, the Justice Department's antitrust chief, according to The Wall Street Journal. Indeed, we did: Competition dwindled. Prices went up. Consumer choice went down.
Blocking the American-US Airways deal is a little like closing the barn door after the horses are long gone.

HEADLINE: U.S. Troop Pullout Affects India-Pakistan Rivalry

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH; Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from New Delhi.

 BODY:
LONDON -- A weary familiarity hangs over the latest clashes between India and Pakistan, whose armies have traded artillery and accusations in recent days, jeopardizing new efforts to normalize relations between the two countries.
Still, though the escalation and excoriation may fit an old pattern, analysts believe something important has changed this time. The military exchanges have been more serious, and they point to a new brittleness in the rivalry: one that is being exacerbated by the impending American troop withdrawal in Afghanistan, analysts say.
It started in the disputed territory of Kashmir, with the deadliest episode of the past decade.
On Aug. 6, the Indian Army accused Pakistan of orchestrating a cross-border ambush in which five Indian soldiers were killed. Pakistan angrily rejected that claim, then accused India of killing two civilians during a bout of tit-for-tat cross-border shellfire. 
Politicians issued heated warnings, the Parliaments in both countries passed condemnatory resolutions, and speculation grew that a meeting between the leaders of the two countries, set to take place at a United Nations summit meeting in New York next month, would be canceled.
The military exchanges continued on Friday. Each side claimed the other had fired first.
In some ways, this is nothing new. The two nuclear-armed countries have fought over the mountainous territory of Kashmir -- which both claim in its entirety -- since Pakistan was carved from British India in 1947. Border flare-ups have occurred many times before, and once tempers have calmed, diplomats on both sides resume the sputtering effort to normalize relations.
But the latest violence comes after an unrivaled stretch of eased tensions over Kashmir, mostly thanks to a 2003 cease-fire that has suited both sides. Pakistan's military has been preoccupied with the war in Afghanistan and, more recently, the threat from Taliban insurgents in the northwest. India, meanwhile, learned the limits of armed confrontation after the last major standoff, in 2002, and has concentrated on building its economy.
But hard-liners in both countries remain firmly entrenched. And few doubt that the departure of American combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014 will change the strategic calculus of circling hawks.
Some Indians fear that, as the Americans leave Afghanistan, Pakistan's military will use the moment to draw international attention back onto Kashmir, either by bargaining with the United States or by diverting jihadi fighters to the territory, as it did for much of the 1990s.
''The Pakistanis will put up a price to assist with the transition in Afghanistan in 2014,'' said Srinath Raghavan, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. ''Part of that price might be to mount pressure on India over Kashmir.''
Pakistani officials, worried about the possibility of a wider Afghan conflict spilling over their borders, retort that they cannot afford new hostilities with India. As for Islamist collusion, they say Pakistan is already under threat from Taliban fighters, who recently mounted a major jailbreak in the northwest of the country.
Moreover, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had made a point of pledging to improve relations with India before he took office in June. He has a history of making overtures of peace to New Delhi, dating back to his last stint in power in the 1990s. He is under pressure from the business lobby in his native Punjab Province, which borders India, to bolster trade levels that, according to some estimates, could increase to $11 billion from $2 billion a year.
The question is whether Pakistan's generals will permit Mr. Sharif to deliver on his promises. The security establishments of both countries have become ''a mirror image of each other,'' said Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani general who has participated in back-channel peace efforts. ''Neither wants peace. Whenever any movement takes place, they create bottlenecks and problems.''
One ominous possibility, experts say, is that as American troops withdraw from Afghanistan next year, India and Pakistan will conduct their rivalry through proxy groups, a worry that was heightened by a suicide attack on an Indian consulate in eastern Afghanistan on Aug. 3.
''I think that Afghanistan will be a major theater for them,'' said Stephen P. Cohen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
For now, the most visible point of contention is in Kashmir. A top Indian general told reporters on Friday that India had killed 28 ''terrorists'' in the disputed territory since June 24, an unusually high number of casualties.
As usual, it was difficult to confirm that assertion. Both armies tightly limit access to the disputed border, known as the Line of Control. And it can be harder still to circle the logic behind the bloodshed.
After decades of strife, the cross-border exchanges of fire appear to have emotional rather than strategic value. Neither side realistically expects to gain ground, or to force the other to the negotiating table.
One problem is that governments on both sides are relatively weak right now. Mr. Sharif is struggling to calibrate his relationship with the powerful Pakistani military, while in New Delhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's Indian National Congress Party faces an election next year.
Another is that Pakistan has refused to bend to Indian demands to rein in Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the leader of the jihadist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, and the country's most prominent anti-India preacher.
In February, Mr. Saeed, who lives in open sight in Lahore despite a $10 million United States bounty for information leading to his capture, warned that ''just as America had to run away, then India, you will leave Kashmir.'' This week, he led prayers outside Qaddafi Stadium, one of Pakistan's largest cricket grounds.
For the United States, increased hostility between Pakistan and India spells trouble, whether conducted in Kashmir or Afghanistan.
American officials helped de-escalate the last major border showdown, in 2002, when one million Indian soldiers massed on the Pakistani border. That confrontation, and one three years earlier in which President Bill Clinton intervened, brought global concern about the possibility of a nuclear exchange. While no one is saying such a disaster is imminent, the episodes are present reminders of the risks involved in any tension between India and Pakistan.
America's other problem is its fragmented approach to the region. Even as the United States continues to pursue stronger economic ties with India, it depends on Pakistan to cooperate in Afghanistan and to crack down on militants sheltering in the northwestern tribal belt. Many analysts say that American attempts to walk that policy tightrope have often come across as incoherent.
Mr. Cohen, the author, said he feared the Pakistan-India conflict could stretch on for decades longer. One hope, he said, is that the troop reduction in Afghanistan in 2014 will give Washington a chance to formulate a more holistic regional approach.
''It's like a kid who falls into a pile of manure and says, 'Hey, there's a pony around here somewhere,' '' he said.
But, Mr. Cohen added, that is unlikely to happen. ''I'm not confident we're going to do that,'' he said. ''It's going to be a case of cut and run.''

HEADLINE: A Brazilian Belter Extends Her Reach

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
If Ivete Sangalo were an American singer, rather than the most popular female vocalist in Brazil, she would undoubtedly be described as a belter. Onstage, she is bold, brassy and boisterous, part of a lineage that includes Tina Turner, Janis Joplin and Bette Midler, and on her records she has often favored songs that allow her to emote loudly and dramatically.
It's an approach that has worked splendidly for Ms. Sangalo, who on Saturday will be performing at the Prudential Center in Newark. She has sold more than 15 million records as a solo artist; is said by the Brazilian press to be the country's highest-paid active performer, earning up to $500,000 a show; has 8.5 million followers on Twitter; and runs her own production company. 
''To be able to entertain people is a triumph, but the funny thing is that I never dreamed as a child about being a singer, never looked in the mirror and played at being a pop star,'' Ms. Sangalo, 41, said in an interview this week at a Manhattan hotel. ''I played at being an actress, and it wasn't until I started going to Carnival as a teenager and heard all that loud, joyous music blaring from the trucks that I said to myself, 'There's nothing I'd rather do than this.' ''
Ms. Sangalo (pronounced San-GAHL-oh) is the leading exponent of an upbeat and often raucous style known as axé music, which combines a variety of Brazilian and foreign influences into a high-octane blend, reminiscent of what is heard at Carnival. Samba and reggae are the most obvious sources, but rock, soul and Caribbean genres like salsa and merengue, as well as local regional rhythms, also enter the mix.
Her enormous popularity illustrates the gap between foreign perceptions of Brazilian music and the reality there. While singer-songwriters like Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil and Marisa Monte win plaudits abroad for their subtle vocals and sophisticated melodies and harmonies, Brazil's charts are dominated by axé, romantic pop ballads and a local version of country music called sertaneja.
''For better or worse, Ivete reflects the state of Brazilian popular music at a moment when people are buying a lot of upbeat, simple dance music with lyrics that are very basic,'' Chris McGowan, a co-author of the pop music history ''The Brazilian Sound,'' said in a telephone interview from Brazil. ''She's a consummate professional with a powerful, controlled voice that can soar over drums and polyrhythms. On the other hand, there is not much subtlety about her and no great artistry, just pure show business.''
Increasingly, the popularity of Ms. Sangalo, a former model with dark, expressive eyes; a husky voice; and an effervescent personality, extends beyond the stage and recordings. She appears regularly in television and print ads and on the cover of celebrity-oriented magazines, has been adopted by players on the national soccer team as their muse, has branched out into acting and has also shot fashion spreads for Brazilian Vogue and other magazines.
''She's not just a singer or entertainer, she's also a personality whom people here like a lot, someone who is admired and seen as a role model,'' Ricardo Pessanha, the other author of ''The Brazilian Sound,'' said from Rio de Janeiro. ''Women in particular are inspired by her, seeing her as a person who is strong, independent, happy, well-dressed and fulfilled, with a child and lots of money.''
Ms. Sangalo was born in the interior of the state of Bahia, in Juazeiro, also the birthplace of João Gilberto, one of the fathers of the bossa nova. As a child, the youngest of a brood of six, she listened to all kinds of Brazilian music, but after her family moved to Salvador, the capital of Bahia, the most musically rich state in a country obsessed with music, her horizons broadened to include reggae and American pop and soul music.
''I adore Sly and the Family Stone, George Clinton, Prince, Kool and the Gang and especially Stevie Wonder,'' she said. Normally, ''I don't do covers, but I bring them into my music and translate them into the percussion lines.''
After Ms. Sangalo's father, a jeweler, died when she was a teenager, she began playing the bars of Salvador, accompanying herself on guitar and learning to project above the din and disarm potentially hostile crowds with humor and between-song patter. She joined a group called Banda Eva in 1993, had several hit records with them, and then ventured out on her own in 1999.
Marco Mazzola is a producer who, before working with Ms. Sangalo at the start of her solo career, had made records with every major Brazilian female singer of recent decades, including Elis Regina, Gal Costa, Elba Ramalho and Fafá de Belém. Asked to name Ms. Sangalo's distinguishing characteristics, Mr. Mazzola listed the power of her voice, her charisma on the stage, her business savvy and her ''integral'' sense of who she is.
''There is something in her voice that is very warm, that transmits happiness to listeners,'' he added. ''She's a theatrical performer, an actress and dancer as much as a singer, who sings with a lot of heart, and man, does she have drive and determination.''
With nothing left to prove in Brazil, Ms. Sangalo has begun looking to the global market. She first toured the United States in 2010, including a sold-out show at Madison Square Garden that was turned into a hit DVD, and arrives for her Newark show after testing the waters on the West Coast and in the Boston area, with Miami coming on Sunday.
During her first go-round, the bulk of the audience at her United States shows had roots in Brazil or Portugal, where she is also quite popular. But in her debut in Los Angeles last week, she happily reported, ''half the audience was Americans,'' both English- and Spanish-speakers.
Last year, she won a Latin Grammy for a record she made with Mr. Gil and Mr. Veloso, whom she idolized as a child. To ease into the international arena, she has also performed with Dave Matthews, Shakira, Juan Luis Guerra and Alejandro Sanz, and when, in December, she makes her next live record, at a show in Salvador to commemorate her 20 years as a professional singer, she plans to include songs in English by Bob Marley and Stevie Wonder.
But it is not clear, even to her, whether she wants to follow in the footsteps of someone like Shakira, the Colombian singer who alternates between projects in English and ones in Spanish. That would require a commitment to absent herself from her homeland, which has enjoyed an economic boom -- lifting as many as 50 million into the middle class -- that coincides with the start of her solo career and that is the source of her success.
''It's a card in the sleeve, to leave my own country and come here for a year to dedicate myself to this and take advantage of what's here, which is really good and marvelous,'' she said. ''But what I've got there, in Brazil, is also marvelous, but different. What I can't do is stop singing.''

HEADLINE: A Merger Too Far For U.S. And Airlines

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Shareholders and employees of American Airlines and US Airways may well be wondering: why us?
Until this week, when the Justice Department filed suit to block the proposed merger of the airlines' parent companies, it had been notably lax on airline mergers. What the antitrust division deemed acceptable -- even beneficial -- for Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines (in 2008), and Continental and United Airlines (2010), and Southwest Airlines and AirTran Airways (2011) now ''threatens substantial harm to consumers,'' the complaint says.
US Airways has been doubly unlucky. United abandoned a merger deal with US Air in 2001 after the Bush administration said it would file an antitrust suit. And the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, William J. Baer, said this week that the department might have sued to block US Airways' 2006 hostile bid for Delta if US Airways hadn't abandoned the takeover. (US Airways did get approval to acquire America West in 2005.) 
The government ''abandoned the framework it used in approving the last three airline mergers,'' said Paul T. Denis, a partner at Dechert L.L.P., which is representing US Airways. ''In some ways, the complaint is a throwback to the 1970s,'' before market-oriented economic analysis led to a broad revision in antitrust policy. ''Now they're saying those prior mergers were anticompetitive. That's surprising. But even if they believe that, it's not relevant to whether this merger will have an adverse effect.''
US Airways and American have come out fighting. The government ''got this one wrong, very wrong,'' Richard Parker, an antitrust litigator at O'Melveny & Myers and former director of the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust arm, the Bureau of Competition, said at a news conference on Wednesday. He stressed that only a judge could block the merger and vowed to take the case to trial. But perhaps the airlines shouldn't have been so surprised by the lawsuit -- and shouldn't be quite so eager for a courtroom showdown.
''It's a different regime, different standards and a different time,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, professor of law at the University of Iowa and widely regarded as a dean of the antitrust bar. The relevant question may not be why the department moved to block the American-US Airways deal, but why it approved the United-Continental merger -- a move it now seems to regret.
Mr. Baer of the Justice Department told me this week: ''We consider every merger one at a time. Here, we had a proposed merger that would reduce the legacy carriers from four to three. That's not the same as six to five, or five to four. That logic would get you from two to one pretty quickly.''
And while he said he couldn't comment on the earlier airline mergers, since he has been the antitrust chief for just seven months, ''if you look at the net effects, what we've seen is a reduction in capacity and higher prices, and not the benefits that were promised.''
Whatever the recent precedents, the proposed American-US Airways merger violates the Justice Department's merger guidelines, which the Obama administration finally seems to be taking seriously. The merger would substantially reduce competition because ''there are too many routes that would create a monopoly or oligopoly,'' Professor Hovenkamp said.
According to the Justice Department, the American-US Airways merger would substantially reduce competition in over 1,000 city pairs served by the two airlines. Among the more egregious examples it cited are Charlotte, N.C.-Dallas; Charlotte-Durango, Colo.; Dallas-Philadelphia; and Kahului, Hawaii-Tampa, Fla. It said the merger would create four out-and-out monopolies, albeit on secondary routes, including three that serve St. Croix in the Virgin Islands. And it said the merger would reduce competition on more than 1,000 routes.
It's pretty clear what happens when concentration increases substantially on a route between two cities. After Continental and United merged, the combined airline accounted for 79 percent of the service between O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. During a three-month period after the merger, fares on that route were 57 percent higher than they were three years earlier, according to the aviation industry Web site PlaneStats.com. United's fares overall increased 16 percent in the same period.
''Over and over, the airlines have merged, concentration has increased, and prices have gone up,'' said Christopher L. Sager, an antitrust professor at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, who warned about the effects of the American-US Air merger in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee in March ''This is what economic theory would predict and it is, in fact, exactly what the carriers have done. They have no incentive to use higher profit margins to lower prices for consumers.''
Like AT&T, whose proposed acquisition of T-Mobile was also a flagrant violation of the guidelines, the airlines seemed surprised that the Justice Department took its own standards seriously. Given the Obama administration's tougher stand on antitrust enforcement, ''It should have been crystal clear under the revised guidelines that this merger was vulnerable to challenge,'' Professor Hovenkamp said. Mr. Baer added, ''I can assure you we're taking the guidelines seriously.''
But obstacles to mergers that violate the guidelines can be overcome by other benefits, an approach that worked for United and Continental. Indeed, the arguments those airlines advanced to support their merger -- a more comprehensive route network with smoother connections, better service, increased business for suppliers, greater employee stability and benefits, and creating sustainable long-term value for shareholders -- are almost exactly the ones US Airways and American have been making.
The Justice Department closed its investigation of the proposed Continental-United combination after Continental agreed to transfer its landing slots and other assets at Newark Liberty International Airport to the discount carrier Southwest Airlines, which at the time had only limited service to the New York area. The Justice Department issued a statement in August 2010 saying that the agreement eased most of its concerns and said the deal ''will likely significantly benefit consumers.''
But much has changed in just the last few years. Far from benefiting consumers, the department now states flatly, ''increasing consolidation among large airlines has hurt passengers'' because of higher fares, new fees and add-on costs, reduced service and fewer amenities. The complaint notes disapprovingly that the merged United and Continental ''reduced capacity at nearly all its major hubs'' and ''at many other airports where the two airlines previously competed.''
Southwest, known for its discount pricing and regarded as a savior two years ago, no longer seems as significant a competitive threat to higher pricing. ''Competition from Southwest, JetBlue or other airlines would not be sufficient,'' the complaint asserts, suggesting that the antitrust division no longer views Southwest as a feisty upstart.
''When Southwest entered a market, it was able to constrain price increases, even in concentrated markets,'' Professor Sager said. ''The Justice Department took this seriously. But now empirical evidence is suggesting that Southwest has become such a large entity that it's no longer a reliable constraint.''
And two years ago, the airlines were still struggling from the effects of the recession. They're now flying close to capacity and generating higher revenue and profits. The complaint noted that US Air had record profits in 2012 and that American, although it is still operating under bankruptcy court supervision, had record revenue in its latest quarter, with $357 million in net profits. ''American does not need this merger to thrive, let alone survive,'' it said.
An obvious compromise might be for American and US Airways to give up landing slots at Reagan National Airport, much as Continental and United did at Newark. That would remove at least one major impediment, since the two airlines control 69 percent of the slots there. But surely such a move was already considered and rejected before the department filed suit. When I spoke to Mr. Baer this week, he didn't seem inclined to compromise.
''If they have ideas, I'll listen,'' he said. ''I didn't say I would compromise. As I look at the deal, the best outcome would be a full injunction.''
Professor Hovenkamp added: ''When there's a dozen or so anticompetitive city pairs, that's one thing. You can spin off some routes. But when there are this many problems, it would require a massive redistribution of resources. I wouldn't say it's impossible, but it seems very unlikely.''
Even if the merger's fate is ultimately decided in court, American and US Airways may simply have waited too long, as their rivals consolidated and became more profitable.
''There's a huge first mover advantage'' in any market, Professor Sager said, since the industry is less concentrated and there are fewer bad precedents. American and US Airways are saying ''You have to give us this chance because everyone else got it,'' he said. ''But that doesn't make any sense. Just because you let two competitors merge doesn't mean you have to let everyone else merge. You'd have to approve every merger, which cannot be the law, should not be the law and is not the law.''

HEADLINE: My Job Isn't So Bad

BYLINE: By BERT STRATTON. 
Bert Stratton is the author of the blog Klezmer Guy: Real Music and Real Estate.

 BODY:
CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio -- GOOD news: unemployment fell to 7.4 percent in July -- the lowest level since the end of 2008. But there's bad news, too: most of the new jobs were low-wage, in retail and restaurants. They're not the jobs that people want. I should know. No one wants my job, either. At least, nobody in my family.
I'm a landlord. It isn't very glamorous. I just got a call: ''There's a smell of urine in the front of my apartment. Something is leaking from above.'' 
But at least it's pretty lucrative and stable. That's what I tell my 32-year-old son, a recently minted lawyer. ''Come on, Son, make the rounds with me.'' He has taught English in Korea; he has been a newspaper reporter; he has passed the Ohio bar. But things are tough out there; right now he's an hourly contract worker at a big law firm.
''Dad, I have something else to do.''
My other son is 25 and a musician in a band called Vulfpeck in Los Angeles. Every middle-class kid from the Midwest is trying to make it in a bigger city. At the corner ice cream shop, I ran into a mom whose daughter is a personal assistant to a movie mogul. The mom said, ''In 10 years my daughter and your son will run Hollywood.'' Pure Cleveland. Dream on. I give my musician son at least five years before I press him to join the business. Right now I'm focusing on the lawyer.
Last January I got a fan letter from a young man who said he wanted to go into real estate and meet me. He wrote: ''I'm looking for jobs in a variety of fields, but my primary interest is real estate. While I grew up in New York and have returned to the city for now, I have visited Cleveland and could easily imagine working there.''
I showed the letter to my son the lawyer. ''You see,'' I said.
He didn't see.
I telephoned the letter writer. He said: ''I figured you would call. My dad said not too many landlords in Cleveland get fan mail.''
Right. My fan -- Jim, a 23-year-old liberal arts grad -- lived with his parents in Manhattan. He's a graduate of Carleton College. ''That's in Minnesota,'' he said.
Jim came to Cleveland to talk real estate with me. I gave him the deluxe tour: a vacant storefront, a vacant apartment and a semi-vacant apartment. I knocked on the semi-vacant apartment door and said ''maintenance'' three times. Then I got out the master key.
There was a couch and a bed in the apartment. Tenants always leave behind the heavy stuff. TVs too. Everyone upgrades his TV on move-out. There was a junk heap of small items: pennies, beer cans and unopened bills. Enough to fill three garbage bags. The refrigerator was missing a couple of crucial shelves. Always happens. Why? There were clothes strewn about, but the tenant's socks were gone. No socks meant no tenant.
''The guy skipped,'' I said. That was probably worth four years of Carleton.
Jim said he couldn't get into the landlord business in New York. One suite in New York costs an entire building in Cleveland.
I said, ''I don't have enough work for you right now, unless you want to paint walls.'' He didn't. ''I don't buy and sell buildings every day. I don't have that much white-collar stuff going on.''
Jim returned to New York. I guarded his letter. It was United States mail, not e-mail. I've shown it to everybody. A lot to my sons.
I have white-collar openings for my sons. That's different. That's family business.
I'll wait my boys out. I know how it goes. ... Flashback, 1980, Boca Raton, vacation: My dad expounds on the incredible growth in Florida. ''This was a two-lane dirt road when we got here. Now it's six lane.'' With a bagel store on every other block. My dad thought about real estate constantly. ''You ever think about our properties when you're down here?'' he asked. ''You ever dream about the buildings?''
''No.''
Back in Ohio, I served an eviction notice on a painter -- a real artist -- for my father. The tenant was late with her rent. I handed her the eviction, and she yelled, ''I was going to pay the rent, but not now!''
My father sent me! I'm a cool dude! I was 30.
My father's properties were prewar buildings in Lakewood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. He started the business in 1965. I kept it going and expanded it. At different times, I've had my sons cleaning halls and collecting rent. They asked, ''I went to college for this?''
Quite possibly. I did.
I'm a proud dad; my sons will probably be big successes. But I can't help hoping at least one of them comes back to the family business. Unemployment is down, but underemployment isn't.

HEADLINE: Despite Drop in Commodity Prices, Farmland Values Rise

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
DAN LINDSTROM remembers looking at a piece of Nebraska farmland six or seven years ago that cost $3,300 an acre. Raised on a farm, he ran the numbers with his brother who is farming the family land and concluded that it was too expensive. He figured that with a 2 to 3 percent return, it made more sense to put the money into a dividend-paying stock and have his brother lease additional land.
A few weeks ago, Mr. Lindstrom said similar land sold for nearly $11,000 an acre.
This is a common story across the farm belt. In Indiana, William C. Ade, who made a fortune in oil and gas exploration in Asia, said he stopped adding to his 1,000 acres when the price passed $5,000 an acre. 
''Right now it's at auction as high as $12,000 an acre,'' he said of land to grow corn and soybeans in northwest Indiana. ''A poor plot of land went for $8,000.''
Mr. Lindstrom, who is a financial adviser at UBS Wealth Management in Omaha, and Mr. Ade, a member of the investment club Tiger 21, are among investors who say they believe farmland could be headed for a serious drop in values, if not a full-on crash. Of course, many of them have been thinking that for years.
The traditional view of farmland, from the farmer to the agricultural economist to the investment adviser, is, as Mr. Ade put it, ''an inflation-proof bond.'' (''No one is going to steal it,'' he said. ''No one is going to default on it. If inflation goes up, it will still be there.'')
After the financial collapse of 2008, most forms of real estate were shunned. But not farmland. Prices shot up, driven by rising commodity prices from global demand, low interest rates in the United States and high auction prices begetting higher prices.
Now commodity prices have fallen. Corn has gone to about $4.60 a bushel this week from over $8 a bushel last year. Soybeans have fallen to about $12.60 a bushel from over $17. Yet the value of farmland for row crops has continued to rise.
''We're kind of at an inflection point,'' said Brent Gloy, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University. ''We've had five years of spectacular profitability that was somewhat unanticipated. The U.S.D.A. was forecasting much lower than this, so it surprised people.''
Yet there are still reasons to think that there will be buyers for land who will hold on to it for decades to come. A report released by U.S. Trust highlighted the graying of America's farmers and their need to sell or lease their land as they age.
''Can land go up and down?'' asked John Taylor, national farm and ranch executive for U.S. Trust, which manages 900 farms for investors. ''Sure. But I've never seen land go to zero. And with world demand, there is no vacancy factor on good U.S. farmland.''
All of this raises the issue of whether it is time to sell.
Brian C. Duke, vice president for Northern Trust, said that even with the run-up in prices for commodities, the annual return of farmland remains about 3 percent. Since 2000, the value of land in Illinois, for example, has increased 207 percent. For an investment comparison, The Dow Jones industrial average went up 42 percent in that period. Triple-digit appreciation has a way of luring new investors.
More experienced investors said that appreciation isn't the goal: to realize it you have to sell the land. ''The capital gain is nice, '' said Albert Kirchner, who is known as Bud and owned a manufacturing company. ''We don't look at the capital gain. We look at it from a productivity standpoint.''
Mr. Kirchner owns 6,000 acres of corn and soybean land in Illinois, an 8,000-acre cattle ranch in Montana and 1,200 acres of timberland in Florida. But his benchmark since he started investing in land after World War II has remained a 4 percent annual return.
At that number and using Agriculture Department estimates that the average farmland value in Illinois is $7,800, Mr. Kirchner's land would be worth $46.8 million, with an annual return of $1,872,000.
But for the person who has bought land recently at auction, getting even 4 percent becomes more challenging. At $12,000 an acre, a 4 percent return is $480. Kevin Casner, who farms 2,400 acres in Carrollton, Mo., with his son Adam, said the rents in his area ranged from $150 to $450 an acre. (Those rents were negotiated before commodity prices started to fall, and will presumably drop.)
A landlord can squeeze a farmer only so far on rent. Mr. Lindstrom said that an acre of his family farm was producing 175 bushels of corn, which equals a little more than $740 at $4.25 a bushel. But a farmer has some pretty hefty fixed costs. He said that, per acre, seed is $100, nitrogen is $100, dry fertilizer is $100, taxes are $50, insecticide is $30, chemicals are $50, and cash rent is $300 on average. That is $680 without factoring in the cost of equipment and labor. There is no room to increase the rent in this example by $180 more an acre.
This balance between commodity prices and land values and rents can change. It is why all land investors need to have a long enough time frame. ''If you're wanting to park money for five years, farmland is really not what you should be investing in,'' Mr. Duke said. ''You need to have that longer-term approach.''
Many farmers and investors fear the past decade could be too much of a good thing.
''In real terms the gain we've seen in farmland values over the last 10 years are greater than those we saw in the 1970s,'' said Professor Gloy of Purdue. In the early 1980s, farmland prices crashed when interest rates went up and farmers could not continue to borrow to finance their operations.
The two things that could set off a decline are a further drop in commodity prices and higher interest rates.
Matt Ward, one of the owners of Premier Grain Farms in Walker, Iowa, said that a drop of $2 a bushel in the price of corn translated to a loss of about $400 an acre. If all 15,000 acres he farms were planted evenly, that would translate into $6 million less in revenue than the land produced last year.
Investors who have sharecropping agreements that designate a split in the harvest between farmer and owner will see their return reduced immediately. Those who have cash leases are likely to have to negotiate lower rents when the lease is renewed.
Another option for an investor has been a variable cash lease. The owner would accept a lower cash rent up front and negotiate an additional payment if the price of the commodity or the yield was higher. There is now less chance of upside potential.
As for interest rates, the fear is that they will rise and the value of land will fall. Mr. Lindstrom, the farm owner who works for UBS, said there was no way to finance land at today's rates of 5 percent and make money. Cash buyers, he said, are at risk of losing their principal.
''Could the land go from $10,000 to $15,000 an acre?'' he said. ''Sure, but not today and not with corn at $4.25. I'd be surprised if we don't go from $10,000 to $8,000 or $7,000. Land has tripled in the last five to six years.''
Still, this was the man who passed on buying land at $3,300 an acre because he thought it was overpriced. ''We just tried to buy more ground and were willing to go to $7,500 an acre,'' Mr. Lindstrom said.
''It went for $10,500. My instincts tell me we'll buy that ground, and we'll buy it cheaper.''

HEADLINE: Assessing Blame for the Violence in Egypt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Military Madness in Cairo'' (editorial, Aug. 15):
In analyzing the military's violence, you write: ''The Muslim Brotherhood must also share responsibility. Since the July 3 coup that ousted President Mohamed Morsi, it has shown too little interest in negotiating a peaceful path out of the crisis. And even before that coup, Mr. Morsi and other Brotherhood leaders had displayed little interest in reaching out to Egyptians of different political and religious persuasions.'' 
Yet the same day, Reuters published remarks by Bernardino Leon, the European Union envoy for the Middle East, stating clearly that the United States and the European Union had presented a compromise that would likely have resolved the impasse, which was accepted by the Muslim Brotherhood but rejected by the military. His conclusion was: ''All that has happened today was unnecessary.''
Accounts by your own Cairo correspondents in the immediate aftermath of the July 3 coup also revealed that President Morsi was willing to meet demands by the opposition.
In the United States it is fashionable to try to blame all sides, but in this case, the facts point to one murderer only.

To the Editor:
Re ''His Options Few, Obama Rebukes Egypt's Leaders'' (front page, Aug. 16):
President Obama's options may be few, but one that he has -- the suspension of military and economic aid to Egypt -- is a mighty cudgel. Even if the ending of $1.3 billion a year of American support did not cause Egypt's generals to end their murderous ways, it would dissociate the United States from the carnage that is currently being carried out with full American material support.
That United States tax dollars are being used to kill hundreds of civilians, including the shooting of wounded people trying to make their way to makeshift hospitals, is nauseating in the extreme.

HEADLINE: How We Experience Art Museums

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Judith H. Dobrzynski's essay ''High Culture Goes Hands-On'' (Sunday Review, Aug. 11) reminded me of a scene I witnessed at the entrance to the Metropolitan Museum of Art one summer afternoon two years ago. A family of four, all chewing on slices of pizza, was being turned away by security guards. And what can one expect, considering the fun house exhibitions that are a regular staple at museums?
The current fetish by museum curators for recreations of toilets and arrangements of detritus is evidence of a mind-set that no longer has anything to do with what art is or is not. 
In regard to that toilet, recreated as part of the recent ''Punk: Chaos to Couture'' show at the Metropolitan, a staff member commented that curators wanted to confront the public's sense of good taste.
If I want my sense of good taste confronted, I know exactly where to go. I do not need the Metropolitan or any other museum to make it accessible.
RICHARD KAGAN Long Island City, Queens, Aug. 13, 2013
To the Editor:
As a teacher of art history, I believe that the museums are taking the easy way out when they try to pander to the public looking for ''an experience.''
They are seeking to involve more people in a way that will increase museum attendance, a wonderful goal indeed. But my experience tells me that the true problem is that Americans seem to be afraid of museums and of anything but exhibitions of photography and contemporary art. They have not been exposed to the history of art, to the development of art as it relates to the culture. They do not understand its historic purpose, nor the stories depicted, whether biblical or classical.
I believe that rather than creating rain rooms and the opportunity to meet the artist, we should be educating all our children to love, appreciate and feel at ease in the presence of the great art of the past. Only then will museums truly fulfill their purpose and their role as a place of contemplation and appreciation.
DEBORAH MARKOW Brooklyn, Aug. 12, 2013
To the Editor:
The real threat to museums isn't that too many people visit them for the ''wrong'' reasons, or even that contemporary artists make ephemera. It's that public officials and leaders of private organizations view museums as safe deposit boxes.
When the global art market is valued at around $60 billion, as it was in 2012, municipalities and universities begin to wonder why they're suffering when selling collections might quickly solve their problems.
Museums answer this existential threat with popularity. There are about 850 million visits to American museums annually, according to the American Alliance of Museums, ''more than the attendance for all major league sporting events and theme parks combined.''
Even if museums go too far toward the tired tropes of the experience economy, it will be worth it if they can remain open long enough to move on toward something better -- and if that something better includes their collections.
LAURA KNOTT Brookline, Mass., Aug. 12, 2013
The writer runs a consulting firm that works mostly with academic museums and galleries.
To the Editor:
Museums should heed Judith H. Dobrzynski's advice and not rush to conform and become more participatory. The drama of a Rubens, the emotion of a Rodin or the tranquillity of a Corot are unique experiences.
Museums are vital cultural institutions that remind us that there are things in this world that are truly beautiful. By resisting conforming to the demands of those who are never satisfied, museums will ensure their prominence and remain an oasis.
For those in search of a more hands-on experience, try an amusement park.

HEADLINE: Brown Cheered In Second Act, At Least So Far

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- When Jerry Brown became governor of California again, three years ago, this state was on a steep decline, crushed by budget deficits, deep spending cuts, governmental paralysis, high unemployment and a collapsing housing market. California, a place that once symbolized promise and opportunity, seemed caught in an intractable reversal of fortune.
But these days, Mr. Brown -- who at 75 is the oldest governor in the nation and about to become the longest-serving governor in the history of California -- is enjoying a degree of success and authority he and his opponents could scarcely have imagined when he returned to Sacramento to begin a second tour as governor in 2010.
The state's budget problems are largely resolved, at least for the short term. Mr. Brown is the dominant figure in Sacramento, strengthened by overwhelming Democratic control of the Legislature and the decline of the Republican Party. He has pushed through major initiatives on education financing and prison reorganization. Even Republicans say his re-election next year seems considerably more than likely. 
''Some people were ridiculing California, and some were calling it a failed state,'' Mr. Brown, a Democrat, said in an interview. ''The unemployment came down from 12.2 to 8.5. Real estate is rebounding. There's a lot of confidence out there. That's what happened.''
Mr. Brown has his share of problems. He unsuccessfully resisted a federal court order to move inmates out of overcrowded prisons. Changes in the state employee pension system approved last year do not, in the view of most analysts, come close to addressing the long-term pension liabilities over the horizon.
His latest proposal to overhaul California's water distribution system is smacking up against the same entrenched geographical and business factions that defeated him when he tried to address the problem as governor from 1975 to 1983. Mr. Brown's signature plan to build a high-speed rail line from Los Angeles to San Francisco remains a target of skepticism and ridicule. In a setback Friday night, a superior judge in Sacramento ruled that the agency overseeing the project failed to comply with the cost and environmental requirements in a ballot measure authorizing the project.
And the governor has so far shown little inclination to use his considerable political capital to take on some of the most divisive problems that have long plagued this state, among them a dysfunctional governmental structure and tax system. ''He's done a good job -- he doesn't want to be great,'' said Antonio R. Villaraigosa, a Democrat and former speaker of the State Assembly, who just finished two terms as mayor of Los Angeles. ''He wants to be solid. And he's been solid.''
Yet by almost every measure, Mr. Brown, the son of another California governor, has accomplished a turnaround in a state where his family has been a dynasty for more than 50 years. He has defied critics who questioned how someone who last served as governor in a wholly different era could thrive today, much less rescue a state that had gone from being a model for American aspiration to a case study in governmental dysfunction.
''He's proven better at the job than perhaps his critics anticipated,'' said Bill Whalen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. ''In 2010, his critics wanted to criticize him as a flaky moonbeam,'' he said. ''Instead we have a governor who is very serious and sober about his choices. You can't find a governor in recent history who has a smoother road to re-election.''
Mr. Brown is not saying whether he will seek re-election, but it seems nearly unthinkable that he will not. He does not appear to be even slightly worried about his prospects. ''The opposition candidates,'' he said, ''are rather few and far between.''
Mr. Brown is as quirky as ever. Lawmakers speak with frustration of an insular and enigmatic executive circle where most decisions are made by Mr. Brown and his wife and special counsel, Anne Gust Brown, and where he is so consumed with details that he reads every bill put on his desk before signing it. He has gone for weeks with barely a public appearance (his office asked that a 30-minute interview for this article be done by phone).
''He is informal,'' said Darrell Steinberg, the president pro tem of the State Senate. ''He decides things and solves problems in very iterative ways. I think I have as many phone conversations as I have face-to-face meetings. He conducts business informally, which is great: it's all about the bottom line.''
John A. Pérez, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, said he had no quarrel with Mr. Brown's style. ''I think most people would have a larger staff than he does -- but the results speak for themselves,'' he said. ''I am the last person who is going to second-guess him when he has achieved so many good results.''
Mr. Brown has certainly benefited from a playing field sloped in his favor. The economy began to rebound as he took office. Term limits are in full force, which means that the era of entrenched legislative powerhouses like Willie Brown, the legendary Assembly speaker, is gone. And the Republican Party has been almost marginalized, removing the presence of any kind of opposition, loyal or not.
''We have a weak Republican Party that is not challenging him,'' said Abel Maldonado, the former lieutenant governor who is seeking the Republican nomination to challenge Mr. Brown. ''Nobody questions anything. We need to stand up.''
Mr. Brown acknowledged that some of his successes have been the result of lucky circumstances, including powerful Democratic leaders in the Legislature, but said he also benefited from having been governor before. ''To get anything done you need the political will, and you need the political skill, and you need the knowledge'' he said. ''I do feel a certain command of the process.''
He might need that more than ever now. The issues Mr. Brown has turned to -- among them, building two new water tunnels and moving state inmates to county jails -- have sharply divided the state and are fraught with political risks.
''He has gotten through the first part of his governorship in real strong shape, and now he is moving into some really, really tough territory,'' said Raphael J. Sonenshein, the executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University. ''But he's got assets going into it.''
Mr. Brown's father, Pat -- for whom the institute was named -- was governor from 1959 to 1967 and was considered one of the most effective chief executives in this state's history, championing the development of its higher education, highway and water systems. Mr. Brown frequently invokes a lesson he said he learned from his father. ''Timing is important, my father always told me,'' he said once, discussing his legislative agenda.
Observers of this governor suggest that his father's penchant for legacy-defining projects has rubbed off on the younger Mr. Brown. His sister Kathleen Brown, a former state treasurer, was defeated in a run for governor by Pete Wilson, a Republican.
Mr. Brown disputed any suggestion that he was not making full use of his political standing to move on the tougher problems, be it inequities in the tax system or pensions. Mr. Brown said he would proceed on his own schedule. ''There are some people who are writing, 'Well, everything wasn't done in the first year, and therefore this seems to be a failed situation,' '' he said. ''But it's not just one year. It's many years.''
''I've said there needs to be more pension reform,'' he said. ''Well, when to do that is a matter of my prudential judgment. People who want to do everything all at once generally don't get anything done.''

HEADLINE: Layoffs Taboo, Japan Workers Are Sent to the Boredom Room

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI; Joshua Hunt contributed research from Tokyo.

 BODY:
TAGAJO, Japan -- Shusaku Tani is employed at the Sony plant here, but he doesn't really work.
For more than two years, he has come to a small room, taken a seat and then passed the time reading newspapers, browsing the Web and poring over engineering textbooks from his college days. He files a report on his activities at the end of each day.
Sony, Mr. Tani's employer of 32 years, consigned him to this room because they can't get rid of him. Sony had eliminated his position at the Sony Sendai Technology Center, which in better times produced magnetic tapes for videos and cassettes. But Mr. Tani, 51, refused to take an early retirement offer from Sony in late 2010 -- his prerogative under Japanese labor law.
So there he sits in what is called the ''chasing-out room.'' He spends his days there, with about 40 other holdouts. 
''I won't leave,'' Mr. Tani said. ''Companies aren't supposed to act this way. It's inhumane.''
The standoff between workers and management at the Sendai factory underscores an intensifying battle over hiring and firing practices in Japan, where lifetime employment has long been the norm and where large-scale layoffs remain a social taboo, at least at Japan's largest corporations.
Sony wants to change that, and so does Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. As Japan's economic recovery slows, reducing the restraints on companies has become even more important to Mr. Abe's economic plans. He wants to loosen rigid rules on job terminations for full-time staff.
Economists say bringing flexibility to the labor market in Japan would help struggling companies streamline bloated work forces to better compete in the global economy. Fewer restrictions on layoffs could make it easier for Sony to leave loss-ridden traditional businesses and concentrate resources on more innovative, promising ones.
''I have a single wish for Japan's electronics sector, and that's labor reform,'' said Atul Goyal, a technology analyst at Jefferies & Company.
Sony said it was not doing anything wrong in placing employees in what it calls Career Design Rooms. Employees are given counseling to find new jobs in the Sony group, or at another company, it said. Sony also said that it offered workers early retirement packages that are generous by American standards: in 2010, it promised severance payments equivalent to as much as 54 months of pay. But the real point of the rooms is to make employees feel forgotten and worthless -- and eventually so bored and shamed that they just quit, critics say.
Labor practices in Japan contrast sharply with those in the United States, where companies are quick to lay off workers when demand slows or a product becomes obsolete. It is cruel to the worker, but it usually gives the overall economy agility. Some economists attribute the lack of a dynamic economy in Western Europe to labor laws similar to Japan's that restrict layoffs.
New York had ''rubber rooms'' where it put teachers who would sit -- with full pay -- while the city tried to fire them. The practice was ended in 2010. The United Auto Workers and automakers had created, under union contracts, places where idled workers were essentially warehoused.
Sony, a sprawling company with more than 146,000 employees, is under pressure. It has been outmaneuvered by more nimble competitors and its executives are trying to remake the company. Fixing Sony is especially critical after it snubbed the American activist investor Daniel S. Loeb's push to spin off part of Sony's entertainment business. Its shares have fallen almost 10 percent since Sony rejected his proposal earlier this month.
Critics of labor changes say something more important is at stake. They warn that making it easier to cut jobs would destroy Japan's social fabric for the sake of corporate profits, causing mass unemployment and worsening income disparities. For a country that has long prided itself on stability and relatively equitable incomes, such a change would be unacceptable.
''That's not the kind of country Japan should aim to be,'' said Takaaki Matsuda, who leads the Sendai chapter of Sony's union.
It would be a radical change. A combination of lifetime employment, seniority-based pay and intense worker loyalty to the company was credited for Japan's postwar economic miracle, as stability and growth went hand in hand. But when the Japanese economy stumbled in the early 1990s, companies found that Japan's rigid labor practices made downsizing impractical. Instead, unneeded workers were left with little to do besides gaze out of the window, giving rise to the term ''madogiwa zoku'' or the ''window seat tribe.''
Proponents of employment change point out that stiff protections for workers have prompted companies to make major cuts in hiring, shrinking opportunities for scores of younger Japanese. Sony hired 160 fresh college graduates this fiscal year, compared with about 1,000 in 1991.
Companies have also adjusted by using a secondary class of temporary or part-time workers they can more easily let go. ''In reality, hidden inequalities already exist in Japan,'' said Fumio Ohtake an economist at Osaka University.
Still, some fear that Mr. Abe's changes are not so much pro-market as just pro-business. A weaker yen has brought exporters like Sony windfall profits, yet no substantial increases in salary have followed, and many manufacturers continue to shift production overseas.
The delicacy of labor changes has forced Mr. Abe to tread gingerly. He took the issue off the agenda when he focused on parliamentary elections in July. After a big win for his party, it is back. But a new plan under discussion would ease firing rules only in Japan's three biggest cities.
Japan's biggest companies appear to be imitating Sony. Local media reports say many of them, including Panasonic, NEC and Toshiba, use the oidashibeya, or chase-out rooms, and similar tactics. In May, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that an employee at a Panasonic unit was being required to spend his days in a room staring at monitors to catch irregularities. Last year, a Tokyo court ordered Benesse, an educational services company, to reinstate a worker who claimed she had been required to do demeaning, menial tasks after resisting pressure to leave.
Panasonic could not be reached for comment over its summer holiday period. Benesse said it had since revised its personnel practices.
While details to the government plans are still being determined, Mr. Tani's managers at Sony are already upping the ante. Starting this month, the company has ordered him to work 12-hour shifts on an assembly line at a Sony plant in Toyosato, more than an hour's drive away. He says he will comply.
For Miwako Sato, who joined Sony right out of high school in 1974, the changes are a betrayal of an accepted social contract in Japan. She put in 12-hour shifts at the Sendai factory, working with huge rolls of magnetic film, and watched Sony grow into a global electronics powerhouse.
But technology moved on, and Sony was increasingly usurped by nimbler rivals. In 2003, the factory offered the first of many early retirement programs.
Two years ago, a destructive tsunami swept through the factory, sending workers scrambling to the roof. The damage prompted Sony to move its battery and optical devices operations, and the company later sold its chemical products business, eliminating more jobs at the plant.
In February, just two years shy of Mrs. Sato's retirement, a manager had blunt news: ''Your job no longer exists.'' She refused to quit, and was dispatched to the chase-out room. There she completed an online degree in nursing the elderly. But she didn't quit. Since last month, she has been assigned to do data entry.
Sony's labor union estimates that the plant's work force is half the size it was three years ago.
Mrs. Sato said that in the factory's heyday, workers called Sony the Sony Maru, or the Sony Ship. ''Everybody was on board, our fates tied together,'' she said. ''Not anymore.''

HEADLINE: Chevrolet's Cheap Minicar, the Spark, Is a Surprisingly Strong Seller

BYLINE: By JACLYN TROP

 BODY:
The tiny Chevrolet Spark from General Motors is about as bare bones as cars come these days, with no floor mats and one of the smallest engines of any car. But to the surprise of even G.M. itself, which has traditionally struggled to sell small cars, the Spark has become an unlikely hit as many American buyers warm to a car that is cheap to buy and to operate.
The Spark, made in South Korea, seats four, has room for groceries -- and starts at $12,170, significantly less than the Fiat 500's starting price of $16,100. It's also inexpensive to run, getting about 35 miles to the gallon.
In July, sales of the Spark increased 163 percent over the previous year, its introductory month, to a record 3,847, showing that a stripped-down minicar can succeed in a market crowded with costlier rivals like the Fiat 500 that have more features and technology. Its July sales outpaced the Fiat 500's 2,821, which was a 24 percent decline from a year earlier. Through July this year, Spark sales were 21,435, behind only the Fiat 500's 23,892 among minicars. 
''To me, it's an appliance,'' said William Wortman of Ohio City near Cleveland, who in April bought a Spark with manual transmission for his weekly 250-mile commute to his job as a toolmaker. The Spark's 1.2-liter, four-cylinder engine makes it the smallest in the Chevrolet lineup.
''It gets me back and forth,'' he said. ''All I wanted was a radio.''
Even G.M. did not expect it would resonate this way with consumers. ''We're very surprised with how well the vehicle has been selling,'' said Cristi Landy, Chevrolet marketing director.
Beyond its cost, what separates the Spark, buyers say, is that it's the only minicar sold in the United States with four doors.
''The ability to get four adults in a minicar like that is what sells the vehicle,'' said Andy Lilienthal, of Portland, Ore., who has run a blog on small cars, called Subcompact Culture, since 2008.
G.M.'s decision to market a minicar like the Spark was a logical one, analysts said. With gasoline routinely topping $4 a gallon, many Americans are seeking better mileage. But automakers also need to make their fleets more efficient to meet strict new federal fuel economy standards that take effect in 2016, said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst for Edmunds.com.
''Everybody's going in that direction,'' Ms. Krebs said, ''but no one expected G.M. to do it as well as they have.''
More broadly, minicars and subcompacts, which like the Chevrolet Sonic are slightly bigger, now make up 5.9 percent of overall vehicle sales, according to Edmunds.com. That is compared with 3.1 percent in 2007.
For the automakers, smaller cars have become a profitable niche in an area where they have often been outdone against foreign competition.
''There was skepticism in general that Detroit could not make small cars and compete with the Japanese market, but we're over that,'' Ms. Krebs said.
Beyond better fuel economy and cost savings, the styling and technology are helping change the perception of cars like the Spark, known as ''penalty boxes'' in the 1980s, implying that the driver was being punished for not affording a larger car. In the 1980s and '90s, junkyards across America quickly became littered with duds like the Yugo GV, Daihatsu Charade and Geo Metro.
''You were basically buying these slow, underpowered vehicles with the only advantage being that they were cheap,'' Mr. Lilienthal said.
The Spark and its competitors, including the best-selling Nissan Versa subcompact and No. 2 Kia Soul -- which are slightly bigger and have four doors but cost about the same -- come with features that were never included in subcompact cars, from air conditioning and power locks to Bluetooth and smartphone navigation.
Now, buyers ask themselves, ''Do I need to buy a full-size sedan, or can I get away with a Nissan Versa?'' Mr. Lilienthal said.
Automakers have also taken a different tack in marketing the cars, promoting them as fun to drive and easy to maneuver around the city, as well as the cost advantage.
Brad Johnson, a minister from Thousand Oaks, Calif., paid in the mid-$12,000s for a Spark in June, and found he can pick up groceries, hang up his dry cleaning and park downtown while getting about 35 miles to the gallon.
At 53, Mr. Johnson is not the first-time car buyer Chevrolet is aiming for, but he was attracted to the car's styling nonetheless.
''It felt a little young,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''but it fit my personality.''
The Spark's early success makes the case for a new Detroit market staked on smaller, fuel-efficient cars, analysts said.
''You can make a good quality minicar now whereas before I don't think U.S. consumers would have accepted a car that's sold in India or Thailand,'' said Terry Rhadigan, G.M.'s executive director for product and technology communications.
It's also less risky for automakers like G.M. to introduce smaller cars in America as they become adept at adjusting the models that are popular in other regions of the world, said Joseph Spak, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.
But Mr. Spak said he was skeptical that demand from American consumers for subcompact and mini models had much room to grow as larger vehicles become more fuel-efficient. Despite the interest in small cars, it is trucks and utility vehicles that are fueling Detroit's resurgence.
''Over the years, you've definitely seen some consumers move down to smaller cars,'' he said, ''but the challenge for subcompacts is that you're seeing the fuel economy of other segments increasing.''
Whether more manufacturers will produce four-door minicars to compete with the Spark is unclear. Smaller cars mean smaller profit margins, but the Spark is made in Korea and can compete on price. Analysts say it's not clear if small cars can be made profitably in the United States, though G.M. is experimenting with the Chevrolet Sonic, its first United States-produced subcompact, made in Orion Township, Mich.
G.M.'s crosstown rivals say that their small cars are selling quickly, too. Ford Motor, whose sales in the segment dropped to a low in 2009, reported last month that its small car sales were the best in 13 years.
Chrysler's year-old Dodge Dart compact car was a bright spot in the automaker's July sales, with sales up eightfold to 6,064.
With a quarter of buyers under 35, the Spark is crucial to attracting younger drivers who are critical to G.M.'s longevity, analysts said. About 60 percent of Spark buyers are new to the Chevrolet brand.
''The under-35's is a huge population that everybody wants to get,'' Ms. Krebs said. ''Once you get them, you have an opportunity to keep them.''
Marketing to this group meant that Chevrolet avoided television spots in favor of social media networks and events popular with the millennial generation.
''We're getting out where they're having fun,'' Ms. Landy said. ''We know a lot of these younger buyers are not watching TV.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Aug. 17 about the growing popularity of subcompact cars among American consumers misstated some features of one such car, the Chevrolet Spark. Power windows and air-conditioning are standard in the Spark; it is not the case that the windows are hand-crank and that air-conditioning is optional.

HEADLINE: Hiring in China by JPMorgan Under Scrutiny

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG, BEN PROTESS and DAVID BARBOZA


HIGHLIGHT: Authorities have opened a bribery investigation into whether JPMorgan Chase hired the children of powerful Chinese officials to help the bank win lucrative business in the booming nation. 

 BODY:
Federal authorities have opened a bribery investigation into whether JPMorgan Chase hired the children of powerful Chinese officials to help the bank win lucrative business in the booming nation, according to a confidential United States government document.
In one instance, the bank hired the son of a former Chinese banking regulator who is now the chairman of the China Everbright Group, a state-controlled financial conglomerate, according to the document, which was reviewed by The New York Times, as well as public records. After the chairman's son came on board, JPMorgan secured multiple coveted assignments from the Chinese conglomerate, including advising a subsidiary of the company on a stock offering, records show.
The Hong Kong office of JPMorgan also hired the daughter of a Chinese railway official. That official was later detained on accusations of doling out government contracts in exchange for cash bribes, the government document and public records show.
The former official's daughter came to JPMorgan at an opportune time for the New York-based bank: The China Railway Group, a state-controlled construction company that builds railways for the Chinese government, was in the process of selecting JPMorgan to advise on its plans to become a public company, a common move in China for businesses affiliated with the government. With JPMorgan's help, China Railway raised more than $5 billion when it went public in 2007. 
The focus of the civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission's antibribery unit has not been previously reported. JPMorgan - which has had a number of run-ins lately with regulators, including one over a multibillion-dollar trading loss last year - made an oblique reference to the inquiry in its quarterly filing this month. The filing stated that the S.E.C. had sought information about JPMorgan's "employment of certain former employees in Hong Kong and its business relationships with certain clients."
In May, according to a copy of the confidential government document, the S.E.C.'s antibribery unit requested from JPMorgan a battery of records about Tang Xiaoning. He is the son of Tang Shuangning, who since 2007 has been chairman of the China Everbright Group. Before that, the elder Mr. Tang was the vice chairman of China's top banking regulator.
The agency also inquired about JPMorgan's hiring of Zhang Xixi, the daughter of the railway official. Among other information, the S.E.C. sought "documents sufficient to identify all persons involved in the decision to hire" her.
The government document and public records do not definitively link JPMorgan's hiring practices to its ability to win business, nor do they suggest that the employees were unqualified. Furthermore, the records do not indicate that the employees helped JPMorgan secure business. The bank has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
Yet the S.E.C.'s request outlined in the confidential document hints at a broader hiring strategy at JPMorgan's Chinese offices. Authorities suspect that JPMorgan routinely hired young associates who hailed from well-connected Chinese families that ultimately offered the bank business. Beyond the daughter of the railway official, the S.E.C. document inquired about "all JPMorgan employees who performed work for or on behalf of the Ministry of Railways" over the last six-plus years.
A spokesman for JPMorgan said, "We publicly disclosed this matter in our 10-Q filing last week, and are fully cooperating with regulators."
The Ministry of Railways, which has since been restructured into various agencies, and the China Everbright Group did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the S.E.C. declined to comment.
Attempts over the weekend to reach Ms. Zhang and Tang Xiaoning, both of whom have left JPMorgan, were unsuccessful.
Western companies have been aggressive in trying to snag a share of riches in China's fast-growing economy in recent years. Some have come under fire over their business practices there, including GlaxoSmithKline, whose employees are said by Chinese officials to have confessed to bribing doctors to increase pharmaceutical sales.
Global companies also routinely hire the sons and daughters of leading Chinese politicians. What is unusual about JPMorgan is that it hired the children of officials of state-controlled companies.
It is even less common for American authorities to scrutinize such practices. Only a handful of Wall Street employees have ever faced bribery accusations, including a former Morgan Stanley executive in China who pleaded guilty to criminal charges in 2012, admitting to "an effort to enrich himself and a Chinese government official."
In recent years, the S.E.C. and the Justice Department have each stepped up their enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a 1977 federal law that essentially bans United States companies from giving "anything of value" to a foreign official to win "an improper advantage" in retaining business.
The S.E.C. created its own corrupt practices unit, which since 2010 has filed about 40 cases against companies like Tyco and Ralph Lauren. Over that same period, the Justice Department has leveled charges in more than 60 cases.
Legal experts note that there is nothing inherently illicit about hiring well-connected people. To run afoul of the law, a company must act with "corrupt" intent, or with the expectation of offering a job in exchange for government business.
"While the hire of a son or daughter itself is not illegal, red flags would be raised if the person hired was not qualified for the position, or, for example, if a firm never received business before and then lo and behold, the hire brought in business," said Michael Koehler, an expert on the corrupt practices act who is an assistant professor at the Southern Illinois University School of Law.
The inquiry into JPMorgan comes when the bank is already the focus of investigations in the United States by at least eight federal agencies, a state regulator and two foreign nations. Many of the cases, including a civil and criminal investigation in California, involve JPMorgan's financial-crisis-era mortgage business.
The multitude of cases has led some lawmakers to question whether JPMorgan, which has operations in more than 60 countries, is too big to manage.
The potential perils of JPMorgan's size also came to light with a multibillion-dollar trading blowup last year that came to be known as the "London Whale." The trading losses, stemming from a bad bet on the exotic financial instruments known as derivatives, prompted Congressional hearings and wide-ranging investigations.
On Wednesday, federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced criminal charges against two of the bank's former traders in London, accusing them of masking the size of the $6 billion loss.
The S.E.C., conducting a parallel investigation, is seeking to extract a rare admission of wrongdoing from the bank related to the losses. A settlement, which could come as soon as this fall, will also include a hefty fine, according to people briefed on the matter.
The agency's bribery inquiry could pose an even steeper challenge to JPMorgan. Although banks are prone to the occasional trading blunder - JPMorgan produced record quarterly profits despite the losses in London last year - a corruption inquiry could leave a more lasting mark on its reputation. It might also spur the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation.
The families of the ruling elite in China see great value in finding work at Wall Street banks. While the jobs often pay token sums, finding such work bolsters the résumés of aspiring financiers and lends credibility in the Chinese business world.
In the case of Mr. Tang, the S.E.C. is seeking his salary, "employment file" and "communications" he has had with JPMorgan since he left in December 2012. The agency is also requesting documents that "identify all persons involved in the decision to hire" Mr. Tang, who is believed to have joined the bank in 2010.
The S.E.C.'s document appears to be looking for connections between his hiring and business JPMorgan won from the China Everbright Group and its banking subsidiary. In its confidential request, the S.E.C. asked the bank to "identify and produce all contracts or agreements between JPMorgan and China Everbright."
Before hiring Mr. Tang, JPMorgan appeared to do little if any business with China Everbright, based on a review of securities filings and news reports. Since then, though, China Everbright has emerged as one of its prized Asian clients. In 2011, its banking subsidiary hired JPMorgan as one of 12 financial advisers on its decision to become a public company. Amid global economic turmoil and questions about China's banking system, that deal was delayed.
Yet in 2012, JPMorgan was the only bank hired to advise China Everbright International, a subsidiary focused on alternative energy businesses, on a $162 million sale of shares, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ, a research service. JPMorgan, according to securities filings, owns a stake in the subsidiary.
The same year, JPMorgan guided China Everbright through its role in what was, according to Dealogic, the largest-ever private equity deal in China. The deal involved reshaping Focus Media, a digital advertising firm, into a private company owned, in part, by China Everbright.
The S.E.C. is investigating similar aspects of JPMorgan's hiring of Ms. Zhang, whose father is Zhang Shuguang, former deputy chief engineer of China's railway ministry. Before joining JPMorgan, Ms. Zhang attended Stanford University, according to her LinkedIn and Facebook pages.
In addition to requesting her employment file and compensation earned from JPMorgan, the S.E.C. is asking the bank to turn over "all contracts or agreements between JPMorgan and the Ministry of Railways of the People's Republic of China."
The Ministry of Railways has never hired JPMorgan directly, securities filings and news reports suggest. But those records indicate that the China Railway Group, the construction company whose largest customer is thought to be the Chinese government, hired JPMorgan to take it public in 2007. Ms. Zhang was hired around this time.
About four years later, when Ms. Zhang was an associate at the bank, JPMorgan won out again. This time, according to media reports, the operator of a high-speed railway from Beijing to Shanghai picked the bank to steer it through its own public offering. That deal fell apart after a 2011 train collision killed 40 people and injured hundreds. The incident - just a month after the Chinese government announced the project - spotlighted the dangers of corruption in China's railway system.
The railway minister at the time, Liu Zhijun, has since received a suspended death sentence for accepting bribes in exchange for government rail contracts over a 25-year period, according to reports. Ms. Zhang's father, the former deputy chief engineer, was also detained on suspicion of corruption, according to China's official state-run news agency. It is unclear whether that case is still pending.
The S.E.C., in its request to JPMorgan, questioned whether the bank had "investigated the reported arrest."

HEADLINE: Crushed by the Cost of Child Care

BYLINE: ALISSA QUART


HIGHLIGHT: Day care has become prohibitively expensive not just for the working poor, but for the middle class and upper middle class as well. 

 BODY:
The difficulty of obtaining good, affordable day care is well known as a problem afflicting the working poor. But increasingly, middle- and upper-middle-class parents are finding that day care is hard to find or access and that even when it is available it is startlingly costly. Among the mothers I spoke to, one sent her daughter to a day care proprietor where the owner secretly had another woman mind all eight babies all day long; another signed up for a slot at a local day care when she was newly pregnant. Her daughter is now 5, and she is still on the wait list. 
The cost and the scarcity of day care has helped create what the sociologist Joya Misra calls "the motherhood penalty." While women without children are closer to pay equity with men, women with children are lagging behind because they find that working doesn't always make sense after considering the cost of child care. When women earn less than their partners, they are more likely to drop out of the work force, and if they do so for two years or more, they may not be able to get back in at anything approaching their prior job or earnings. The cost of taking care of one's children outside the home is now so high that many women cannot be assured of both working and making a decent income after taxes and child care costs.
Professor Misra, who teaches sociology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has analyzed data from thousands of parents from different social classes. One study of middle-class academic parents was based on hundreds of surveys and focus group interviews and 17 one-on-one interviews. Many talked about the shock of day care costs, which can eat up 30 percent of one income in a two-salary couple, Professor Misra says.In 35 states and D.C., even the cost of center-based day care (let alone a nanny) is higher than the cost of a year of a public college. More anecdotally, day care costs for middle-class New Yorkers can easily equal from $25,000 to $30,000 per child. In New York, child care is the single greatest expense among low-income families in the city, surpassing both food and housing.
Child care is a towering expense for parents like Carla Bellamy, a professor of anthropology at Baruch College in Manhattan who holds a Ph.D. from Columbia, earns $74,000 a year and lives with her husband and their two children, a newborn and a 4-year-old. Her husband is a composer and the executive director of a music organization. Only 9 percent of women in the work force make $75,000 or more, so Professor Bellamy is relatively privileged.
But even with a combined household income of $110,000, she and her husband struggle to afford day care. (It was a story I heard echoed when I spoke with other female professors, who sometimes took sick days even when they were healthy so they could stay home and not have to pay for baby sitters.) "Our entire disposable income goes to child care," Professor Bellamy, 41, says. "It's not a tragic story, but is tiring and tiresome. I have a career, I work really hard, and yet I get no break."
Professor Bellamy fleetingly thought about spending her summer vacation working at a restaurant as a waitress or a host, but that's the time that academics typically use to do the writing and research that ultimately helps them get tenure - or not.
And it's not just New York City. Ainsley Stapleton, 36, an accountant based in Arlington, Va., describes herself as middle class. But with three children, all of whom are in preschool or day care, she calculates that she spends 87.6 percent of her take-home pay on day care.
"It makes me want to cry a little," Ms. Stapleton said by phone from her office. In the past, she said, she and her husband have bounced around the question of whether "he should quit or I should, but both of us enjoy working."
Jane Dimyan-Ehrenfeld, 37, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., who works for the federal government and who is the mother of two, struggled since she was first pregnant to get her first child into quality day care near her home. "The competition is unbelievable," she says. So she sent her older child to a local home day care. After nearly three years, she says, she discovered that the proprietor at the home day care who was supposed to be taking care of her infant daughter was instead selling herbal supplements all day upstairs, and on one occasion, on the road, leaving her daughter and seven other children to be cared for by one aide, in a home with two giant snakes and attack dogs supposedly kept in a very different part of the house.
Ms. Dimyan-Ehrenfeld says that she checked the center's references before she enrolled her daughter and that the owner seemed very warm. She discovered the truth when the one aide who had been caring for the children was fired and told the parents what had been going on at the home day care center. Startled by both the undersupervision and the fact that the exotic animals weren't kept away from the children, she immediately pulled her daughter from the center. Her younger child now has a nanny and her older child is in a private preschool. That has meant, however, that she earns 50 cents, after paying for all that, in each biweekly pay period. "And I am a lawyer!" she exclaims.
Even for experts like Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, 44, of Kirkland, Wash., a founder of a nonprofit group centered on these issues, MomsRising, obtaining day care isn't easy. Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner had a "heck of a time" getting her children off years-long waiting lists for local day care centers and preschools. "I applied early, and my daughter only got in when she was 3," Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner says. "Access is a problem across the socioeconomic spectrum."
That includes parents like Carly Fox, an educator and organizer for a legal services organization who is a single mother of a 3-year-old and earns a little too much at $42,000 to be eligible for a government subsidy for day care. She cobbles together child care by working at home sometimes and by relying on her mother, her father, a cousin, a neighborhood sitter and time swaps with other parents.
For Yvette Nunez in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, the expense of day care is even more challenging. Ms. Nunez is raising her three children on her own, yet her former employer, a supermarket, required her to work on weekends. That increased her day care bill by $75 a week. Even with subsidies, she was paying out almost of all of what she was earning from her 18-hour-a-week job. She finally quit to take care of her children. She is now unemployed, she told me as her 2-year-old wailed in the background. She really wants to get back to work but for now simply cannot afford to do so. Ms. Nunez lives on government assistance and a small amount of child support. For many parents, the promise of prekindergarten programs, proposed earlier this year by President Obama, is a start. But it's not going to stanch the financial desperation that takes hold in many families before their children are 5 and able to go to school.
"As we have resisted institutionalizing the day care system in this country, ordinary workers on their own have created D.I.Y. child-care networks," says Kathleen Gerson, a sociologist at New York University who is now studying these networks in Silicon Valley. "What is our strange commitment to seeing care as a purely private individual act rather than one embedded in the larger community?" she asked.
We see day care as a private responsibility. Part of the problem is that we sometimes have a problem with the idea of "day care" itself. Professor Gerson and other sociologists saw something I had seen as well among my middle class acquaintances: a discomfort with center-based day care and even the term "day care," preferring terms like "educational enrichment" and, yes, preschool. Across the world, though, people count on the availability of day care and see it as a collective good: Americans don't tend to do so as readily. More access to quality early childhood care would help. But those solutions go only part of the way. The most radical solution of all is the most obvious: we need high-quality, universal, subsidized day care. And we should not be ashamed to ask for it.

TESTED 2013 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid
WHAT IS IT? A Lincoln-branded upscale hybrid sedan with its Ford roots showing.
HOW MUCH? $36,820 base, $42,415 as tested. The price is the same as an equivalent nonhybrid MKZ.
WHAT MAKES IT RUN? A 141-horsepower 2-liter 4-cylinder, with an 88-kilowatt electric motor and a 1.4-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery for 188 net horsepower; continuously variable transmission.
IS IT THIRSTY? The E.P.A. rating is 45 m.p.g. all around -- in the city, on the highway and combined. 
ALTERNATIVES Lexus ES 300h, Ford Fusion Hybrid.
Part of the fun of a hybrid car is listening for the gasoline engine to start and analyzing how smoothly it makes the transition from electric to gas. Unless you floor the accelerator, the MKZ Hybrid is so quiet it's hard to tell what's moving you forward.
With active noise control, which sends sound-canceling frequencies through the infotainment system, the car errs on the side of isolation: if engagement with the road is your goal, this isn't your ride. Rather, the appeal is the combination of an impressive mileage rating and an understated wood-and-leather ambience.
Ford calls the MKZ Hybrid ''America's most fuel-efficient luxury sedan.'' Consumers are showing an active interest in upscale gas sippers, a category that never existed in the past.
This is the second iteration of the MKZ Hybrid, which shares a powertrain with the Ford Fusion Hybrid. Both cars were extensively reworked for 2013, with striking -- but quite different -- new designs. The MKZ's extroverted styling is one of the best things about it. The winged grille treatment recalls a subtler form on the streamlined Stout Scarab of the 1930s.
The lithium-ion battery replaces the nickel-metal-hydride pack in the first version of the MKZ Hybrid. The push-button shifter would have been more daunting if I didn't own a 1963 Dodge Dart convertible, which offers an early space age version of this amenity.
In 277 miles of mostly in-town driving, I achieved an underwhelming 33.6 m.p.g. -- far below the E.P.A. rating. The car does have some displays aimed at encouraging economical motoring.
In July, Ford announced software updates for its hybrids, including changes to the air-conditioner and electric fan, and the ability to cruise to 85 m.p.h. in electric mode, instead of 62. The upgrades, which do not affect the 2013 E.P.A. ratings but should help drivers attain better real-world numbers, will be made to Fusion, MKZ and C-Max hybrids at dealerships.
The front-drive MKZ Hybrid -- all-wheel drive is reserved for conventional powertrains -- provides neither an exciting driving experience nor a disappointing one. The car won't impress drivers who obsess over performance, but the quiet ride and comfortable seats are a boon for long-distance travel. Rear legroom could be better, but the trunk is quite roomy despite a slight intrusion of the battery pack.
This is a car for tech lovers, but they're not likely to applaud all of its features. The challenges posed by Ford's infotainment systems are well documented by now, and I had some issues with this car's version, called MyLincoln Touch. Flat-panel controls, with a gimmicky virtual slider in place of a volume knob, were hard to use.
Nor did the Sync voice commands play nice. When I asked for the Beatles, the audio system played the group Beach House. A request to play the next song was interpreted as a request for Doug Sahm, the Tex-Mex musician.
One big question for potential buyers is whether to buy a Fusion Hybrid instead of this Lincoln. The Ford starts at $27,995, so there's a price gap of nearly $9,000. Of course, the MKZ comes loaded with features like heated leather seats that cost extra on the Fusion. Still, my Lincoln test car came with $5,595 in options.
You could choose a standard MKZ for the same price as the hybrid, but you'd be opting for a combined 26 m.p.g. with the 4-cylinder model, or 22 m.p.g. with the V-6.
For some shoppers, the distinctive styling is a plus, and the car has some exclusivity: you won't see hordes of them coming and going. But if you can live without that and the fancier interior, the Ford may appeal. The Fusion Hybrid is 200 pounds lighter and has a slightly better E.P.A. rating: 47 m.p.g. all around. But the numbers can change: Ford said on Thursday it would drop the 2013 C-Max Hybrid's combined rating to 43 m.p.g., from 47.

HEADLINE: War On The Border

BYLINE: By TODD MILLER. 
The author of the forthcoming book ''Border Patrol Nation: Dispatches From the Front Lines of Homeland Security.''

 BODY:
THREE generations of Loews have worked the family's 63 acres in Amado, Ariz. In the last 20 years, the Loew family harvested thousands of pounds of onions, garlic and pumpkins without incident. So Stewart Loew, 44, who was born and raised on the farm, was surprised when he went to irrigate his fields one night and found himself surrounded by federal agents.
Pointing to the fires about 200 feet away that Mr. Loew lit to keep warm while he irrigated his fields, one of the agents slogged out of the ankle deep water in the irrigation ditch and asked Mr. Loew what he was doing.
''I'm irrigating, dude,'' said Mr. Loew, who was in his pajamas. ''What are you doing?'' 
''Don't 'dude' me, I'm a federal officer,'' the Border Patrol agent said, and demanded Mr. Loew's identification.
Since Mr. Loew did not carry his wallet in his pajama pocket, the agents followed him into his house; a local police officer, who knew the Loew family, had already arrived, vouched for Mr. Loew's identity and assured the federal agents that Mr. Loew posed no threat to the homeland or national security, and the agents left without comment or apology.
This kind of brush with law enforcement would have been unthinkable to previous generations of farmers here. But these run-ins have become increasingly common in the rugged, hilly desert stretch along the southern borderlands where, in the post-9/11 world, everyone -- even farmers in pajamas -- is a potential threat.
The United States-Mexico border has become a war zone. It is also a transfer station for sophisticated American military technology and weapons. As our country's foreign wars have begun to wind down, defense contractors look here, on the southern border, to make money.
Lately it has become entirely normal to look up into the Arizona sky and to see Blackhawk helicopters and fixed-wing jets flying by. On a clear day, you can sometimes hear Predator B drones buzzing over the Sonoran border. These drones are equipped with the same kind of ''man-hunting'' Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (Vader) that flew over the Dashti Margo desert region in Afghanistan.
The Border Patrol is part of Customs and Border Protection, now the federal government's largest law-enforcement agency. Its presence is a constant factor not only in the lives of Stewart Loew and his neighbors, but also in the lives of those who live in places like San Diego, El Paso, Brownsville, Tex., and other big cities along the southern border that have sizable Latino populations.
The Border Patrol, however, concerns itself far less with counterterrorism than with the agency's traditional tasks of immigration and drug enforcement. This creates an uneasy mixture of missions. And it results in the deployment of an expensive military apparatus to police and capture immigrants who cross the border in the hopes of finding jobs as maids, janitors or day laborers.
In 2012, a majority of the more than 364,000 people arrested by Border Patrol agents nationwide were migrant workers crossing the border. Agents did not capture or arrest a single international terrorist.
But they have disrupted the lives of tens of thousands of people like Stewart Loew who live and work near the border. There's a point on Interstate 19, two miles from the Loews' farm, that buzzes with what borderland residents call the ''men in green,'' who stop and interrogate everyone who drives past. Border Patrol vehicles scan the off-road areas smugglers and migrants use to circumvent official checkpoints. A mobile control tower with a sophisticated surveillance system mounted on its cabin is visible near the Loews' farm.
The Department of Homeland Security, which includes Customs and Border Protection, plans to invest billions more in borderland surveillance towers, drones and helicopters if the House adopts the immigration reform bill that the Senate passed in June. Even if it doesn't pass, there is more than $1 billion in the federal budget for surveillance towers that will likely be clustered around the Arizona desert lands, near Mr. Loew's farm, where most undocumented migrants cross the border.
The Republican senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Hoeven of North Dakota added a proposal to the immigration bill that would provide about $40 billion in financing for extra agents and 700 miles of fencing along the United States' southern boundary, which Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, noted would become ''the most militarized border since the fall of the Berlin Wall.'' Indeed, if the Senate's bill, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act, passes in the House, the Border Patrol will swell to 40,000 agents, making it the size of a small army.
In recent years, we have built up our boundary and immigration policing apparatus with great speed. Founded in 1924, the Border Patrol deployed just over 4,000 agents in 1993. In only 20 years the agency's ranks have more than quintupled, and if the reform passes it will increase its size tenfold.
The Border Patrol buildup in the aftermath of 9/11 was unparalleled. In the 10-year period following 9/11, the United States spent a staggering $90 billion on border enforcement.
In 2012, the Migration Policy Institute reported that immigration and border enforcement spending totaled almost $18 billion. That is 24 percent more than the $14.4 billion combined budgets in the last fiscal year of the F.B.I., the Secret Service, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Add the billions anticipated in the Senate bill, and you have what the trade publication Homeland Security Today calls a ''treasure trove'' for contractors in the border security industry.
Projected as an approximately $19 billion industry in 2013, defense contractors seem, in the words of one representative from a small surveillance technology company hoping to jump into the border security market, to be ''bringing the battlefield to the border.''
In 1999, the anthropologist Josiah Heyman wrote that the Southwest was becoming a ''militarized border society, where more and more people either work for the watchers, or are watched by the state.''
There is nowhere else in the country with such extensive and concentrated surveillance technology; nor is there any part of the United States in which people are as clearly divided between the police and the policed.
And the militarized security zone has begun to creep beyond the southern border and to affect those who live near the northern border in places like Spokane, Wash., Detroit and Erie, Pa., where the Border Patrol has significantly increased its ranks.
IN the border zone -- 100 miles from the boundary into the interior -- the Border Patrol's authority extends beyond that of other law enforcement agencies. For example, agents have the authority to conduct routine searches at the border even in the absence of reasonable suspicion, probable cause or a warrant.
''The problem with giving the largest federal law enforcement agency, and one that operates with few if any accountability mechanisms, is that it is a recipe for civil liberties abuses, and seriously risks further erosion of Fourth Amendment rights,'' says James Duff Lyall, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona. Mr. Lyall notes that the areas involved constitute a sizable portion of the country; if you consider land and coastal borders, this 100-mile zone encompasses approximately two-thirds of the United States population.
Agents that operate in the 100-mile zone now regularly board buses and trains and ask passengers for identification. They have -- and use -- the authority to further question anyone who raises suspicions, especially people who appear to be from another country.
In 2007, for example, a Border Patrol agent in Syracuse, N.Y., asked Silvio Torres-Saillant, a professor of English at Syracuse University, to produce his documents. When Mr. Torres-Saillant, a United States citizen of Hispanic descent, gave the agent his university identification, the agent demanded additional documents. At the Border Patrol's Rochester, N.Y., station, 2,743 people were arrested on buses, trains and in stations from 2006 to 2009.
Border Patrol agents record the skin complexion of the people they arrest, and most of those arrested were of ''medium'' complexion and from Latin America, according to a 2011 report, ''Justice Derailed: What Raids on New York's Trains and Buses Reveal About Border Patrol's Interior Enforcement Practices,'' by the New York University School of Law and the New York Civil Liberties Union.
In a much-publicized incident, Border Patrol agents stopped Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, 125 miles south of the border, in New York. When Mr. Leahy asked what authority the agent had to detain him, the agent pointed to his gun and said, ''That's all the authority I need.''
The Immigration and Nationality Act gives Border Patrol agents even greater authority when they operate within 25 miles of the international border. Here agents ''have access to private lands, but not dwellings, for the purpose of patrolling the border to prevent the illegal entry of aliens into the United States.''
Mr. Loew says agents don't always comply with the 25-mile exemptions; he points out that his farm in Amado is 30 miles from the border, and that that did not stop agents from entering his property or from surrounding him while he prepared to irrigate his fields.
Three years after Mr. Loew's brush with federal agents, Border Patrol agents held his 16-year-old son at gunpoint after they mistook the minivan he was driving for another one. Mr. Loew says he wonders if the agents were veterans, since so many Border Patrol recruits seem to be ex-military men; in fact, almost one-third of all agents have served in Iraq or Afghanistan. It's no wonder that more and more people in the 100-mile zone from across the political spectrum view the Border Patrol as an occupying army.
If immigration reform passes, it will mark another milestone in a transformation that has already resulted in the creation of a war-zone-like area in which agents enjoy special powers to chase down, question and detain people.
Two oversight offices within the Department of Homeland Security have already received hundreds of complaints of rights violations, including beatings and Taser shootings, at the border. In the last three years, Border Patrol agents have killed at least 15 people along the Southwest border. Whether or not the immigration bill passes, the militarization of the border and the disturbance it causes people like Stewart Loew suggest it is time to look seriously into how we might better police the agencies that police the border.

HEADLINE: 'Bodies on the Border' By Marc Silver

BYLINE: By MARC SILVER. 
Marc Silver is a documentary filmmaker based in London. His first feature-length film, ''Who Is Dayani Cristal?'' made its premiere at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Cinematography Award for World Cinema (Documentary). It will open theatrically later this year. This video is part of a series by independent filmmakers who have received major support from the Britdoc Foundation and the Ford Foundation and additional support from the nonprofit Sundance Institute.

 BODY:
This summer, as discussions have advanced around a comprehensive immigration reform bill, I traveled to Arizona to film some people who have a unique perspective on border security. I followed Dr. Bruce Anderson, a forensic anthropologist with the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner, who has worked to identify the remains of some 2,200 people found dead in the Arizona desert since 1990 -- undocumented migrants who attempted to cross illicitly from Central America and Mexico into the United States. And I followed Robin Reineke, a University of Arizona doctoral student in anthropology who founded the Missing Migrant Project, a nongovernmental organization that helps families look for their missing relatives. 
My goal was to better understand the impact that President Obama's and Congress's proposed security measures might have on migrant deaths along the border. I've been exploring this issue for the last four years while making a feature-length documentary, ''Who Is Dayani Cristal?'' (That film follows the discovery, identification and repatriation of a migrant found dead under a cicada tree 20 minutes south of Tucson.)
There has been a dramatic increase in such deaths since 2000. Over that time, particularly after Sept. 11, 2001, the government has added thousands of guards and constructed fences along the border. This policy has had a grim consequence: since most remaining gaps in the border are in remote and harsh terrain, migrants now attempt increasingly dangerous routes into the United States.
Some may argue that the latest proposals for tighter border security could save lives -- by flooding the border with guards, cameras and drones that could spot and help intercept migrants in dangerous areas. Yet recent history shows that even when border security is tightened, people will still find a way to cross -- as long as there is a demand for low-wage jobs. Even as fewer people are believed to be crossing the border illegally, the number of migrant deaths has remained high (the remains of at least 116 people have been found this year in Arizona), and a greater proportion is likely dying.
As a British filmmaker, I don't perceive this as a uniquely American issue, even if the politics are local. Similar migrant deaths have recently resulted from capsized boats in the Mediterranean Sea, filled with migrants from Africa and the Middle East, and in the seas north of Australia. Around the globe, it's clear that economic disparity, political instability and harsh immigration policies are a combustible mix -- one that plays out tragically along national borders.

HEADLINE: When Taking Sides Isn't Easy

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
CHANGE IS hard. There is an economic recession, let's say, and you have to give up Caribbean vacations, day spas and decent wines. Or there is a revolution, and you have to give up your royal title and wealth, leave the country and work as a servant, setting the table (such tacky china!) and polishing the boots of the Parisian bourgeoisie.
The Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey brings us just such a fantasy of displaced Russian nobility, ''Tovarich,'' in a sometimes thrilling, frequently elating and consistently complex new production. Hearing the play's premise, it's easy to think ''European screwball comedy,'' and ''Tovarich'' is that -- it was made into a 1937 Hollywood film with Charles Boyer and Claudette Colbert -- but it's a great deal more. And to its authors' credit, it is not obvious whose side we are supposed to take: that of the seemingly noble Bolsheviks who have overthrown Russia's titled 1 percent, or the charming young Russian prince and grand duchess who find themselves stealing artichokes for dinner and cutting up chemises to make handkerchiefs. 
In this production, it helps the aristocracy's side that Jon Barker, as Prince Mikail Alexandrovitch Ouratieff (butler name: Michel), and Carly Street, as Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna (housemaid name: Tina), are supremely lovable. Maybe the message is something about how each of us deals with adversity. As Tatiana says, with a nod to ''Twelfth Night,'' ''Resourcefulness has been thrust upon us.''
To the credit of many -- particularly Bonnie J. Monte, who has directed four very different scenes with royally confident versatility -- everyone here is lovable, with the semi-exception of Commissar Gorotchenko (Anthony Cochrane), who has just discovered that Communism and the oil business can be friends.
Charles Dupont (Matt Sullivan) and his wife, Fernande (Alison Weller), are a lovely upper-middle-class couple whose classified ad Mikail and Tatiana answer, bringing along a glowing letter of recommendation (from themselves). Mr. Sullivan's finest moments are when he is struggling to stifle his lust for the new maid.
The Duponts' grown children, Georges (Seamus Mulcahy) and Hélène (Rachael Fox), are brats when we first meet them. But they have the common sense to become entranced by the new arrivals, for both their nonservantlike skills and their sexiness, and soon we love the children, too. A lot of crushing is going on chez Dupont.
If there were an award for most fabulous scene, it would go to the one in which Michel volunteers some fencing advice to young Georges and then dazzles everyone in a demonstration that would have made Errol Flynn envious. Yes, Rick Sordelet, the company's acclaimed fight director, deserves major credit, but the seductiveness is all Mr. Barker's.
The second-best moment is the realization by the Duponts' white-haired Russian guest, Madame Van Hemert (Mary Dierson), as ''the maid'' enters the room. Although Tina-Tatiana is practically carrying a feather duster, Madame Van Hemert falls to her knees and kisses her hand.
I don't know much about Jacques Deval, who wrote the original 1933 French play, but Robert E. Sherwood, who did the 1935 English adaptation, also wrote my favorite 1940s movie, ''The Best Years of Our Lives,'' which was another story of changing identities. (The World War II enlisted man is actually an affluent banker married to Myrna Loy. The brave officer can't get a postwar job in a drugstore.) Those same rich observations about 20th-century life, character and fortune are now on the stage in Madison.
Brittany Vasta's scenic design (Paris, 1925 and 1926) is both beautiful to look at and imaginative. It is especially satisfying to see the skylight in the Russians' cheap hotel room turn into a glamorous backdrop in the Duponts' formal parlor and finally into the windows of the servants' kitchen.
Paul Canada's period costume design is elegant. Has a grand duchess ever looked better in a French maid's uniform with a below-the-knee hemline? Steven Rosen's lighting design is lovely, but in the first scene it is almost too good. That atmospheric hotel room nearly put me to sleep.
Eliminating or rewriting great playwrights' words can be sacrilege, but a scene late in Act II, in which the newly christened Michel and Tina admire the view of a Russian Orthodox church from their new employers' window, could be an exception. Tina says, with a deep sigh, ''We can see Russia.'' It may take a few minutes to get the unspoken words ''from our house'' and the image of Tina Fey's Sarah Palin out of your head.
''Tovarich,'' by Jacques Deval, adapted by Robert E. Sherwood, is at the F. M. Kirby Shakespeare Theater, 36 Madison Avenue, Madison, through Aug. 25. Information: (973) 408-5600 or shakespearenj.org.

HEADLINE: Ruth Asawa Dies at 87; Artist Who Wove Wire

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Ruth Asawa, an artist who learned to draw in an internment camp for Japanese-Americans during World War II and later earned renown weaving wire into intricate, flowing, fanciful abstract sculptures, died on Aug. 6 at her home in San Francisco, where many of her works now dot the cityscape. She was 87.
Her daughter Aiko Cuneo confirmed the death.
Ms. Asawa had been shunted from one detention camp to another as a child before blossoming under the tutelage of the artists Buckminster Fuller, John Cage, Franz Kline and Josef Albers. Gaining notice in the art world while still a student, she soon began building a wider following with abstract wire sculptures that expressed both the craftsmanship she had learned from Mexican basket makers as well as her ambition to extend line drawings into a third dimension. Many of these were hanging mobiles. 
In 1968 she startled her admirers by creating her first representational work, a fountain in Ghirardelli Square on San Francisco's waterfront. It had two mermaids -- one nursing a ''merbaby'' -- frogs, turtles, splashing water and a recording of frogs croaking.
Lawrence Halprin, the distinguished landscape architect who designed the waterfront space, had planned to install an abstract fountain. But after a long, unexplained delay, the developer chose Ms. Asawa for the job. Her creation set off a freewheeling debate about aesthetics, feminism and public art. Mr. Halprin, who had been a fan of Ms. Asawa's abstractions, complained that the mermaids looked like a suburban lawn ornament.
Ms. Asawa countered with old-fashioned sentiment. ''For the old, it would bring back the fantasy of their childhood,'' she said, ''and for the young, it would give them something to remember when they grow old.''
By and large, San Franciscans loved it. Ms. Asawa went on to design other public fountains and became known in San Francisco as the ''fountain lady.'' For a work in a plaza near Union Square, she mobilized 200 schoolchildren to mold hundreds of images of the city in dough, which were then cast in iron.
The work became the locus of a dispute this summer with Apple Inc., which wanted to remove the sculpture to make way for a plaza adjacent to a store it is building. After a public outcry, the company and the city promised to protect the sculpture, but the final disposition of the piece remains unresolved.
Ms. Asawa's wire sculptures are in the collections of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art. In May, one of her pieces sold at auction at Christie's for $1.4 million, four times its appraised value.
After the M. H. de Young Museum in San Francisco opened a new building in 2005, it installed 15 of Ms. Asawa's most significant hanging wire sculptures at the base of its tower. As they drift with air currents, her large organic forms have been said to resemble a giant, eerie kelp forest.
Her work is inextricably linked to her life. ''Glimpses of my childhood'' inspired her, she once said. One memory, of sunlight pouring through a dragonfly's translucent wing, was transmuted into the crocheted wire sculptures for which she first became known. In 1958, The New York Times wrote of their ''gossamer lightness'' and the way ''the circular and oval shapes seem like magic lanterns, one within the other.''
Ms. Asawa said another influence came from riding on the back of horse-drawn farm equipment on the fruit and vegetable farms where her Japanese-American parents worked in California. She made patterns with her feet as they dragged on the ground.
''We made endless hourglass figures that I now see as the forms within forms in my crocheted wire sculptures,'' she said in an interview with The Contra Costa Times in 2006.
A third influence -- one she insisted was positive -- was being held in internment camps with her family during the war, a fate that befell 120,000 Japanese-Americans, rounded up by the federal government for fear that they might aid the enemy. Her family spent the first five months of detention in stables at the Santa Anita Park racetrack. It was there that three animators from the Walt Disney Studios taught her to draw.
''I hold no hostilities for what happened; I blame no one,'' she said in 1994. ''Sometimes good comes through adversity. I would not be who I am today had it not been for the internment, and I like who I am.''
Ruth Aiko Asawa was born on Jan. 24, 1926, in Norwalk, a Southern California farming town. Her third-grade teacher encouraged her artwork, and in 1939, her drawing of the Statue of Liberty took first prize in a school competition to represent what it means to be an American.
In 1942 F.B.I. agents seized her father and sent him to an internment camp in New Mexico. Ms. Asawa did not see him for six years. Two months later, she, her mother and her five siblings were taken to the racetrack. After five months, they were taken to a camp in Arkansas, where Ms. Asawa graduated from high school.
In 1943, a Quaker organization arranged for her to attend Milwaukee State Teachers College, now the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, to prepare to be an art teacher. She completed three years but was unable to earn her degree after being barred from a required student-teacher program because of her ethnicity.
Ms. Asawa then spent three years at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, a magnet for budding artists and renowned teachers. There she befriended the choreographer Merce Cunningham and studied painting with Albers, whose theories on color were immensely influential. While still a student of his, in 1948, she caught the attention of a reviewer for The Times, who observed that her work ''transformed Albers' color-shape experiments into personal fantasy.''
Ms. Asawa had started exploring wire as an artistic medium after a trip to Mexico in 1947, when she noticed looped wire baskets being used in the markets to sell eggs and produce.
''I was interested in it because of the economy of a line, making something in space, enclosing it without blocking it out,'' she explained. ''It's still transparent. I realized that if I was going to make these forms, which interlock and interweave, it can only be done with a line because a line can go anywhere.''
Ms. Asawa wore bandages to protect her hands when working with wire, but still suffered constant cuts. When young, her children were usually at her side while she worked.
Her husband of 59 years, Albert Lanier, an architect she met at Black Mountain, died in 2008. Their son Adam died in 2003. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Cuneo, she is survived by her sons, Xavier, Hudson and Paul Lanier; her daughter Addie Lanier; 10 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
Ms. Asawa supported arts education in San Francisco public schools, and in 2011, the one to which she was most devoted was renamed for her. For years Ms. Asawa maintained the grounds herself.
Her own educational experience came full circle in 1998, when the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, which had prevented her from graduating a half-century earlier when it was a teachers college, sought to present her with an honorary doctorate. Ms. Asawa asked that she be awarded the bachelor's degree instead.

HEADLINE: Co-Payments and Beyond

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In his Economic View column, ''When a Co-Pay Gets in the Way'' (Aug. 11), Sendhil Mullainathan argued for the elimination of co-payments for drugs with proven benefits for the recipients. I agree, but even more can be done to improve the odds that patients will always take their medications over the long term. 
In addition to the co-pay barrier, other factors can reduce adherence to medication. Receiving just one- or three-month supplies of chronic or maintenance mediations can cause such lapses. And the cost and inconvenience of an office visit, simply to arrange for a new annual prescription, can be burdensome as well. A patient may have to miss work just to have such an appointment.
Perhaps a longer supply of medication, along with the availability of a nurse for consultation by phone, could further drive long-term adherence to proven drugs.

To the Editor:
Co-payments for medications are only part of the problem. Last year, my health plan started charging $40 for any specialist and $200 for an emergency room visit, even with a premium of close to $800 a month. That adds to the stress of deciding when to go to specialists or the emergency room, even when it's medically necessary.
If a basic level of free health care were funded by all taxpayers, we could solve many problems and change the economic landscape of this country. We wouldn't have the stress of worrying about how to afford to stay alive -- and the nation's job creators would no longer have to subsidize employees' health care costs.

HEADLINE: Born To Ride

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK

 BODY:
ALBANY, Calif. -- Russell Baze, the ironman of thoroughbred racing -- Lou Gehrig on a saddle -- was about to ride in his 50,000th start, an astonishing milestone that by happenstance put him aboard an undistinguished filly. The horse, Finish Rich in Nyc, had not won in nearly a year. ''She's not the one I would have picked for the occasion,'' the jockey remarked dryly.
At 55, Baze is near the outside edge of even a durable rider's working life span. People credit this longevity to his avoidance of serious injury, which may seem an odd thing to say of a man who has broken his cervical spine, pelvis, tailbone and collarbone and suffered multiple compression fractures in his back and neck. But jockeys often sustain far worse, and Baze, having ''hit the ground'' well over 100 times, believes he has the benefit of an uncommonly resilient body and a conscientious guardian angel. 
His back was hurting that afternoon. So was his neck, the pain outmaneuvering the anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants he takes each day. Certain aches have dogged him for 35 years, and he receives periodic injections of cortisone to pacify the discomfort. These lingering afflictions are accepted by him as the necessary dues for a fulfilling career, for he says a life in horse racing has been worth every throb and spasm. ''If everybody was as happy with their job as I am with mine, it'd be a great world.''
It was a chilly Friday in winter at Golden Gate Fields, a down-on-its-luck racetrack perched on a marvelous nugget of real estate, a rocky outcropping that juts into the East Bay near San Francisco. But neither the view nor the horses are much of a draw these days. ''The area has just forgotten about us here,'' Joe Morris, who ran the place, wanly put it. Only a skeleton crew of fans was there. Tumbleweed could have blown through the grandstands.
Nevertheless, a little ceremony had been planned, and Baze, who is remarkably humble, was uncomfortable with the fuss. ''It's just another day at the office,'' he said dismissively with a shrug of his compact shoulders.
Think of it, though: 50,000 races, more than any other American jockey. The combined distance adds up to about 348,000 furlongs, or 43,500 miles, nearly twice the circumference of the earth. Just watching the wire-to-wire replays would require a nonstop marathon of 48 days.
Of course, winning races, not merely riding in them, is the more important thing, and Baze already held the American record in that too: 11,839, at the time.
He reached 12,000 on July 7 -- 2,470 more than the previous leader, the great Laffit Pincay Jr., who in 1999 surpassed the even-greater Bill Shoemaker. The accruing win total is attentively updated above the racetrack's tote board in huge black numerals on a yellow background, up there between the signs for Avión Tequila and Coors Light.
And yet who has heard of Russell Baze?
Avid horseplayers would recognize the name but otherwise America's winningest jockey is virtually unknown. This relative obscurity largely results from a career choice he made two decades ago, attempting, as so many people do, to find some happy medium between ambition and contentment. Baze rides almost exclusively in Northern California, where he is a decidedly local racetrack luminary -- ''Russell the Muscle'' -- particular to the region like the cable cars of the city and the vineyards of Napa.
There is a hierarchy within horse racing. At the top are places like Belmont in New York, Santa Anita near Los Angeles and Gulfstream near Miami. The purses are bigger, the mounts are better. San Francisco, for all its other charms, is a horse racing also-ran. It is the minor leagues.
And yet the minors can be a congenial place for a gifted jockey who likes to ride favorites and win and win and win. Nearly all the trainers at Golden Gate Fields want Russell Baze aboard their horses, if they can manage to get him.
On the day he was to ride No. 50,000, he was entered in six races. In the first five, the morning line had his horses at 1-1, 7-5, 2-1, 8-5 and 2-1: for Baze a typical rollout of extremely short odds. Among the field of plodders in the sixth, the mediocre filly Finish Rich in Nyc was actually the favorite at 7-5.
Baze's wife, Tami, had asked if he wanted her to be there and he said no. She usually gets up around 5 a.m. and fries him a strip of bacon or a cocktail weenie, which he follows with a few swallows of fruit punch. That and six or seven peanut M&M's are ordinarily all he eats until he sits down for a full dinner. ''It's a lot easier to stay thin when your livelihood depends on it,'' he said.
But Tami slept in that day, and Baze ate an Oreo instead, washing down the cookie and some vitamins with those restrained mouthfuls of punch. He then walked Pearl, the family dog, and left home in his 2009 Jaguar XK for the 45-minute drive to the track, taking a route that went past the San Francisco airport and over the Bay Bridge. He listened to talk radio and occasionally squeezed a tennis ball to loosen up the joints in his arthritic right hand.
Baze arrived at Golden Gate Fields at 6:30, sitting for a few moments in the small restaurant at the entrance to the stables and, along with friends, doing the Jumble in the newspaper. (''Sea the World'' was the scrambled answer.) He exercised some horses and sat in the whirlpool, perspiring off a pound to get down to his riding weight of 115. TVG Network, a horse racing channel, wanted to interview him, but the timing interfered with his nap.
That's the morning ritual: work out horses, cut weight, nap and then read for a while, maybe a Jack Reacher novel or Reader's Digest Condensed Books. Finally, he watches replays involving the horses he is about to ride, trying for a sort of precognition of how each race will go, which mounts will vie for the early lead and which will hang back and for how long.
''Finish Rich in Nyc, she's certainly not the best horse I'll be on, no sir,'' Baze said, lying in his tiny cubicle in the jockeys' room, his iPad balanced on his chest. As usual, he sounded as likable and down-home as Andy of Mayberry. ''The horse has enough want-to for one little move and that's it.''
The jockeys' hangout at Golden Gate is a two-story building at the end of the grandstand. It is a crowded space, smelling of deodorant and well-earned sweat. Each jockey has a cubicle with adjacent shelves and cubbyholes. Baze's space is unusual for its library of a few dozen books. Racing silks dangle from hangers. Black boots, sprayed with Pledge and buffed to a shine, are lined up in neat rows. Riders go in and out of ''the box,'' the steam room where they melt away pounds. Baze shaved, brushed his teeth, inserted some eye drops.
He is 5 feet 4 inches and rock solid, especially in his arms and legs. He needs to be. Thoroughbreds weigh about 1,200 pounds and circle the track at 40 miles an hour. Jockeys do not sit on a horse but rather stoop above it, perched like hood ornaments on a shimmying, lurching vehicle. Their entire weight is balanced with toeholds on thin metal stirrups. Their fingers clutch the reins and a handful of mane. Each race demands exhausting effort.
Horse racing may keep Baze physically fit, but the years have chiseled the customary wrinkles in an older man's face. His forehead has annexed new territory as his hair has thinned. It is not hard to believe he is a grandfather.
''Hey Old Man, you ready for your big day?'' Frank Alvarado, one of the other riders, said to him with a smile. ''We love you, but it's time to retire.''
For now, however, quitting is unthinkable. Yes, there is the continuing risk of a devastating injury. Paralysis, concussions and calcified limbs are among the hazards, as is death. But Baze is too competitive to give up a sport he is so good at, and he is riding as well as ever.
''I forget who said this: there's nothing better for the inside of a man than the outside of a horse,'' he remarked one morning in a moment of reflection. ''They're such nice animals, big and powerful. They have nice soft noses.''
He is an adrenaline addict, and horse racing satisfies the craving. ''You never lose the thrill of having that gate come open and the feeling of that horse surging up beneath you,'' he said. ''It feels like you're on top of one big muscle. It's exhilarating. You're in command of all that power.''
The challenge then is to outwit the other riders. ''It's like a chess game where you need to see the moves ahead. You can influence what the others do. If a guy is going too slow, you let your horse creep up on them and give them a little goose, get them started a little sooner than they'd want.''
Or you can squeeze an opposing horse to the inside or push it to the outside. ''The race is constantly changing. It helps that time slows down for me. The horses don't seem to be going all that fast. I can usually predict what the other jockeys will do. I know how to react. I've done this so many times.''
Horses have a small gas tank and there is no fuel gauge: ''But you know how fast you've gone and, if you have any sense of pace, you know how much horse you've used up. You can feel it in your hands. Sometimes you can hear it in their respiration. Hopefully, they're not lying to you. Some make you feel like you've got a ton of horse left and then you turn for home and pfft, nothing, the dirty lying son of a gun.'' But a good jockey usually knows.
And then comes the homestretch. ''It's really fun to come from behind. When you're in the lead, you've got the target on your back. But when you come from behind, you're the one doing the target practice. It's fun to wheel out and pass everyone. It's even more fun to get through on the rail, because you are exploiting a flaw in somebody else's plan and you feel extra smart.''
Baze is well paid for this work but thinks if he had to, he would do it for free. Who wouldn't, he wondered. Wouldn't anyone pay a fortune to do it just once?
Winning a horse race is that rapturous. And it is just another day at the office.
Sunup
Horse racing in the Bay Area used to be split between two racetracks. One was Bay Meadows -- inevitably nicknamed Baze Meadows -- which was ripped down in 2008. The other is Golden Gate Fields, where racing now goes on nearly year-round, Thursdays through Sundays. It is a lovely spot, facing the tree-laced hills of Berkeley and Albany, the two cities it straddles. The view is even better over its shoulder, the Golden Gate Bridge itself.
Early mornings are a wondrous time on the backside of the racetrack. The shed rows are alive with pre-dawn activity, the stalls getting mucked out, the hay racks restocked, the feed tubs refilled. Floodlights partially sweep aside the darkness. Mist hangs in the heavy air. Seabirds swoop past in low arcs.
Some horses are escorted to the track for a workout, and there is a serene musicality of hoofbeats and hard breathing as riders gallop them around the oval. A thoroughbred's magnificent proportions -- all those determined muscles and bones moving in harmony -- are easier to admire without the distraction of a race. These are not just beautiful animals but conditioned athletes. Trainers with knowing faces lean against the rail, their eyeballs seesawing between the fast-moving horseflesh and a clutched stopwatch.
The ''kitchen'' is a snack bar at the entrance to the stables, and inside it the scent of coffee and grease replaces the moist breeze of the outdoors. A burrito costs $2.75; spaghetti is served in paper cups. Men -- and they are almost all men -- sit around the 20 tables, continuing conversations many have been having for years. Secrets do not remain secret here for long. The trainers look like beefy farmers at a Grange meeting, wearing faded jeans, quilted jackets and baseball caps. The jockeys appear almost bug-like, their gaunt elfin faces framed in a carapace of helmets and goggles.
Russell Baze usually sits in the same seat at the same table, next to Ray Harris, his agent, and across from Jim Ghidella, an old friend and semiretired lawyer. I was able to assume the fourth chair, and it felt like I had acquired one of the most desirable bar stools in ''Cheers.''
People on the backside were happy to talk to me about Baze, so long as my story was a ''nice'' one. He seemed not only to be the best-known guy at the track, but the best-liked as well. And yet there was an occasional harrumph when I used the term ''in-depth profile,'' as if that was some sort of fool's errand.
''Good luck to you,'' scoffed Steve Miyadi, one of the track's top trainers. ''Do you know why you never see vanilla ice cream on a dessert menu? It's because there's no way to dress it up. It is what it is, and only what it is, and it's bland. Russell Baze is the vanilla ice cream of Golden Gate Fields.''
Miyadi enjoys saying outrageous things, but similar sentiments were more gently repeated. It was as if Baze was thought slightly abnormal for being so darned normal, or perhaps it was merely a commentary on the old-fashioned normality he quietly exhibited: the teetotaling, family-first, straight-arrow kind.
Jockeys are rarely so deficient in human flaws. It is an occupation booby-trapped with stresses and temptations. The list of top riders who have battled alcoholism and addiction is a long one, and the pressures of the job for those at the bottom are just as unyielding. Jockeys are easily replaced transient workers who frequently get blamed when a horse underperforms.
Though most are men, they are expected to maintain the weight of adolescents, about 115 pounds, and many rely on laxatives, diuretics and ''flipping,'' the habitual vomiting of their meals. Some ride while perilously lightheaded from malnourishment and low blood sugar. ''State-sanctioned starvation,'' Dr. David Seftel, the track's physician, calls the weight limits.
Baze, by comparison, is a paragon of the Protestant ethic, his disciplined lifestyle and work habits as important to his success as his horsemanship. He married at age 20, and he and Tami raised three daughters and a son.
''My most important job has been being a husband and a father,'' he said in a matter-of-fact self-assessment. ''It's kind of cool to be leading rider, too. But when I got done with work -- when others went out drinking or played golf on their days off -- I preferred to be at home with my family.''
He works six days a week, early to bed and early to rise, and despite being popular at the track, he has very little social life. He prefers to stay put in the large red-brick home he owns in Woodside, one of the Bay Area's wealthiest communities. Massive eucalyptus trees tower above the forested acreage. A barn out back once sheltered two horses when the kids were young. His in-laws live on the property, steps away in a smaller two-story house.
Each evening, Tami makes her husband dinner -- often chicken or pasta -- and if Baze has won that day, the two watch replays of the victories as they eat. He clears the table and then reads to her as she does the dishes and he continues as she sips hot cocoa. His idea of gluttony is three slices of pizza and a dish of ice cream. His idea of a night out is a movie. He enjoys reality TV shows like ''Survivor,'' though it is only the physical challenges he relishes, fast-forwarding past ''all that double-dealing and back-stabbing.''
Politically, he considers himself a ''good conservative on fiscal and moral things,'' someone who sympathizes with the Tea Party ''but not the wacko tea partiers.'' He and Tami were practicing Mormons until about five years ago. ''We read some books that kind of put some questions in our minds about some of the claims the church made,'' he told me. He was purposely vague, quickly adding that he still thought it a good church, if perhaps not the only true one: ''I like that they want you to lead an exemplary life.''
Again and again, over many conversations, he apologized for not being more colorful. ''I'm just a regular guy, a blue-collar rider,'' he said, nodding his head as if to insist this was true. ''I've gotten a lot of trophies and accolades and stuff, but if I didn't have them, I'd be just as happy.'' He said he was called Russell the Muscle only because people are suckers for a catchy rhyme.
One morning, I asked him about his cousin, Mike Baze, a superb jockey who squandered his talent on drugs and booze. The two were close as boys, and Mike was once married to Tami's sister. Now Russell has no idea where his cousin lives. In 2011, Mike's son Michael, another terrific rider, was found dead of a drug overdose in the stable area at Churchill Downs.
''It's the choices you make,'' Baze said flatly. ''Everybody knows right from wrong. I suppose there's some gray area in the middle, but pretty much right is right and wrong is wrong and you live with the consequences.''
We were talking in an area above the jockeys' room. Baze walked over to a refrigerator and grabbed a bottle of juice. Rather than twisting off the top he poked a tiny hole in it with a screwdriver. That way only a trickle of liquid would come out, sparing him the temptation to take a gulp.
A History of Horsemen
Abednego Baze fought in the Revolutionary War for the First Virginia Regiment, and, according to the family annals, he was at Valley Forge in 1778. Generations later, a branch of his descendants settled in the Yakima Valley of Washington State. Many of them were horse people of one sort or another: traders, haulers, blacksmiths, trainers, wranglers and rodeo riders. The family name became so prevalent at every kind of equine event that one local newspaper columnist called them ''the Maze of Bazes.''
But the main bloodline to the progeny who would become jockeys -- those with the necessary genetic makeup for small sinewy bodies -- arrived from a union with another family, the Jameses. Albert James, born in 1872, was a short, well-built man who had a way with animals. For years he and his wife, Lucinda, owned a livery stable in the high plains of northeastern Colorado. The couple eventually set out toward Washington with their dearest possessions: 3 covered wagons, 6 children and 30 horses.
That migration lasted several years, or at least that is how the story is variously retold. Albert was said to be a crafty fellow who hustled match races in small towns along the way. The family jockey was his daughter Mable, a spunky girl who was ''4-foot-nothing'' and went by the nickname Bunt.
The way it worked, Albert, wearing bib overalls and a straw hat, would meander into a bar and begin blustering among the locals. ''Why, I'll bet my little girl over there on her pony can beat any horse you've got,'' he'd boast, all the while more sober than he let on. Usually, the race went up and back along the main street of town, and almost always Bunt won.
In 1918, when she was 19, she married a horse trader and rodeo rider named Bert Baze. He was a ramrod-straight six-footer and looked even taller under his puffed-up, wide-brimmed hat. Black Hat Baze, some called him. He began training racehorses, and Bunt was his jockey.
In the beginning, they were an itinerant couple, traveling in a covered wagon that had the look of a horse-drawn mobile home. Bert would enter his mounts at the fairgrounds of frontier cities scattered along the wheat fields of southeastern Washington. The crowds were enthusiastic but the tracks themselves were often no more than bumpy circles of three-eighths or half a mile. Racing was less gentlemanly then. Jockeys sometimes kicked other riders or hooked their elbows. They would grab a rival horse's tail or yank its saddle towel.
Bunt took a fall in a race when she was pregnant with her fifth child. Neither she nor the fetus was harmed, but the spill made her give up racing. Bert then groomed successors among the more diminutive of their eight children.
''My younger brother Kenny was going to be the rider because he was skinny and scrawny and I think he had the jaundice,'' said Joe Baze, who is 80 and a fine storyteller. ''Then Kenny growed too big and my dad said to me, 'Joe, you're going to be the rider.' Well, I didn't much care for that, really. But then I started winning money and I liked it pretty good.''
Joe and Beverley Baze, Russell's parents, live in Montana. She is 4-foot-10 and as a girl was a national champion in roller skate dancing. Joe, at 122 pounds, still looks trim enough to climb aboard a racehorse, and meeting him was like unearthing the mold out of which Russell was cast.
Joe began riding when he was 15 in what was then called the Blue Mountain Circuit in places like Walla Walla, Waitsburg and Colfax in Washington. His career can be roughly divided into two parts: the years before the doctors insisted he quit and those after he decided to ride anyway.
Joe went down hard in 1951 and lost a kidney. A similar accident occurred three years later, and that is when he stopped riding, a hiatus that lasted 10 years until Beverley was pregnant with their fifth child and they were $4,000 in debt. Horse racing, however risky, seemed to him the surest way to pay off what they owed. Beverley was opposed at first. ''Every time I mentioned it, she'd start baking cookies and pies so that I'd become too fat,'' he said.
The entire family followed Joe from one racing meet to another, to big cities like Portland, Seattle, Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles. They stayed in motels or a trailer park, and the children changed schools every few months. They were racetrack kids, spending their spare time around the shed rows. The boys fashioned saddles out of twine and sat on hay bales, whipping the sides while pretending they were in a stretch run.
Solvent again, Joe bought a 60-acre dairy farm in the Yakima Valley. He rented it out for a few years and then began converting the property into a place to train racehorses, outfitted with a half-mile track, a three-door starting gate and a 24-stall barn with a tack room and feed row.
He finally retired from riding in 1973. He was 40 by then, and it had begun to seem like ''the ground was getting harder and the horses were getting taller.'' He had taken some bad spills that summer. Every jounce caused pain to shoot through his body. It hurt just to prance from the paddock to the gate.
The family had been living at their Yakima ranch since Russell was in the fourth grade. His boyhood reminiscences sound like some rural ideal of fresh air, pony riding and fishing. He loved to hunt, and he would go after pheasants, doves and rabbits with a shotgun slung across the handlebars of his bicycle.
He was the most self-contained of the Baze children. He did well in school. Beverley, who is 77, called him ''a real bookworm.'' Joe said he was well behaved: ''Russell probably done a lot of things that should have got him in trouble, but he was smarter than I was, so I never knowed about them.''
Russell turned 16 in 1974, and that meant he could ride professionally. He was burning to do it. Though one of the state's better varsity wrestlers, he quit his high school team to devote more time to horse racing. He was second in class rank, but he never gave serious thought to college.
Russell already was educated in the things he most wanted to know. Joe had taught three of his four sons the jockey trade, how to talk to a horse with your hands, how to keep from using up the animal's energy too soon, how to sense where the other horses are and what their riders might try to do.
These instructions were wisely accompanied by admonitions. Joe said there were two guarantees in the life of a jockey: ''If you ride many races, you're going to hit the dirt. And if you ride long enough, you're going to get too old or too fat or too broke up, so you better save your money.''
The Breaks of the Game
Jockeys do not talk much about danger, maybe because the risk becomes second nature. But mishaps are an inevitable part of racing. One horse clips the heels of another. A boxed-in rider impetuously tries to steer his mount through the eye of a needle. A horse's leg snaps during the strain of the race.
''When they break a leg, you hear it as well as feel it,'' Russell Baze said. ''It's loud like a rifle shot. In fact, if you're anywhere in the pack, you hear it.'' The jockey then tries to keep his stricken mount from collapsing. ''Those are the scariest seconds right there, that step or two when your mind is shifting gears, trying to help the horse stay up, going from full drive to rollback.''
Baze has been hurt dozens of times, incurring nine concussions, a dozen or so fractures and 24 contusions, according to medical records provided by the racetrack's physician. He also suffers from kidney stones, a common affliction among chronically dehydrated jockeys.
In conversation, Baze told stories of his various falls with annotations such as ''first compression fracture'' and ''first broken collarbone.'' By his reckoning, his worst spill came in 1987 on a filly named Snow Squaw. The horse was in the lead when it broke both its front legs. As it toppled, Baze was pitched through the air and landed on his head. ''Planted like a tulip,'' he phrased it. He sustained two compressed vertebrae and a concussion.
The jockey spoke of these incidents only at my insistence. Lingering injuries were nothing he wanted advertised. He said: ''People will think, 'Oh, he's got a bad back, he's always in pain,' and I don't want to give anyone an excuse to keep me off a horse. I don't want them thinking I'm getting old either, and if they do, I want them to think I'm ripening, not over-ripening.''
A horse and a jockey make up a team where the faster, heavier teammate is always the more important. ''The horse deserves 90 percent of the credit,'' Baze said. The animals need coaxing of course, and there are three ways a jockey does that: with his hands, his whip and his mouth. Baze is notorious for the high decibel level of his yaaahs. ''A lot of riders don't use their voice,'' he said. ''Why give up a third of your artillery like that?''
Bill Shoemaker, at 98 pounds, was known as a finesse rider with the reassuring hands of a faith healer. Laffit Pincay, a bigger, brawnier man, could actually bully a horse around the track. Baze's style leans more to the muscular. He holds a faltering mount together with his strong arms, pushing and pulling in a commanding rhythm. His highest compliment for a horse is to call it ''honest,'' and by that he means it is just as competitive as he is. He thinks all thoroughbreds enjoy running but perhaps only a third really care about winning. ''We should both be tired at the end of the race,'' he said.
One of Baze's all-time favorites was a homely filly named Silky's Nurse. He said she was ''terrible-looking with just about every bad aspect of horse conformation, a long head and an overbite and floppy ears and skinny neck. She had nice, high withers but her ribs and hips stuck out.'' The filly liked to run 15 or 20 lengths behind the pack but responded to his commands when it was time to catch up. He won five stakes races aboard this honest horse.
Baze employs three sizes of whips, using the one with the least bite on fillies. By his own admission, he is sometimes overzealous in meting out the lashes, and five years ago he drew a 15-day suspension for hitting a horse that had broken its leg. As the gelding neared the wire, it seemed to go lame but then began to run again. Baze, mistakenly thinking the horse still sound, urged it on. The animal was later euthanized. ''In the heat of the moment I did something stupid,'' he said. ''Competitiveness is a blessing and a curse.''
His very first win came in 1974 after about a dozen tries. It was at Yakima Meadows, not far from his boyhood home. The horse was Oregon Warrior, one Joe had trained. He told his 16-year-old son to keep to the outside. Just to be sure, Russell steered the animal five wide of the others on both turns.
While still a teenager, Baze rode in Seattle and San Francisco and even a winter racing season in Chicago, where he left his mouth uncovered while exercising a horse one icy morning. ''It was like my lungs got frostbit,'' he said. ''I was the leading rider going into the final week, but then I missed three days just huddling and shivering in my apartment.''
The young jockey's career was nonetheless off to a fine start, and he was an increasingly confident fellow with money in his pocket when he first got to know Tami Arterburn at Bay Meadows. The Arterburns, like the Bazes, were a horse racing family. Jack Arterburn, Tami's father, was a trainer who had earlier been a jockey. He had ridden for Black Hat Baze and sometimes competed against Joe. Russell thought up excuses to hang out where the Arterburns stabled their horses. He helped Tami groom the animals.
The courtship was swift. Russell and Tami became engaged on Valentine's Day in 1979, two months after they met. He agreed to be baptized in the Mormon faith. ''Russell was smart; he could talk to people and he was a hard worker,'' Tami told me one afternoon at their house. ''I always figured if he wasn't going to be a successful jockey, he'd do well at something else.''
She was loath to accept any credit for her husband's accomplishments, allowing only that ''I've been a good influence in his life.''
Russell was nearby. ''Tami doesn't put up with any foolishness,'' he said.
Newly married, Baze grew close to his in-laws, and Jack Arterburn advised him that if he wanted to ride better horses -- and earn more money -- he ought to change agents, recommending an eager newcomer named Ray Harris. This was a fateful suggestion. Some jockeys change agents as casually as they change socks, but Baze and Harris have been together for 30 years, one of the most enduring professional relationships in the history of the sport.
An agent's job is to get his rider on the horses most likely to win. The motivating financial arithmetic works this way: The winning owner collects 60 percent of the purse, with the next four finishers getting smaller slices. The winning jockey receives 10 percent of the owner's share and gives his agent one-fourth of that. In a $10,000 race, a typical purse at Golden Gate Fields, the owner would get $6,000 and pay $600 to the jockey, who would in turn pay $150 to the agent.
Harris had impressed Arterburn by being uncommonly polite. When his jockey won a race, the agent would write a thank-you note to the horse's trainer and arrive at the barn the next morning with a dozen doughnuts. The idea for thank-you notes came from the book ''Think and Grow Rich'' by the early self-help guru Napoleon Hill. The doughnuts were his own touch.
Harris was 10 years older than Baze, and the two may not have first seemed especially compatible. The agent was a big-city guy from the Boston area. He never knew his father, and his mother cleaned houses and collected welfare. Harris committed a burglary when he was a juvenile and ended up in reform school. Years in the Navy did a lot to straighten him out, though he was not entirely without need of further realignment. Harris liked brandy and beer. He was an alcoholic. His drinking buddies one time dropped him off at the Baze household after he had passed out in a restaurant.
''Tami got a little upset, but as long as Ray did his job the alcohol didn't bother me much,'' Russell said. ''It wasn't like he got plastered every night.''
Harris was very astute, a math and economics major in college who once worked as a racetrack teller and regarded successful gamblers with the reverence of an acolyte. Early on, he urged Baze to ride year-round in Northern California, and barely a year later the jockey had elevated himself from being a promising new rider to being absolutely the Man. He went on an extraordinary run. From 1981 through 1988, he topped the jockey standings every year at both Bay Meadows and Golden Gate Fields.
But how much success is ever enough? Baze was still a young man, not yet 30, and it was natural for him to wonder what more he might achieve. Even the humblest of people are not without ego, and the Southern California racetracks -- Del Mar, Hollywood and Santa Anita -- were the highest step on the horse racing ladder. Was he good enough to climb to the top?
He knew it would not be easy. Some of the greatest jockeys of all time were riding down there: Shoemaker, Pincay, Chris McCarron, Gary Stevens, Eddie Delahoussaye, Patrick Valenzuela and others. But he already had beaten some of these men on even terms when they ventured north.
To test the waters, Baze rode at Del Mar in 1987. He finished an impressive fifth in the standings despite being there only two-thirds of the season. That seemed to settle it. He began laying the groundwork for a move.
Harris, by then devotedly sober and a father of two, did not want to uproot his family and declined to go along. But Tami was all for this new adventure, and the Bazes bought a home in the San Gabriel Valley.
Russell the Muscle was going to ride against the best.
A Shot at the Big Time
Twenty-five years later, the experience still sits undigested in his gut. ''For some reason, me and Southern California weren't a good fit,'' Baze said. He speculated that maybe people did not like the way he rode, or maybe there were just too many other good jockeys. ''Maybe if I had given it more time, it would have turned around. But I just wasn't winning enough races.''
Baze remained there for three years, and he actually did quite well. He almost always finished in the top 10 of the jockey standings. He was second at Del Mar in 1988 and second again in an autumn meet at Santa Anita in 1989. His earnings were roughly the same as they had been in Northern California -- and the potential to make more money was far greater.
But Baze loves to win, needs to win, hungers to win, and after the move his winning percentage had fallen by half, from about 20 percent to about 10.
McCarron said: ''Russell was used to riding nine races a day and five would be favorites. In Southern California, he went to riding four, five or six a day and he was seldom on a favorite. It's very simple. You need that live horse.''
Baze understood that. He was competing for mounts against superb jockeys. He could not expect to be every trainer's first or second or even third choice. And yet he still was not catching on as solidly as he thought he deserved. Beyond that, he was losing races he felt he should have won. Delahoussaye, in particular, was nudging him out in one close finish after another.
The two were friends, and Baze asked him how he did it. Delahoussaye recalled: ''I told him, 'Russell, I just got better horses.' And he said, 'No man, you're doing something different than I am.' ''
During the third year, things turned for the worse. Baze broke his pelvis in a fall, and when he came back he was not getting mounts as good as the ones before. He fell into a slump, and for a jockey slumps are often self-sustaining. Trainers are reluctant to put a down-on-his-luck rider on an up-and-coming horse. Tami, the family bookkeeper, said she was the first to conclude it was time to leave. ''He was starting to beg for mounts,'' she said.
Baze, usually so contented, was unhappy. What good is the big time if it makes you feel small?
He opted for the geographical cure, and it worked like a miracle elixir. Back in San Francisco, he reconnected with Harris, and if the jockey was previously the Man, he was now the King. He had become a better rider down south, more inclined to be fast out of the gate and less likely to lay back. Baze easily reclaimed the strong relationships he had with the men who operated the best stables. About a third of Baze's mounts came from a single trainer, Jerry Hollendorfer, himself a high-percentage winner.
Just as losing begets losing, winning begets winning; the more successful jockeys are the ones asked to ride the more promising horses. And few have maintained the velocity of this favorable momentum as steadily as Baze.
Beginning in 1992, the year after his return, he began accumulating victories at a pace of more than 400 a year. He has led the nation in wins 12 times (and has more thoroughbred victories than any rider in the world except the Brazilian jockey Jorge Ricardo, who rides in South America). Baze's lifetime winning percentage has risen to 24 percent. (Shoemaker ended up at 22 percent, Pincay at 20.) He was named to the Official National Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame in 1999. Only 97 riders are in the Hall.
Wins, however, is only one of two ways to compute the annual jockey standings. The other is earnings: the accrued share of the purses won by the rider's mounts. And the purses in the Bay Area are relatively small.
Though first in lifetime wins, Baze is only 16th in earnings, below several jockeys with half as many races. Last year, though again tops in wins, he finished but 37th in the money column. This is not to say Baze fails to bring home an enviable income. He usually averages about $400,000 a year, he said. But there are jockeys who take home $1 million or more.
Very few great horses come out of Northern California, and that has meant Baze rarely has been in America's biggest races. ''Every jockey's dream is to win the Kentucky Derby,'' he said, describing the thrill of being at the center of so mammoth a crowd. But he has ridden in the event only twice, both times on long shots. Semoran finished 14th in 1996; Cause to Believe was 13th in 2005.
A third horse, Event of the Year, was a Derby favorite in 1998. ''I had the big one,'' Baze said, recalling the momentous opportunity, a chance to be the jockey among jockeys in the race of all races. But the horse -- the best he had ever ridden -- fractured a knee a week before the race.
Because Baze has primarily worked in the Bay Area, some horseplayers put a mental asterisk beside his name, likening his record for wins to a baseball home run king given credit for round-trippers in Class AAA.
That is a reasonable observation, as Baze would acknowledge. ''I'm not the greatest jockey, and I'll be the first one to tell you that,'' he said.
The smaller purses at Golden Gate Fields have inevitably led to fewer entries in each race. Baze often rides in fields of six or seven horses while the average race in North America has more than eight.
So is America's winningest jockey also among its very best?
I kept asking that question, on the record and off, and the responses were consistent. ''He's every bit as good as any rider today,'' said McCarron, who is now retired. Pincay and Delahoussaye, also retired, put Baze in the top tier. So did Gary Stevens, who recently came out of retirement. So did knowledgeable trainers who work in California.
The fact that Baze won so often on lesser racetracks only seemed to deepen their respect. Older jockeys are usually more wary about the stock they ride.
But Baze danced every dance, often risking his hide in cheap races, and any jockey will tell you: It's harder to ride the bad horses than the good ones.
The Right-Hand Man
Golden Gate Fields, like any racetrack, is home to an abundance of Runyonesque characters, and while Ray Harris is hardly a flamboyant man, he does possess the heart of a gambler ever after a fast buck.
He quoted the hallmark belief of Napoleon Hill: ''What the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.'' He had believed he could become rich and said he had achieved prosperity through investing in the stock market, wagering at the racetrack and of course collecting his 25 percent from Russell Baze.
Harris, at 65, is looking forward to a long retirement in Sedona, Ariz., where he owns a second home. His intention is to give up being an agent the moment Baze gives up being a jockey. ''I just hope he quits before he gets hurt so badly that he has to,'' Harris said.
The agent, a doer of good deeds and active in charities, can be somewhat mercurial, endearing one moment and brusque the next. He considers himself a straight talker, a self-image some find inconsistent with the demands of his occupation. Agents and the truth are not always on the strictest of speaking terms, and Harris, representing the rider in most demand, is especially resented when his actions seem duplicitous.
The matchmaking of jockey and horse is usually done about a week in advance of a race, though the lead time is much longer for bigger purses.
''Spinning'' is a common term on the backside of a racetrack. The word is usually employed when an agent, in trying to put his jockey on the best possible mount, agrees for him to ride one horse and then reneges when a better one comes along. Harris is far from alone in pulling this shenanigan, but he has had more chances to do so with Baze as a client.
''Dealing with Ray Harris is like going to the dentist every day of your life,'' said one trainer, Steve Specht. ''The word loyalty isn't in his vocabulary.''
Such animosity, though genuine, needs to be evaluated in context. By necessity, Harris plays the bad cop to Baze's good. ''Ray takes the heat and I appreciate it,'' Baze said. Though he tacitly agrees with Harris's manipulations, Baze -- who comports himself like a Boy Scout: helpful, friendly, courteous and kind -- is never deemed a villain in these matters. The jockey is always the innocent, the agent the double-crosser.
Spinning can work in reverse. Trainers, perhaps at an owner's insistence, abandon a jockey if they can get a better one, especially if the replacement is Baze. Harris is then sometimes deemed a rascal for wooing the trainer away.
''Ray basically has the pick in any race,'' said Boone McCanna, another leading agent. ''It happened to me again this morning. A trainer told me we could ride his horse, but then he gets a call from Ray and the guy now says to me, 'Sorry, but we can get Russell.' They expect you to understand how it is, and I guess I do. If I was an owner or trainer, I'd want Russell, too.''
Early each morning, I would observe the agents purposefully walking between the shed rows and the kitchen. They carried the latest condition book, a pamphlet that set out the eligibility requirements for coming races, and they kept a record of their verbal agreements in well-worn, paper-stuffed notebooks.
Among the youngest was 26-year-old Fernando Navarro. His business was going so badly he worried about making his next car payment; if things did not improve soon, he would have to go back to painting houses for his dad.
Navarro had a Baze fixation. He had watched him ride for years. He said that as a young boy he once approached the highly regarded jockey at Bay Meadows: ''Whatever the reason, I told him he sounded like Mickey Mouse, and he asked me, 'Kid, do you kiss your mom with that mouth?' ''
He spoke of Harris and Baze as if they were predators at the top of a food chain. Others lived in fear of their pounce, which Navarro called the Danger of Baze: ''If you win twice on a horse, there's always the risk that Ray will then come steal that mount for Russell. And what can you do?''
An agent is entitled to represent two jockeys, though Harris only handles Baze. The woebegone Navarro served two riders but one was out with an injury and the other kept getting suspended for errant horsemanship.
Walking with Navarro among the shed rows was different than strolling with Harris, though both were equally agile at dodging the puddles. The older agent moved confidently like a beat cop in a neighborhood where he knew the secrets of every shopkeeper. The younger man entered the barns tentatively, timidly saying to trainers, ''Just seeing if you need any help.''
One day, after I had been away for a few weeks, Navarro called out, ''I've been looking for you.'' He had a new Danger of Baze story. His jockey, Christian Santiago Reyes, was supposed to ride the 4-5 favorite Green to Go but had been bumped in favor of Baze and ended up aboard the long shot Pancho's Vista. Baze won by a length and a half; Santiago came in dead last.
''How are we supposed to make any money around here?'' Navarro complained.
Such remonstrations made me wonder: Given all their advantages, why didn't the team of Baze and Harris amass even more wins? A rider with a 24 percent winning percentage was still losing three of every four.
The answer, as Harris explained it, had two parts. First, he sometimes put his jockey on lesser mounts in order to stay in the good graces of a particular stable. Several leading trainers expected Baze to ride their horses, and Harris often had to choose among them. This could be touchy, requiring verbal finesse, and he saw himself as more an able peacekeeper than devious troublemaker. ''I've got to make as many people happy as I can, and happiness isn't easy,'' he said.
The second reason was the nature of the sport itself. Unpredictable things happen. Horses have good days and bad. They become moody or achy or disinterested. They stumble or rear up or become frightened of shadows. Their jockeys find themselves trapped behind impenetrable barricades of horseflesh. Pathways suddenly open, pathways suddenly close.
It is annoyingly hard to pick winners. Even the savviest handicappers are used to being humbled, sometimes bested by know-nothings who made selections based on a lucky number or an alliterative name. Harris summed up the gambler's dilemma with a familiar racetrack truism: ''You can ride the same race with the same horses and you won't get the same result.''
A Track Past Its Prime
Golden Gate Fields, originally called the Turf Club, was built in 1940 and opened inauspiciously the next year with a racing surface of mush. No one had properly accounted for heavy seasonal rains and the effects of tides on the subsoil, according to Bill Barich's lyrical book ''Laughing in the Hills.'' Horses sank into knee-high mud, and the racetrack was obliged to close after only four days when one mount snapped a leg in a hideous fall.
It did not reopen until 1947, and by then it was a place transformed, a must-stop for some of the nation's top thoroughbreds. The sport was in its heyday, and great racehorses were celebrities equal to movie idols. In 1950, Citation, a Triple Crown winner, circled Golden Gate's oval in a new world record for the mile. Silky Sullivan, forever synonymous with miracle comebacks, won the Golden Gate Futurity in 1957, closing from 27 lengths back as if suddenly pitched by a slingshot. The horse is buried in the track's infield.
Overflow crowds of 20,000 and more once showed up on big race days, and average daily attendance remained a respectable 10,000 until the mid-1980s. By then, interest in the sport was seeping away, and, with the legalization of off-track betting locations, a trip to the racetrack became an unnecessary consumption of a gambler's time. These days, people can watch races on their TV or laptop or smartphone and place wagers from online accounts.
A weekend crowd of 5,000 is now a fine turnout, and when that many are present, Golden Gate Fields still seems a heart-stirring place. People swarm into the paddock area for a close-up look at the competitors. Bettors grow anxious as the lines get long at the wagering machines. The cheering of the crowd crescendos as the horses hasten down the lane to the finish line.
But weekday attendance is typically 1,100. Almost all of the 248 tables in the Turf Club -- a dining room with white tablecloths and a grand view of the homestretch -- go unoccupied. Sheaths of paper cover the place settings so the tableware will not get dusty. The grandstands are equally deserted. People stay indoors, shunning the open air. The place is little more than a betting parlor.
Horseplayers -- most of them men arriving alone -- sit before a bank of TVs that broadcast races from across the country. They are as likely to get excited by a close finish at Santa Anita or Aqueduct as anything happening 100 yards away. Bettors rise from their chairs to rush toward the video screens, hollering at their horses. ''Come on five! Come on five! Damn you five!''
Baze finds the under-populated grandstands a little depressing. Horse racing used to suffer from a reputation for seediness, he said. But these days, apathy seems to be the problem. The sport is no match for baseball, football and the rest. ''It ought to at least get in front of golf,'' Baze said.
Racetracks in many other states boost attendance with slot machines and casino gambling. That is not permitted in California. The best gimmick at Golden Gate Fields is ''dollar day'' on Sundays when admission, hot dogs and beer cost a buck each. In the spring, ''bottomless Saturdays'' were also planned, offering unlimited booze for $30. The promotion was stopped after critics called it a misguided enticement into public drunkenness.
Baze still regards a day at the races as good fun, ''so long as you don't bring more money than you can afford to lose.'' He cautioned me, ''Even the cinches aren't cinches,'' which was something I already knew. Hot tips I picked up on the backside had led to my more scalding losses.
Baze's presence in a race greatly skewed the odds. His climbing aboard a horse was like Warren Buffett endorsing a stock. The masses assumed it was a knowing choice. Horses that might have run at 4-1 dropped down to 2-1 or lower in the parimutuel pool. Betting on Baze was consequently like paying a hidden tax. Winnings, if there were any, came with a reduced payoff.
Harris was in a peculiar position. As an agent, he wanted Baze to win, but as a gambler he often preferred he lose. Harris favored exotic bets like the Pick 4, Pick 5 or Pick 6, where he had to select the winner in several consecutive races. He did this by narrowing each field to two to six horses -- some favorites, some long shots -- and wagering enough combinations to cover them all. It was an expensive way to bet, and only profitable if he sometimes hit a payoff of four or five figures. He needed a long shot to come through.
''Gambling money is like Monopoly money, it's for play,'' Harris said cheerfully. ''I bring $300 a day to play with. If I win, I spend it. I don't try to run it up.'' He recounted fetching stories about times when he hit it big. Years ago, he told his wife to buy a Jaguar after he dumped $40,000 on their bed. Another winning ticket had doubled the size of their master bedroom.
Of course, gamblers exceed even fishermen in the telling of whoppers, but Harris's most polished anecdotes seemed credible enough. He once gave Joe DiMaggio a winning tip on a horse. ''Good picking,'' Joltin' Joe wrote on a signed baseball that the agent displays in his living room.
I'd watch Harris as he analyzed the small print in The Daily Racing Form: all those hieroglyphics about bloodlines, past performances and workout times. A speed-reader of pertinent information, he often handicapped in what seemed algebraic fashion. If two horses were likely to show early speed, he figured one canceled the other out, leaving a good come-from-behind entry as his solution for X.
A prerace trip to the paddock occasionally altered his choices, that last-minute look at the actual horseflesh -- noting perhaps some worrisome tape on a leg or a slight froth of foam in the inner thighs -- trumping earlier calculations. Whatever, he never touted his selections. ''This horse has a good chance,'' was as enthusiastic as he got.
I'm not much of a gambler but I figured I could afford to lose $20 a day, and my inexpert handicapping skills allowed me to do just that. But one afternoon, as Harris watched me shilly-shally about how to wager the final $8 on my machine-generated voucher, he grabbed the slip of paper from my hand and returned a moment later with three trifecta bets, including two that came in. It was rather stunning. He had alchemized my $8 into $202.40.
50,000 ... and Counting
Trinity Kaenel, the oldest of Baze's three daughters, came to watch her dad ride in No. 50,000. When she got married, her husband, Kyle Kaenel, was an enormously promising young jockey. She was watching him in a race on TV, their baby in her arms, when he took the spill that busted up his shoulder and back and ended his riding career. For him, it was Race No. 4,345.
Kyle frequently rode against his father-in-law. He said he had never met anyone so competitive: ''If Russell wins one, he wants another. If he has two, he wants three and if he has three, he wants four.'' Family gatherings tended to include contests. Who can do the most pull-ups and handstands?
That afternoon, things were going Baze's way. He won the first three races. ''It looks like an easy game today,'' he said after dismounting in the third. He hummed as he walked, nothing particularly tuneful, just an intonation of joy.
But then he finished fourth in the next race and lost by a head in the fifth. That last horse, Bi Tomorrow, was an ornery cuss. Before the race, he kept champing on the pony rider assigned to escort it to the gate. Baze, attempting to control the horse, ended up with blood on his white pants.
The sixth race was the anticipated No. 50,000. A few reporters gathered in the jockey's room, hoping perhaps for an unusual gush of sentiment from a habitually restrained man. Baze did not oblige. ''My one concession is I'm changing out of my dirty jockey pants,'' he said with a toothy smile.
Baze is an old-fashioned guy in a newfangled world. He preferred respect to celebration. The number 50,000 had an impressive stretch of zeros. But he did not care how many races he had ridden; he only cared how many he had won. Besides, the total was inexact. It counted only thoroughbreds. Early in his career, he had also raced aboard appaloosas and quarterhorses.
Whatever the milestone symbolized -- to him, to the few people scattered in the grandstands, to the managers of Golden Gate Fields who had printed a commemorative placard -- the race appeared utterly ordinary on the program: six furlongs, a modest $10,000 purse, for fillies and mares who had not won twice and were at least 4 years old.
Finish Rich in Nyc, Baze's mount, entered the day a 7-5 favorite in the seven-horse field. The filly was not anywhere near that worthwhile, and yet the odds dropped further, down to even money when the race began.
Horses are very intuitive animals; they can absorb a rider's emotions. Baze tries to signal confidence when he takes the reins, and going into the starting gate Finish Rich in Nyc was calm, looking straight ahead, her feet well set.
When the door burst open, Baze yelled ''yaaah'' at high volume, not only commanding his horse into motion but trying to scare the others from pinching in too close and impeding his path.
Finish Rich in Nyc bounded forward from the No. 2 stall and accelerated hard. Her trainer had told Baze to let her start out fast if she wanted, and the jockey did nothing to discourage the horse as she bolted to the lead.
The jockey had studied the past performances of every entry in the race. He knew the habits of the other riders, and he expected the No. 1 horse to show early speed, quickly overtaking his own filly. That would have suited him fine. He wanted Finish Rich in Nyc to run comfortably, just off the lead.
But the No. 1 horse failed to move to the front, and Baze had a pivotal decision to make barely 10 seconds into the race. Should he pull back on the reins, disrupting the rhythm of his horse's stride? Or should he stay in the lead, hoping his filly could settle into a fluid, easy gait and run unchallenged on the backstretch? Maybe she could win wire-to-wire, he thought.
And he let her try.
Along the straightaway, another horse, Sogn, came up on the outside, barely a head behind. Finish Rich in Nyc, gamely competing, did not want to be outrun. She strained to keep the lead, but this was energy going to waste like the unnecessary gunning of an engine. The pace was far faster than Baze prefers. He tried to keep his horse relaxed. His repertory of reassuring sounds includes smooches and murmurs of ''easy baby'' and ''nice horsey.''
Sogn fell back as they entered the turn. Another horse, a mare named Grasp, a 5-2 shot, took over second place on the outside. She had won only once in 36 tries but appeared strong as she vied for the lead, pulling even at the quarter pole and then slightly ahead. Baze began to use his whip.
Entering the lane, it seemed a two-horse race, and, like many a classic stretch run, it looked to be a well-matched struggle, hoofbeats pounding into the ground, speed against speed. But appearances can be deceptive. These were cheap horses, and one was merely fading faster than the other.
Finish Rich in Nyc was exhausted. Baze could feel it in his hands. He once told me, ''When the needle hits E, there's very little you can do.'' Sometimes he manages to rouse his mount by pushing his knuckles into its neck -- or he taps into some reservoir of energy with the whip. But this horse was done.
Nearing the finish line, another filly passed Finish Rich in Nyc, who barely hung on for third. She paid $2.10 to show, a dime return on a $2 risk.
Afterward, there was a ceremony, and the other jockeys signed the placard.
Baze was ushered into a small room where a handful of reporters waited with their questions. He answered each one politely, even though he wanted to leave. He was going to a movie and hoped to catch the early show.
''Is that it?'' he asked hopefully after a lull, eager to escape the fuss.

Early mornings on the backside of the track can be a wondrous time. The shed rows are alive with predawn activity, the stalls being mucked out, the hay racks restocked, the feed tubs refilled. Mist hangs in the heavy air as horses are escorted to the track for a workout, and there is a serene musicality of hoofbeats. (SP8

HEADLINE: A Mayor Who Puts Wall Street First

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
On March 15 of last year, at a moment when many New Yorkers found themselves increasingly disturbed by revelations that the Police Department had conducted constitutionally suspect surveillance of Muslim communities, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg made an unplanned visit to the offices of Goldman Sachs.
The mood had grown sour among some of the city's most amply compensated plutocrats. The day before, Greg Smith, an executive director in the company's equity derivatives business, announced his resignation, in an Op-Ed page article in The New York Times, declaring that the previous decade had left Goldman's culture so steeped in avarice and self-interest, so utterly disdainful of its clients, that he no longer found it morally tenable to work there.
Outraged by the attacks on Goldman that immediately followed -- a ''piling on,'' as the mayor put it, that he found ''ridiculous'' -- Mr. Bloomberg arrived to heal and absolve. Do any wounds require avuncular tending quite like those of an investment banker? 
Staying for an hour, Mr. Bloomberg shook hands with employees and sat down to hamburgers with Goldman's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the son of a postal clerk whose trajectory from the East New York housing projects in Brooklyn to Harvard to the management of one of the world's most powerful banks could hardly seem less plausible now, amid the realities of millennial New York.
Among the various enduring images of the Bloomberg years, many are positive and some perhaps even blessed: bike lanes, smokeless restaurants, new expanses of green space, the increased presence of ferries on the city's waterways. But to my mind, this gesture of therapeutic outreach to an institution that defrauded its own clients is unmatched in its symbolic weight, so clearly encapsulating the mayor's most devoutly held allegiances and the civic repercussions accompanying them, the tireless coddling of the overclass.
No mayor in New York's history has done more to consolidate the city's identity with Wall Street. Mr. Bloomberg obviously does not bear responsibility for the creation of the indecipherable, huckster financial instruments that resulted in our economic crisis and the litany of personal miseries that followed, but he was one of the country's most impassioned and nurturing supporters of Wall Street during its most ethically unhinged hour.
It was not simply that he was such an obvious champion of the financial industry, but also that in the city he ran he could barely brook any dissent of it.
This was apparent in the way his police force greeted the arrival of Occupy Wall Street, with Mace and pointless arrests, ultimately clearing Zuccotti Park, where the protesters had encamped, with the aid of sirens and riot gear, as if Manhattan had been taken over by the Shining Path.
A political figure rarely afraid of expressing reproach -- someone whose administration stigmatized fat people, poor teenage mothers, members of the teachers' union -- Mr. Bloomberg seems to imagine that any impulse short of adulation will shoo Wall Street away. Several weeks ago he publicly denounced Eliot Spitzer, not for his domestic failings but for his wish to curtail the worst instincts of the banks and to maximize their utilitarian value. (''This is our industry,'' the mayor said. ''We'd appreciate it if someone recognized that this is our tax base.'')
Presumably, in Mayor Bloomberg's most terrified imagination, the true agenda of someone like Mr. Spitzer is to bundle up Wall Street in Bubble Wrap and send it to Connecticut, leaving in its place only a bottomless container of Pepsi.
Wall Street has benefited under Mayor Bloomberg much more than other industries, as evidenced by the pronounced inequality felt all over the country and experienced most dramatically here.
The average salary in the securities industry in 2011 was $362,900, according to the state comptroller's office, an average higher than before the financial crisis and more than five times the average in the rest of the city's private sector. As a share of private sector wages, the securities industry grew from 21 percent at the beginning of Mayor Bloomberg's first term to 28 percent early in his second, while never accounting for more than 6 percent of jobs.
The top 1 percent of earners in New York make nearly 40 percent of the total income of city residents, nearly twice the national figure. This number has grown. At the beginning of Mr. Bloomberg's tenure in 2002, the top 1 percent of earners in New York made 27 percent of the income.
It is worth considering these numbers in the context of the previous gilded age, the era of Oliver Stone's first ''Wall Street,'' in 1985, when the wealthiest 1 percent of New Yorkers made 15 percent of the city's income, virtually in line with the national figure at the time.
During a presentation to the American Sociological Association last week, James Parrott, chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit research and education group, offered a look at income polarization in the city that included this startling statistic, culled from census data: while real median family incomes were flat from 2000 to 2010, median family incomes rose an average of 55 percent in eight high-income neighborhoods, including TriBeCa and the Upper East Side, the home ZIP codes of the financial industry.
To what extent can we hold Mr. Bloomberg responsible for these gulfs? For the fact that the poverty ratio has remained essentially unchanged in New York since his first days in office, with roughly a fifth of the city's residents living below the federal poverty level?
Certainly, some of the disparity would exist without him, and the poverty rate has been more or less intractable for the past 30 years. But it is easy to envision that we might have arrived at a better place with someone who had paid more visceral attention to inequity than with someone who felt the need to sue the City Council to block a measure mandating a living wage (the suit was thrown out of court).
And still, it is not fair to paint the mayor as a Dickensian ogre who utterly ignored the poor. His Young Men's Initiative, to which he contributed $30 million of his own money, seeks to improve the lives of young underprivileged black and Latino men. The administration's efforts to expand education and job training in Brownsville, Brooklyn, for example have led to higher high school graduation rates and lower rates of unemployment. A network of organizations and agencies called NEON, an innovation of the Department of Probation, puts probation offices in neighborhoods where rates of incarceration have been high so that those in the criminal justice system are saved long commutes to mandatory meetings with their officers. Instead they are encouraged to use their time productively.
What's striking about a recent report delivered by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University, which examines demographic data neighborhood by neighborhood, is that poverty actually declined between 2000 and 2011, though by no means hugely, in some of the most afflicted places in the city -- in Brownsville and in various enclaves of the South Bronx.
Where poverty has crept up are those places where income levels hover around the city's median of $55,000 -- neighborhoods like the Fresh Meadows, Hillcrest and Elmhurst sections of Queens and Stapleton and St. George on Staten Island. Job losses, rent increases and foreclosures have brought those previously able to sustain themselves to precarious new lows.
One legacy of the Bloomberg era is that it has redefined our economic and social categories -- giving us a universe of superrich that have assumed a great share of our psychic space, and replacing a working class with an artisan class. The mayor spoke this month on his fiscal legacy at the former Pfizer pharmaceutical factory in Brooklyn, making this explicit.
The building had served as a manufacturing plant for 150 years, the mayor told his audience. Five years ago, executives closed it. ''But today, as you can see, this is once again a manufacturing hub,'' he continued. ''Only now it's an incubator for a new generation of craftsmen and women, who are making everything from furniture and fashion designs to kimchi and cookies, to software and 3-D printers.''
Mayor Bloomberg, who did nothing to elevate the status of teachers, an exercise that might have helped draw the most talented to that profession, has done a lot to elevate the status of people who make things, or rather the people who make the right things intended to be sold to the right MacBook-carrying-Martha's Vineyard-vacationing people.
To the graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design who can create $13,000 copper bathtubs (of the kind the mayor recently imported from France for his home) or cerused cocktail tables commissioned by uptown decorators, New York is an increasingly hospitable place. If what you make is more pedestrian, Stella D'oro cookies once sold in places like Key Food, instead of $6-a-piece shortbread of the type you might find at Chelsea Market, the mayor's subliminal message winnows down to this: ''Good luck, and send us a postcard from Ohio.''

HEADLINE: The Power of Games

BYLINE: By MATTHEW CALKINS. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
MY favorite activity during childhood was camping with my parents. We traveled up and down the California coast to little campgrounds and state parks, returning dozens of times to our favorites.
Also on these trips, I got my first taste of business, because my father would take me to properties he managed as a real estate developer. He'd explain how the parties negotiated, the quality of the materials, and the struggles he had with the architect. His was a high-stakes industry because, once you're committed to a project, you're on a fixed track, and if the commercial real estate market goes down, everyone knows you're going to lose money.
I skipped first grade and was first in my class in high school. I'd take courses at lunchtime and belonged to three music organizations simultaneously. I love learning and I love a challenge. At Dartmouth, I took all the economics courses I could once I discovered how much I loved the subject. I won the prize as top economics graduate in my 1994 graduating class. 
I was introverted as a child, and computers were a perfect playmate. As I grew, I felt that they were at the forefront of change. I decided that I wanted to be in a constantly changing field with enough dynamism that I could rise quickly. After college, I joined MicroStrategy, a software firm in Tysons Corner, Va., and rose to director of the Enterprise Product Group. I had always wanted to start my own company, but I didn't think I had enough expertise initially, and I was right. I stayed five years and at 26 I walked away from millions in stock options to start Appian in 1999 with three friends.
Appian automates business processes. Our clients range from Amazon to the Pepco power company to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Enterprise Rent-A-Car uses our software in its Rideshare program for van pool commuters.
About five years ago, I wanted to take the business to the next level, so we obtained $10 million from a venture capital company. We've since extended our capabilities to mobile devices and the cloud.
For some years now, I've been the host of history nights at my home. We meet about once a month. Each session covers a single year. We started with 1900 and have discussed 71 years in sequence.
I love the diversity of the groups. College friends, C.E.O.'s, Congressional candidates and others with an interest in history take part. We debate what was the most important birth, death, invention, disaster, political event and so forth in the year. We seem to spend an inordinate amount of time on births and deaths.
In my free time, I enjoy playing and writing games. My board game Sekigahara has won three gaming awards. It's a war game based on Japanese history.
For me, gaming is a means to sharpen my mental life and to increase my abilities. Running a technology organization is full of collaborative accomplishments but there's very little individuality in it, as much as I seek it. I'm always looking for individual expression. At times I wish I were an artist because my life would be a series of creations.
Playing games has helped me in running Appian. Games are exercises in appraising your position and making decisions. I'm interested in that strength-building behavior. Two hours after you make a decision in a game, it leads to victory or defeat. If you play enough games, you get a sixth sense for the quality of your position. You can see victory or a debacle before it occurs. You intuit how the various factors will accumulate, which helps in making strategic choices in business.

HEADLINE: Crossing Into Queens

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
It was only a matter of time, after Bushwick was given a featured role in the HBO show ''Girls,'' that the young creative types who established this gritty Brooklyn neighborhood as an artists' enclave began to be priced out.
Galleries, restaurants and bars have multiplied in Bushwick. Rachel and Kurt of Fox Television's ''Glee'' moved into a loft there. Last September, the Clintons were spotted at Roberta's, the artisanal pizzeria. More recently, Anne Hathaway was reported to be filming a scene for a movie at a local cafe and music joint. And developers have homed in with plans for doorman buildings, and possibly a mall.
Now, with such mainstream endeavors looming and prices on the rise, artists, 20-somethings and young families are taking the L train for the short hop to neighboring and more economical Ridgewood, Queens.
The average monthly rent for a studio in Bushwick was $1,675 in July, up 27 percent from July 2011, according to MNS, a residential and investment sales brokerage. The monthly rent for one- and two-bedroom apartments was also up by double digits, to $1,900 and $2,121 respectively, for the same period. 
The price increases come as the gap narrows between overall rents in northern Brooklyn and Manhattan. Last month, the average monthly rent in northern Brooklyn rose to $3,035 -- by 8.2 percent compared with July 2012, according to a report compiled by the appraisal firm Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman. In Manhattan, the average rent was $3,822 in July, up 1.7 percent.
At the same time, developers are looking for a better return on rental buildings as they face rising land prices in Manhattan. ''We're getting a lot of these landlords who historically have been in Manhattan saying, 'Tell us about Bushwick; what is this area in Queens?' '' said Andrew Barrocas, the chief executive of MNS. He has organized about a dozen informal walking tours of the area for investors and developers who want a better understanding of the buzz.
Compared with Manhattan, he said, ''the rent multiplier is a lot more appealing,'' because of lower land costs and the premium that new rentals can command.
Ten years ago, a two-bedroom priced at $1,100 a month would have been on the high side in Bushwick, said Diana Reyna, who represents the area stretching from Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn into Ridgewood, Queens, on the New York City Council. ''Today we're talking about people who are charging $3,000'' to roommates who split the rent four ways.
She noted that seven rezoning proposals had been submitted in her district, and that she was pushing for developments to set aside 40 percent of apartments as affordable housing. She added that when one of her staff members, who is moving for the third time in two years because of rising Bushwick rents, heard about this article, he lamented, ''Now I'm going to have to move again.''
Ridgewood
Real estate prices in Ridgewood, a working-class neighborhood of roughly two square miles, are on the upswing. But monthly rents are still cheaper than in East Williamsburg and Bushwick. For example, the rent for a three-bedroom in Ridgewood is nearly 20 percent lower than in Bushwick, according to Streeteasy.com.
Ridgewood consists mainly of well-maintained row houses from the early 20th century, between two and six stories high. The median sales price in the second quarter was $400,000, up 14 percent from the same period last year, according to Streeteasy.
Alex Amini, a 24-year-old bass player, is paying just $600 a month to share a large three-bedroom duplex in a renovated Ridgewood row house with four other people. ''It's the biggest apartment I've ever had,'' he said, ''and it's the cheapest.''
He charts his eastward progression over the past four years, starting in Manhattan, where he paid $1,100 a month for a share in a three-bedroom in the East Village. After a brief detour to the Upper West Side, he went through a series of sublets, all with roommates, all costing $700 to $800 a month, near the Morgan Avenue L subway stop -- a burgeoning area called variously Morgantown, Bushwick and East Willamsburg.
''I made some really close friends,'' Mr. Amini said of his time living with ''random people'' in Brooklyn. ''That's part of the allure.''
Ridgewood is quiet by comparison. ''There are not a lot of restaurants,'' he said. ''It is not as much of a hotbed for artists yet.''
But there are signs of gentrification. Notable among the handful of galleries and coffee shops is Bunker, a Vietnamese restaurant headed up by Jimmy Tu, who once cooked at Eleven Madison Park. It was recently named the Best Cheap-Eats Joint by New York magazine.
Even as bright-orange umbrellas shade a new pedestrian plaza where Myrtle Avenue, 71st Avenue and Stephen Street converge, a shop like Ridgewood Coins and Stamps remains straight out of another era, advertising an old-fashioned telephone exchange beginning with the letters EV. Others have signs that reflect the German, Mexican, Polish and other immigrants who make up the community.
But a few are clearly catering to a new demographic. ChocoLatte Café, a year-old coffee shop a storefront away from Ridgewood Coins and Stamps, has cards at the door promoting a local yoga studio with student specials. A block away, Ridgewood Thai has an oversize chandelier, fake lotus flowers floating in pots and a Mod aesthetic.
''Many of the young people who work in Williamsburg -- bartenders, waitresses -- if you ask them where do they live, they say Ridgewood,'' said Gene Keyser, a broker with Halstead Property in Brooklyn. ''It's the young folks, east of Fort Greene, the Pratt kids, finding themselves priced out, who are now pushing out there.''
Families are also being lured to Queens from Brooklyn by the space their money will buy. In March Betsy Hoffman, an agent with Brennan Realty Services, a brokerage that focuses on Brooklyn town houses, began helping a couple who have a year-old child and wanted to buy a free-standing house in Bedford-Stuyvesant. With a $700,000 budget, they were quickly priced out. Next they turned to Bushwick, but that was a washout, too.
''The next logical step was to go to Ridgewood,'' said Ms. Hoffman, who found the couple a three-family fixer-upper there that met their budget. Unfortunately the deal fell through, but they are continuing to concentrate their search on Ridgewood.
New development may have a harder time finding a foothold in Ridgewood than it did in Bushwick. Last month, the community board recommended that a manufacturing area south of Myrtle Avenue be designated an industrial business zone, to help retain jobs and fend off residential construction.
Ms. Reyna, the councilwoman, said that in terms of rezoning, ''we have to draw the line as to where we go and how far we will go to develop housing, so it's not so much to the point that we lose our work force,'' by eliminating small businesses and manufacturing.
Bushwick
While interest in Ridgewood is growing, Bushwick remains the hub of activity.
A proposal by the Read Property Group to develop several rental buildings on a mostly vacant site that used to house the Rheingold Brewery was approved with conditions by the community board; it is making its way through the public approval process, including review by the borough president, the City Planning Commission and the City Council.
The project would add 977 apartments, retail space and a park to the area near Woodhull Medical Center and the Flushing Avenue J train. About 24 percent of the one-, two- and three-bedroom units are to be below market rate, according to Mitch Korbey, a partner in the law firm Herrick, Feinstein, which is working with the developer.
Nearby at 815 Broadway, Douglas Steiner, a developer and the chairman of Steiner Studios, plans to turn a former Conway store into 40 rental units with a large retail component.
And two stops away on the J train, Colony 1209, a 120-apartment rental building going up on DeKalb Avenue, is expected to open this fall with studios and one- and two-bedrooms. Pricing is being finalized.
Colony 1209 will be aimed at ''trendsetting'' 20-somethings, said David J. Maundrell III, the founder of aptsandlofts.com, a New York brokerage that specializes in the marketing of new developments. Indoor bocce courts and a vintage arcade with games like Donkey Kong are on the long list of planned amenities. If the place is not promoted correctly, he pointed out, the bohemian sensibilities of the target audience could be offended.
''I have to be authentic with this,'' said Mr. Maundrell, who has employed a photographer living in Bushwick to capture the essence of the neighborhood in pictures to be used in advertising. The building's home page will include the Twitter feed of Bushwick Daily, an in-the-know blog. ''They don't like corporate,'' he said of his prospective tenants. ''You can't fool around.''
Already, questions are being raised about whether Bushwick is losing its edge. Last year, an entire city block at the Morgan Avenue L stop sold for $12.15 million to a developer with plans for a retail complex. The Commercial Observer noted the news with the headline, ''A Mall Grows in Bushwick?'' It went on to ask if the plans for ''Brooklyn's hippest neighborhood mark the death of cool or the beginning of mainstream success in Bushwick?''
Although that has yet to be determined, some residents are concerned about the neighborhood's rapid transformation.
''There is a lot of anxiety about the pace at which Bushwick is changing,'' said Deborah Brown, an artist who directs the gallery Storefront Bushwick and serves on the local community board. In May she bought a 7,000-square-foot warehouse, which she is using as her studio and has started to use as her gallery. Ms. Brown, who lives in Manhattan, was first struck by Bushwick's then nascent art scene in 2006, when she dropped off her niece at an apartment in the neighborhood. Recognizing the seeds of gentrification, she soon bought a two-story vacant factory with her husband, Eric Ploumis, to use as her studio and to be part of the creative community. ''I thought, 'I have seen this happen so many times, this time I'm going to be in on it.' '' But she didn't anticipate the speed of the neighborhood's change. ''It's been faster than I could imagine,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Is Big Data an Economic Big Dud?

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ. 
An investigative reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
IF pencil marks on some colossal doorjamb could measure the growth of the Internet, they would probably be tracking the amount of data sloshing through the public network that spans the planet. Christened by the World Economic Forum as ''the new oil'' and ''a new asset class,'' these vast loads of data have been likened to transformative innovations like the steam locomotive, electricity grids, steel, air-conditioning and the radio.
The astounding rate of growth would make any parent proud. There were 30 billion gigabytes of video, e-mails, Web transactions and business-to-business analytics in 2005. The total is expected to reach more than 20 times that figure in 2013, with off-the-charts increases to follow in the years ahead, according to Cisco, the networking giant.
How much data is that? Cisco estimates that in 2012, some two trillion minutes of video alone traversed the Internet every month. That translates to over a million years per week of everything from video selfies and nannycams to Netflix downloads and ''Battlestar Galactica'' episodes. 
What is sometimes referred to as the Internet's first wave -- say, from the 1990s until around 2005 -- brought completely new services like e-mail, the Web, online search and eventually broadband. For its next act, the industry has pinned its hopes, and its colossal public relations machine, on the power of Big Data itself to supercharge the economy.
There is just one tiny problem: the economy is, at best, in the doldrums and has stayed there during the latest surge in Web traffic. The rate of productivity growth, whose steady rise from the 1970s well into the 2000s has been credited to earlier phases in the computer and Internet revolutions, has actually fallen. The overall economic trends are complex, but an argument could be made that the slowdown began around 2005 -- just when Big Data began to make its appearance.
Those factors have some economists questioning whether Big Data will ever have the impact of the first Internet wave, let alone the industrial revolutions of past centuries. One theory holds that the Big Data industry is thriving more by cannibalizing existing businesses in the competition for customers than by creating fundamentally new opportunities.
In some cases, online companies like Amazon and eBay are fighting among themselves for customers. But in others -- here is where the cannibals enter -- the companies are eating up traditional advertising, media, music and retailing businesses, said Joel Waldfogel, an economist at the University of Minnesota who has studied the phenomenon.
''One falls, one rises -- it's pretty clear the digital kind is a substitute to the physical kind,'' he said. ''So it would be crazy to count the whole rise in digital as a net addition to the economy.''
Robert J. Gordon, a professor of economics at Northwestern University, said comparing Big Data to oil was promotional nonsense. ''Gasoline made from oil made possible a transportation revolution as cars replaced horses and as commercial air transportation replaced railroads,'' he said. ''If anybody thinks that personal data are comparable to real oil and real vehicles, they don't appreciate the realities of the last century.''
Other economists believe that Big Data's economic punch is just a few years away, as engineers trained in data manipulation make their way through college and as data-driven start-ups begin hiring. And of course the recession could be masking the impact of the data revolution in ways economists don't yet grasp. Still, some suspect that in the end our current framework for understanding Big Data and ''the cloud'' could be a mirage.
''I think it's conceivable that the data era will be a bust for the things people expect it to be useful for,'' said Scott Wallsten, a senior fellow at the Technology Policy Institute and the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy. Some entirely new use will have to turn up for data to fulfill its economic potential, he added.
There is no disputing that a wide spectrum of businesses, from e-marketers to pharmaceutical companies, are now using huge amounts of data as part of their everyday business.
Josh Marks is the chief executive of one such company, masFlight, which helps airlines use enormous data sets to reduce fuel consumption and improve overall performance. Although his first mission is to help clients compete with other airlines for customers, Mr. Marks believes that efficiencies like those his company is chasing should eventually expand the global economy.
For now, though, he acknowledges that most of the raw data flowing across the Web has limited economic value: far more useful is specialized data in the hands of analysts with a deep understanding of specific industries. ''The promises that are made around the ability to manipulate these very large data sets in real time are overselling what they can do today,'' Mr. Marks said.
Some economists argue that it is often difficult to estimate the true value of new technologies, and that Big Data may already be delivering benefits that are uncounted in official economic statistics. Cat videos and television programs on Hulu, for example, produce pleasure for Web surfers -- so shouldn't economists find a way to value such intangible activity, whether or not it moves the needle of the gross domestic product?
In addition, infrastructure investments often take years to pay off in a big way, said Shane Greenstein, an economist at Northwestern University. He cited high-speed Internet connections laid down in the late 1990s that have driven profits only recently. But he noted that in contrast to the Internet's first wave, which created services like the Web and e-mail, the impact of the second wave -- the Big Data revolution -- is harder to discern above the noise of broader economic activity.
''It could be just time delay, or it could be that the value just isn't there,'' said Mr. Greenstein, who has studied the competitive success of online businesses in media, advertising and retailing.
Perhaps surprisingly, the parallel most tightly embraced by digital futurists -- the rise of the electricity grid -- is largely dismissed by those who have studied the history of the subject. The idea is that a ubiquitous Internet will make data and ''cloud'' computing available anywhere, like electricity through a socket.
The numerical comparisons are tantalizing. As illustrated in ''The Electric City,'' by Harold L. Platt, the booming quantity and adoption rates of electricity flowing on the Chicago grid in the late 19th and early 20th centuries instantly bring to mind those charts showing data growth today.
Despite those similarities, Mr. Platt, a professor emeritus of history at Loyola University Chicago, said it was unlikely that the revolutions unleashed in manufacturing, domestic life, transportation and high and low society by electricity could ever be matched by the data era. ''I'd be hard pressed to quickly draw comparisons,'' he said.
But even as Mr. Platt, 68, spoke by cellphone from Chicago, fragments of today's inescapable data flood found him as he received messages from his grown children. ''I have to text them or else they won't answer me back,'' Mr. Platt said gamely. ''I'm going with the flow.''

HEADLINE: Crushed By the Cost of Child Care

 BODY:
The difficulty of obtaining good, affordable day care is well known as a problem afflicting the working poor. But increasingly, middle- and upper-middle-class parents are finding that day care is hard to find or access and that even when it is available it is startlingly costly. Among the mothers I spoke to, one sent her daughter to a day care proprietor where the owner secretly had another woman mind all eight babies all day long; another signed up for a slot at a local day care when she was newly pregnant. Her daughter is now 5, and she is still on the wait list. 
The cost and the scarcity of day care has helped create what the sociologist Joya Misra calls ''the motherhood penalty.'' While women without children are closer to pay equity with men, women with children are lagging behind because they find that working doesn't always make sense after considering the cost of child care. When women earn less than their partners, they are more likely to drop out of the work force, and if they do so for two years or more, they may not be able to get back in at anything approaching their prior job or earnings. The cost of taking care of one's children outside the home is now so high that many women cannot be assured of both working and making a decent income after taxes and child care costs.
Professor Misra, who teaches sociology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has analyzed data from thousands of parents from different social classes. One study of middle-class academic parents was based on hundreds of surveys and focus group interviews and 17 one-on-one interviews. Many talked about the shock of day care costs, which can eat up 30 percent of one income in a two-salary couple, Professor Misra says.In 35 states and D.C., even the cost of center-based day care (let alone a nanny) is higher than the cost of a year of a public college. More anecdotally, day care costs for middle-class New Yorkers can easily equal from $25,000 to $30,000 per child. In New York, child care is the single greatest expense among low-income families in the city, surpassing both food and housing.
Child care is a towering expense for parents like Carla Bellamy, a professor of anthropology at Baruch College in Manhattan who holds a Ph.D. from Columbia, earns $74,000 a year and lives with her husband and their two children, a newborn and a 4-year-old. Her husband is a composer and the executive director of a music organization. Only 9 percent of women in the work force make $75,000 or more, so Professor Bellamy is relatively privileged.
But even with a combined household income of $110,000, she and her husband struggle to afford day care. (It was a story I heard echoed when I spoke with other female professors, who sometimes took sick days even when they were healthy so they could stay home and not have to pay for baby sitters.) ''Our entire disposable income goes to child care,'' Professor Bellamy, 41, says. ''It's not a tragic story, but is tiring and tiresome. I have a career, I work really hard, and yet I get no break.''
Professor Bellamy fleetingly thought about spending her summer vacation working at a restaurant as a waitress or a host, but that's the time that academics typically use to do the writing and research that ultimately helps them get tenure -- or not.
And it's not just New York City. Ainsley Stapleton, 36, an accountant based in Arlington, Va., describes herself as middle class. But with three children, all of whom are in preschool or day care, she calculates that she spends 87.6 percent of her take-home pay on day care.
''It makes me want to cry a little,'' Ms. Stapleton said by phone from her office. In the past, she said, she and her husband have bounced around the question of whether ''he should quit or I should, but both of us enjoy working.''
Jane Dimyan-Ehrenfeld, 37, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., who works for the federal government and who is the mother of two, struggled since she was first pregnant to get her first child into quality day care near her home. ''The competition is unbelievable,'' she says. So she sent her older child to a local home day care. After nearly three years, she says, she discovered that the proprietor at the home day care who was supposed to be taking care of her infant daughter was instead selling herbal supplements all day upstairs, and on one occasion, on the road, leaving her daughter and seven other children to be cared for by one aide, in a home with two giant snakes and attack dogs supposedly kept in a very different part of the house.
Ms. Dimyan-Ehrenfeld says that she checked the center's references before she enrolled her daughter and that the owner seemed very warm. She discovered the truth when the one aide who had been caring for the children was fired and told the parents what had been going on at the home day care center. Startled by both the undersupervision and the fact that the exotic animals weren't kept away from the children, she immediately pulled her daughter from the center. Her younger child now has a nanny and her older child is in a private preschool. That has meant, however, that she earns 50 cents, after paying for all that, in each biweekly pay period. ''And I am a lawyer!'' she exclaims.
Even for experts like Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, 44, of Kirkland, Wash., a founder of a nonprofit group centered on these issues, MomsRising, obtaining day care isn't easy. Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner had a ''heck of a time'' getting her children off years-long waiting lists for local day care centers and preschools. ''I applied early, and my daughter only got in when she was 3,'' Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner says. ''Access is a problem across the socioeconomic spectrum.''
That includes parents like Carly Fox, an educator and organizer for a legal services organization who is a single mother of a 3-year-old and earns a little too much at $42,000 to be eligible for a government subsidy for day care. She cobbles together child care by working at home sometimes and by relying on her mother, her father, a cousin, a neighborhood sitter and time swaps with other parents.
For Yvette Nunez in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, the expense of day care is even more challenging. Ms. Nunez is raising her three children on her own, yet her former employer, a supermarket, required her to work on weekends. That increased her day care bill by $75 a week. Even with subsidies, she was paying out almost of all of what she was earning from her 18-hour-a-week job. She finally quit to take care of her children. She is now unemployed, she told me as her 2-year-old wailed in the background. She really wants to get back to work but for now simply cannot afford to do so. Ms. Nunez lives on government assistance and a small amount of child support. For many parents, the promise of prekindergarten programs, proposed earlier this year by President Obama, is a start. But it's not going to stanch the financial desperation that takes hold in many families before their children are 5 and able to go to school.
''As we have resisted institutionalizing the day care system in this country, ordinary workers on their own have created D.I.Y. child-care networks,'' says Kathleen Gerson, a sociologist at New York University who is now studying these networks in Silicon Valley. ''What is our strange commitment to seeing care as a purely private individual act rather than one embedded in the larger community?'' she asked.
We see day care as a private responsibility. Part of the problem is that we sometimes have a problem with the idea of ''day care'' itself. Professor Gerson and other sociologists saw something I had seen as well among my middle class acquaintances: a discomfort with center-based day care and even the term ''day care,'' preferring terms like ''educational enrichment'' and, yes, preschool. Across the world, though, people count on the availability of day care and see it as a collective good: Americans don't tend to do so as readily. More access to quality early childhood care would help. But those solutions go only part of the way. The most radical solution of all is the most obvious: we need high-quality, universal, subsidized day care. And we should not be ashamed to ask for it.

HEADLINE: The Impossible Mayor of the Possible

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER

 BODY:
The question was a trap, put to a novice politician who had only just been elected mayor and had no government experience whatsoever.
Would Michael R. Bloomberg be keeping any of the seasoned hands from the administration of his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, acclaimed after 9/11 as America's Mayor, Time Magazine Person of the Year, not to mention The Guy Who Personally Tamed and Therefore Saved New York City?
Mr. Bloomberg had no intention of doing so, nor was he going to say that. He praised the Giuliani team. Then he explained why he needed new faces.
''After you've done a job for six or eight years,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, ''you know what can't be done.'' 
Mr. Bloomberg was keen to take on the impossible, or at least the seemingly so. And he did. A man whose public personality came in a plain brown wrapper presided during an era of radical change and rebirth in the city, much of it fostered by his administration.
He has stayed so long that he and New Yorkers are now getting on each other's nerves: he, increasingly peevish and deaf to his critics; they, in turn, no longer able to detect or grant him any qualities beyond arrogance.
Mayors rarely leave office in New York on affectionate terms. In the case of Mr. Bloomberg, a relationship that was always fraught -- and could it have been anything else with a mayor whose net worth, enormous to begin with, increased every 15 minutes by more than the city's median annual household income? -- has frayed.
Baffling, visionary, obstinate and brilliant, Mr. Bloomberg had complications that could be maddeningly hypocritical or endearingly human. He preached the virtues of dietary sodium restrictions, but sneaked shakes of salt onto slices of pizza. His staff let it be known that Mike Bloomberg had a regular guy palate for beer and a hot dog; at dinner with a few commissioners, he confided that he didn't see why anyone should have to pay more than $300 for a good bottle of wine.
He led the country -- indeed, the world -- in taking strong measures to reduce carbon emissions, anticipating that the city's population would grow by one million in the decade after he left office; meanwhile, he flew everywhere on private jets, the least carbon-efficient form of transportation on or above the earth, whether going to spend weekends at his house in Bermuda, or to lecture at a climate change conference in Copenhagen.
He was not naturally inclined to soaring oratory, so on his rare forays, the eloquence was indelible. Practically alone among elected officials in the United States, Mr. Bloomberg spoke in 2010 for the right of a Muslim group to open a mosque a few blocks from the site of the World Trade Center attacks, citing the founding principles of the nation. As he stood on Governors Island, with the Statue of Liberty visible over his shoulder, Mr. Bloomberg said: ''We would be untrue to the best part of ourselves and who we are as New Yorkers and Americans if we said no to a mosque in Lower Manhattan.''
Last week, during a news conference in City Hall, the same mayor snarled at a judge for ruling that in searching the pockets of millions of young black and Latino men who had done nothing wrong, the police and the city had violated their constitutional rights. The moment lacked even a whisper of the grace that had made his voice so powerful on Governors Island.
It would be futile to try squaring those two Bloombergs.
Yet as he enters his final months in City Hall, the full arc of his era is coming into view. Mayors are often spectators, forced to play the hands dealt them by history, the economy, the public, their allies or campaign contributors. As much as any mayor of modern New York, Mr. Bloomberg has been a transformative figure, a shaper of his time.
Elected to lead a city that was the grieving, wounded site of an atrocity, he will depart as mayor of a city where artists have been able to decorate a mighty park with thousands of sheets of saffron, for no reason other than the simple joy of it; where engineers figured out how to turn sewage gas into electricity; where people are safer from violent crime than at any time in modern history.
He is shrewd and has often had good luck, and when that happy combination was in short supply, his vast personal fortune helped patch things over, do good deeds, buy allies. He was not conventionally partisan, and was clumsy in dealing with the baroque centers of power in Albany. The ideology that shaped his goals was, broadly, the allure of large numbers: get enough rich people and companies here, and they will support a government that can keep the city running for everyone else; make policies in public health, education and policing that, when multiplied across eight million people, will create a healthier, smarter, safer city. The love of big numbers led to great success and, at times, toxic excess.
Perhaps most important, he has had a knack for avoiding unnecessary political fights, and little anxiety about trying and failing. At his best, that combination of emotional efficiency and fearless experimentation changed not only the city, but the world. He didn't want to know what couldn't be done.
Imagine the deep, drawn breaths of the audience -- the gasps -- at the finale of a special show held at the Time Warner Center in Columbus Circle on Feb. 24, 2005.
In an elegant performance hall, 13 honored guests, delegates from the International Olympic Committee, had been treated to aperitifs and a 40-minute revue that captured the New York of story, song and cinema.
Mayor Bloomberg and his committee had spared nothing in the enchantments, hoping to lure the 2012 Olympics to the city.
Dancers whirled. Meryl Streep charmed. Whoopi Goldberg cracked wise. The trumpeter Wynton Marsalis pulled rhythm and melody from sky and cellar. A reel of iconic movie clips rendered the city in every shade from the noir to the gaudy.
Finally, at the very back of the stage, a giant curtain began to drop from a three-story wall of glass, shifting the spectacle to the actual city.
Framed in the giant window was Central Park. Its winter browns were pillowed in snow and swaddled in streaks of the saffron cloth of ''The Gates,'' an art installation that was glowing, thanks to lights held by volunteers stationed along miles of winding paths. Overhead, fireworks spattered rivers of color in the sky.
The only word for it was breathtaking: what human brain trying to process such a scene would not instantly demand more oxygen?
The Olympics delegation rose in ovation.
Now, eight years later, all of that evening's shimmer has been stilled, the last trumpet notes faded with the embers from the rockets and the pinwheels. The 2012 Olympics went to London, not New York.
That is the way of political administrations: a million struggles and crises and circuses, ''an October surprise every month,'' as Mayor Edward I. Koch once said, so many of them vanishing in the wink of a New York minute.
Tucked into that evening was something beyond a fling with the Olympics, which many New Yorkers could not have cared less about. Beyond the overreaching was something far-reaching. In the gasps at the finale, in every breath drawn by the audience, was the invisible substance that could be counted as Mr. Bloomberg's most enduring, radical work: cleaner indoor air. The room was free of tobacco smoke. Even during cocktails, no one lit up. And not just on that gilded night, in that privileged space at the center of Manhattan, but in every restaurant, bar and watering hole throughout the five boroughs since March 30, 2003.
Soon after taking office, Mr. Bloomberg had met at Gracie Mansion with his first health commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, who urged him to push for a complete ban on smoking in places where people work -- no exceptions, no special pleadings by hotels or small places or private catering halls. A person who spent one minute in a smoky bar, Dr. Frieden said, would be exposed to as much pollution as someone who stood in the Holland Tunnel for 60 minutes at rush hour.
Would such a ban save lives, Mr. Bloomberg wanted to know.
Yes, Dr. Frieden said.
Then go ahead, the mayor said.
With that, Dr. Frieden continued his briefing by mapping the political heat that would be applied by the hospitality industry.
The mayor cut him off.
''He told me, 'The first rule of business is, once you make a sale -- leave,' '' Dr. Frieden said in Joyce Purnick's authoritative biography, ''Mike Bloomberg: Money, Power, Politics.''
Most dramatically, the New York ban included bars and restaurants, whose trade lobbyists tried to stop it by warning of economic disaster. Commentators jeered about ''Mommy Mayor'' and the ''Nanny State.'' Mr. Bloomberg pushed past the catcalls and got a bill through the City Council that in addition to the ban, included money for cessation programs and steep taxes on cigarettes. The smoking rate for adults declined by a third, and for young people by half.
California and a few cities and towns in the United States already had similar restrictions, but they were little-noticed beyond their borders. After New York City took the step, the crusade started by Mayor Bloomberg and Dr. Frieden crossed the country and then the oceans.
Since New York City passed its law, 500 other cities in the United States and 35 states enacted smoke-free legislation. In March 2004, a national smoking ban in public places was adopted by the Republic of Ireland, making it the first country in Europe to have one; anyone who had frequented Irish pubs fogged with smoke might have thought they would be the last places on earth to stub out cigarettes.
There was more. On the night in 2005 of the Olympic spectacle, only one of the 10 countries with delegates in the audience had a law that restricted smoking in public places. Now nine of those countries do. By the end of 2012, 48 countries had followed New York in adopting smoking bans, providing some protection to 1.2 billion people. That works out to about one in seven of all the humans now on earth: breathtaking and breath-giving.
Not just the air changed. City parkland grew by about 800 acres; 750,000 new trees have been planted, toward a goal of one million, an initiative that took off after the parks commissioner, Adrian Benepe, reported that every dollar the city spent on a tree returned $5.50 in savings on heating, cooling and public health.
The transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, added 285 miles of bike lanes and turned over parts of Broadway near Times Square to pedestrians.
The waterfront on the East River in Queens and Brooklyn, rezoned to accommodate the Olympics that never came, grew to absorb a population that increases by the thousands every month. The No. 7 train line is being extended to 11th Avenue from Times Square, and then south, to irrigate a new crop of skyscrapers being planted on and around train yards. The city alone picked up the bill -- unusual for transit projects -- and intends to pay for it with the real estate taxes collected from new development.
Mr. Bloomberg committed $4 billion, more than all his predecessors combined, to build the third water tunnel, which was first proposed more than 60 years ago. Construction had begun in 1970, then dragged on through six mayoral administrations, slowing and stopping when money was tight; his acceleration of the project, however farsighted, had no political upside -- it will not be completed until 2018, but property owners have had to pay steep increases in annual water bills.
Cornell University, with the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, is building a new campus for applied sciences on Roosevelt Island; the project was instigated by the Bloomberg administration and became possible when the philanthropist Charles F. Feeney pitched in $350 million.
The city cut the number of young people detained for trial in juvenile court by as much as 50 percent, and reduced over all the number of people it sent to jail. Crime went down. At the same time, public health doctors increased screenings and treatment at Rikers Island, a likely vortex of communicable disease.
As one of his first acts, Mr. Bloomberg sought and won control of the schools, saying it would create accountability. He invested heavily in education: the amount of money spent on schools has doubled since 2001. More students graduated from high school in four years, though that success was not closely tied to how much money was spent in a given school; nor were the additional resources able to close the frustrating gap in test scores between higher-performing Asian-American and white students and their lower-scoring black and Hispanic classmates.
The city opened 28 career and technical education high schools, the first new ones since the 1960s. Teachers were paid more, though the city did not negotiate a new evaluation system when it agreed to the increases, and later got into an ugly fight over it. However, approval of tenure applications, once all but automatic, dropped to 55 percent from 97 percent.
Mayoral control of the education system meant that a central administration had the power to close schools, corral space for charter programs, and set rigid rules for assigning students to schools. Many parents found the new educational bureaucracy hidebound and remote, and looked fondly back at the once-reviled community board system.
Air, water, ground had changed. So did the tone.
Unlike most elected officials, Mr. Bloomberg had ample balm to spread around when the city budget dried up; over nine years, he gave about $200 million through the Carnegie Corporation to 600 arts and cultural groups, many of which had been cut adrift from the city budget.
''The grants conveyed an indisputable good to the city's social and cultural fabric,'' the investigative reporter Tom Robbins wrote in The New York Post in June. ''But political advantage was equally inescapable.''
The giving doubled in 2005, an election year, and tripled in 2008, when Mr. Bloomberg sought the right to run for a third term in office by undoing a limit of two that had been voted into law by public referendum. He spent more than $110 million on his re-election campaign, and barely won.
No mayor finishes all the business that needs to be taken care of. When Mr. Bloomberg was toying with a run for president, he kicked liabilities down the road.
In recent weeks, he has been saying how important it is for the next mayor to negotiate concessions on pensions and health benefits from the city unions -- something he did talk about at the time, but did not win at the bargaining table. Meanwhile, the city's public housing authority, which provides homes or vouchers for more than 600,000 people, has deferred maintenance in thousands of apartments. It needs $6 billion in capital financing.
And the durability of the experimental spirit that Mr. Bloomberg encouraged remains uncertain, as is the $383 million in private donations he raised in support of varied pilot projects: stopping domestic violence, preventing black and Latino young men from falling behind, manufacturing green roofs, getting salads into schools.
The siren song of large numbers led the city to multiply the number of people that the police stopped and frisked.
But the Constitution protects the rights of individuals and does not recognize the laws of large numbers. It requires that the more invasive an action the authorities take against a person, the greater the cause must be.
More than a year ago, Mr. Bloomberg himself had -- sotto voce -- said there would be changes to the police approach. The number of stops declined sharply. A more agile Mr. Bloomberg would have avoided a needless fight on behalf of a program that was already being reformed.
Asked on Monday about a judge's order that the police wear body cameras in five precincts for a year, to document precisely what was happening in the streets, Mr. Bloomberg seemed especially angry. A ''nightmare,'' he said. He insisted the test would fail: a police officer might turn his or her head and the camera would miss the action.
The judge said it would be an experiment, a pilot project for a year, but Mr. Bloomberg wasn't having it. ''It is a solution that is not a solution,'' he declared.
Michael Bloomberg had become the kind of expert that 12 years ago he would not hire for his government: someone who knew ''what can't be done.''

HEADLINE: The Economy

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
During Mayor Bloomberg's three terms, the city's economy has weathered two recessions and a financial crisis that wiped out two of the biggest investment banks on Wall Street. Today, employment in the city is at an all-time high, driven mostly by a boom in tourism and in part by a fast-growing group of new technology companies. But there also are many more residents without jobs, and the city's unemployment rate -- 8.4 percent in June -- is much higher than it was when Mr. Bloomberg took office. Incomes have not kept pace with the job growth. Average wages have risen between 1 percent and 2 percent in recent years, failing to match the rate of inflation in the region. PATRICK McGEEHAN

HEADLINE: Meanwhile, in Jersey City ...

BYLINE: By RONDA KAYSEN

 BODY:
Have New Yorkers finally discovered Jersey City?
As property values soar even in Brooklyn neighborhoods once viewed as on the fringe, New Yorkers are looking across that other river that separates Manhattan from the rest of the world: the Hudson. And some of them are heading to Jersey City, which has a flintier personality than Hoboken, its preppy neighbor to the north. New Jersey's second-largest city, it now has a branch of the popular Williamsburg arcade-bar Barcade; farm-to-table restaurants; and a new mayor who worked for Goldman Sachs, served in Iraq and rappelled down a skyscraper.
Jersey City has long attracted the Wall Street crowd to its splash of waterfront high-rises that promise cheaper rent and a speedy ride to Manhattan. But for years, the rest of the city was an afterthought with a reputation for high crime, failing schools and a lack of night life. But as the economy and housing market improve, other Jersey City neighborhoods are enjoying newfound attention, with boutique storefronts opening and New Yorkers steadily moving in. 
The renovated Hamilton Park, surrounded by brownstones, has new landscaping, tennis courts, free Wi-Fi and a playground. Construction is under way for White Eagle Hall, a new arts site downtown. And the Journal Square PATH station plaza will soon be renovated as part of a new development with three high-rises and retail. In a sign that parents from ''the city'' have moved in, TriBeCa Pediatrics opened an office in Hamilton Park.
''Jersey City is good for 30- to 40-somethings who aren't interested in hanging out in Williamsburg anymore,'' said Kevin Pemoulie, the former chef of Momofuku Noodle Bar, who last year along with his wife, Alex, opened the restaurant Thirty Acres in the Van Vorst Park neighborhood. He, like many others who have moved to Jersey City, also liked the in-transition quality of the area.
With New York City rents reaching new highs, housing prices by comparison are still reasonable in Jersey City. The average rent here was $1,900 a month during the second quarter of the year, according to data provided by Trulia. In early July, the average listing price for a home downtown was $604,000 and in Hamilton Park was $426,000, according to data provided by Liberty Realty.
Richard LeFrak, chief executive of the LeFrak Organization, which began developing the Newport neighborhood in 1986 when it was rail yards and warehouses, is one who has noticed a change. ''I would say, in the last three years, when you say you live in Jersey City,'' he said, ''people don't look at you like there's something wrong with you.'' In the next decade, LeFrak plans to add condos, a hotel and an outdoor swim club to Newport.
A year and a half before the Pemoulies opened Thirty Acres, they moved to Jersey City from Williamsburg, shaving $600 a month off their rent. They pay $1,650 a month for a large two-bedroom apartment two blocks from the Grove Street PATH station, which has a renovated pedestrian plaza with shops and new residential developments nearby.
''Brooklyn is just ridiculous -- it's expensive,'' Mr. Pemoulie said. ''It's frustrating to be there. All of my friends ended up moving out.''
Indeed, some parts of Brooklyn have even eclipsed Manhattan in rent prices. The average rent for a one-bedroom in Williamsburg in July was $3,155 a month, a price point rivaling those of many Manhattan neighborhoods, according to a market report by MNS. Even less-developed Brooklyn neighborhoods are commanding a premium: in Bushwick in July, the average rent for a one-bedroom was $1,900.
Still, for many New Yorkers, crossing the Hudson is a psychological hurdle, even if Jersey City now has a Two Boots Pizza and a coffee shop that serves Blue Bottle Coffee.
''The PATH train is like the train to Hogwarts,'' said Kip Jacobson, 41, alluding to the ''Harry Potter'' series. Mr. Jacobson moved to the Van Vorst Park neighborhood from Williamsburg a year ago with his wife, Samantha, and their young son.
Jersey City's new mayor, Steven Fulop, 36, intends to persuade budget-conscious and reluctant New Yorkers to give his city a chance. Mr. Fulop has been in office for less than two months and already has plans to start a marketing campaign called ''Across the River'' to entice New Yorkers.
''I'm looking to portray Jersey City as a cool place to be,'' said Mr. Fulop (who a year ago completed the 140-mile triathlon known as the Ironman U.S. Championship).
Sitting in his sparse office a few weeks after his inauguration, he declared, ''There's a stigma associated with living in Jersey that we've got to correct.''
But Jersey City itself has more than just an image problem. Its public schools remain partly under state control, and certain areas have a serious crime problem; Mr. Fulop knows the two issues must be addressed before the city's reputation can improve and more upwardly mobile families can be persuaded to remain. In his first month, he chose a veteran of the New York Police Department to be his new public safety director. Similarly, the city's new school superintendent once worked for the New York City Department of Education.
One newcomer, Celeste Madhere, describes herself as having been ''anti-Jersey.'' Ms. Madhere, 39, who is originally from Chicago, had lived in Brooklyn for 15 years. ''When you're a transplant,'' she said, ''you always want to live in the city or in Brooklyn. There is no other place to live.''
But when she and her husband, Serge, a Brooklyn native, began searching for a larger apartment, the best they could find was a Crown Heights two-bedroom listed at $3,200 a month. ''It was in a questionable area and still an hour-and-five-minute commute to work,'' said Ms. Madhere, an associate production manager for the Hearst Corporation.
Reluctantly, Ms. Madhere ventured to Jersey City. When she saw the Beacon, a 14-acre Art Deco complex, she was sold. Her commute, which includes a shuttle ride to the PATH train, is now 33 minutes door to door. ''I was like, 'This is really $2,200?' '' she said of the two-bedroom apartment that she and her husband have called home since late July. ''It had a dishwasher!''
Like many of the new developments in Jersey City, the Beacon has a generous amenity package with a dog run, an organic garden, a spa and a screening room. The buildings, some of which date to 1929, have details like terrazzo floors, a wood-paneled poker room and a frieze of the history of humanity. Rents range from $1,825 a month, for a studio, to $2,400 a month for a two-bedroom. Set midway between the Grove Street and Journal Square PATH stations, the complex offers a free shuttle to the train.
Developers are building, and not just along the waterfront. Citywide, 2,610 units of housing are under construction and 11,405 more have been given the green light, according to the mayor's office. In fact, the city has enough developable land available to fill all of Hoboken, which is one square mile. But the construction is still not keeping pace with demand. In July there was only a two-month supply of available homes downtown, according to Liberty Realty.
''If you see a vacant building in Jersey City,'' said Joseph V. Covello, the owner of Liberty Realty, ''someone is bidding on it or renovating it.''
Mr. Fulop, too, is moving farther into the city. Two weeks before his election he sold his apartment, a fifth-floor walk-up in the desirable Paulus Hook neighborhood. Now he is renting in the Madox, a luxury boutique apartment house also in Paulus Hook. But he will leave the waterfront as soon as he closes on a brownstone near Liberty State Park.
This summer, the Greenpoint bookstore WORD hosted a reading at Barcade in Jersey City. More than 250 people showed up to hear Chuck Klosterman read from his new book of essays. WORD's owner, Christine Onorati, who plans to open her second bookstore near the Grove Street PATH station in September, found the event encouraging. ''The neighborhood is so receptive,'' she said. ''People who live there are so desperate for retail, because they love not having to leave Jersey City.''

HEADLINE: Ta-Ta, London. Hello, Awesome.

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL. 
A writer at large for The New York Times and the author of ''The Anglo Files: A Field Guide to the British.''

 BODY:
EVEN after 18 years, I never really knew where I stood with the English. Why did they keep apologizing? (Were they truly sorry?) Why were they so unenthusiastic about enthusiasm? Why was their Parliament full of classically educated grown-ups masquerading as unruly schoolchildren?
Why did rain surprise them? Why were they still obsessed by the Nazis? Why were they so rude about Scotland and Wales, when they all belonged to the same, very small country? And -- this was the hardest question of all -- what lay beneath their default social style, an indecipherable mille-feuille of politeness, awkwardness, embarrassment, irony, self-deprecation, arrogance, defensiveness and deflective humor?
Now that my spell as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times has ended and I've come back home -- if a place counts as home when you've been away for so long -- I've had some time to think about how Britain and America have changed, and how I have. 
When I got to London, it was a calmer time. The only terrorists anyone worried about were the ones from Ireland. Margaret Thatcher's Conservative revolution was winding down. Princess Diana had yet to reveal that there were three people in her marriage. David Beckham had yet to learn that he could make extra money by posing alluringly in his underpants. Rupert Murdoch's News of the World had yet to close in disgrace.
Meanwhile, Loyd Grossman, an American-born food-show host and purveyor of his own brand of spaghetti sauce, radiated from my television set like a piece of performance art representing the pitfalls of long-term expatriate-ism. The problem was his accent, a bizarre strangulated sui generis concoction that sounded as equally incomprehensible to English people as to Americans. It was not even mid-Atlantic, except in the sense that perhaps it was the way they used to speak in the lost city of Atlantis.
I resolved to hang on to my own accent, mainly by watching a lot of American TV, and to assimilate as best I could while remembering where I came from. What happens then is that you begin to see through the looking glass from both sides. I began to understand how America appeared from 3,000 miles away -- not just the things Britons admired, but the things they didn't.
And so a country where even Conservatives are proud of the nationalized health service cannot comprehend a system that leaves tens of millions of people unable to afford basic health care. A country that all but banned guns after the slaughter of 16 small children in Scotland in 1996 cannot understand why some Americans' response to mass shootings is to argue for more gun rights, not fewer.
Despite the sometimes immature behavior of Britain's legislators, they manage to enact laws without deliberately obstructing the running of the country. Britons are perplexed by the sclerotic hatred infecting so much political discourse in America. And not one Briton I ever met understood why being able to see Russia from Alaska was at one time apparently considered an acceptable foreign-policy credential for a prospective vice president.
Britons admire and consume American culture, but feel threatened by and angry at its excesses and global dominance. They are both envious and suspicious of Americans' ease and confidence in themselves. They want American approval but feel bad about seeking it. Like a teenager worried that his more popular friend is using him for extra math help but will snub him in the cafeteria, they are unduly exercised by the ''special relationship'' -- endlessly deconstructing what it meant, for instance, when in 2009 Gordon Brown, then the prime minister, gave President Obama a handsome penholder made of wood from a Victorian anti-slave ship, while Mr. Obama reportedly gave him a stack of movies that were incompatible with British DVD players.
Also, Britons are not automatically impressed by what I always thought were attractive American qualities -- straightforwardness, openness, can-doism, for starters -- and they suspect that our surface friendly optimism might possibly be fake. (I suspect that sometimes they might possibly be right.) Once, in an experiment designed to illustrate Britons' unease with the way Americans introduce themselves in social situations (in Britain, you're supposed to wait for the host to do it), I got a friend at a party we were having to go up to a man he had never met. ''Hi, I'm Stephen Bayley,'' my friend said, sticking out his hand.
''Is that supposed to be some sort of joke?'' the man responded.
The pursuit of happiness may be too garish a goal, it turns out, in the land of the pursuit of not-miserableness. After enough Britons respond with ''I can't complain'' when you ask them how they are, you begin to feel nostalgic about all those psyched Americans you left behind.
Sometimes in London I felt stupidly enthusiastic, like a Labrador puppy let loose in an antique store, or overly loud and gauche, like a guest who shows up at a memorial service wearing a Hawaiian shirt and traumatizes the mourners with intrusive personal questions.
Britain became more American while I lived there -- everyone did, thanks to the Internet and the global economy. By this spring, 25 percent of the adult population was obese, and doctors were calling the country ''the fat man of Europe.'' Like a pale cousin of the Republican Party, the Conservative Party began squabbling with itself.
The rise of the right-wing British National Party, coupled with the populist influence of the popular Daily Mail, shifted the political axis to the right; the government cut welfare spending and tightened the borders. Even as London transformed into an international town square, there was talk that Britain might pull out of the European Union.
But the British character lay underneath it all, and that never changed. Many of the stories I covered had to do with the question Britons have asked themselves incessantly since their empire fell: Who are we, and what is our place in the world? It wasn't until the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games last summer, with its music medleys and dancing nurses and quotes from Shakespeare and references to Mary Poppins and sly inclusion of the queen and depictions of the Industrial Revolution and compendiums of key moments in British television history, that the country seemed to have found some sort of answer.
It was a bold, ecstatic celebration of all sorts of things -- individuality, creativity, quirkiness, sense of humor, playfulness, rebelliousness and competence in the face of potential chaos -- and more than anything I have ever seen, it seemed to sum up what was great about Britain.
AMERICA has always been secure about its place in the world, though its self-belief is fraying a bit. But while Britain was figuring itself out, America was changing, too.
I've come back often, so it's not like it was a total shock. But while I wasn't paying attention, Arizona for some reason got its own Major League Baseball team. New York City's center of gravity shifted to Brooklyn, at least according to the people who live in Brooklyn.
In other developments, available phone numbers ran out, forcing the introduction of unpleasant new area codes. ''Awesome'' went from being a risible word used only by stoners and surfers to an acceptably ubiquitous modifier, the Starbucks of adjectives.
New York City Transit began kindly informing passengers how long they would have to wait until the next train. A few Americans started going only to restaurants with lovingly reared, locally sourced unpronounceable ingredients; the rest started going only to restaurants with All-U-Can-Eat Fat Plate specials.
The Kardashians arrived and would not leave.
Now that I'm back, I feel somewhat Loyd Grossman-ish. I am thrilled to be in a city that has the cultural advantage of having a garbage can on every corner, but sad to leave one whose mayor speaks off-the-cuff Latin, employs expressions like ''inverted pyramid of piffle'' and last summer compared the Olympic beach volleyball players to wet otters.
After years of using pound and euro coins, I find dollar bills cumbersome and idiotic. After years of living happily among Britons who by New York standards would be considered functioning alcoholics, I now find my old friends' tendency to order wine by the glass, not the bottle, unnecessarily Puritanical.
I've grown accustomed to British friends who, when it comes to personal matters, don't ask much, don't tell much and really, really, don't want to get into it. We lived for more than 15 years next to a couple who corresponded with us almost exclusively by letter. I have become an expert in the art of the anodyne weather discussion. I'm chronically sorry.
''Sorry,'' I said to a Metro-North conductor the other day, when I disrupted the swift completion of his progression through the train by asking what time we would get to my stop. ''No problem,'' he said, looking surprised at my apology, and so I apologized again, for apologizing.
It is enough to make your head spin. There I was at the Apple store the other day, asking basic technical questions and trying not to take up too much of anyone's mental space. I told the salesclerk that I had to change my address, since I'd just moved back.
He asked me a million questions: Why? Where was I going to live? How about my family? How did I feel?
He considered the whole thing for a moment -- me, the move, New York, life.
''Awesome!'' he said. And I think he really meant it.

HEADLINE: Delinquencies on the Decline

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
In another sign of an improving market, mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures are down significantly since last year -- although procedural impediments have tempered progress on the East Coast, especially in New York and New Jersey.
The national mortgage delinquency rate -- defined as borrowers at least 60 days past due on their payments -- shrank by 26 percent in the second quarter, when compared with the same period in 2012, according to TransUnion, a credit information service.
The delinquency rate is now 4.09 percent -- still about double prerecession levels, but on a downward trend, according to Tim Martin, the group vice president for United States housing in TransUnion's financial services business unit. ''We had a really good start to the year,'' he said. ''This is the third quarter in a row where we've had record improvements.'' 
Rising home prices and an improving job market are largely responsible for the turnaround. And mortgages issued in 2010 or since are performing well, which should bolster lender confidence, Mr. Martin said. In fact, a large majority of the delinquent mortgages date to 2007 or earlier.
''What's causing the high rates now is people who have been delinquent for a long time,'' Mr. Martin said. ''These are folks who took out mortgages before the house prices fell and haven't been able to recover yet.''
Florida and Nevada have the highest delinquency rates -- 9.9 and 7.7 percent. But just behind them are New Jersey, at 7.2 percent, and New York, at 5.7 percent.
''They are not the worst delinquency states,'' Mr. Martin said, ''but they've made the least progress since their peak out of other states in the country.''
Although neither New York nor New Jersey experienced the boom-and-bust scenario that dragged down the Florida and Nevada markets, their foreclosure timelines have been longer because of delays in the process, caused by logjams in state courts.
Sam Khater, the deputy chief economist of CoreLogic, a residential property information provider, described it this way: ''The real issue in New York and New Jersey is, you had a slow drip of water coming through, and the drain was plugged. Even a slow drip will build up after a while.''
This regional backup is also evident in foreclosure inventory levels. The three states with the biggest inventories were Florida (8.6 percent), New Jersey (6 percent) and New York (4.8 percent). Connecticut came in fourth, at 4.2 percent. But nationally, the number of homes in some stage of foreclosure had dropped off by 28 percent, to roughly 1 million, as of the end of June, according to a CoreLogic analysis.
''The bulk of the foreclosure problems have shifted East from the hardest-hit sand states,'' Mr. Khater said.
But he also notes that foreclosure levels remain two to three times higher than they were before the recession. From 2000 to 2006, completed foreclosures nationwide averaged 21,000 per month, versus 55,000 in June of this year.
''While there's been rapid improvement,'' he said, ''we're still a ways from what a normal market would look like.''
Mr. Martin predicted that it would take two more years for delinquency rates to reach normal levels. The rapid declines of the last several quarters will most likely slow with rising interest rates, which limits people's ability to refinance and buy homes. But the rate could still dip below 4 percent by the end of the year, he said. Essentially, the nature of the delinquent mortgages no longer looks so ominous.
''People can stop getting scared off by this big number,'' Mr. Martin said. ''It's just a bubble of folks who haven't worked their way through the process.''

HEADLINE: Building Boom

 BODY:
Parks, pedestrian plazas, stadiums -- and construction everywhere. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's legacy includes profound changes to the landscape of the city, among them 40,000 new buildings, shown in red. Graphic, Page 6 

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Turf War Over Asphalt: The mayor fought a war of attrition with the automobile. He sought to transform bicycling from a recreational activity into a real alternative to cars. By 2013, the city had added about 450 miles of bike lanes carved mostly from the city's roadways. Some curbs and medians were installed to separate pedalers from cars, but many of the lanes were demarcated simply with painted asphalt, much as blue paint divided automobiles from pedestrians along sections of Times Square and Broadway. Mr. Bloomberg lost his most ambitious offensive against cars when the State Legislature defeated his plan for ''congestion pricing'' in 2008, but he doubled down on biking with a popular bike-sharing system this year.

A Boom in New Housing: In spite of a recession and foreclosure crisis, the mayor presided over a boom in residential construction, encompassing everything from new aeries for the rich in Manhattan to disappearing vacant lots in the South Bronx. New York has added 40,000 new buildings since he took office, and the census counted an additional 170,000 housing units in 2010, up from 10 years earlier, more than any other city.

A Preference for Building: ''We have beaten the odds and the obstructionists over and over again,'' the mayor triumphantly declared in his State of the City address in March. He chose an appropriate venue: the Barclays Center, the new home of the Brooklyn Nets, which was a lightning rod for his all-out development policy. A vigorous opposition was beaten in the courts and the City Council in much the same way he often steamrolled opposition to his comprehensive rethinking of development. His 120 rezoning proposals were approved by the Council. The city arranged cheap public-backed financing for developers at a rate that dwarfed that of his predecessor, including bonds that helped build Barclays, as well as new stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets.

A Third of the City Rezoned Mr. Bloomberg and Amanda M. Burden, director of the Department of City Planning, rezoned 37 percent of the city and claimed credit for creating opportunities for high-density growth along subway corridors while preserving low-density neighborhoods. Critics said that this simply cleared the way for gentrification and that the city fell behind on building affordable housing for lower-income New Yorkers. An often-cited example is the dilapidated industrial waterfront in Williamsburg, now the city's nascent fifth skyline. Whether the luxury high-rises of Williamsburg are good or bad for the city is a matter of continuing debate among city politicians and residents, and is even a plot line in the HBO series ''Girls.'' (MB6)
Transforming Neighborhoods Whites and the college-educated moved into neighborhoods, like Harlem, that had been home to minorities and those with lower incomes. Rezoning encouraged inclusion of affordable units, but the poor were pushed out as housing prices rose. In the Melrose neighborhood of the Bronx, a host of developments drew enough new residents to drop the poverty rate in one census tract by 20 percentage points. But in some nearby tracts, poverty ranks swelled. In Queens, the city rezoned Hunters Point in Long Island City, a residential and commercial area behind an industrial waterfront, in 2004. Now, it has a high-rise skyline and a dozen new luxury medium-rise buildings scattered nearby. Population is up 2,000, but 600 poor people have left.

HEADLINE: The Constituents Speak

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Allison Kopicki, Marina Stefan and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
They stirred resistance at every turn, prompting predictions of economic doom, touching off years of lawsuits and spawning a cottage industry of jokes on late-night television.
But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's crusades to restrict smoking, encourage biking, expose calorie counts and sideline automobiles are now overwhelmingly embraced by New York City residents, according to a New York Times poll, making his experiments in behavioral modification an unexpectedly popular hallmark of his legacy.
In a stinging assessment of the mayor's priorities and effectiveness, however, two-thirds of New Yorkers say they believe that the quality of the city's long-troubled school system has stayed the same or become worse since he took office in 2002, despite his vigorous pledges to improve it.
Most New Yorkers say Mr. Bloomberg's policies have favored the rich over the middle class and the poor. And 70 percent say that as mayor, he has paid too much attention to Manhattan, rather than its surrounding, less well-off boroughs. 
Over all, the Times poll offers a portrait of a long-term relationship between mayor and city that remains deeply conflicted and contradictory, marked by almost loveless admiration and an unmistakable yearning for change as Mr. Bloomberg's third and final term winds to a close.
Asked to rate the 12 years of his mayoralty, 52 percent describe them as fair or poor, compared with 46 percent who label them as excellent or good.
When comparing him with past mayors, 38 percent rank Mr. Bloomberg as average -- a bracing evaluation for a man who thinks of himself as anything but. Still, 21 percent say he is above average and 15 percent say he is one of the best.
Since he become mayor, 40 percent say the quality of life in the city has stayed the same, 35 percent think it has become better, and 23 percent find it has gotten worse.
In the waning days of Mr. Bloomberg's tenure, New Yorkers are expressing a measure of affection for their 108th mayor, a sometimes prickly by-the-numbers manager who eschewed the role of emoter in chief. Fifty-four percent pronounce him ''likable.''
And despite his $27 billion fortune and a luxurious lifestyle, 55 percent of respondents say Mr. Bloomberg cares ''some'' or ''a lot'' about the needs and problems of people like themselves, compared with 43 percent who say he cares ''not much'' or ''not at all.''
In a follow-up interview after the poll was conducted, Dr. Mitchell J. Breidbart, a 55-year-old podiatrist in Queens, summed up the complex feelings about Mr. Bloomberg, praising him as noble for entering public service but complaining that his policies had left the city unaffordable.
''If I won the lottery I think I would stop working, and here's a rich guy who took on one of the most difficult jobs there is,'' Dr. Breidbart said. ''As far as the job he's done, he's not the worst mayor, but he's not the best, either.''
The poll of 1,029 adult New Yorkers was conducted Aug. 2 through 7. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.
The survey revealed the financial strains of everyday life during the Bloomberg era. Eighty-five percent say New York is becoming too expensive for people like them to live in. Nearly two-thirds say it is harder to make ends meet in New York than in other large American cities.
Gone are the days when New Yorkers sensed that their city government catered to the indigent: just 3 percent of residents say Mr. Bloomberg's policies have favored the poor.
But in a finding that might hearten Mr. Bloomberg, who once described New York City as a ''luxury product'' worth paying for, 64 percent say they will still want to be living in New York City four years from now.
Residents are evenly split, 44 percent to 45 percent, about whether Mr. Bloomberg's initiatives have done more to improve their lives or to interfere with them.
But when asked specifically about his signature policies, they express broad support for most, suggesting that philosophical objections yielded to acceptance once the measures were put in place.
Eighty-two percent approve of his smoking ban inside restaurants and bars; 81 percent approve of his requirement that fast-food chains post calorie counts on menus; 85 percent approve of his mandate that restaurants display the letter grades given to them by the city; 72 percent approve of the pedestrian plazas he ordered installed around the city; 64 percent approve of the bike lanes he had constructed; and 73 percent approve of the bike-sharing program he created.
New Yorkers, who pride themselves on their fiercely independent style, have come to respect, and even like, Mr. Bloomberg's brand of elbows-out interventionism in their lives.
''Look at the ground,'' said Marvin Gruza, 50, an accountant in Queens. ''When you walk into the city it's a different city. You have bike lanes. Yes, construction and change is painful, but people will look back in 10 or 15 years and say we're glad he made us do it.''
There are two glaring exceptions, however.
By a wide margin, people disapprove of his attempt to reduce obesity by limiting sales of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces. Fifty-nine percent object to the regulation, which was struck down by a state court this year and, unlike Mr. Bloomberg's other health rules, never enforced.
There is equally strong opposition to the mayor's dismantling of the city's Board of Education in 2002. Fifty-seven percent now disapprove -- a sign of dissatisfaction with the mayor's handling of education since the State Legislature granted him much greater authority over the system.
The poll shows a profound sense of unease over the state of the public schools, whose reinvention Mr. Bloomberg had put at the center of his mayoralty and his legacy. He has raised teacher pay, closed failing schools, rolled out a letter-grade system for evaluating schools and made it harder for instructors to gain tenure.
Yet of those surveyed, 32 percent say public education has not changed during Mr. Bloomberg's three terms; the same percentage say it has grown worse; and 26 percent say it has improved.
Phyllis Rudnick, a 77-year-old former teacher who lives in the Far Rockaway section of Queens, recalled the difficulty of watching families learn that their local schools would be shut down.
''Parents were so unhappy. They fight so hard to keep schools open,'' Ms. Rudnick said. ''After 12 years of being mayor, the best thing you can do is shut down a school and start over?''
Perhaps no set of municipal statistics has given Mr. Bloomberg greater pride than the city's plunging crime rates, which have reached records lows during his tenure.
Nevertheless, less than half of the public -- 44 percent -- believe that crime has actually decreased during his time as mayor; 35 percent say it has stayed the same; and 17 percent say it has increased. That perception may be influenced by the large drop in crime under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, his immediate predecessor.
Gavin Johnson, 39, from the Bronx, said Mayor Bloomberg has ''had his problems, but they have been smaller problems, especially with the police.''
''There have been issues with the stop-and-frisk,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''but fewer police shootings -- nothing really to scar his term.''
The stop-and-frisk policing tactic, which the city credits with reducing gun violence, is as polarizing as ever: 50 percent approve of it and 47 percent disapprove of it, according to the poll, which was conducted before a federal judge ruled Monday that the city's use of the procedure violated New Yorkers' rights by, in effect, singling out young black and Hispanic men. Approval for the tactic is lowest among black residents, 28 percent of whom support it, compared with 55 percent of whites and 59 percent of Hispanics.
While 49 percent of New Yorkers approve of Mr. Bloomberg's job performance, black residents do so at a significantly lower rate (38 percent) than whites (55 percent) or Hispanics (49 percent).
Still, Mr. Bloomberg can claim credit for having vastly improved the city's race relations, an accomplishment that eluded the previous two mayors.
Throughout the administrations of Mr. Giuliani and David N. Dinkins, the percentage of New Yorkers who rated race relations as ''generally good'' mostly hovered in the mid-20s and 30s, dipping to a low of 19 percent in 1993.
Soon after Mr. Bloomberg's election, the figure shot up to 63 percent as he defused racial tensions by avoiding incendiary rhetoric and forging close ties to civil rights leaders like the Rev. Al Sharpton. He leaves office with 59 percent describing race relations as generally good.
Speculation about Mr. Bloomberg's future after City Hall, a topic that consumes the city's political class, arouses equally strong opinions from its citizens.
Two-thirds think he is either very likely or somewhat likely to seek public office in the future. But 50 percent seem displeased by the prospect, saying he should not bother. Of those who say he should run for another office, the largest group wants his political aspirations to remain within the state, as a candidate for governor. New Yorkers do not, however, wish to see Mr. Bloomberg stay too close to home. Were he somehow allowed to seek a fourth term as mayor, a majority, 57 percent, say they would not vote for him.

HEADLINE: Foreign Investment in Mexican Oil

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico proposed ambitious constitutional reforms last week that would allow foreigners to invest in Mexico's nationalized oil industry for the first time in 75 years. Such a change could help revive the country's energy sector and give its economy a much-needed lift. 
Mexico has one of the world's largest reserves of oil and natural gas, but its production has been declining in recent years because the government oil monopoly, Petróleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, does not have the money or expertise to extract fossil fuels from deepwater wells and shale formations. It produced about 2.6 million barrels of crude oil per day last year, down 20 percent from 2002.
Since the oil sector accounts for 16 percent of the country's exports and about one-third of its government revenue, the decline in production has forced the government to run bigger fiscal deficits. Reversing the trend would benefit Mexico; doing so would also make the United States less dependent on energy imports from the Middle East because it is the biggest importer of Mexican oil.
Mr. Peña Nieto, a politician who came into office last year with big promises of change, wants to allow Pemex to enter into partnerships with foreign oil companies to increase production. His proposal, which requires a change in the Constitution, would allow foreigners to share the risks and profits associated with production but would keep ownership of the oil reserves in Mexican hands. Big American and European companies would have preferred to be allowed to own the oil, but even Mr. Peña Nieto's plan represents a huge change because many Mexicans still oppose any foreign involvement in the oil sector.
Mexico was the first major oil-producing country to nationalize the industry, in 1938. Since then, various leaders who have proposed letting foreign oil companies back in have been stymied by political opposition, even from within their own parties. The latest proposal has the support of one major opposition party, and that greatly improves its chances. Leaders of another opposition party, however, have pledged to organize protests against it.
Mr. Peña Nieto has already pushed through important telecommunications and broadcasting reforms that should bolster the Mexican economy. Changing policies on foreign partnerships on oil and gas will be a lot harder, but it could promise big returns.

HEADLINE: Bicycling for Thinner Texans and New Businesses

BYLINE: By AMAN BATHEJA. 
abatheja@texastribune.org

 BODY:
In Fort Worth, the mayor hosts occasional bicycle rides called Rolling Town Halls. The Dallas City Council may soon require new businesses to set aside space for bicycle parking. Over in El Paso, officials are developing plans for a bike-share system, which is expected to be the fifth such program in the state after Austin's makes its debut this year.
In car-clogged communities around Texas, a biking movement is gaining speed. Midsize and large cities are expanding bike trails and putting roads on ''lane diets'' to accommodate bike lanes.
''Biking has just exploded over the last year in Houston,'' said Laura Spanjian, director of Mayor Annise Parker's office of sustainability. 
While curbing traffic and air pollution prompted earlier interest in such initiatives, those concerns are now overshadowed in some cities by other motivating factors, particularly boosts to public health, quality of life and economic development.
''It's really being embraced for solving a lot of problems. It's not this sort of fringe tree-hugger issue anymore,'' said Linda DuPriest, a former bicycle-pedestrian program coordinator for Austin who is now a senior planner for Alta Planning + Design, a Portland, Ore.-based design firm that focuses on bike infrastructure. In June, Ms. DuPriest opened the agency's Texas office in Dallas.
''Texas is really ripe'' for an expansion in bike infrastructure, said Mia Birk, the firm's president and a former bicycle program manager with the City of Portland, widely regarded as a national model for biking infrastructure. ''There's so many cities that are growing and thriving, and really looking for ways to create healthier opportunities for residents and businesses.''
Rising obesity rates across the country have drawn increased attention to Texas, where two-thirds of residents are overweight or clinically obese. The unwanted publicity of landing high on various ''fattest cities'' lists has heightened interest in doing more to encourage bicycle use, according to some city officials.
''I think what made city leaders take notice is we kept getting on lists that didn't look so good for the city,'' said Julia Murphy, a biking manager in San Antonio's sustainability department. ''We were all tired of having that reputation.''
In Brownsville, the health argument, along with the prospect of drawing more jobs to the border city, has helped increase support for expanding bike lanes and closing off some city streets several times a year for biking events, according to Ramiro Gonzalez, the city's planning director.
''We have a high obesity rate here in Brownsville, so the idea kind of stemmed out from that,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. ''The research shows it's just a domino effect. If you have a healthier population, you might attract different kinds of business and corporations.''
For many longtime biking advocates, there is a sense of momentum around Texas that was not there even a few years ago.
''People who are trying to attract people and businesses to their cities get it,'' said Robin Stallings of BikeTexas, an advocacy group. ''If they want to get their kids to come back after college, if they want to get any kind of high-tech industry, they need this stuff.''
''Our population is trending younger, and I think younger populations are wanting more density and want to live closer to where they live, play, shop and eat,'' Ms. Spanjian said.
The recent creation and expansion of bike-share systems in three Texas cities has both promoted biking and fueled increased calls for expanding biking infrastructure in those communities. San Antonio introduced the state's first bike-share system in 2011 with 13 stations, Ms. Murphy said. By the end of August, the city will have 52 stations and 500 bikes.
Houston followed suit in 2012, and then Fort Worth began its system in April. Austin plans to have the first 10 stations of a planned 40-station system operating by the end of this year.
In all four cities, initial financing for the bike-share systems came from a mix of public grants and private donations and sponsorships.
''I don't think it's a coincidence that within two years of each other, we have four Texas cities with bike-share programs,'' Ms. Spanjian said.
Developing such programs in Texas poses unique challenges, Ms. Birk said, because the cities are more spread out and less crowded than in many other states. ''When you have very high density but that smaller footprint, you also have a competition over space and a lot of humans debating how we use that space,'' Ms. Birk said. Many Texas cities, she said, have almost the opposite problem: so much space that it is more difficult to convince people that biking is a practical way to get around.
Advocates often stress the value of biking for short trips and as a means of connecting with public transportation.
''About two to three miles is the sweet spot where it really can be more efficient and faster to take a bike,'' said Annick Beaudet, a City of Austin planner who had previously worked as bicycle program manager for the city.
Gannon Gries, who moved to Fort Worth in 2004, regularly commutes via bike to his office at a downtown architectural firm. The three-mile route, and biking in the city in general, has become easier in recent years, he said.
''When I first started, there were no bike lanes, no nothing -- just the Trinity Trails around the river,'' Mr. Gries said. ''Now there's a lot more signage, and there's dedicated lanes.''
In Texas, where strong population growth has lawmakers in a constant search for more highway construction financing, city officials are balancing efforts to maintain and expand vehicular capacity while still encouraging new bike lanes and trails.
Julia McCleeary, a Fort Worth senior planner, said the city's strategy had been to encourage cyclists to use roads that were originally built to accommodate more traffic than they currently receive.
''They were roads that perhaps served a greater purpose 40 years ago, but now that there's a freeway nearby, there's a lot of excess capacity,'' she said.
Advocates say the goal is to see bicycle use become more common around the state, even if, in most cases, bikes only supplement a transportation routine that still relies more on automobiles.
''We're not trying to take away cars,'' Ms. Murphy said. ''That's the fine line you walk. Our media campaign is 'There's enough road to go around.' ''

HEADLINE: In Absence of New Revenue Bonds, Universities Delaying Projects

BYLINE: By REEVE HAMILTON. 
rhamilton@texastribune.org

 BODY:
The University of Houston-Clear Lake, which is scheduled to become to a four-year university in 2014, had sought support from the Texas Legislature for new science and academic support facilities that administrators hope to open in 2017.
But a package of tuition revenue bonds to provide more than $2.7 billion to support about 60 campus construction projects around the state was not approved during the last legislative session, despite broad, bipartisan support. And during the three subsequent special sessions, Gov. Rick Perry did not add the issue to the agenda. 
William A. Staples, the president of U.H.-Clear Lake, said the institution's plan to begin accepting underclassmen would proceed as planned.
''The challenge will come in about three years,'' Mr. Staples said. He said he was hopeful that the Legislature would make financing available in 2015. ''If not,'' he said, ''then we will have to really limit the number of freshmen and sophomores we can take on a yearly basis due to the lack of new facilities.''
Following yet another session without tuition revenue bonds since the last round was authorized in 2006, many universities -- especially smaller, regional ones -- are delaying their projects.
''It's tougher on the regional campuses,'' said John Sharp, the chancellor of the Texas A&M University System. ''They don't have the leverage that we do at our flagship, which is big enough where we can go in the private sector and see if someone will partner with us.''
Gary Susswein, a spokesman for the University of Texas at Austin, which sought $95 million in tuition revenue bonds for a new $310 million engineering education center, said officials there are hopeful they can find an alternative source of funding.
''We need this building,'' he said. ''It is essential, and we are looking for ways to get this done.''
But for several institutions, finding other options can be difficult. In an e-mail, Eugene Bourgeois, provost and vice president for academic affairs at Texas State University, wrote, ''At this stage, we have no contingency plan for addressing space needs for our two highest-priority facilities: an engineering and science building for our main campus and a health professions building for our Round Rock campus.''
(The Texas A&M University System, the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas State University System are corporate sponsors of The Texas Tribune.)
Senator Judith Zaffirini, Democrat of Laredo, expressed surprise that Mr. Perry did not add tuition revenue bonds to the agenda in the final special session, especially after he indicated he would consider other items once his priorities had been addressed.
''Rick Perry doesn't bluff,'' Ms. Zaffirini said. ''He doesn't play games. Usually, he's pretty frank. I felt, given my history of experience with him, if he had not intended to put it on, he would have told me so.''
The chairman of the Senate Higher Education Committee, Senator Kel Seliger, Republican of Amarillo, characterized the need to improve some university facilities, including a storm-damaged library at Texas Southern University, as ''emergencies.''
In a statement, Lucy Nashed, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry, said, ''As all state agencies and Texas families have to do, it is up to the institutions to prioritize spending and determine the best and most efficient ways to provide a quality higher education to their students.''
The chairman of the House Higher Education Committee, Representative Dan Branch, Republican of Dallas, hinted at a silver lining. ''While the Legislature missed the opportunity to help our universities commence these needed projects sooner rather than later,'' he said, ''our institutions have learned to do more with less.''
Ms. Zaffirini and Mr. Seliger both said they planned to reintroduce legislation on campus construction at the next opportunity.
Mr. Seliger said he would prefer to pay for projects using money from the state's Economic Stabilization Fund and might pursue that route.

HEADLINE: Why Innovation Is Still Capitalism's Star

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.

 BODY:
CAPITALISM is culture. To sustain it, laws and institutions are important, but the more fundamental role is played by the basic human spirit of independence and initiative.
The decisive role of the ''spirit of capitalism'' is an old concept, going back at least to Max Weber, but it needs refreshing today with new evidence and new thinking. Edmund S. Phelps, a professor of economics at Columbia University and a Nobel laureate, has written an interesting new book on the subject. It's called ''Mass Flourishing: How Grassroots Innovation Created Jobs, Challenge and Change'' (Princeton University Press), and it contains a complex new analysis of the importance of an entrepreneurial culture.
Professor Phelps discerns a troubling trend in many countries, however, even the United States. He is worried about corporatism, a political philosophy in which economic activity is controlled by large interest groups or the government. Once corporatism takes hold in a society, he says, people don't adequately appreciate the contributions and the travails of individuals who create and innovate. An economy with a corporatist culture can copy and even outgrow others for a while, he says, but, in the end, it will always be left behind. Only an entrepreneurial culture can lead. 
Is the United States really becoming corporatist? I don't entirely agree with such a notion. Even so, President Obama has been talking a lot about innovation as a job creator this year, and while some of his intentions may be good, I'm afraid that some of his proposals look a little corporatist, and might suppress individual initiative.
In his State of the Union address in January, for example, the president proposed that the government should create 15 new ''innovation institutes,'' modeled on a public-private partnership that he helped start in Youngstown, Ohio, that is devoted to developing 3-D printers. There was more in this vein in his administration's 2014 budget, offered in April. And in a speech on July 30 in Chattanooga, Tenn., Mr. Obama suggested extending the number of innovation institutes to 45, or almost one for every state. The institutes, he said, would be ''getting businesses, universities, communities all to work together to develop centers of high-tech industries all throughout the United States.''
Will such measures work? Should the government really be trying to start a 3-D printer center? And why in Youngstown? It is easy to be skeptical of such a plan, especially when it was started in a swing state just before the presidential election. Web sites of the two senators and two representatives introducing bills this month supporting the president's latest proposals are suggesting, in not-too-subtle terms, that the legislation would bring jobs to their own states.
Successful companies aren't usually started this way. Professor Phelps, citing a McKinsey study, suggests that in free-market capitalism, ''from 10,000 business ideas, 1,000 firms are founded, 100 receive venture capital, 20 go on to raise capital in an initial public offering, and two become market leaders.'' It is easy to doubt, as Professor Phelps does, that the odds are favorable for a Youngstown 3-D printer center.
How you view the innovation institutes, and the topic of capitalism and culture, may depend on your own experience. Many people have never seen the hatching of a successful business idea. That makes it hard to judge the subtle changes that may be occurring in the nation's culture and in its potential for innovation.
My own business experience has certainly helped shape my thinking. Yale, like many other universities, sensibly allows its professors to spend limited time in business, providing the opportunity for faculty members to gain valuable experience outside of the ivory tower and to offer their technical skill to the business world.
In 1991, I started a business with Karl Case, an economics professor at Wellesley College, and Allan Weiss, a former student of mine at Yale. We called it Case Shiller Weiss, Inc., and it was devoted to an innovation we dreamed up. The idea was a new ''repeat sale'' home price index -- which would track the changes in the value of the same houses over time.
At the time, this was an entirely new line of business. And, at first, that posed a problem: we were spectacularly unsuccessful in raising money. We talked to venture capitalists and their committees, to no avail. They just didn't seem to get our business plan. We must have appeared odd to them -- overly academic, perhaps. One remarked that we'd do better proposing a new shopping center.
But we went ahead with our idea anyway. At first, Allan worked without pay. A friend of Professor Case, Chuck Longfield, contributed some money. And in 1995, I took out a home equity line of credit on my house in New Haven so I could personally lend more money to help keep our business afloat. The experience was stressful, especially when adding it to the burdens of my main job, as a professor. I have much to thank my wife, Virginia, for her tolerance of my overwork and my worrying, and for allowing me to put our family savings at risk.
In the end, our business was successful, and I think a big part of it was that we relied on our own ideas and energy and, to a large extent, our own money. In 2002, we sold the business to Fiserv Inc., then licensed Standard & Poor's to create what are now known as the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. In 2006, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange began trading futures on 11 of our indexes. Fiserv sold the index business to CoreLogic early this year.
In short, our business made its mark without any help from the government.
This little real-life experiment convinces me that committees of experts, even at smart venture capital firms, will often not recognize real innovation. I think that America's business success through the decades has occurred because we have so many people with specialized knowledge who are willing to put their money, time and resources on the line for ideas that can't be proved to a committee.
THAT experience may also help explain why I think the new crowdfunding initiative, started by the Jobs Act that the president signed last year, is an exciting step forward. It's all about finding and mobilizing people who really understand specific, hard-to-prove ideas for important investments.
At the same time, other of my experiences incline me to think that government-appointed committees of experts can help set the stage for an entrepreneurial culture, under certain limited circumstances.
Long before I started any commercial ventures of my own, I received some federal government support -- in the form of National Science Foundation research grants, awarded to me decades ago as a young professor. They allowed me to do research, and though it was not directly related to my later business endeavors, the process developed my expertise and reinforced a sense of entrepreneurial opportunity.
These grants were awarded competitively, based on the quality of the proposals, and gave me experience with a system focused on creating opportunities for those who try hard. Later, from 1983 to 1985, I evaluated others' proposals when I served on the foundation's panel for economics. Observing the process from the government side convinced me that the foundation really works. Maybe it's because the panelists are chosen from successful scientists, who serve anonymously out of public spirit.
In any case, as Professor Phelps has argued, direct government involvement in capitalism is a delicate thing. The system's success depends on subtle cultural factors -- and these require careful nurturing.

One of the worst things about Michael Bloomberg being the mayor is that because he was so rich, he didn't have to appeal to what he kept calling the ''special interest groups'' -- which, you know, I would call the ''citizens.''
I don't think public school teachers are a special interest group; I don't think cops are a special interest group; I don't think tenants are a special interest group. Billionaires are a special interest group. So when he says that anyone who is running for mayor is going to have to make concessions to these special interest groups -- that is what democracy is. Not issuing bans and demands.
He thinks of himself as the public health mayor. How many hospitals closed under Bloomberg? Hospitals: that's public health. Smoking, soda, salt? That's private health. And what could be more minute? I mean, I've never heard anyone say, '' 'Do you like New York?' 'Mmm, not really, too salty.' '' 
When he announced this soda thing, someone showed me the size soda that you couldn't have. I didn't know those existed. My first apartment was smaller than that. I think maybe in Abu Ghraib they make you drink that soda. It seems like a crazy amount of soda; it doesn't mean I think it should be against the law.
Also, he's the ''green mayor''? He's the green mayor who travels by private jet. There is nothing more polluting than jet fuel. One of his little trips on his private jet, to wherever he goes on the weekend -- he doesn't tell us, that's his private life -- that is every cigarette ever smoked in the history of New York City.
I don't know how many of these bikes there are, but it seems like there are 80 million of them. I do not want to see 80 million ads for Citibank. When they first put them in, Bloomberg said, ''Wasn't that nice of Citibank? They gave us these bicycles.'' Really? Let me put it this way: I would rather see Citibank give us back our money, and then I would buy them a bicycle. And also maybe a skateboard, if they're really good.
The overturning of the term limits -- when this happens in another country, we call this a coup. We, the citizens, voted -- twice! -- to have term limits, and then he overturned them. I saw him give some press conference about guns. He said something like, ''I believe in democracy,'' and I thought, No, you don't. No, you certainly do not. Vladimir Putin has the same belief in democracy you do.
I really felt that during the election of the pope, Bloomberg was in a state of contained hysteria, trying to figure out, ''How can I get this gig?'' If I was in charge of electing the pope, I would elect him, because anything that would get him out of New York would be fine with me.

Walking through Brooklyn Bridge Park during its construction in 2010, the architecture critic Paul Goldberger turned to me and said, ''Michael Bloomberg will be remembered as the mayor who made great parks.'' From where we stood that day, this prediction was brimming with promise. Brooklyn Bridge Park itself was the largest park project to have occurred in Brooklyn in recent memory. Looking over to Manhattan we could see the East River Park renovation under way, and to the left Governors Island, with its clear potential as a public place.
Many other projects have reinvented New York's public landscape: the Bronx River park system, the Fresh Kills landfill transformation, the High Line, Hudson River Park, a pedestrian-friendly Times Square, and bicycle lanes in streets long dominated by cars.
Over all, Mr. Bloomberg has added about 800 acres of new parkland to the city, the vast majority of it outside Manhattan; and he has invested record amounts in revitalizing old parks. The aim is now for every New Yorker to live within 10 minutes of a park. A mayor who made parks, indeed.
Michael Bloomberg took office at a time when many citizens and community groups were changing what urban life could be. But he also brought his own sense of the moment. He realized, as New York's great mayors and planners have in the past, that public parks make city life joyful and healthful. During the Bloomberg years, an entire public landscape has taken shape, a feat comparable to that of Fiorello La Guardia and Robert Moses in the 1930s. While La Guardia and Moses had access to federal work relief funds, Mayor Bloomberg had to summon the courage to use city tax dollars for the creation of these new urban landscapes. He recognized the need to invest in critical infrastructure while also putting people to work.
But the genius of park creation has never been about one person, even a mayor. The public -- specifically, people who attend meetings and enliven the process of park planning -- have been the driving force of this Bloomberg era of accomplishment. Those who have advocated for parks will need to continue to demand of elected officials that our city persist in becoming a great place to live, raise children and grow old. Mr. Bloomberg knew this need, sensed the energy and seized the opportunities. That is when the parks started happening. Under Mayor Mike's tenure, New York became a better place to live.

I've met Mayor Bloomberg on several occasions, but nothing compares to the first time. It was at Red Rooster, and I can remember the night so well. Wolfgang Puck was in the house, and Alicia Keys was sitting in a booth next to the church ladies, who were still in their hats and gossiping away. The mayor walked in with about eight or nine people and I could see on his face that he was excited to be there.
The first thing he said to me was, ''How many people have you hired from Harlem?'' I proudly told him 75 percent of our staff were from the neighborhood. He seemed satisfied as he finished his dinner and headed downtown. I know that he was really asking about my commitment to Harlem and New York City.
The way Mr. Bloomberg never wavered in his commitment to improving New York after he became mayor following 9/11 still inspires me today, particularly as a resident and business owner in Harlem. The mayor has taught me to encourage people to build their lives in Harlem, to work hard and to have a deep love for the city. In our neighborhood, we've had 15 new restaurants open on the blocks around Red Rooster in the last three years, and combined we serve more than a thousand people a night, half who are local and half who are visitors to the neighborhood. That's a number the mayor would be very proud of.

I guess it's been O.K. I haven't been mugged or transfatted in a while. I drink Coke out of tiny glass bottles, if at all, and I don't even look at heroin. Yeah, it's fine. Thing is I'm bored. And boring. You should hear the stuff that comes out of my mouth. Blah, blah, blah, bike lanes. Blah, blah, blah, shoyu-style ramen.
I used to shout from foreign rooftops about New York's diversity (''No wonder they attacked us, we're so freaking diverse!''), but the last decade has been all about the rise of the T.B.I., the Truly Boring Immigrant. We've colonized most of Manhattan and the string of artisanal villages that is brownstone Brooklyn. Only Elmhurst, Queens, and points east are safe from the dull tread of our Common Projects sneakers.
Lately, I've gone even farther out, to a village upstate. My neighbors are a bunch of sheep. On some nights, the coyotes attack them and this really cool working-class immigrant, an Australian sheepdog, tries to keep her charges safe. There's howling and barking and bleating, and it all kind of sounds like how New York used to be.
Yeah, sometimes things don't turn out well, but you know what? Life ends in death. Except in Manhattan, where free of transfats and bathed in kale juice, our high net worth citizenry just might live forever.

Michael Bloomberg has made New York City sing over the past 12 years -- not because of his ear for music, but his eye for numbers. The city today is more vibrant and on sounder managerial footing in large part because of his data-driven approach. He has often said, ''You can't change it if you can't measure it.'' And the city will be better positioned for decades because of his efforts to broaden its commercial base beyond the traditional industries of finance, real estate and insurance, and attract more scientists, engineers, technologists and inventors.
N.Y.U.'s Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) was spawned by one of the Bloomberg administration's most ambitious efforts, the Applied Sciences Initiative, to bring more science and technology to New York. CUSP is pioneering the field of ''urban informatics,'' the application of Big Data to address the challenges faced by cities around the world, and will welcome its inaugural graduate class at the end of this month. Only New York City, CUSP's laboratory and classroom, has the scale, variety and ambition to lead the world in creating these new technologies. Their application will improve the quality of life, support commercial and economic development, enhance scientific understanding, and help anchor an entire new sector in New York.
On a personal note, the city to which I've recently returned after an absence of almost 50 years is very different from the one in which I grew up and attended high school. It's safer, cleaner and works better while remaining one of the world's most exciting cities. This mayor's legacy is that he positioned New York to continue to thrive for the next 50 years.
Rosie Perez
is an actress and the chairwoman of the artistic board of the Urban Arts Partnership.
Early in his tenure, Mayor Bloomberg made it clear he wanted to be seen as New York City's ''Education Mayor,'' and the bold changes he proposed for the public school system were so radical they made everyone's head spin. Although I suspect he would like to be known as the mayor who raised graduation rates and finally brought accountability to a failing system, I doubt that will be the case. I think Mr. Bloomberg will actually be remembered as the champion of the small schools movement, which is the one innovation that will be almost impossible for any incoming mayor to reverse.
In his tenure, the city closed 164 large failing schools, and replaced them with 656 smaller and more manageable ones. At times his approach was unapologetic and brutal. As the artistic chairwoman at Urban Arts Partnership, one of the city's largest arts education providers, I've been a supporter of the mayor's strategy in this regard, maybe because I went to a New York City public school and I know how a kid in a large failing high school can get lost in the shuffle.
When I walk down the hallway of New Design High School, one of the five small schools Urban Arts has helped to found in partnership with the New York City Department of Education, the kids come up to me, look me in the eye, shake my hand. I listen to their dreams and ask them where they're going to college.
It's very hard for a kid to be anonymous in a small school like New Design. I can't tell you how many kids I have seen go from a scowling ninth grader to an accomplished senior, winning scholarships to prestigious colleges. The arts have the ability to make these kinds of transformations in students, and there is a special relationship between the arts and the small schools movement.
However, Mr. Bloomberg's reputation as a supporter of the arts has not translated into more arts in all schools. Mr. Bloomberg's empowerment of principals as C.E.O.'s has created a culture where principals are held accountable only for test scores and graduation rates; whether they provide arts education in their schools is largely up to them. If a principal wants to spend all her money on math and English test prep -- so be it. So while the arts thrive in some schools, in others they are nonexistent. The lack of a clear strategy to provide high-quality arts instruction for every child in New York City public schools leaves a mark on Michael Bloomberg's permanent record.
Caleb Carr
is author of ''The Alienist'' and other books.
When Michael Bloomberg finally leaves office, we may rely on pervasive testimonials concerning the manner in which he has made the city cleaner, safer, more attractive to business and a hive of new development; and many of these assessments will even have the virtue of being true. What is less likely to be discussed is the cost of all this supposed civic improvement to the soul of the city.
The influx of wealth and the super-wealthy from around the world has meant the exodus of those creative New Yorkers who gave the city its own unique romance -- and heart. This is part of the ''he cleaned up crime'' aspect of Bloomberg's legacy: For it was the city's seedy, crime-ridden neighborhoods that could offer cheap housing not only to the middle and lower classes of workers and business owners, but to artists, writers and musicians.
Within the lifetime of many of us, SoHo was a trucking district one ventured into at night at peril to one's safety, but it was also sheltering many of the greatest American artists of the 20th century. Greenwich Village and the Hudson waterfront were still rife with very dangerous street gangs, but writers unequaled in the years since were also occupying ancient apartments in the neighborhood. In the 1960s and '70s, Hell's Kitchen was still living up to its name, but that allowed dramatists to create the Off and Off Off Broadway theater worlds. And in the '70s and '80s, the infamous Lower East Side produced what was arguably the last stand of New York music, the punk and new wave movements.
But why, if this regrettable, soul-sucking transformation of the city was conducted, for the most part, in the open, did New Yorkers not protest more vigorously? A comparative few did, but those comparative few were as nothing against the tide of new citizens with far more self-centered concerns, the first of which was safety. And here Mr. Bloomberg demonstrated a no-prisoners stance that was much to the liking of a city traumatized by the 9/11 attacks. That his policies opened his administration to justifiable accusations of racial profiling has never seemed to bother him.
In the end, cleanliness stands as the only goal that seems to have escaped the mayor. According to Travel and Leisure in 2012, New York ranked as the ''Dirtiest American City,'' due to its overflowing street trash. Perhaps some bit of the old city has survived, and will be revitalized under a new chief executive. We can but hope. But money, once it eats up a place, very rarely spits it out again.
Felix Rohatyn
is a former chairman of New York's Municipal Assistance Corporation and a former United States ambassador to France.
In 1999, Michael Bloomberg attended a meeting of American and French corporate chief executives at the United States Embassy in Paris, where I was serving as ambassador to France. Of the two dozen or so C.E.O.'s present, he was the only one who had founded the company he ran, Bloomberg L.P. He described his global business and financial information company and the explosion of digital and technological know-how that was changing how organizations did business. He told his fellow executives that technology was transforming their companies as we met, and that to thrive, firms must harness it. He was smart, pragmatic, incisive and confident. Mike Bloomberg didn't strike one as politic or particularly compromising, but as a futurist, able to see where things were headed more clearly than most of us could.
When he ran for mayor two years later, the terrorist attacks of 9/11 had left New Yorkers in grave doubt about the city's future. We needed a leader who was future-oriented and had a gift for most often getting things right.
I had gotten a taste of New York City politics during the fiscal crisis of the '70s, when Gov. Hugh Carey asked me to chair the Municipal Assistance Corporation. Among other things, I found that skills acquired in a financial career didn't always translate into an ability to govern effectively. Mr. Bloomberg, however, transported his management style and operational model to City Hall and never looked back.
When he ran for re-election as a Republican, I joined a group called Democrats for Bloomberg. Political party was not an issue. The mayor had little interest in partisan politics, which helped him govern independently. With public policies and initiatives, he didn't get everything he wanted, but he always pressed forward. Over the years, I disagreed with a few of the mayor's proposals and supported others, such as congestion pricing, which unfortunately never got done. I also supported his efforts to modernize New York's public transportation and infrastructure. He may not have reached all his goals for New York in this area, but through his foundation he has worked to help cities around the world build modern, environment-friendly public transport systems.
Michael Bloomberg has been the global mayor of the most global of cities. He sees New York City at the center of an interconnected, interdependent world, and he thinks big. His leadership helped New York rapidly recover from our darkest days. He also saw the city through a global economic crisis that had our financial industry -- the core of New York's economy -- teetering on the brink. The mayor will leave New York City sound, solvent and hopeful -- with profound challenges ahead but strongly positioned to meet them.
Mark Green
was the public advocate and then the Democratic mayoral nominee against Mr. Bloomberg in 2001; he is the host of the national radio show ''Both Sides Now.''
While he doesn't publicly talk about his rank as the world's 13th-wealthiest person, it would be as naïve to ignore his billions in discussing Mayor Bloomberg's legacy as it would the sled in ''Citizen Kane.''
Nearly all successful politicians work their way to the top by immersing themselves in communities to learn what people think and need -- what Lincoln called his ''public baths.'' Mr. Bloomberg, however, was no rail-splitter feeling people's pain, but rather a brilliant businessman who made a successful tender offer for the city. The result: a mayor independent of contributors and voters, as well as a leader lacking noticeable sympathy and empathy.
Old habits didn't die in office. So no town halls in outer boroughs, no Listening Tours, lots of black-tie galas in Manhattan, spreading millions around town to cultural and religious leaders, threatening to retaliate financially against politicians standing in his way. All very quiet. He became the most powerful mayor in the city's history because he fused in one place political power, philanthropic power and media power. How did he spend this extraordinary political and personal capital?
First, based on his closed-loop rationale that more money to the rich meant more revenue for New York City, his mayoralty embodied trickle-down urbanism. Can anyone think of a contest between capital and labor -- living wage, minimum wage, sick leave, progressive taxes -- when Mr. Bloomberg sided with average families? He rightly made sure that Manhattan kept attracting high-value talent, especially to the finance and tech sector. But the growing income and wealth gap in the city over his 12 years took a bite out of our Big Apple story.
Second, he also used his extraordinary muscle to overturn two voter referendums on term limits. Democracy can be so annoying.
Third was Mr. Bloomberg's genuine passion for public health. Look at his excellent health commissioners, Citi Bikes on his bike lanes, more green space, his 2030 sustainability plan -- and of course his gutsy crusades against tobacco and guns. He swatted away taunts of being a ''national nanny,'' knowing his efforts would save thousands of lives and billions of dollars.
There were pluses and minuses to the reign of the Medici in Italy -- and Mr. Bloomberg in New York. Was our bargain with a benevolent billionaire worth it?
The trains ran more on time, though they derailed from time to time (Jets Stadium, Cathie Black, whites ''not profiled enough,'' No-Test-Left-Behind producing few gains). He brought the city together by avoiding racial rhetoric and embracing the Muslim Cultural Center, yet divided it by a stop-and-frisk fixation that unconstitutionally profiled minorities, according to a federal judge the other day.
My guess: because an imperial style kept him from connecting with New Yawkers, Mr. Bloomberg's post-City Hall legacy as a King Canute literally shouting at the tides and the N.R.A. will be even bigger than his legacy as mayor.

THE MARCH ON WASHINGTONJobs, Freedom, and the Forgotten History of Civil Rights
By William P. JonesIllustrated. 296 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $26.95.
The 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington is bringing forth innumerable commemorations and reminiscences in all forms. But memories of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ''I Have a Dream'' speech that Aug. 28 afternoon always threaten to overwhelm, if not obliterate, other aspects of what still remains the most famous mass gathering in American history. 
William P. Jones, a history professor at the University of Wisconsin and the author of a well-regarded study of Southern black lumber workers, has chosen to emphasize the march's roots and prehistory in the black trade union movement. His focus in ''The March on Washington'' is on A. Philip Randolph, the longtime president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, who from World War II into the mid-1960s was the universally acknowledged dean of American civil rights leaders. Seventy-four years old in 1963, Randolph had first come to nationwide -- that is, white -- attention in 1941, when his threat to stage a march on Washington to protest racial discrimination prompted Franklin Roosevelt to summon him to the White House and, just one week later, issue an executive order prohibiting workplace discrimination throughout defense industries. Roosevelt's decisive action led Randolph to call off the scheduled march, and while compliance with Roosevelt's order was widely flouted, Randolph's efforts to maintain a March on Washington movement dissipated well before the war's end in 1945.
Jones's most valuable contribution in ''The March on Washington'' is in detailing the activities of black trade unionists, women as well as men, as they fought employment discrimination across the postwar decades. He also provides a cogent account of the racial divisions that racked the A.F.L.-C.I.O. during the late 1950s, culminating in a public censure of Randolph for what hostile white union leaders claimed were his ''unfair and untrue allegations'' about the pervasiveness of racial discrimination within many unions. As Jones rightly observes, decade after decade Randolph ''displayed a level of confidence and independence that is rarely seen in political movements.''
Anyone who approaches ''The March on Washington'' anticipating a richly detailed, book-length account of the actual march, however, will be sorely disappointed, for Jones devotes only one chapter out of six to the events of 1963. Another chapter provides an entirely competent but wholly unoriginal account of the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56, and Jones's familiarity with labor movement figures does not extend to the Southern freedom movement. Within three successive sentences the Rev. Joseph Lowery appears as ''Lowry,'' the Rev. Theodore Jemison as ''Jamison'' and Randolph and King's adviser Stanley Levison as ''Levinson.'' Terroristic violence experienced by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Greenwood, Miss., is mislocated in Greenville, Miss.
What's more, Jones's fine effort to trace the labor-movement origins of the march in the years up to 1963 is not matched by similar attention to decisive events in the months immediately before August. In late January, the longtime Randolph associate Bayard Rustin, together with two younger associates, Norman Hill and Tom Kahn, presented Randolph with a three-page memo describing how a ''mass descent'' upon Washington, with as many as 100,000 participants, could highlight ''the economic subordination of the American Negro'' and the need for ''the creation of more jobs for all Americans.'' Rustin and Randolph's attention to employment and economics is fully in line with Jones's perspective, but ''The March on Washington'' devotes less than one paragraph to that crucial document. Jones's extensive bibliography omits any mention of either Rustin's or Kahn's papers, both of which are readily available, and lists no oral histories or interviews with Hill or other surviving march organizers.
Randolph and Rustin's vision would be incorporated into the demonstration's formal name -- the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom -- but popular understanding of the event virtually never acknowledges how significant a challenge to existing American society the two men intended. As Rustin and his colleagues stated in their planning memo, ''integration in the fields of education, housing, transportation and public accommodations will be of limited extent and duration so long as fundamental economic inequality along racial lines persists.''
What made the march a reality, however, was not the decades of thinking by Randolph and others, but the May 1963 demonstrations in Birmingham, Ala., mounted by King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference and its local allies. Peacefully targeting segregated public accommodations and drawing a response of snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses directed against black schoolchildren, the Birmingham demonstrations attracted widespread news coverage that thrust the civil rights movement onto the national -- and presidential -- agenda to a far greater extent than ever before.
''We are on the threshold of a significant breakthrough, and the greatest weapon is the mass demonstration,'' King told his close friend Levison in a telephone call wiretapped by the F.B.I. Because of Birmingham, King went on, ''we are at the point where we can mobilize all of this righteous indignation into a powerful mass movement,'' and even the mere threat of a march on Washington might so ''frighten'' President Kennedy that he would send a meaningful civil rights bill to Congress.
Less than 10 days later, on June 11, Kennedy did just that in a nationwide television address, and an overjoyed King told Levison ''he was really great.'' Still, planning for the march went ahead, and as the Aug. 28 date approached, Kennedy summoned Randolph, King and other civil rights leaders to the White House to try to dissuade them from proceeding. He was politely rebuffed. By mid-July, as Rustin steadily built an organization of staff members, volunteers and black trade unionists, Kennedy accepted the inevitable and endorsed the march.
Most publicity in the month before the march portrayed it as a rally to press reluctant white members of Congress to back Kennedy's civil rights bill, but King stressed that it sought ''to arouse the conscience of the nation over the economic plight of the Negro.'' When the day itself arrived, Jones notes, Randolph began the program by declaring that ''real freedom will require many changes in the nation's political and social philosophies and institutions.'' Drawing a crowd of more than 200,000 people -- vastly more than the original goal of 100,000 -- the event was, as Jones writes, ''an unmitigated success,'' highlighted of course by the ''compelling vision of interracial harmony'' offered in King's closing address.
Jones ends ''The March on Washington'' with a brief survey of civil rights developments into 1964 and early 1965, but regrettably fails to extend his account to address the ''Freedom Budget for All Americans'' that Randolph and Rustin, with the endorsement of King and many other luminaries, put forward in 1966. With the twin goals of achieving full employment and wiping out poverty by 1975, the Freedom Budget offered a truly radical agenda for America's future. Even sympathetic liberal senators dismissed it as ''utterly unrealistic,'' but it was entirely in accord with everything Randolph, Rustin and King had intended on Aug. 28, 1963. Just days later Rustin emphasized that the march was ''not a climax but a new beginning,'' yet its actual agenda remains just as unrealized as that of the Freedom Budget.

NIGHT FILMMarisha Pessl
602 pp. Random House. $28.
The true believers come out at night. They meet in condemned buildings marked by the symbol of a stylized eye to watch a ''night film'' -- one of the psychologically punishing horror pictures of Stanislas Cordova, a master filmmaker who has shunned publicity with a zeal that makes Thomas Pynchon look like a shameless attention hog. Adding to the mystique is a sense that Cordova might have retreated because he has something unsavory to hide. Bad things happen to those who try to pick his locked closet for a look at the skeletons. Consider the star reporter Scott McGrath, who plunged into disgrace after a preliminary investigation into Cordova's secrets blew up in his face. McGrath has a score to settle, so when Cordova's achingly gifted daughter turns up dead in a Manhattan ruin, it's Take 2 for the unemployed journalist. Nor is McGrath the only one who wants to know what's been going on behind the camera; in short order he's joined by a shabby but smoldering drug dealer named Hopper and a breathless ingénue, Nora Halliday. Together, the three make an adorably awkward family of misfits, who will be even more appealing should George Clooney, Ryan Gosling and Alison Brie be cast for the movie adaptation. 
No one can accuse Marisha Pessl of unfamiliarity with the tools of the modern thriller. With pages of faked-up old photos, invented Web sites and satellite maps, ''Night Film'' -- Pessl's second novel, following ''Special Topics in Calamity Physics'' (2006) -- asserts itself as a multimedia presentation more than an old-fashioned book. There are over a hundred chapters, most of the James Patterson two-page variety, a technique that adds a giddy accelerant to Pessl's already zippy pacing. She also italicizes two or three sentences a page, an insecure tic like a child poking you in the ribs to ask if you're paying attention. Unfortunately, all those italics serve to draw the reader's notice to exactly the wrong sort of lines, clunkers like ''It was too quiet'' and ''Had I just sealed myself inside my own coffin?'' Pessl is capable of fine prose, so her willingness to serve up ''Hardy Boys'' nuggets like these suggests she's willfully dumbing herself down. Still and all, ''Night Film'' has been precision-engineered to be read at high velocity, and its energy would be the envy of any summer blockbuster. Your average writer of thrillers should lust for Pessl's deft touch with character. Here's McGrath on his ex-wife:
''When I met Cynthia our sophomore year at the University of Michigan, she was flighty and poor, a French studies major who quoted Simone de Beauvoir. She wiped her runny nose on her coat sleeve when it was snowing, stuck her head out of car windows the way dogs do, the wind fireworking her hair. That woman was gone now. Not that it was her fault. Vast fortunes did that to people. It took them to the cleaners, cruelly starched and steam-pressed them so all their raw edges, all the dirt and hunger and guileless laughter, were ironed out. Few survived real money.''
Cordova himself -- a dark riff on Kubrick, with a pinch of Friedkin and a sprig of Banksy thrown in for good measure -- stays offstage, casting his long, creepy shadow across the actors throughout the course of the drama. Pessl would like ''Night Film'' to work as a meditation on the question of whether one must be a monster to effectively portray the monstrous in art (quick real-world answer: no). But her conception of the monstrous is sweetly innocent. The book leaps from bondage clubs to mental hospitals to witchcraft supply stores, as if evil were more a matter of setting than a person's actions. To be fair, the witchcraft emporium -- which turns out to be like a voodoo Apple store, right down to the Genius Bar in back -- is an exquisitely charming side trip. But the evil-as-scenery tactic grows wearisome in the novel's central set piece, when the heroes break into Cordova's sprawling compound in a scene that lasts almost 50 pages and feels at least twice that. In the first two-thirds of the book, Pessl captures the feel of one of Kubrick's compact, relentless chillers, but during this not-quite-climactic climax, ''Night Film'' begins to feel more like one of his glacially paced statements -- ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' without the redeeming value of celebrity nudity.
For all we get about Cordova and his films (the story lines, memorable characters, favorite motifs and symbols, casts, costumes, everything except what there was to eat at the craft service table), the story isn't really about him at all but about his daughter, Ashley, an equally larger-than-life figure, matter to his antimatter. ''Did she fall or was she pushed'' is maybe a less intellectual concern than what a work of art reveals about the artist, but it serves Pessl better. Ashley Cordova at least feels like a person, whereas her father feels more like the world's most sinister IMDb entry. She's busy, anyway: she records a virtuoso piano performance at 14, lights a man on fire, escapes a mental ward and has more than a little of the devil in her. (This last is not necessarily a metaphorical statement.) I'm not sure the reader ever becomes fully invested in her either, but no matter. Piecing together the events of Ashley's last days keeps the heroes moving and in constant contact with a personality that does connect: Manhattan itself, in her best-looking summer dress. In a book of colorful settings, this is a backdrop that refuses to drop back. Pessl's renderings of Chinese grocery stores, tattoo boutiques and the dog run in Washington Square Park are bound to remind readers of the grungy thrills of a whole different director: Martin Scorsese. Cue the Rolling Stones.
More crucially, the mystery of Ashley's death gives the heroes plenty of opportunities to leap into trouble, fast-talk their way out of it and gradually wake to the realization that they love one another. Pessl is at her best here, when she's least ambitious and her focus is pinned to her three amateur detectives as they negotiate the unmapped terrain of affection and trust in sweet, breezy dialogue: ''I told you. I love you. And not as a friend or a boss, but real love. I've known it for 24 hours,'' Nora tells McGrath, who responds, ''Sounds like a stomach bug that will pass.''
In simple, unadorned moments like these, when her heroes seem at least as interested in one another as in a dead girl or absent auteur, ''Night Film'' settles into the relaxed rhythms of a Ross Macdonald mystery, with a dirt and hunger and guileless laughter that are all Pessl's own.

HEADLINE: 'Where Do You Go To Buy Back Your Reputation When You Lose It?'

BYLINE: By PAT JORDAN

 BODY:
Peter Berg wanted me to box with him. ''Come on, you're a tough guy,'' he said. I tried to disabuse him of that notion. I told him I'd been in only one fight in my adult life, and I lost that one.
 
We went to Team Tapia Boxing Academy in Albuquerque, where Berg was scouting locations for the film he had written and was directing, ''Lone Survivor,'' based on a book with the same title about a Navy SEAL mission in Afghanistan that went terribly wrong in 2005. Berg fell in love with boxing when he was a 14-year-old freshman at the Taft School in Connecticut. ''I was on fire,'' he said, ''a seething ball of energy moving at a speed I couldn't explain.'' He was angry and disruptive ''and diagnosed as a troublemaker,'' he said. ''Today it'd be A.D.H.D., and I'd be Ritalined up.'' Instead a dean took him after class to his basement, where Berg and other disruptive students learned ''to dissipate all our energy'' by fighting. Boxing calmed him. ''You can't box angry,'' he said. ''You have to be disciplined. Before boxing, I was this angry kid ready to fight if someone said, 'Hello.' ''
Through boxing, Berg became fascinated with what he referred to as ''the psychology of violence,'' which has informed most of the things he has directed or acted in. Sports violence (''Friday Night Lights,'' ''The Great White Hype''); criminal violence (''Very Bad Things,'' ''The Last Seduction''); and military violence (''A Midnight Clear,'' ''The Kingdom,'' ''Battleship,'' ''Lone Survivor''). But violence on the screen is never as viscerally satisfying as it is in the ring. ''There's a truth to the violence of boxing,'' Berg said. ''You have a very real threat, an opponent.'' Movie violence is make believe.
At Tapia, the manager taped up my hands while Berg shadowboxed in the ring, waiting for me. Berg is 51, hyperactive and lean, his long arms rippled with muscles and veins. Once my gloves were on, I pounded them together and stood up.
Later that night I called my wife. She asked how the boxing went. I said, ''I broke Peter's jaw.'' She said, ''I hope he can still talk.'' I told her I was kidding. It was make-believe. I got a lesson on the heavy bag instead.
The next night, Berg told me to meet him for dinner at a steakhouse on the outskirts of Albuquerque. I waited at the bar till Berg rushed in late, looking spent, and sat down. He'd been at Kirtland Air Force Base checking out ''choppers'' -- Berg likes to use military jargon -- and also scouting mountains for the big shootout between the Taliban and the SEALs. (In the movie, which is due out at the end of this year, the shootout comes across as one of the most realistic depictions of close-in combat in film.) ''I must have climbed 30 mountains,'' he said. ''We need different locations because we couldn't get access to Indian land.'' He raised his eyebrows. ''It's sacred, except for the land with casinos on it, I guess.''
Berg was exhausting himself making ''Lone Survivor'' on the cheap. A 42-day shoot, a $40 million budget, a list of producers as long as his arm whose only required movie expertise was the ability to fork over at least a million dollars to get a credit -- and still, his team was scuffling around for money until a few weeks before filming was about to start last fall. ''Universal will release it,'' he said, ''but I have to deliver the finished film to them.'' Berg had been trying to make ''Lone Survivor'' for five years. ''I'm a patriot,'' he said. ''I admire our military, their character, code of honor, belief systems. I lived with the SEALs, their families, went to their funerals. I went to Iraq. Did you ever see anyone killed? I did.'' Berg is infatuated with heroes, military, sports and, sometimes, because of his teenage years, misfits.
He was directing for scale, the minimum salary allowed by the Directors Guild (which in this case was $17,000 a week), and had got most of his crew and actors (including Taylor Kitsch and Mark Wahlberg) to work at a discount too. No one worked for scale on his most recent movie, ''Battleship,'' which was supposed to be the summer blockbuster of 2012. Instead it was one of the biggest science-fiction-movie busts in the history of the genre. ''Battleship'' had problems from its inception, beginning with the idea of trying to make a movie out of a board game. Berg knew ''Battleship'' was in trouble even before it was released. When we spoke by phone last summer, he told me: ''You should go see it. It's fun, but leave your brain outside the theater.''
Berg was supposed to make ''Lone Survivor'' first, then ''Battleship,'' but Universal wanted him to reverse the order. ''I couldn't say no to that challenge,'' he said. Berg was confident because his first foray into big-summer-movie mode, ''Hancock,'' starring Will Smith, took in more than $600 million at the box office. After years of working on smaller productions, ''I felt I had a new understanding of what went into making a blockbuster,'' he said. ''I got a taste of a film's global power. But I discounted the effect of Will Smith on 'Hancock's' success. I thought I could pull off 'Battleship' without a big star.'' He suggested he couldn't afford one: nearly half of the movie's $200 million budget went to special effects, spaceships and aliens. There was nothing left to pay a Will Smith.
I asked Berg how much the failure of ''Battleship'' hurt him, his career. ''It didn't help,'' he said. ''But the perception wasn't that Peter Berg screwed up.'' It was that he threw himself under the bus to try to save a flawed project for backers who would then reward him by helping him make the movie he really wanted to make, ''Lone Survivor.'' His bosses held him hostage, in a sense. ''Where do you go to buy back your reputation when you lose it?'' he asked. His answer: Make a small, low-budget, emotionally powerful film that is truly patriotic, about real human beings, Navy SEALs, in a real life-or-death situation. Berg told me the lesson he learned from ''Battleship'' was ''I don't want to tackle that kind of economic project for quite a while.''
The work he loves most, and seems best at, is making small films based on real stories. ''Friday Night Lights,'' about a high-school football team in Texas based on a nonfiction book written by Berg's cousin, Buzz Bissinger, was a successful movie that spawned the TV series of the same name. I asked Berg if that made his career. ''It didn't hurt,'' he said.
Now ''Lone Survivor'' offers a chance to remake his career after ''Battleship.'' But he says the only pressure he feels is to do the SEALs and their families justice. That's why he lived with them, as he did with Texas high-school football players. ''I love that kind of research,'' he said. He once researched a TV series by living in the psychiatric ward of Bellevue Hospital, where, he said, ''I started to question my own sanity.'' I asked him if he worried about not being let out. He didn't smile. Berg is a serious man.
The following morning we were driving before sunrise over a rutted dirt road that led to mountains in the distance. We passed an abandoned racetrack, and then we were deep into the hardscrabble hills: rocks, gray dirt, a few bushes, a moonscape. Berg's assistant, Francis Keao, a burly man from Hawaii, was driving while Berg slouched low in his seat beside him, groggy from a lack of sleep.
We rode in silence until we came upon a herd of wild horses standing perfectly still on either side of the road. They were beautiful, thin and sleek, pintos that stared at us blankly. I asked, ''Will they end up in your movie?''
''Only if I can find their agent to broker a deal,'' Berg said. ''But I can promise you there will be goats.'' He was referring to a pivotal scene in ''Lone Survivor'' when the SEALs, deep in the Afghan mountains, are surprised by three Afghan goatherds. The four SEALs are confronted with a dilemma: Do they kill the goatherds to keep their presence unknown, or do they let the men go, and risk having their position reported to the Taliban? ''That's why I wanted to do the movie,'' Berg said. ''They were confronted with such a complicated moral decision.'' The SEALs decide to let the Afghans go. Shortly afterward, the SEALs are ambushed by the Taliban, who eventually kill all but one of the soldiers, Marcus Luttrell, who makes it home to write his book.
Berg got his love of the military from his father, whom he described as ''a hard-assed ex-Marine'' and, in later life, one of the real Mad Men. He was an ad executive for Grey Advertising. ''You know,'' Berg said, ''three-martini lunches, the bar car on the train back to Chappaqua.'' Wives would wait at the foot of the platform and catch their husbands as they got off the train. ''But there was no judgment about it.'' (Later a Universal publicist told me, ''Peter's parents don't do interviews.'')
We came to signs that read ''Lone Survivor location up ahead.'' The place was a private ranch, and now there were cows all around us. ''These aren't wild,'' Berg said. ''They will be eaten.'' Then he added: ''The wild horses don't hang with the cows. They don't have much respect for cows.''
We pulled into a clearing, a patch of dirt, at the base of the mountains. As if cued, the sun came up, like a stage spot turned on by a lighting director.
While we waited for the rest of the crew to arrive by bus, Berg began telling me he never had a desire to be an actor. He wanted to be an athlete when he enrolled in Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn. Then one day a theater professor told him the school was going to close down the theater department because it didn't have enough students. ''I didn't want to sign up, but he made me,'' Berg said. Quickly, at 18, Berg came to love the theater -- acting, writing, lighting, building sets were new outlets for his energy. What he loved most about the theater was that ''it was a family thing, and there were hot girls'' and really messed-up guys, he said. ''For some reason I fit in. I'm not sure why. I guess I was intrigued as much by misfits as by heroes.'' He'd envisioned himself as the latter but was beginning to realize that he might be the former. Of all the roles in the theater, he was least enamored of actors, however. They were manipulated by directors and writers. Their craft couldn't exist unless they were given dialogue, a character, a story from the writers. The writers created something out of nothing. Furthermore, Berg valued real physical activity more than the illusion of it created by actors.
''I love actors,'' Berg said. ''I'm empathetic to them. I understand what they go through. But I didn't want to be an actor.''
He became one anyway. After he left college, he moved to L.A. and got jobs working behind the scenes in the movie business. But he always managed to lose them, or be fired, actually. He didn't respect money or authority, and didn't want ''anyone to have power over me.'' But to survive he took on acting jobs from 1989 to 1994, when he came to the public's attention playing a not-too-bright sexual stud in the low-budget independent film ''The Last Seduction,'' starring Linda Fiorentino. ''It was supposed to be a nothing film,'' he said, ''and it went straight to HBO. But it got such great critical reception it was then released to theaters.'' It won awards, and for the first time people in the business noticed Berg.
A year later, he got a recurring role in the TV drama ''Chicago Hope,'' which led to his directing an episode. That led in turn, a year later, to his first feature-film-writing-and-directing effort, ''Very Bad Things.'' Critics savaged its bloody violence, which made some people laugh and others ''run out of the theater sick to their stomachs,'' according to Berg. The movie, a hysterically funny black comedy about a Las Vegas bachelor party that goes very bad -- a dead prostitute, others killed in the cover-up -- was the work of an angry mind. (''I was going through a divorce,'' Berg said. ''I was full of violent confusion, rage.'') It wasn't till ''Friday Night Lights'' a few years later, in 2004, that his career moved past the darkness of ''Very Bad Things.''
In the early-morning sunlight, Berg hiked vigorously up a mountain as about 30 crew members and producers, who were not in the same shape as he, struggled to keep up with him. Berg is a director out of the John Huston mold, very physical. ''We're going to make this mountain look more majestic than the ones in Afghanistan,'' he said to me. He pointed to his right. ''We'll put some pinyon trees there.'' He pointed to his left. ''And we'll tear out those pine trees. We'll blow things up. Hopefully nothing alive.''
He stopped halfway up the steep mountain beside what looked like a hide-out: huge tree trunks bleached white as bone, laid one on top of another, where the SEALs could hide and from which they could fire at the Taliban above them. The tree trunks were bought at an Indian reservation, trucked over and hoisted up on the mountainside by a crane.
Standing above the hide-out, Berg gestured with his hands toward the rocks behind him and said to his crew: ''There's a lot of loose rock there. We don't want anyone swallowed up by an avalanche.'' The stunt coordinator said, ''I feel confident about that.'' Berg said, ''The four SEALs will come tumbling down here, but we need more bushes.'' A crew member made notes. At the top of the mountain there were jagged stone cliffs. Berg looked at them and said, ''I'd like them to look higher.'' A crew member said, ''We'll make them look higher by putting in some cliffs from Santa Fe.''
Berg said, ''Can I get four SEALs under the logs?'' Four crew members got under the logs. Berg looked at his script and said: ''The Taliban's coming down, one of the SEALs gets shot here. Can I get an R.P.G. hitting the hide-out?'' He was referring to a rocket-propelled grenade. A crew member said, ''We can use a controlled explosion and flying balsa-wood splinters.''
Berg asked the people under the logs to fire uphill. They aimed imaginary guns over the logs and shot at imaginary Taliban. Berg cupped his hands into an imaginary camera lens and looked up the mountain. ''I'd like to see a couple of Taliban get shot to slow them down.''
Then he hiked up the mountain. Only a few of the crew members followed him. The rest stayed behind. Berg's longtime producing partner, Sarah Aubrey, introduced herself to me. She wore a baseball cap and big sunglasses.
Berg was high above us now, standing at the top of the mountain, looking down as the Taliban would while shooting at the SEALs. He stayed there for a long while, moving among the rocks, looking down through his cupped hands.
An hour later, as we were walking back to Berg's S.U.V., Berg said to me: ''Those rock cliffs, where the Eagle Warrior Spirit lives -- to the SEALs that's a noble place to die. The SEALs rarely call the Taliban 'terrorists' because they respect them as worthy opponents. The Russians found that out. Now we are.''
We drove over to the Afghan village that set designers had built in a valley surrounded by pine trees. Berg walked among the adobe huts. ''It doesn't look lived in,'' he said. ''It's supposed to be 100 years old.'' A crew member said, ''It will be.'' Berg stopped in the dusty street, knelt down and lowered his head to show how an Afghan was to be beheaded.
It was almost noon now, and hot in the sun. Berg wrinkled his nose. ''What's that pungent smell?'' He looked down at all the cow dung flattened around the village. ''That's not healthy, breathing in cow [expletive],'' he said. He took off his sweatshirt and wrapped it around his face so that only his eyes showed. He walked to a mud-brick wall that surrounded a hut and asked a crew member how quickly the wall could be reset after being hit by an R.P.G. The crew member said, ''A few hours.'' Berg looked annoyed. ''What if I want to reshoot?'' The crew member said, ''We can reset with wet mortar.'' Berg said: ''Will the dirt explode? Can we match every bullet hole? Maybe get a bunch of . . . birds and stuff to fly out of the hut.'' The crew member began to explain. Berg silenced him with his hand. Berg put his hand to his forehead, thinking. Someone was talking. The assistant director said firmly, ''Silence, please!'' After a long moment Berg looked up and said, ''I'd like to blow up that wall.'' Someone said, ''It could be expensive.'' Berg asked how much, then shrugged. ''O.K., just tear it up a little. Blowing it up makes me nervous.''
We ate lunch outside at a picnic table near the Afghan village. I sat at a table with Kitsch and Wahlberg, Berg and Aubrey. The actors' faces were blackened, and they wore military camouflage. Real SEALs were acting as advisers on the film. They took the actors into the mountains and taught them how to fire M-4 machine guns and R.P.G.'s and how to act like real SEALs in battle. Throughout the morning the mountains echoed with the pops of M-4's. But now at lunch, everything was quiet. The actors ate, joked around, laughed. The SEALs stood off by themselves, eating standing up, in silence. They were ordinary-looking men in baseball caps, T-shirts, jeans. Many of them were big, well over 6-foot-2, 230 pounds. Wahlberg was 5-foot-8, maybe 155 pounds. Yet he looked more like a SEAL than they did, at least a film version of a SEAL.
Berg said that what defines SEALs is their ''extraordinary competitiveness. It's not that they're stronger or more violent, it's that if you ask them to throw rocks at a hill, they'll do it until they drop. It's about will.'' I asked how they were adjusting to helping make a movie. ''They'd prefer to be anonymous,'' he said. ''They don't covet attention. They even resist a project that glorifies them.''
I asked him if I could talk to Wahlberg and Kitsch, whom I hadn't been able to speak with at lunch. ''Sure,'' he said. ''Why don't you come to rehearsal tomorrow? You can watch them read through and then talk to them.''
After lunch, Berg's assistant Keao drove Berg, Aubrey and me to the mountain where the goatherds scene would be shot. It was in a national forest that had an overlook and a paved parking area. Berg told me, ''The rangers won't let us bring any living goats here if brown bears have displayed aggressive tendencies.'' (The potential conflict was resolved by putting up an electric fence to keep the goats from wandering off.)
When we were walking back to Berg's S.U.V. at the end of a long day, I asked him what time rehearsal was tomorrow. He looked at me sheepishly and said: ''Well, there's a problem. The actors don't want you to sit in. A writer in rehearsal would distract them.'' He shrugged, helpless.
Behind me, Aubrey reiterated, ''The actors want a closed rehearsal, so I'm afraid you can't.''
The next morning, I went to the I-25 Studios in Albuquerque for the first production meeting with most of the film's crew. More than 40 people -- producers, set designers, director of photography, makeup, carpenters, costumers, lighting, special effects and so on -- sat around a long, right-angled U of tables, eating breakfast and waiting for the meeting to begin at 8:30 a.m.
Twenty minutes after that, Berg came rushing it. Someone shouted, ''All rise!'' and there was laughter. ''I'm sorry I was late,'' Berg said, ''but I was working, not sleeping.'' Someone whispered, ''He was writing.''
''We all know you're working for less money as a favor to me,'' he said. ''We appreciate it. Whatever your rate that you're working for, we won't tell anyone, so it won't affect your future rate. This is a no-frills movie.''
For the next few hours, Berg and the crew went through parts of the script to make sure the crew members were aware of their responsibilities.
Later that afternoon I followed Berg and some of the crew onto Stage B, in a hangarlike building where most of the interior sets had been built. We were joined by Luttrell and his wife, Melanie, who were holding hands. Luttrell is a big man, 6-foot-4, 240 pounds, a little soft now, not as hard as he was in Afghanistan. Wahlberg was playing him.
Berg told me that when he first met Luttrell, he invited him to stay at his house in Los Angeles. ''He was up all night, sitting on the sofa like he was haunted,'' Berg said. Haunted, yes, by the things he experienced in Afghanistan, but haunted too by the realization, Luttrell told me, that ''nothing you can ever do will give you the rush you get in combat. Everything else in life is boring.'' Then he met Melanie. ''She changed his life,'' Berg said.
Luttrell told me that what he liked about Berg was ''that he didn't sugarcoat anything, and he wanted to honor the guys who died on that mountain. I deferred to him, he's the pro, but I gave him my opinions too, and left. Yeah, I guess you could say we're true friends. From the outside Peter's fascination with SEALs looks like hero worship. He has an open-door policy for SEALs. Sometimes he wakes up, and there are five guys there'' -- at Berg's other home in Montana.
Berg led us into the first set, a long, low building with a narrow hallway and SEALs' bunk rooms on each side. Each reflected a different personality. One was filled with books -- Lee Child and Tony Hillerman thrillers. Another had a huge drawing of a Conan-like warrior on the wall and an American flag. Another had a New York Rangers pennant on the wall. The fourth wall was plastered with posters of half-naked porn stars. When I asked Luttrell why there were no photos of wives or girlfriends, he said it was because sometimes guys would photocopy pictures of someone's wife and paste them all over someone else's bunk as a prank. But he also said, ''We didn't want to think about home.''
The next set was the SEALs' supply room. Boxes of dummy ammunition, radios, hand grenades, bungee cords and M.R.E.'s -- Meals Ready to Eat. Berg stood at the head of a table, his crew around him, and opened an M.R.E. He said, ''Hmmm, ravioli.'' He tilted his head back and squeezed the contents of the package into his mouth. Berg chewed for a bit, then said, ''Not bad.''
The weight room was next. Racks of dumbbells, squat racks, weight-lifting machines, chin-up bars, boxing bags. While Luttrell explained to everyone how the SEALs worked out, Berg began punching the big bag. Smack! Smack! Smack! Then he went over to the chin-up bar and began doing chin-ups behind Luttrell as he talked.
The last set was the SEALs' lounge. Ping-Pong table, TV, sofa. Berg threw himself on the sofa and lay there, one arm draped over the edge theatrically. That Berg, the actor, is so unlike the private Berg that you can't help wondering if the actor in him is a personality trait he just can't shake.
At the end of the day Berg and I went to his office. He sat behind his desk, in a good mood now, excited that he would begin filming in a week. ''It's a good story,'' Berg said of ''Lone Survivor.'' ''Like Gary Sinise told me, 'Peter, it's all about the yarn.' '' And Berg couldn't have a better yarn than one about the ultimate sacrifice by true American heroes.
''Want to see something?'' he said. He took out his cellphone to show me a home video. ''My house in Montana,'' he said. ''The guy coming out of the snowy woods is a SEAL staying at my house. They're the best guests, neat, clean, self-contained.'' The SEAL was walking toward the house, shirtless, carrying something huge over his back. A woman's voice could be heard off-camera. ''Don't bring it in the house!'' The dead deer draped across the SEAL's shoulders dripped blood down the man's bare back. He threw the deer on the deck. The woman's voice said, ''Not on Peter's new deck!''
At Taft, Berg must have been one of those hyper, skinny kids with a chip on his shoulder, always ready to fight to prove his manhood. When he was researching ''Battleship,'' he spent three days on a Navy destroyer. When he was ready to leave, Berg made a short film for the benefit of the captain and crew. The captain ribbed Berg by telling him he was ''a Hollywood lame ass'' who couldn't understand the workings of a destroyer in only three days. Berg shot back that he'd seen a lot of Michael Bay films. He'd watched ''Pearl Harbor.'' So to settle their argument ''like men,'' in Berg's words, they played a board game of ''Battleship'' in front of the film crew and Navy sailors. A circling helicopter filmed their game while the Navy crew members cheered for their captain. After that, one of Berg's team said that the captain ''was a better actor than Pete, and Pete lost the game.''
Berg then disagreed: ''Thankfully, I pulled out a victory at the very end of the game.''

HEADLINE: Hiring in China By JPMorgan Under Scrutiny

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG, BEN PROTESS and DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
Federal authorities have opened a bribery investigation into whether JPMorgan Chase hired the children of powerful Chinese officials to help the bank win lucrative business in the booming nation, according to a confidential United States government document.
In one instance, the bank hired the son of a former Chinese banking regulator who is now the chairman of the China Everbright Group, a state-controlled financial conglomerate, according to the document, which was reviewed by The New York Times, as well as public records. After the chairman's son came on board, JPMorgan secured multiple coveted assignments from the Chinese conglomerate, including advising a subsidiary of the company on a stock offering, records show.
The Hong Kong office of JPMorgan also hired the daughter of a Chinese railway official. That official was later detained on accusations of doling out government contracts in exchange for cash bribes, the government document and public records show.
The former official's daughter came to JPMorgan at an opportune time for the New York-based bank: The China Railway Group, a state-controlled construction company that builds railways for the Chinese government, was in the process of selecting JPMorgan to advise on its plans to become a public company, a common move in China for businesses affiliated with the government. With JPMorgan's help, China Railway raised more than $5 billion when it went public in 2007. 
The focus of the civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission's anti-bribery unit has not been previously reported. JPMorgan -- which has had a number of run-ins lately with regulators, including one over a multibillion-dollar trading loss last year -- made an oblique reference to the inquiry in its quarterly filing this month. The filing stated that the S.E.C. had sought information about JPMorgan's ''employment of certain former employees in Hong Kong and its business relationships with certain clients.''
In May, according to a copy of the confidential government document, the S.E.C.'s anti-bribery unit requested from JPMorgan a battery of records about Tang Xiaoning. He is the son of Tang Shuangning, who since 2007 has been chairman of the China Everbright Group. Before that, the elder Mr. Tang was the vice chairman of China's top banking regulator.
The agency also inquired about JPMorgan's hiring of Zhang Xixi, the daughter of the railway official. Among other information, the S.E.C. sought ''documents sufficient to identify all persons involved in the decision to hire'' her.
The government document and public records do not definitively link JPMorgan's hiring practices to its ability to win business, nor do they suggest that the employees were unqualified. Furthermore, the records do not indicate that the employees helped JPMorgan secure business. The bank has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
Yet the S.E.C.'s request outlined in the confidential document hints at a broader hiring strategy at JPMorgan's Chinese offices. Authorities suspect that JPMorgan routinely hired young associates who hailed from well-connected Chinese families that ultimately offered the bank business. Beyond the daughter of the railway official, the S.E.C. document inquired about ''all JPMorgan employees who performed work for or on behalf of the Ministry of Railways'' over the last six-plus years.
A spokesman for JPMorgan said, ''We publicly disclosed this matter in our 10-Q filing last week, and are fully cooperating with regulators.''
The Ministry of Railways, which has since been restructured into various agencies, and the China Everbright Group did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the S.E.C. declined to comment.
Attempts over the weekend to reach Ms. Zhang and Tang Xiaoning, both of whom have left JPMorgan, were unsuccessful.
Western companies have been aggressive in trying to snag a share of riches in China's fast-growing economy in recent years. Some have come under fire over their business practices there, including GlaxoSmithKline, whose employees are said by Chinese officials to have confessed to bribing doctors to increase pharmaceutical sales.
Global companies also routinely hire the sons and daughters of leading Chinese politicians. What is unusual about JPMorgan is that it hired the children of officials of state-controlled companies.
It is even less common for American authorities to scrutinize such practices. Only a handful of Wall Street employees have ever faced bribery accusations, including a former Morgan Stanley executive in China who pleaded guilty to criminal charges in 2012, admitting to ''an effort to enrich himself and a Chinese government official.''
In recent years, the S.E.C. and the Justice Department have each stepped up their enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a 1977 federal law that essentially bans United States companies from giving ''anything of value'' to a foreign official to win ''an improper advantage'' in retaining business.
The S.E.C. created its own corrupt practices unit, which since 2010 has filed about 40 cases against companies like Tyco and Ralph Lauren. Over that same period, the Justice Department has leveled charges in more than 60 cases.
Legal experts note that there is nothing inherently illicit about hiring well-connected people. To run afoul of the law, a company must act with ''corrupt'' intent, or with the expectation of offering a job in exchange for government business.
''While the hire of a son or daughter itself is not illegal, red flags would be raised if the person hired was not qualified for the position, or, for example, if a firm never received business before and then lo and behold, the hire brought in business,'' said Michael Koehler, an expert on the corrupt practices act who is an assistant professor at the Southern Illinois University School of Law.
The inquiry into JPMorgan comes when the bank is already the focus of investigations in the United States by at least eight federal agencies, a state regulator and two foreign nations. Many of the cases, including a civil and criminal investigation in California, involve JPMorgan's financial-crisis-era mortgage business.
The multitude of cases has led some lawmakers to question whether JPMorgan, which has operations in more than 60 countries, is too big to manage.
The potential perils of JPMorgan's size also came to light with a multibillion-dollar trading blowup last year that came to be known as the ''London Whale.'' The trading losses, stemming from a bad bet on the exotic financial instruments known as derivatives, prompted Congressional hearings and wide-ranging investigations.
On Wednesday, federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced criminal charges against two of the bank's former traders in London, accusing them of masking the size of the $6 billion loss.
The S.E.C., conducting a parallel investigation, is seeking to extract a rare admission of wrongdoing from the bank related to the losses. A settlement, which could come as soon as this fall, will also include a hefty fine, according to people briefed on the matter.
The agency's bribery inquiry could pose an even steeper challenge to JPMorgan. Although banks are prone to the occasional trading blunder -- JPMorgan produced record quarterly profits despite the losses in London last year -- a corruption inquiry could leave a more lasting mark on its reputation. It might also spur the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation.
The families of the ruling elite in China see great value in finding work at Wall Street banks. While the jobs often pay token sums, finding such work bolsters the résumés of aspiring financiers and lends credibility in the Chinese business world.
In the case of Mr. Tang, the S.E.C. is seeking his salary, ''employment file'' and ''communications'' he has had with JPMorgan since he left in December 2012. The agency is also requesting documents that ''identify all persons involved in the decision to hire'' Mr. Tang, who is believed to have joined the bank in 2010.
The S.E.C.'s document appears to be looking for connections between his hiring and business JPMorgan won from the China Everbright Group and its banking subsidiary. In its confidential request, the S.E.C. asked the bank to ''identify and produce all contracts or agreements between JPMorgan and China Everbright.''
Before hiring Mr. Tang, JPMorgan appeared to do little if any business with China Everbright, based on a review of securities filings and news reports. Since then, though, China Everbright has emerged as one of its prized Asian clients. In 2011, its banking subsidiary hired JPMorgan as one of 12 financial advisers on its decision to become a public company. Amid global economic turmoil and questions about China's banking system, that deal was delayed.
Yet in 2012, JPMorgan was the only bank hired to advise China Everbright International, a subsidiary focused on alternative energy businesses, on a $162 million sale of shares, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ, a research service. JPMorgan, according to securities filings, owns a stake in the subsidiary.
The same year, JPMorgan guided China Everbright through its role in what was, according to Dealogic, the largest-ever private equity deal in China. The deal involved reshaping Focus Media, a digital advertising firm, into a private company owned, in part, by China Everbright.
The S.E.C. is investigating similar aspects of JPMorgan's hiring of Ms. Zhang, whose father is Zhang Shuguang, former deputy chief engineer of China's railway ministry. Before joining JPMorgan, Ms. Zhang attended Stanford University, according to her LinkedIn and Facebook pages.
In addition to requesting her employment file and compensation earned from JPMorgan, the S.E.C. is asking the bank to turn over ''all contracts or agreements between JPMorgan and the Ministry of Railways of the People's Republic of China.''
The Ministry of Railways has never hired JPMorgan directly, securities filings and news reports suggest. But those records indicate that the China Railway Group, the construction company whose largest customer is thought to be the Chinese government, hired JPMorgan to take it public in 2007. Ms. Zhang was hired around this time.
About four years later, when Ms. Zhang was an associate at the bank, JPMorgan won out again. This time, according to media reports, the operator of a high-speed railway from Beijing to Shanghai picked the bank to steer it through its own public offering. That deal fell apart after a 2011 train collision killed 40 people and injured hundreds. The incident -- just a month after the Chinese government announced the project -- spotlighted the dangers of corruption in China's railway system.
The railway minister at the time, Liu Zhijun, has since received a suspended death sentence for accepting bribes in exchange for government rail contracts over a 25-year period, according to reports. Ms. Zhang's father, the former deputy chief engineer, was also detained on suspicion of corruption, according to China's official state-run news agency. It is unclear whether that case is still pending.
The S.E.C., in its request to JPMorgan, questioned whether the bank had ''investigated the reported arrest.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: How A U.S. Push To Defuse Egypt Ended In Failure

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK, PETER BAKER and MICHAEL R. GORDON; David D. Kirkpatrick reported from Cairo, and Peter Baker and Michael R. Gordon from Washington. Reporting was contributed by Eric Schmitt, Mark Mazzetti and Thom Shanker from Washington; Mark Landler from Chilmark, Mass.; and Steven Erlanger from London.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- For a moment, at least, American and European diplomats trying to defuse the volatile standoff in Egypt thought they had a breakthrough.
As thousands of Islamist supporters of the ousted president, Mohamed Morsi, braced for a crackdown by the military-imposed government, a senior European diplomat, Bernardino León, told the Islamists of ''indications'' from the leadership that within hours it would free two imprisoned opposition leaders. In turn, the Islamists had agreed to reduce the size of two protest camps by about half.
An hour passed, and nothing happened. Another hour passed, and still no one had been released.
The Americans heightened the pressure. Two senators visiting Cairo, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, met with Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, the officer who ousted Mr. Morsi and appointed the new government, and the interim prime minister, Hazem el-Beblawi, and pushed for the release of the two prisoners. But the Egyptians brushed them off. 
''You could tell people were itching for a fight,'' Mr. Graham recalled in an interview. ''The prime minister was a disaster. He kept preaching to me: 'You can't negotiate with these people. They've got to get out of the streets and respect the rule of law.' I said: 'Mr. Prime Minister, it's pretty hard for you to lecture anyone on the rule of law. How many votes did you get? Oh, yeah, you didn't have an election.' ''
General Sisi, Mr. Graham said, seemed ''a little bit intoxicated by power.''
The senators walked out that day, Aug. 6, gloomy and convinced that a violent showdown was looming. But the diplomats still held out hope, believing they had persuaded Egypt's government at least not to declare the talks a failure.
The next morning, the government issued a statement declaring that diplomatic efforts had been exhausted and blaming the Islamists for any casualties from the coming crackdown. A week later, Egyptian forces opened a ferocious assault that so far has killed more than 1,000 protesters.
All of the efforts of the United States government, all the cajoling, the veiled threats, the high-level envoys from Washington and the 17 personal phone calls by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, failed to forestall the worst political bloodletting in modern Egyptian history. The generals in Cairo felt free to ignore the Americans first on the prisoner release and then on the statement, in a cold-eyed calculation that they would not pay a significant cost -- a conclusion bolstered when President Obama responded by canceling a joint military exercise but not $1.5 billion in annual aid.
The violent crackdown has left Mr. Obama in a no-win position: risk a partnership that has been the bedrock of Middle East peace for 35 years, or stand by while longtime allies try to hold on to power by mowing down opponents. From one side, the Israelis, Saudis and other Arab allies have lobbied him to go easy on the generals in the interest of thwarting what they see as the larger and more insidious Islamist threat. From the other, an unusual mix of conservatives and liberals has urged him to stand more forcefully against the sort of autocracy that has been a staple of Egyptian life for decades.
For now the administration has decided to keep the close relationship with the Egyptian military fundamentally unchanged. But the death toll is climbing, the streets are descending into chaos, and the government and the Islamists are vowing to escalate. It is unclear if the military's new government can reimpose a version of the old order now that the public believes street protests have toppled two leaders in less than three years, or if, after winning democratic elections, the Islamists will ever again compliantly retreat.
As Mr. Obama acknowledged in a statement on Thursday, the American response turns not only on humanitarian values but also on national interests. A country consumed by civil strife may no longer function as a stabilizing ally in a volatile region.
An Enduring Headache
Mr. Obama has found Egypt's tumultuous political transition a headache for more than two years. Accused of sticking for too long by President Hosni Mubarak, the longtime ruler in Egypt who was ousted by a popular uprising in 2011, and then criticized when he later abandoned him, Mr. Obama gambled on Mr. Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood leader elected a year ago. He found Mr. Morsi a useful and pragmatic partner in handling issues like a violent flare-up in Gaza. But Mr. Obama became convinced that the Egyptian was not being inclusive enough at home to stabilize his own country.
When Secretary of State John Kerry visited Cairo in the spring, he urged Mr. Morsi to reach out to his opposition. If not, Mr. Kerry warned, Mr. Morsi would set the stage for another uprising, this time against himself. But the implied threat only hardened Mr. Morsi's resolve not to bend, his aides said.
Mr. Morsi's failure to incorporate other factions, his habit of demonizing his critics as part of a treasonous conspiracy and a near-calamitous economic crisis combined to fire up opposition to the Islamists, which spilled out in street protests. Hard-liners with the military and intelligence services who always despised the Muslim Brotherhood saw that the group's experiment in power might have left it more vulnerable than at any time in its eight decades underground.
The Obama administration warned the military against stepping in, noting that a coup would require an aid cutoff under American law. But on July 3 the military moved in, detaining Mr. Morsi and rounding up scores of his allies.
Mr. Obama made no public comments, opting instead for tempered written statements. He skirted the aid law by refusing to determine whether Mr. Morsi's ouster constituted a coup, while Mr. Kerry and Mr. Hagel pressed the military to restore civilian governance as soon as possible.
Although Mr. Obama agreed not to restrict the aid, he postponed the delivery of four F-16 fighter jets. At the time, officials discussed pulling out of joint military exercises called Bright Star scheduled for September, but the White House opted to wait to see if the generals would follow through on their threat to clear out pro-Morsi protesters.
Western governments took a wait-and-see approach even after the military committed its first mass killing, shooting more than 60 supporters of Mr. Morsi at a sit-in on July 8. Western diplomats did not engage in earnest until July 24, when General Sisi, in dark sunglasses and military regalia, delivered a fiery speech asking the public to turn out for demonstrations giving him a ''mandate'' to take on the Islamists. Security forces killed 80 more Morsi supporters in their second mass shooting on the day of the demonstration.
The next morning, Morsi aides and Brotherhood leaders say, their phones began ringing with American and European diplomats fearing an imminent blood bath.
The administration enlisted people on opposite sides of the contest unfolding in Egypt. Diplomats from Qatar, a regional patron of the Muslim Brotherhood, agreed to influence the Islamists. The United Arab Emirates, determined opponents of the Islamists, were brought in to help reach out to the new authorities.
But while the Qataris and Emiratis talked about ''reconciliation'' in front of the Americans, Western diplomats here said they believed the Emiratis were privately urging the Egyptian security forces to crack down.
Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the Emirati foreign minister, went to Washington last month and urged the Americans not to cut off aid. The emirates, along with Saudi Arabia, had swiftly supported the military takeover with a pledge of billions of dollars, undermining Western threats to cut off critical loans or aid.
The Israelis, whose military had close ties to General Sisi from his former post as head of military intelligence, were supporting the takeover as well. Western diplomats say that General Sisi and his circle appeared to be in heavy communication with Israeli colleagues, and the diplomats believed the Israelis were also undercutting the Western message by reassuring the Egyptians not to worry about American threats to cut off aid.
Israeli officials deny having reassured Egypt about the aid, but acknowledge having lobbied Washington to protect it.
When Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, proposed an amendment halting military aid to Egypt, the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee sent a letter to senators on July 31 opposing it, saying it ''could increase instability in Egypt and undermine important U.S. interests and negatively impact our Israeli ally.'' Statements from influential lawmakers echoed the letter, and the Senate defeated the measure, 86 to 13, later that day.
Building Connections
Mr. Hagel tried to forge a connection with General Sisi, the defense minister who has become the country's de facto leader. Mr. Hagel, a 66-year-old decorated Vietnam War veteran, felt he and General Sisi, a 58-year-old graduate of the United States Army War College in Pennsylvania, ''clicked right away'' when they met in April, an American official said.
In a series of phone calls, Mr. Hagel pressed General Sisi for a transition back to civilian rule. They talked nearly every other day, usually for an hour or an hour and a half, lengthened by the use of interpreters. But General Sisi complained that the Obama administration did not fully appreciate that the Islamists posed a threat to Egypt and its army. The general asked Mr. Hagel to convey the danger to Mr. Obama, American officials said.
''Their whole sales pitch to us is that the Muslim Brotherhood is a group of terrorists,'' said one American officer, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the dialogue.
American and European diplomats hoped to reinforce the few officials in Egypt's interim cabinet who favored an inclusive approach, led by Mohamed ElBaradei, the vice president and Nobel Peace Prize-winning former diplomat. After the second massacre, on July 26, Mr. ElBaradei wanted to resign, but Mr. Kerry talked him out of it, arguing that he was the most potent, if not the only, voice for restraint in the government.
But General Sisi never trusted Mr. ElBaradei, and on the other side was a small core of military officers close to the general who saw a chance to finally rid Egypt of the Muslim Brotherhood. Among them were Gen. Mohammed al-Tohami, a mentor and father figure to General Sisi and now head of the intelligence service, and Gen. Mahmoud Hegazy, the general's protégé and chosen successor as head of military intelligence. And with no serious reprisals against Egypt after two mass killings, many analysts here argue that the hard-liners could only feel emboldened.
Mr. Kerry sent his deputy, William J. Burns, to Cairo, where he and a European Union counterpart scrambled to de-escalate the crisis.
Under a plan they worked out, the Muslim Brotherhood would limit demonstrations to two squares, thin out crowds and publicly condemn violence. The government would issue a similar statement, commit to an inclusive political process allowing any party to compete in elections and, as a sign of good faith, release Saad al-Katatni, the Muslim Brotherhood speaker of the dissolved Parliament, and Aboul-Ela Maadi, founder of a more moderate Islamist party. Both faced implausible charges of instigating violence, and Western diplomats felt that before the takeover, Mr. Katatni in particular had proved himself a pragmatic voice for compromise.
But on Aug. 4, the interim government surprised the diplomats by bringing charges for incitement to murder against the Brotherhood's supreme guide, Mohamed Badie, who was in hiding, and Khairat el-Shater, its most influential leader, who had been detained.
Adding to the shock of the new charges, they came just hours before Mr. Burns and his European partner, Mr. León, were allowed to see Mr. Shater. Mr. Shater embraced the need for dialogue, but did not endorse the proposals.
Still, the diplomats grew hopeful that they had gotten through to the government. On the morning of Aug. 6, Brotherhood leaders and diplomats said, Mr. León called Amr Darrag, an adviser to Mr. Morsi and top negotiator for the Islamist coalition, and told him to expect Mr. Katatni and Mr. Maadi to be released within hours. When nothing happened, Mr. Darrag called Mr. León back, the Brotherhood officials said. Do not worry, Mr. León said, arguing that the new government must have put the release off by a day to avoid the appearance of bowing to American pressure.
Heightened Tensions
Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham arrived in Cairo amid increasing tensions. They went first to see Ambassador Anne W. Patterson. ''You could see it on her face, that nobody's listening,'' Mr. Graham said. He said administration officials asked them to press for the release of the two Islamists and to push the Brotherhood to pull people off the street.
When the senators asked government officials to release the Islamist leaders, one woman on the Egyptian side stormed out. The senators warned that the United States would ultimately cut off aid if the military did not set elections and amend the Constitution.
Mr. Graham recalled arguing with General Sisi. ''If Morsi had to stand for re-election anytime soon, he'd lose badly,'' the senator remembered saying. ''Do you agree?''
''Oh, absolutely,'' the general answered.
''Then what you're doing now is making him a martyr,'' Mr. Graham said. ''It's no longer about how badly they ruled the country and how they marginalized the democratic institutions. It's now about you.''
The meeting with the prime minister was even tenser. As they walked out, Mr. Graham said, he told Mr. McCain, ''If this guy's voice is indicative of the attitude, there's no pulling out of this thing.''
When Egyptian state news media leaked reports of an imminent government statement that diplomacy had failed, the diplomats were stunned, and scrambled to hold it off.
The next day, Mr. León, the European envoy, assured the Islamists that although the prisoner release had fallen through, at least the Egyptians had agreed to pull back the statement, Brotherhood leaders said.
A half-hour later, it was issued nonetheless. ''The phase of diplomatic efforts has ended,'' it declared, calling the sit-ins ''nonpeaceful'' and obliquely blaming the Muslim Brotherhood for any coming violence.
The Americans and Europeans were furious, feeling deceived and manipulated. ''They were used to justify the violence,'' Mr. Darrag said in an interview. ''They were just brought in so that the coup government could claim that the negotiations failed, and, in fact, there were no negotiations.''
Mr. Burns left Cairo with a sense of foreboding. Western diplomats in Cairo said that, despite their public statements at the time to the contrary, it was then that they, too, gave up hope.
Mr. Hagel made a last stab at holding off violence. He called General Sisi late on the afternoon of Aug. 9, and they talked for 90 minutes. ''Secretary Hagel was strongly urging restraint,'' said an American official briefed on the conversation. The secretary recited the same talking points he had been delivering for weeks: avoid violence, respect freedom of assembly and move toward an inclusive political transition.
But within the Egyptian government, the only real debate was about tactics and blame. Mohamed Ibrahim, the interior minister under Mr. Morsi who had kept his job by refusing to protect the Islamists, was convinced that brute force was the only way to break up sit-ins by tens of thousands of Morsi supporters. But diplomats and Egyptian officials said Mr. Ibrahim was worried that if the assaults went badly he might be held up as a scapegoat.
Last Sunday, Interior Ministry officials told journalists that the police would move in at dawn to choke off the sit-ins, cutting off food and water and gradually escalating nonlethal force. But overnight, diplomats said, Mr. Ibrahim reconsidered, worried that a gradual approach would expose the police to Brotherhood retaliation, for which he could be blamed.
Two days later, Mr. Ibrahim and the government told Mr. ElBaradei that they had a new plan to minimize casualties: maximum force to get it over with quickly, the Western diplomats said. And the military had agreed to support the police. But the attack the next morning left more than 600 dead, according to official figures that soon grew. By midday, Mr. ElBaradei had resigned.
As images of Egyptian security forces opening fire flickered across television screens in Washington, Mr. Hagel called General Sisi again and warned him that the violence had put ''important elements of our longstanding defense cooperation at risk,'' as he put it in a statement afterward. Mr. Kerry made the same points in tandem to the interim foreign minister, Nabil Fahmy.
Mr. Obama announced the cancellation of Bright Star exercises without saying anything about the aid. As of Friday, American officials were still working phone lines to Cairo. Mr. Kerry talked with his Egyptian counterpart, urging the government to appoint an envoy to negotiate directly with the Islamists, United States officials said. But the diplomats and military officers in the two countries seemed to be talking past each other.
''The million-dollar question now,'' said one American military officer, ''is where is the threshold of violence for cutting ties?''

HEADLINE: Jamaica Fights To Break Grip Of Violent Past

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
KINGSTON, Jamaica -- Gunshots every night, burned-down businesses and corpses -- up to a half-dozen a day -- used to define the neighborhood of Mountain View on the eastern hillsides of Kingston, Jamaica's capital. But not anymore.
Now, the nights are filled with barefoot soccer matches under streetlights or block parties that bring together former rivals from local gangs. No one has been murdered in Mountain View for three years.
''The dark cloud is moving away,'' said Keith Nugent, 76, a tailor in the neighborhood who counsels former criminals. ''Young people here are beginning to gravitate to a sense of life, and function.''
Jamaica is emerging as a rare bright spot in the hub of the fight against drugs and organized crime that extends across South America and the Caribbean. After more than a decade fighting lawlessness, with limited success, this small island with a reputation for both carefree living and bloodshed has begun to see results. Jamaica's murder rate, while still high, has fallen by 40 percent since 2009, and a respected study recently reported that ''Jamaica has fallen from one of the more corrupt countries in the Americas to one of the least.'' 
The situation here differs markedly from elsewhere in the region, in Central America and Mexico, where militarized, transnational drug cartels battle among themselves over the main smuggling routes into the United States. But experts and American officials say that as drug traffic shifts back to the Caribbean -- because of intensifying enforcement elsewhere -- Jamaica has done far more than many other countries to protect itself, by working transparently to strengthen weak institutions while welcoming assistance from outsiders.
''There's an awful lot of introspection that's been going on in Jamaica,'' said Pamela E. Bridgewater, the American ambassador. As a result, she added, cooperation with the United States and other countries has ''risen to a different level.''
Since 2009, no other country has received more American aid from the $203 million Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, yet relatively little of it has been directed toward the muscular, militarized efforts financed elsewhere as part of the war on drugs.
The new emphasis -- on community policing, violence reduction and combating corruption -- grew partly from crisis. In May 2010, Christopher M. Coke, one of Jamaica's most powerful drug lords, fought an attempt to arrest and extradite him to the United States, prompting a neighborhood siege by the authorities, which left at least 70 people dead.
His surrender a few weeks later helped break up gun and drug networks, according to Jamaican officials, and allowed the country to zero in on longer-term projects, with imported expertise.
The United States, for example, is about to set up a vetting center for the Anticorruption Bureau of the Jamaican police, complete with polygraphs and training for operators.
A recent report by the Government Accountability Office also notes that the Americans are giving Jamaican officers utility belts with only a baton and pepper spray in an effort to discourage deadly armed conflicts. The next weapons most likely to be delivered -- Tasers -- are more aggressive, but still a far cry from the helicopters, boats and Special Forces troops the United States is pushing into Central America.
Jamaica, though, has a different historical relationship with the United States and the war on drugs.
The Caribbean was the main trafficking route for cocaine heading to the United States in the '80s and '90s, which means Jamaica was among the first countries in the region to join international efforts against transnational crime. Jamaican and American officials say that as a result, sensitivities about foreign intervention are less intense here than in Central America and Mexico, and there are fewer institutional rivalries or disagreements about when the police or the military should intervene in the fight against traffickers.
''As long as we are aligned in the fight against organized crime, I'm willing to work with anyone,'' said Peter Bunting, Jamaica's minister of security.
Jamaica, as a longtime hub of marijuana production and consumption, has generally been more open about its weaknesses. Officials acknowledged the need for new levels of help nearly a decade ago, even putting foreigners in charge of the national police.
''Jamaica was on a precipice; it was about to become a narco state,'' said Mark Shields, a former British police officer appointed deputy police commissioner in 2005.
The government also created or strengthened anticorruption commissions to keep a close watch on elected officials, contracts and the police. Forensic audits became required annually, for senior officials and beat officers alike. And laws have been toughened so that those found with suspicious windfalls must prove how they obtained the money or else be fired or prosecuted.
The goal, Mr. Bunting said, is to focus less on drugs and more on ill-gotten gains. ''The kingpins are not the ones on the go-fast boat,'' he said. ''They're usually closer to their money, so we're going after the money.''
Eduardo A. Gamarra, a professor of international relations at Florida International University, said Jamaica's approach had taken hold only because the arrest of Mr. Coke forced residents to see their country at rock bottom. A tipping point was reached, he said, as Jamaicans witnessed the power of Mr. Coke (nicknamed Dudus), who avoided extradition for nearly a year with the help of well-connected political allies, and as bodies piled up from the conflict between his supporters and the authorities.
''You have to have these momentous events to transform societies,'' Mr. Gamarra said. ''What is it that produced the change in Jamaica? Dudus Coke.''
The positive results have been obvious in areas like Mountain View. For many residents there, the Coke affair -- which took place a few miles away in the Tivoli Gardens neighborhood -- still stings like lingering tear gas. Local gangs with ties to Mr. Coke resent what they describe as a police ''incursion'' characterized by officers killing civilians and other examples of excessive force.
But even the angriest Mountain View residents say they have chosen calm over chaos. Oswaldo Kemp, 34, who spent two years in prison in connection with the shooting of a police officer, now worries mostly about work. ''I'm just trying to get my little farm running again,'' he said, standing between a fattened pig and a row of vegetables.
Around the corner, Kachif Benjamin, 27, shirtless and wearing a pink backpack, said many gang members and drug dealers also decided they had had enough of the bloodshed. ''We've been there, done that,'' he said.
Violence remains a significant problem. On July 22 in Montego Bay, a teenager was stabbed to death by an angry mob in what appeared to be an antigay attack, and Jamaica's murder rate is still 40 per 100,000, compared with 22 per 100,000 in Mexico and 87 per 100,000 in Honduras.
Bruce M. Bagley, a professor of international studies at the University of Miami, said it is still not clear if the improvements here and in other parts of the Caribbean are enough to withstand the increase in drug trafficking that experts are predicting. ''The underlying socio-economic problems, the institutional problems and the rerouting of drugs back through the Caribbean are a very powerful combination,'' he said.
But for Mr. Nugent, the tailor, and for many other residents, peace carries its own momentum. Gaunt and goateed, standing near a faded sticker on the wall of his home reading, ''Celebrate forgiveness,'' he said he sees hope in all the people asking him to mend clothes for work, and in the young men who seek guidance or help paying for school. Praising the police for spending more time getting to know the community and for starting youth clubs for teenagers, he said the future looked more bright than dark.
''Light attracts light,'' he said. ''Everything good must have a beginning.''

HEADLINE: Master's Degree Is New Frontier Of Study Online

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Next January, the Georgia Institute of Technology plans to offer a master's degree in computer science through massive open online courses for a fraction of the on-campus cost, a first for an elite institution. If it even approaches its goal of drawing thousands of students, it could signal a change to the landscape of higher education.
From their start two years ago, when a free artificial intelligence course from Stanford enrolled 170,000 students, free massive open online courses, or MOOCs, have drawn millions and yielded results like the perfect scores of Battushig, a 15-year-old Mongolian boy, in a tough electronics course offered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
But the courses have not yet produced profound change, partly because they offer no credit and do not lead to a degree. The disruption may be approaching, though, as Georgia Tech, which has one of the country's top computer science programs, plans to offer a MOOC-based online master's degree in computer science for $6,600 -- far less than the $45,000 on-campus price. 
Zvi Galil, the dean of the university's College of Computing, expects that in the coming years, the program could attract up to 10,000 students annually, many from outside the United States and some who would not complete the full master's degree. ''Online, there's no visa problem,'' he said.
The program rests on an unusual partnership forged by Dr. Galil and Sebastian Thrun, a founder of Udacity, a Silicon Valley provider of the open online courses.
Although it is just one degree at one university, the prospect of a prestigious low-cost degree program has generated great interest. Some educators think the leap from individual noncredit courses to full degree programs could signal the next phase in the evolution of MOOCs -- and bring real change to higher education.
''Perhaps Zvi Galil and Sebastian Thrun will prove to be the Wright brothers of MOOCs,'' said S. James Gates Jr., a University of Maryland physicist who serves on President Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. ''This is the first deliberate and thoughtful attempt to apply education technology to bringing instruction to scale. It could be epoch-making. If it really works, it could begin the process of lowering the cost of education, and lowering barriers for millions of Americans.''
The plan is for Georgia Tech to provide the content and professors and to get 60 percent of the revenue, and for Udacity to offer the computer platform, provide course assistants and receive the other 40 percent. The projected budget for the test run starting in January is $3.1 million -- including $2 million donated by AT&T, which will use the program to train employees and find potential hires -- with $240,000 in profits. By the third year, the projection is for $14.3 million in costs and $4.7 million in profits.
The courses will be online and free for those not seeking a degree; those in the degree program will take proctored exams and have access to tutoring, online office hours and other support services. Students who cannot meet the program's stringent admission standards may be admitted provisionally and allowed to transfer in if they do well in their first two courses. And students who complete only a few courses would get a certificate.
''This is all uncharted territory, so no one really knows if it will go to scale,'' Dr. Galil said. ''We just want to prove that it can be done, to make a high-quality degree program available for a low cost.''
Would such a program cannibalize campus enrollment? ''Frankly,'' he said, ''nobody knows.''
Not everyone believes that such a degree program will be sustainable, or that it would even be a step forward.
''The whole MOOC mania has got everyone buzzing in academia, but scaling is a great challenge,'' said Bruce Chaloux, the executive director of the Sloan Consortium, an advocacy group for online education. ''I have to believe that at some point, when the underwriting ends, to keep high quality, Georgia Tech would have to float to more traditional tuition rates.''
Some faculty members worry that despite Dr. Galil's pledge that the program will match the quality and standards of the on-campus master's program, it could dilute the value of a Georgia Tech degree. And as in California, where Udacity has worked with San Jose State University to offer three basic math courses -- now paused because of underwhelming student performance -- some object to the idea of outsourcing part of their work to a for-profit company like Udacity.
''If you spend a lot of money, you can make online great, and this will probably be a showcase program,'' said Chris Newfield, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who is studying online education. ''But we in universities could do that ourselves if we had that money, and the whole history of private involvement in public education has been one of extracting resources. However well-intentioned, we don't need a Trojan horse product that will take money out of the system.''
There is no question, educators say, that online learning will continue to spread. But whether massive open online courses are the approach that will win out and bring real change is not clear.
''A very large number of public universities are experimenting with how online delivery can increase quality and contain costs,'' said M. Peter McPherson, the president of the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities. ''Using MOOCs for a low-cost graduate degree certainly crosses a threshold,'' but, he added, so does Virginia Tech's practice of teaching freshman math through self-paced online courses with lower costs and better outcomes. ''We're going to see more online learning,'' he said, ''but not one single absolute model.''
The three leading MOOC providers, Udacity, Coursera and edX, have grown at a remarkable rate, adding hundreds of courses with dozens of college and university partners. But the path ahead is less clear, and all three are working with universities to find ways in which their courses can be used for credit. Some state universities, leery of ceding control to outside organizations, lean toward developing their own programs and platforms.
For-profit colleges like the University of Phoenix, whose tuition generally falls between state institutions and private not-for-profit universities, were the first to offer large online degree programs. But for-profit enrollment has declined because of the recession, increased government scrutiny and Congressional hearings finding that their students had low graduation rates and high loan default rates. And with so many traditional institutions now offering online degrees, the for-profit colleges may have a tougher time attracting students.
Many public universities have recently expanded online degree programs costing as much as their on-campus programs. But if the Georgia Tech program attracts thousands of students -- a big if -- that pricing model may be vulnerable.
''Online is a scale game, so the Georgia Tech thing is interesting,'' said Phil Regier, executive vice provost of Arizona State University Online, which takes in $90 million annually in revenue. ''What we're seeing is different price points for different levels of faculty involvement. If you want no touch, or very little touch, they'll deliver that for $6,000. If you want a higher-touch program, taught and graded by regular faculty, with a lot of faculty interaction, it's going to be more expensive.''
Mr. Regier said he did not know whether Georgia Tech's model would succeed.
''What I do know is that if they attract 5,000 students, I don't want to be doubling down on our computer science master's program,'' he said. ''You have to know your market.''
The Florida Legislature has directed the University of Florida to start fully online bachelor's degree programs and set the price for residents at three-quarters of the campus in-state tuition, or about $4,700. But Bernie Machen, the university's president, said he had not yet decided whether to charge out-of-state online students the full $28,000 tuition they would pay on campus, in part because he wondered if online pricing models were changing.
''Most of us got into online graduate programs more from the revenue side than the service side,'' said Mr. Machen, whose university brings in $75 million annually from its more than 70 online graduate degree programs. ''It was an untapped market.''
Mr. Machen, like others, said he was puzzled by Georgia Tech's optimistic financial estimates for its program, and was not sure they would work out.
Higher education officials say they will be watching closely.
''Georgia Tech is exceptionally important because it's a prestigious institution offering an important degree at very low cost with a direct connection to a Fortune 100 corporation that will use it to fill their pipeline,'' said Terry W. Hartle, the senior vice president of the American Council on Education. ''It addresses a lot of the issues about universities that the public cares about. But how good and how transferable it is remain to be seen.''

STEPHEN KING'S FAMILY BUSINESS
I enjoy Stephen King's work, but I'm not a huge fan -- horror is not my favorite genre, and for every ''Dolores Claiborne,'' he has a ''Cujo.'' But I admire his commitment to his craft, his no-nonsense approach to the work and his immense enthusiasm. After reading this, I also admire his strong bond with his wife and their creative approach to parenting. People snarking about nepotism in reaction to this article seem to not realize that children raised on storytelling games, given challenging books to read and encouraged to make up bedtime tales for their parents would undoubtedly be primed for creative lives. AMY VINCENT, New Orleans, posted on nytimes.comIt would be absurdly naïve to think that Stephen King, with all his millions, didn't have a thing to do with his children's choice of career or their sudden recognition. 
It's no different from rich Hollywood actors whose children stand there waiting for their Oscars. CAROLYN, Saint Augustine, Fla., posted on nytimes.comGood Lord, who wouldn't want to follow in the amazing footsteps of Stephen King? There is absolutely nothing wrong with his children working in the same creative field. In fact, it's terribly brave. MARGARET BURKETT, Oyster Bay, N.Y., posted on nytimes.comAN AMERICAN MAN'S QUEST TO BECOME AN OLD CASTILIANIn this beautiful article, Michael Paterniti seems saddened when the scales fall from his eyes and he sees that indeed manual labor takes a toll, as do drinking and smoking. An isolated village is likely dying, and its charm is also a death rattle. But I find this is when I start to really like a place: when it feels not like a fairy tale but like an old shoe. When a magical place becomes not magical, it helps me realize that so many of the supposedly ordinary places in my life are also quite special, I've just gotten too familiar with them to notice. P. SCOTT CARNEY, Champaign, Ill., posted on nytimes.comThat happy moment when an artcle catures something I've felt but haven't been able to articulate for years. @RuthGalloglyA SEA CHANGE FOR THE AMERICA'S CUPWith his money and ego, Larry Ellison could have easily created a huge event of his own and left the America's Cup to people who love yacht racing. The competition used to be a hard sell to the public, but in recent years technology has allowed us to watch the maneuvering close up, virtually onboard the boats. Certainly there is room in the world of sailing for the classic America's Cup as well as a large event like the one Ellison had hoped for. DEBORAH TAYLOR, Santa Cruz, Calif., posted on nytimes.comMike Escamilla's intense photos help dispel the notion that this year's American's Cup is a mere exercise in conspicuous consumption. They accentuate Warren St. John's vivid account of the dangers involved in racing these extreme catamarans. The article almost makes me wish I hadn't canceled plans to attend the races. But then again, imagine the Kentucky Derby with only three horses. Thoroughbreds or not, it would soon be of limited interest. A.R. KARA, Key West, Fla., posted on nytimes.comSTOP BLAMING 'JAWS'!I saw a behind-the-scenes segment about ''Jaws'' in which Spielberg complained that the shark models he used kept breaking down. Maybe it was due to this difficulty that Spielberg focused more on character and suspense rather than on special effects, so that the shark would be felt rather than seen. He was aiming for a blockbuster, with 1975 technology, which is all the better for us fans. ALEJANDRO FLÓREZ, Queens, posted on nytimes.comI realize this makes me a bad person, but I'd totally watch the over-the-top movie that Heather Havrilesky satirically described in the opening to her essay about ''Jaws.'' I'm not saying it would be a good movie, but I would watch it. PAUL FERGUSON, Minneapolis, posted on nytimes.comBILLABLE HOURSAdam Davidson's thoughtful column struck a chord with me as a matrimonial lawyer who must only bill by an hourly rate pursuant to court rule. Pricing legal services by time unit has vastly increased the cost of divorce and has, as Davidson points out, encouraged practitioners to spend more time than necessary on routine work rather than on the more nuanced jobs. Thirty years ago such services were required at a specific price, rewarding efficiency, resolution and creativity. The current system makes no economic sense for the clients or the lawyers. MICHAEL P. FRIEDMAN, Delmar, N.Y.

HEADLINE: Who Made That? (Water Bed)

BYLINE: By PAGAN KENNEDY

 BODY:
In the late 1960s, a design student named Charlie Hall embarked on an independent project to explore the idea of comfort. He poured a cornstarch-based gel into an enormous vinyl bag, sealed it and climbed on top. He felt as if he were levitating, his body cradled in the gel that molded around him. But there were drawbacks: the chair began to stink after a few days, and it weighed 300 pounds. ''Unless you had a forklift in your living room, it was an impossible piece of furniture,'' he says. Hall switched to water as his filler. And he decided to build a mattress instead of a chair; since people rarely move their beds, the weight wouldn't matter so much. Plus, he says,''It's the piece of furniture you spend the most amount of time in.''
Hall built the demo model in his house in Haight-Ashbury and invited his design class from San Francisco State University to stop by and critique his project. ''Somebody got a bottle of wine,'' Hall says. ''The party didn't stop until everybody got too tired and went home.'' It was 1968, just after the Summer of Love, and he had created a heated bed that undulated, seeming to hold you in its embrace. 
Soon Hall set up a studio where he handcrafted his water beds; he sold them by word of mouth. ''One went to a Smothers Brother, another to a Jefferson Airplane member,'' Hall says. ''We would deliver these things all over Marin County and San Francisco on top of a Rambler station wagon. I did make one for Hugh Hefner, upholstered in green velvet.''
Within a few years, competitors offered knockoff water beds for less than $100 -- and the mattress became notorious for leaks and deflations. But Hall says that what really sank the water bed was the installation: ''Generally, a professional would come in and fill it up, then set up the frame, the heater, this and that. It was a lot of work to put in. So when people made a move, often the water bed got left behind and they opted for a simpler solution.''
Still, even if we rarely sleep on them today, the water bed may have transformed our ideas about comfort. ''It used to be 'firmer is better,' '' Hall says, until ''water beds changed what people look for in a mattress. The Tempur-Pedic and the memory-foam things and pillow tops are all about making a bed conform to you.''
HE KNOWS WHEN YOU ARE SLEEPING
Robert Oexman, director of Kingsdown's Sleep to Live Institute, helped design Sleep Smart, a mattress that analyzes the sleeper's body. Priced at about $8,500 (for queen size).
How does the mattress monitor your sleep habits? The bed has sensors in it that measure your body. It takes into account your height, your weight, the distribution of your weight, the width of your shoulders, the width of your waist, the width of your hips, the amount of lumbar curve you have and the flexibility of that lumbar curve. After you've been on the bed for about two weeks, the system has learned your sleeping behavior. So the bed decides: ''You're 86 percent sleep-efficient. I want to do better than that.'' And the bed makes adjustments.
Have you slept on this thing? Yes. I could see my sleep patterns change by watching what happens inside my mattress. So if I chose to go out and have two cocktails for dinner, I could see that impacted my sleep.
You mean that you plug your smartphone into the mattress and look at a display? Yes, I get onto my phone and pull up my sleep stats. There's an app that comes with the bed, and the consumer can answer questions in a sleep diary. So the consumer could send this data to the Sleep to Live Institute. We would then help them solve their problems with their environment, their behavior and sleep equipment -- like a pillow or a comforter.

HEADLINE: Questioning The Feasibility Of Hyperloop

BYLINE: By NICK BILTON

 BODY:
Elon Musk, a serial entrepreneur who was a co-founder of PayPal and the electric car company Tesla Motors, sent people in California into a tizzy on Monday when he released a white paper outlining a hypothetical high-speed transportation system called the Hyperloop.
There were a number of curious questions about the Hyperloop, which Mr. Musk's white paper claims will be able to travel at up to 800 miles an hour and transport people from San Francisco to Los Angeles in 30 minutes. While physicists agree that technically, on paper, this is possible, economists seem to agree that technically, on paper, the price tag of $6 billion is impossible. 
Richard White, a professor of American history at Stanford and author of ''Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America,'' said Mr. Musk's project was ''dramatically overblown and the price is drastically underestimated.'' He said in an interview that Mr. Musk's document outlining the price of the project was ''just pie in the sky.''
Just how pie in the sky is it?
Alexis Madrigal, a senior editor at The Atlantic, points out that one reason California's high-speed rail project has been projected to cost $68 billion is that ''they have to acquire 1,100 different pieces of land.''
''Just Fresno to Bakersfield, a little over 100 miles, is supposed to cost $7 billion for high-speed rail,'' he writes.
Although Mr. Musk has stated that he would save money on land parcels by setting up pylons for the Hyperloop along Interstate 5 in California, he isn't taking into account the legal hurdles the currently planned, high-speed train had to go through just to acquire land.
As Brad Plumer of The Washington Post noted, one of the major factors for the California high-speed rail price's ballooning to 10 times Mr. Musk's projected price is that local communities along the train route demanded extra viaducts and tunnels. ''Other towns, meanwhile, have insisted they not be bypassed even in cases where it would be cheaper to do so,'' Mr. Plumer wrote.
The 400-mile Hyperloop would not be immune to these issues.
Putting aside the cost of construction, critics said the projected cost for people to use the Hyperloop was impossible, too.
Mr. Musk projected that the Hyperloop would be able to transport 840 people an hour, each paying $20 a ticket. But as Dan Sperling, founding director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, said: ''There's no way the economics on that would ever work out.''
Mr. Sperling told Al Jazeera that when you factor in capital, labor and maintenance of the Hyperloop, the numbers, ''even in the most outlandish visionary way, do not make any sense at all.''
''The whole technology is unproven,'' he said. ''I know he's a brilliant guy, but it just doesn't pencil out.''
Michael L. Anderson, an associate professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Berkeley, predicted that the cost of the entire project would be closer to $100 billion.
No one seems to be arguing whether it is possible, or even if Mr. Musk could technically build the Hyperloop -- this is, after all, the man who created Tesla and SpaceX -- experts seem to be focused on how he plans to build this invention, then operate it, at the costs he proposes.
''People laud him for creating Tesla,'' said Mr. White of Stanford. ''But let's be realistic; he's not Henry Ford creating the Model T. Musk is creating $60,000 to $100,000 electric cars for rich people.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: This Artificial Intelligence Is Ruining My Commute

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
Machines have been proving themselves to be our enemies for years, at least in the science-fiction world. The danged things keep becoming sentient and turning against us. They do it again in ''Delete,'' a television movie that has its debut on Reelz on Monday night. 
In the film, an independent, thinking entity somehow coalesces out of the world's computers, which of course are all linked thanks to the Web. And this creature is a twisted, havoc-wreaking being because its DNA is formed from the junk found on the Internet.
The movie is pure formula, but if it has been a while since you've seen one of these ''It's alive!'' films, ''Delete'' is terrifying in that it underscores just how much the machines will control when fiction someday becomes reality. In addition to messing with missiles and the banking system, this thing is manipulating traffic lights. Crash the global economy if you want, but mucking with our morning commute? We can't have that.
As is often the case in these movies, it somehow falls to some random kid (Keir Gilchrist) -- a geeky one, of course -- to stop the cyberinvader. He joins up with a newspaper reporter (Erin Karpluk) and an F.B.I. agent (Ryan Robbins).
While the American government flails away helplessly at the invisible enemy, the three of them go off the grid to try to stop it. Seth Green comes into the film late as a hacker eager to help, livening it up considerably.
The events imagined by the film will almost certainly happen in real life sometime soon. Maybe they already have. As you leave your computer-controlled home and drive to work in your computer-controlled car, late as always, don't those bothersome traffic lights seem to be staying red a little longer than usual?

HEADLINE: Sotheby's to Auction Rare Blue Diamond

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's economy is cooling, and Asia's once-rosy prospects look less shiny than they did two years ago, but this has not deterred Sotheby's from choosing Hong Kong as the place to sell a rare multimillion-dollar diamond in October. 
The auction house is expected to announce on Monday that the stone, ''The Premier Blue,'' will be sold on Oct. 7 as part of Sotheby's regular twice-yearly auction series.
The stone weighs 7.59 carats and is about the size of a shirt button. Its size, vivid blue color and round cut -- highly unusual for colored diamonds -- make it exceptionally rare, and Sotheby's expects the stone to bring about $19 million, Quek Chin Yeow, deputy chairman of Sotheby's in Asia, said in an interview before Monday's announcement. That, he said, would be a record per-carat price for any diamond.
The choice of Hong Kong as a place to sell the stone underlines just how important Asia has become as a consumer of luxury items, as rapid growth has swelled the ranks of the ultrarich.
''Since about 2006, 2007, Hong Kong has ranked alongside Geneva and New York as a center for jewelry sales,'' Mr. Quek said. ''It is now the third pillar of the global jewelry market.''
That the rapid growth has slowed has generally not dented the ability and willingness of these superrich to spend. The rich generally remain rich even when times are worse, luxury industry analysts said.
Moreover, Mr. Quek said, Asian buyers tend to be more willing than their Western counterparts to seek out buying opportunities during uncertain times, often making purchases with an eye to potential price increases down the line. And when it comes to diamonds, they tend to like round cuts and colors -- another reason for auctioning the Premier Blue in Asia rather than in Europe or the United States.
Sotheby's is previewing the stone and other auction items around Asia, including in Beijing, Shanghai, Bangkok, Singapore, Jakarta and Taiwan -- a reflection of the regional spread of buyers.
About 25 percent to 30 percent of the money spent at the Hong Kong art and jewelry auctions comes from mainland Chinese buyers, but Hong Kong buyers are also very active, as are Singaporeans, Indonesians, Taiwanese and southeast Asians, Mr. Quek said.

DEAR DIARY:
After dodging two bicycles going the wrong way in their own lane, I planted my feet in the dangerously narrow pedestrian area between traffic and parked cars and began looking for a cab. With none in sight I lighted a cigarette, but after just a few puffs I could see a dimly lit taxi-top light about a block away.
At $14.50 a pack (thanks, Mayor Bloomberg), I don't waste, so as the cab approached, I got in a couple more drags and was about to behead the cigarette to save it for later. Just then, the cabdriver held up a pack of smokes on his dashboard -- the universal sign for freedom. More rare than unicorns or honest politicians, this was a smoking cab. 
The moment I stepped inside I was instantly transported back to a pre-Bloomberg New York. Passengers in taxis to the left and right stared at me with palpable envy, and I was awash in a sense of privilege. Savor this opportunity, I thought, for it may never come again.
I rewarded the driver with a great tip, but then, fidgeting with the clunky sliding cab door, I was reminded that nothing escapes Bloomberg's influence. Doors that swing open can hurt bicyclists, so now, once again inconveniencing the many to appease the few, we have sliding cab doors. An elderly person has as good a chance of opening one of those doors as she does of wresting Excalibur from its stone.

Dear Diary:
I was leaving my office in SoHo the evening of Aug. 1 when the rain began to pour down harder. Having no umbrella, I walked swiftly on Spring Street toward a block I saw mostly covered by scaffolding, joining the queue of unprepared New Yorkers who always huddle under construction to keep dry.
I had on a short skirt that exposed a large cut and bruise on my right knee, a souvenir from a painful sidewalk blunder that week. From the corner of my eye, I caught a man about 30 years old, with blond facial hair and a trim blazer, studying my leg.
He interrupted the quiet of the dry pocket of sidewalk.
''Battle wound?'' he asked. I looked up.
''You're scrappy,'' he continued. He smirked at me, his eyes crinkling. I looked him in the eye and smiled back.
There is only so long we can stay inside the shell of these moments, sheltered by awnings and overhangings and comfortable silences, waiting on a storm we don't know will let up. Without looking back, I stepped into the thick curtain of rain and limped up Broadway. Kate Hakala
Dear Diary:
I love the unintentional typo of the sign in the courtyard of my sister's West Village apartment building, where it's rumored Jack Kerouac once lived.
Taken at face value, though, I do wonder why a no-scatting zone would be necessary in this day and age. I then imagine under the sign an illustration of Ella Fitzgerald scatting inside a ''No'' symbol -- a circle and a diagonal red line through the picture -- stifling her singing ''Bu di di bi bu bi dibi ...'' from ''How High the Moon.''

Dear Diary:
On a recent visit to New York City, my cousin, a friend and I were on the northbound 103 bus on Third Avenue, when the female bus driver pulled to the curb at 27th Street, turned off the motor, stood up, walked to the door and announced: ''I have to go to the bathroom; I'll be right back.''
She stepped down to the sidewalk, locked the door and quickly walked down the street. The passengers sat in silence.
My cousin, a lifelong Manhattanite, said, ''Boy, I never had THAT happen before.''
We sat and waited for her return; it was one of the days of 100-plus degree heat. We had no air, nor could we leave the bus.
I had checked my watch; she returned in eight minutes and, without a word or a nod, started the engine and proceeded north. The stunned passengers shook their heads in silence and disbelief. Betty Cota
Dear Diary:
Scene: Sunday, July 28, waiting for tickets to ''Love's Labour's Lost'' in Central Park.
I was waiting alone, and overheard hours of conversation from the pair ahead of me and the fivesome behind me.
One of the young men behind me (Brooklyn native and soon to be 21 years old, musician, arranger and songwriter, I had heard) approached me (60 years old, out-of-town visitor) and said that he really, really liked my shirt, that he had noticed how great I looked in the shirt, that yellow was perfect with my skin tone, and that he and I had similar skin tone.
I thanked him for the compliment, and basked for a brief moment in praise from a hip 20-year-old New Yorker.
Then he continued, ''If I saw that shirt in a thrift store, I would totally buy it!''
My out-of-town sense of style suffered a sudden deflation.

HEADLINE: Leaving Military Aid Intact, U.S. Takes Steps to Halt Economic Help to Egypt

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and THOM SHANKER; Mark Landler reported from Chilmark, and Thom Shanker from Washington. Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
CHILMARK, Mass. -- The Obama administration has taken preliminary steps to withhold financial aid to the Egyptian government, officials said on Sunday, though it is curtailing economic assistance, not the much larger military aid on which Egypt's generals depend.
The State Department has put a hold on financing for economic programs that directly involve the Egyptian government, administration officials said, out of a concern that the military-led government might have violated Congressional rules prohibiting aid to countries where there has been a coup.
The administration has not declared whether the Egyptian military's ouster of President Mohamed Morsi constituted a coup. But the State Department is abiding by a complex web of restrictions governing foreign aid, an official said. Those restrictions are tighter than the rules governing the military aid, which has not been suspended.
Whether to cut off the remaining $585 million in military aid available to Egypt this year was one of the questions that awaited President Obama as he returned to Washington from a vacation in Martha's Vineyard that was shadowed by the bloodshed in Egypt that has left hundreds of Islamist protesters dead. 
For Egypt, the value of the military aid is perhaps less important than the advanced systems it can buy with American support. Already, the United States is considering a delay in the shipment of Apache attack helicopters and repair kits for tanks. That comes on top of decisions to delay the delivery of four F-16 fighter jets and to pull out of a major joint military exercise next month with the Egyptian Army.
But the administration has stopped short of suspending the aid, which has served as a foundation of the American relationship with Egypt for more than three decades and is viewed as critical to the region's stability, not least as a pillar of the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
Military aid to Egypt dwarfs civilian aid: of the $1.55 billion in total assistance the White House has requested for 2014, $1.3 billion is military and $250 million is economic. The civilian aid goes to such things as training programs and projects run by the United States Agency for International Development.
''We have stopped spending money in areas that would be prevented if it were determined to be a coup,'' said an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. ''We'll put a pause on those programs, because we don't want to flout the law.''
Among the programs affected, the official said, would be training programs in the United States for Egyptian government workers, teachers or hospital administrators. Depending on how events in Egypt unfold, and on how lawmakers react when they return from August recess, the economic aid could resume later, the official said.
There are fewer legal restrictions on the $585 million in military aid -- the amount remaining from the original $1.3 billion appropriation. This has yet to be deposited in an account in the Federal Reserve in New York, where the Egyptian military could use it to buy weapons and spare parts and to pay for maintenance and training.
"As we've made clear, all of our assistance to Egypt is currently under review,'' the State Department's deputy spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said. ''At this point, no additional decisions have been made regarding assistance.''
In the past, administration officials have said they were skeptical that halting military aid would persuade the generals to put Egypt back on a path to democracy. They also worry that withdrawing the funds would leave the United States without any leverage.
Israel and several Arab counties have lobbied the United States not to cut off aid, arguing that the army is still the best hope to stop Egypt from slipping into chaos and that the need for stability should outweigh, for now, concerns about democracy and human rights.
But with the death toll from the week's violence surpassing 1,000 and little prospect of an end to the standoff, officials said, the administration had begun a debate over what threshold it was willing to bear before it fundamentally rethought its relationship with the military.
During his week on Martha's Vineyard, Mr. Obama tried not to allow the Egypt crisis to intrude on his vacation routine of golf, dinner with friends, and beach and bike outings with his family. But on Thursday, the president held a conference call with members of the National Security Council to discuss options for dealing with the standoff.
Back in Washington, pressure on Mr. Obama to do more about Egypt is mounting, but lawmakers remain divided on whether to cut off aid, with a handful of outspoken Republican hawks calling for it, while other Republicans and most Democrats still have qualms. Given the reluctance of many lawmakers to suspend military aid for security reasons, canceling economic aid may be an easier way for them to register their displeasure with the Egyptian government.
Senator John McCain of Arizona, who recently traveled to Cairo and took part in a failed diplomatic effort to defuse the standoff, said in a television interview that the administration lost credibility when it did not cut off aid, even after the generals clearly engineered a coup in removing Mr. Morsi.
''We could be cutting off the aid,'' Mr. McCain said on the CNN program ''State of the Union'' ''The spare parts and maintenance of this military equipment we've given the Egyptians is important to their capabilities.''
Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who accompanied Mr. McCain to Egypt, said the United States should send a powerful message to the Egyptian military leader, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi.
''Somebody needs to look el-Sisi in the eye and say, 'You're going to destroy Egypt, you're going to doom your country to a beggar state, you're going to create an insurgency for generations to come; turn around, General, before it's too late,' '' Mr. Graham said on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.''
But the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, said the United States should ''recalibrate'' its aid to make its unhappiness clear but not endanger security needs like priority passage through the Suez Canal in a crisis. ''I don't want to cut off our relations,'' Mr. Corker said on ABC News's ''This Week.''
Several Democrats echoed Mr. Corker's sense that overarching American security interests made any aid cutoff problematic.
''I think we'll find that aid that we may withhold is compensated by aid that the Gulf states may provide,'' Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
In one small but telling way, the relationship between the United States and Egypt has already changed. An administration official said that when the Pentagon finally delivers the four delayed F-16 planes, it will charge the Egyptian Air Force a fee for storing them.

Foreign Education Costliest in Australia, Report Finds
Australia is the most expensive country for foreign students to pursue a higher education, surpassing the United States and Britain, a report by HSBC has found.
Average annual tuition fees for foreign students in Australia and the United States are roughly the same, about $25,000, the report, released last week, found, but a higher cost of living pushed Australia to the top of the list. A year of study in Australia costs about $38,000 when living expenses are factored in, while foreign students in the United States pay around $35,000. Britain ranked third, with an average cost of about $30,000.
The research by HSBC was compiled from public data in 13 countries. Fees were calculated from the average cost of tuition for foreign students at the 10 largest institutions in each country. Cost of living data came from HESA Global Education Rankings 2010, the Expatistan index and HSBC's own research and were adjusted for inflation. 
Of the 13 countries surveyed, the most affordable place to study was Germany, with an average of $6,200 a year in tuition and living expenses. In Asia, Singapore and Hong Kong are the most expensive for overseas students, who pay about $24,000 annually in Singapore and $22,000 in Hong Kong. -- GRACE TSOI
Harvard Ranked Top University in the World; Stanford is No. 2
Harvard University is the top institution of higher education in the world, according to the 2013 Academic Ranking of World Universities, followed by Stanford University; the University of California, Berkeley; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Cambridge.
The rankings, released Thursday by the Center for World-Class Universities at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, also put California Institute of Technology; Princeton University; Columbia University; the University of Chicago and the University of Oxford in the top 10. The best ranked universities in the Asia-Pacific region were the University of Tokyo, ranked 21st; Kyoto University, at 26th, and the University of Melbourne, at 56th.
The study surveyed more than 1,200 universities worldwide on the basis of six indicators, including the number of alumni and faculty who had received Nobel Prizes and Fields Medals, the number of highly cited researchers and publications, and per capita performance. -- ANNE-SOPHIE BOLON
Poll finds British Colleges Meet Students' Standards
Eighty-five percent of undergraduate students in Britain are satisfied with their higher education, according to the ninth annual National Student Survey, whose results were published last week.
The survey of about 300,000 undergraduates in their final year of studies represented a response rate of 68.6 percent of eligible students. The study, in which a small number of institutions did not participate, was carried out by Ipsos MORI and commissioned by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, a government body. It is designed to guide prospective students as well as to provide feedback on higher education institutions. Students reported a slight increase in satisfaction over previous years in categories including assessment and feedback, academic support, organization and management, learning resources and student unions.
The University of Bath was at the top of the list, with 94 percent of its students expressing satisfaction. The universities of Buckingham, East Anglia, Essex, Keele and St. Andrews all received an approval rating of 93 percent. The University of Cambridge received a 92 percent satisfaction rate, as did the Open University and the University of Surrey. The University of Oxford was just behind at 91 percent, tied with the University of Exeter and Newman University, Birmingham. The survey comes on the heels of a study by the country's Higher Education Statistics Agency that found that 86.4 percent of recent British graduates had either found jobs or were continuing their studies. -- CHRISTOPHER F.

HEADLINE: A New Ethos Grips North Carolina

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEW

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- North Carolina is channeling Alabama and South Carolina when it comes to the best economic, social and political model for a Southern state.
For more than half a century, North Carolina has been progressive on education and public investments, and pro-business -- witness the celebrated Research Triangle between Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill and the financial center in Charlotte -- with less racial strife than other Southern states.
As Republicans took full control of the state government in Raleigh, there has been a shift to the right. Taxes for the wealthy have been slashed, and spending for education and programs that benefit the poor has been cut. Abortion has been restricted, and guns rights expanded. 
At the end of the legislative session in July, in a state that has enjoyed relatively good race relations -- which the business community both encouraged and benefited from -- provisions that ensured higher black voter participation were targeted.
Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican elected last year, says the turn to the right is necessary and is paying off.
''We're getting tremendous positive feedback from the business community,'' he said in an interview. His state had ''lost its focus'' and needed to be ''shaken up.''
To critics, this conservative agenda -- much of it orchestrated by Art Pope, the governor's budget director and a multimillionaire retailer who is seen by some as the state's equivalent of the Koch brothers -- threatens the state's legacy.
''We're turning back everything that made us different from other Southern states,'' said Jim Goodmon, the chairman of CBC New Media Group and owner of the Durham Bulls Minor League baseball team. ''With this shift, economic development is broken.''
Ronnie Bryant, the chief executive of the Charlotte Regional Partnership, the area's top economic development recruiter, recently complained to The Charlotte Observer that all the efforts of recent years to promote Charlotte as a business center ''have been negated in the last few weeks.'' He said business leaders elsewhere were asking: ''What the hell are you guys doing?''
Ann Goodnight, a powerful advocate for higher education in the state, whose husband is the chief executive of the technology company SAS Institute, wrote a letter to The Raleigh News and Observer charging that cuts in education funding were a ''grievous mistake.'' The places that succeed in economic competitiveness, she wrote, ''are investing in education and using the playbook we once embraced.''
The biggest firestorm erupted when the Legislature changed voting procedures, requiring a state-issued photo ID, limiting early voting and ending same-day registration -- steps that disproportionately hamper black voters in elections.
''They are extremists and are playing the race card,'' said the Rev. William Barber, head of the state's chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. The civil rights group is organizing multiracial coalitions around the state and turning out thousands to protest these changes.
On taxes, the Republicans cut the corporate rate, ended the progressive personal income tax and eliminated the estate tax, which affected, on average, fewer than 75 families annually and will cost the state $300 million in lost revenue over the next five years. The Legislature also decided not to continue the earned income-tax credit for the working poor.
North Carolina requires a balanced budget, and new expenses must be offset elsewhere.
''They put in place tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit millionaires,'' said Alexandra Sirota, director of the leftist North Carolina Budget and Tax Center, ''while choosing not to extend a tax credit for the working poor.''
The governor, who is as moderate in demeanor as his previous record as mayor of Charlotte suggests, denied that he had been captured by the right. The tax cuts were essential, he said, because North Carolina was falling behind economic competitors like South Carolina. He pointed out that spending for kindergarten through 12th grade had increased (though not enough to keep up with inflation and population growth) and that funding for community colleges was cut because enrollment was down. Asked about support for the world-class University of North Carolina, the 56-year-old governor replied, ''They can't be satisfied with the status quo.''
Ms. Goodnight, he said, is a Democrat. Besides, he added, her husband supports him. When asked about the alleged voting fraud that mandated the changes in procedure, he offered no specifics: ''It's like insider trading; you don't know until you look.''
The governor bristled at claims that Mr. Pope was the real kingmaker. ''When he made Pope the budget director,'' Mr. Goodmon said, Mr. McCrory ''became a puppet.'' Mr. Pope's political contributions, the governor said, are no different from Mr. Goodmon's giving to Democrats. He depicted his budget director as a fiscal conservative, a benign libertarian with no racial animosity.
Mr. Pope declined a request for an interview. The governor said he had headed off some far-right moves, vetoing a bill subjecting welfare recipients to drug tests and sidelining a measure that would have created an official state religion.
Yet, Ms. Goodnight points out she is a registered Republican. Mr. Goodmon's contributions -- mainly, though not exclusively, to Democrats -- pale next to the millions in family wealth that Mr. Pope has given to the Republican Party through his political action committee, foundations and personal contributions.
As for the competition with South Carolina, the two states had roughly identical, solid economic growth last year, and both have jobless rates worse than the national average. Multiple surveys have long rated North Carolina's business climate as one of the best in the United States. Its higher education system is better than its neighbor's, wages are higher, and poverty is less pervasive.
Dating from the 1960s, under the leadership of Terry Sanford, the country's best one-term governor, and four terms of Jim Hunt, North Carolina produced a much-envied system of higher education and community colleges, good race relations, a desirable quality of life and a healthy business climate. The debate about its usefulness today will persist. But the North Carolina model, which served the region and country so well, is gone in the Tar Heel State.

HEADLINE: Most of U.S. Is Wired, but Millions Aren't Plugged In

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT; Cynthia Howle, Glenny Brock and Alan Blinder contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Obama administration has poured billions of dollars into expanding the reach of the Internet, and nearly 98 percent of American homes now have access to some form of high-speed broadband. But tens of millions of people are still on the sidelines of the digital revolution.
''The job I'm trying to get now requires me to know how to operate a computer,'' said Elmer Griffin, 70, a retired truck driver from Bessemer, Ala., who was recently rejected for a job at an auto-parts store because he was unable to use the computer to check the inventory. ''I wish I knew how, I really do. People don't even want to talk to you if you don't know how to use the Internet.''
Mr. Griffin is among the roughly 20 percent of American adults who do not use the Internet at home, work and school, or by mobile device, a figure essentially unchanged since Barack Obama took office as president in 2009 and initiated a $7 billion effort to expand access, chiefly through grants to build wired and wireless systems in neglected areas of the country. 
Administration officials and policy experts say they are increasingly concerned that a significant portion of the population, around 60 million people, is shut off from jobs, government services, health care and education, and that the social and economic effects of that gap are looming larger. Persistent digital inequality -- caused by the inability to afford Internet service, lack of interest or a lack of computer literacy -- is also deepening racial and economic disparities in the United States, experts say.
''As more tasks move online, it hollows out the offline options,'' said John B. Horrigan, a senior research fellow at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. ''A lot of employers don't accept offline job applications. It means if you don't have the Internet, you could be really isolated.''
Seventy-six percent of white American households use the Internet, compared with 57 percent of African-American households, according to the ''Exploring the Digital Nation,'' a Commerce Department report released this summer and based on 2011 data.
The figures also show that Internet use over all is much higher among those with at least some college experience and household income of more than $50,000.
Low adoption rates among older people remain a major hurdle. Slightly more than half of Americans 65 and older use the Internet, compared with well over three-quarters of those under 65.
In addition, Internet use is lowest in the South, particularly in Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas.
Willa Ohnoutka, 78, who has lived in the same house in suburban Houston for 40 years, said she did not use the Internet at all. ''I use my telephone,'' Ms. Ohnoutka said. ''I get news on the TV. I'm just not comfortable involving myself with that Internet.''
Others cite expense as the reason they do not use the Internet.
''I am cheap,'' said Craig Morgan, 23, a self-employed carpenter from Oxford, Miss. So far, he has made do without the Internet at home, but while he has used a smartphone to connect, that has limitations, he said.
''When we came home from the hospital with our new baby two months ago,'' the hospital ''took pictures and put them online,'' he said. ''We had to go to my in-laws to order them.''
Gloria Bean, 41, an elementary school teaching assistant from Calhoun City, Miss., said cost was also a reason she had not had Internet access at home for three years.
''I just couldn't afford it,'' she said. Being cut off, she said, ''has affected me and my children.''
''They have to have it for school to do research for a paper or something they need for class,'' Ms. Bean said.
As a result, she added, she often rushes from her job at school to pick up her children and take them to the library, where there are 10 computers.
The Obama administration allocated $7 billion to broadband expansion as part of the 2009 economic stimulus package. Most of it went to build physical networks. About half of those infrastructure programs have been completed, with Internet availability growing to 98 percent of homes from fewer than 90 percent.
About $500 million from the package went toward helping people learn to use the Internet. Those programs were highly successful, though on a small scale, producing more than half a million new household subscribers to Internet service, Commerce Department statistics show.
''We recognize more work needs to be done to ensure that no Americans are left behind,'' said John B. Morris Jr., director of Internet policy at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the Commerce Department. ''Increasing the level of broadband adoption is a complex, multifaceted challenge with no simple, one-size-fits-all solution.''
The percentage of people 18 years and older in the United States who have adopted the Internet over the past two decades has grown at a rate not seen since the popularization of the telephone, soaring nearly fivefold, from 14 percent in 1995. Although that growth slowed in more recent years, it had still moved close to 80 percent of the population by the beginning of the Obama administration in 2009, according to several academic and government studies.
Since then, however, the number has not budged, shifting between 74 percent and 79 percent through 2011, according to one study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project. Pew's most recent research shows the figure fluttering this year between 81 percent and 85 percent, a slight uptick that experts attribute to the still-growing popularity of smartphones. Most smartphone users also have home connections, however, and do not face the affordability or digital literacy problems that have caused Internet adoption to remain stagnant.
Even at that level of Internet adoption, however, the United States, with the world's largest economy by far, ranked seventh among 20 major global economies in 2012, down from fourth in 2000, according to the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency. Ranking ahead of the United States were Britain, Canada, South Korea, Germany, France and Australia, as well as nearly every other smaller country in Western Europe.
Aaron Smith, a senior researcher at the Pew Project, said that when the center asked nonusers if they believed they were missing out or were disadvantaged by not using the Internet, most of the older Americans said no, it was not relevant to them. ''But when you excluded the seniors,'' he added, ''most people said, 'Yeah, I feel like I'm not getting the access to all the things that I need.' ''
Researchers say the recent recession probably contributed to some of the flattening in Internet adoption, just as the Great Depression stalled the arrival of home telephone service. But a significant portion of nonusers cite their lack of digital literacy skills as a discouraging factor.
Some programs, like the federally financed Smart Communities, have shown promising results. Smart Communities, a $7 million effort in Chicago that was part of the administration's $7 billion investment, provided basic Internet training in English and Spanish for individuals and small businesses. Between 2008 and 2011, the Smart Communities participants registered a statistically significant 15 percentage-point increase in Internet use compared with that in other Chicago community areas.
The Federal Communications Commission and some Internet providers have started programs to make Internet service more affordable for low-income households. Comcast's two-year-old Internet Essentials program, which offers broadband service for $10 a month to low-income families, has signed up 220,000 households out of 2.6 million eligible homes in Comcast service areas.
Those types of programs hold promise, administration officials say, but they remain unsatisfied. ''I've seen enough to know that we're making good progress,'' said Thomas C. Power, the administration's deputy chief technology officer for telecommunications. ''But I also know we need to make more progress.''

HEADLINE: Lewis Kornfeld, 97, President of Radio Shack

BYLINE: By DANIEL E. SLOTNIK

 BODY:
Lewis Kornfeld, who as president of Radio Shack helped the company become a major player in the early personal computer market in 1977 by releasing the TRS-80, one of the first mass-market and relatively affordable computers, died on Aug. 11 in Fort Worth. He was 97.
The cause was complications of lymphocytic leukemia, his wife, Rose Ann Kornfeld, said. 
When Radio Shack unveiled the TRS-80, personal computers mainly came in kits for aficionados to cobble together. Mr. Kornfeld presented a finished product that consumers could just plug in and use.
The market for home computers was virtually untested at the time, but Mr. Kornfeld prided himself on having recognized their potential.
''Nobody had a personal computer,'' Mr. Kornfeld told The Fort Worth Star-Telegram in 2006. ''I didn't know about them. I walk into a buyer's office, and I see him using a cathode ray tube screen and a typewriter keyboard. I said, 'You let me know when I can play chess on it, and if it will, I'm going to put the damned thing in our line.' ''
The TRS-80's CPU was contained in its keyboard. It used a cassette deck to load and save data and came with a 12-inch monitor. The computer had four kilobytes of memory, the equivalent of about two double-spaced typed pages.
It retailed for $600 (about $2,300 in today's dollars). Comparable computers released in 1977, like the Apple II and the Commodore PET, cost from $200 to more than $1,000 more, though costlier models often had more memory.
The TRS-80 was an immediate hit. The Tandy Corporation, Radio Shack's parent company at the time, initially planned to manufacture about 1,000 of the computers, but by the end of the year 5,000 had been delivered.
By 1983, computers and accessories, marketed under the slogan ''The Biggest Name in Little Computers,'' were Tandy's biggest sellers. That year the company released the TRS-80 Model 100, one of the earliest portable computers. Priced at $800 (nearly $1,900 adjusting for inflation), it could run on four AA batteries and was the last machine for which Bill Gates wrote much of the code.
I.B.M. broke into the market with its own PC in 1981, and by the late '80s Tandy had stopped manufacturing its own computers and begun stocking I.B.M.'s in Radio Shack stores.
Lewis F. Kornfeld Jr. (he used a middle initial though he did not have a middle name) was born in Boston on July 31, 1916. He received degrees in English and journalism from the University of Denver and served in the Pacific with the Marines in World War II.
Mr. Kornfeld became Radio Shack's advertising manager in 1948, when the company had only one store in Boston. In 1963 the Tandy Corporation, formerly a leather company based in Fort Worth, acquired what had become the Radio Shack chain.
He became the chain's president in 1970 and retired in 1981, when Radio Shack had more than 7,000 locations.
After retiring he served on Radio Shack's board until 2003. He wrote ''To Catch a Mouse Make a Noise Like a Cheese,'' a book on small-business marketing, published in 1983.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Kornfeld, who lived in Fort Worth, is survived by two sons, Nicholas and Hardy; two stepchildren, Ann and John McReynolds; two grandsons; a great-granddaughter; three step-grandchildren; and a brother, John. His first wife, the former Ethel Hardy, died.

HEADLINE: Drug War Apparently Has Mexican President's Attention

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- Even before he took office in December, Mexico's president, Enrique Peña Nieto, made clear that he saw the drug war as his predecessor's problem: a political liability best pushed aside to make room for his sunnier plans to overhaul the economy, education and energy.
But crime and violence have returned to the spotlight. Over the past month, Mr. Peña Nieto has experienced a series of enforcement highs and lows that have experts on both sides of the border scratching their heads and wondering: what exactly is the security strategy of Mexico these days? Is it really all that different, or has Mr. Peña Nieto fallen (or been pushed) back into the same old approach? 
The Mexican military's capture of a top leader with the Gulf Cartel on Saturday -- as 23 bodies appeared in a pair of western states where the authorities have been battling gangs and vigilantes -- has added to the sense of déjà vu.
The arrest of Mario Armando Ramirez Treviño, a major drug boss in Reynosa, came just a few weeks after Mexican marines picked up an even more powerful capo: the leader of the Zetas, Miguel Ángel Treviño Morales, known as Z-40. What the detentions suggest, to some, is that Mr. Peña Nieto is no longer quite so opposed to making use of the American-led strategy of taking down cartel kingpins.
It is, after all, what the system he inherited is set up to do. ''Every Mexican administration has presided over the takedown of at least one major leader of organized crime,'' said Alejandro Hope, a former government intelligence analyst. ''There was no reason to believe this administration would be an exception.''
The arrests may also be an effort to appease the United States, which had been growing frustrated with Mr. Peña Nieto's decision to push American authorities into a position of on-call support: when the Mexican government needed help, it would ask.
Some experts say the arrest of Z-40 on July 15 was a way to bring both sides back together.
''They couldn't have taken out Treviño without the United States,'' said David Shirk, the director of the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego. ''That wasn't a target of opportunity. That was Mexico saying: 'What do the Americans want? What can we give them?' And going after the Zetas is a mutual win.''
By that point, security concerns were also demanding that attention be paid. In the states of Guerrero and Michoacán, masked men calling themselves community police were waging war with various gangs, including the Knights Templar, a reconstituted branch of the old La Familia cartel (known for rolling severed heads into a bar a few years ago).
Mr. Peña Nieto's response has been unequivocal. The federal government has sent in military troops, as his predecessor, Felipe Calderón, had done when the area spiraled out of control. Some Peña Nieto officials have even started using a form of Mr. Calderón's famously militaristic rhetoric, using words like ''traitors'' to describe those who pass information to the Knights Templar.
''The Michoacán strategy is very much what we saw with Calderón,'' Mr. Hope said.
Mr. Peña Nieto has emphasized that his approach is different because it includes better coordination across government institutions. On Sunday, Eduardo Sanchez Hernandez, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, made a similar argument regarding Saturday's arrest of Mr. Ramirez, noting that not a single shot was fired in a joint operation involving the army, federal police and attorney general's office. But if control is a sign of competence -- as Mr. Peña Nieto and his party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P.R.I. -- have long maintained, what should be made of the release on Aug. 9 of a drug lord who had been one of the United States' most despised criminals?
Rafael Caro Quintero had spent 28 years in prison for the murder of Enrique Camarena, known as Kiki, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was abducted, tortured and killed in 1985. But, without advance notice, a Mexican judge set him free on a technicality.
Current and former American officials were stunned. ''This is a particularly difficult one for us to just take lying down because it's about a federal agent,'' said John Negroponte, the American ambassador here from 1989 to 1993. ''The U.S. government almost always feels obliged in that instance to take a very firm stance.''
Still, he said, the links between Mexico and the United States are now too strong to be ''walked back.'' The question is how to move forward.
Mr. Shirk said Mr. Peña Nieto had been quietly trying to address judicial reform by pushing for a new federal code of criminal procedure that could help solve the procedural issues that led to Mr. Caro Quintero's release. But many experts say his administration is still too loyal to the dark arts of his party, which was Latin America's ultimate political machine -- only occasionally deigning to explain what was really going on during its rule from 1929 to 2000.
If President Peña Nieto and the P.R.I. have evolved, Mr. Shirk said, it may be hard to know the scope of that evolution.
''They came into this hoping they could use the 'ostrich strategy' and things would just go away,'' he said, adding that even as crime once again refuses to go quietly, Mr. Peña Nieto and law enforcement officials may choose to keep the public in the dark.
''I don't think they want us to know what exactly they're planning and what they are hoping to accomplish,'' Mr. Shirk said in an interview. ''It's useful to keep their strategy close to the vest so they can control people's perceptions.''
In other words, without a clear target to shoot for, who can say Mr. Peña Nieto has missed?

HEADLINE: An Afghan Poet Shapes Metal and Hard Words

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED; Sangar Rahimi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
KHOST, Afghanistan -- The poet guided a strip of sheet metal into the ancient steel clippers, cutting shimmering triangles that fell with a dull clang on the shop floor.
In the background, a workman's chorus filled the yard: a handsaw planing a log beam; a generator humming and catching; the groan of a giant diesel truck idling.
The harsh music of the workday welled up around Matiullah Turab, one of Afghanistan's most famous Pashtun poets, in the garage where he earns a living repairing the colorful Pakistani caravan trucks that transport goods around the countryside.
The cadence of his nights, though, is his own: shaping poetry as hard and piercing as the tools he uses by day. Nature and romance carry no interest for him. 
''A poet's job is not to write about love,'' he growled, his booming voice blending with the ambient noise of the workshop. ''A poet's job is not to write about flowers. A poet must write about the plight and pain of the people.''
With his unflinching words, Mr. Turab, 44, offers a voice for Afghans grown cynical about the war and its perpetrators: the Americans, the Taliban, the Afghan government, Pakistan.
War has turned into a tradeHeads have been soldas if they weigh like cotton,and at the scale sit such judgeswho taste the blood, then decide the price
Taped versions of Mr. Turab's poems spread virally, especially among his fellow ethnic Pashtuns, whom he unabashedly champions -- a tribal affinity that alienates some Tajik and Hazara listeners. His close affiliation with Hezb-i-Islami -- part Islamist political party, part militant group -- has put off others.
But even as his social affiliations are narrow and divisive, his poetry has mass appeal. Mr. Turab reserves his charity for ordinary Afghans, weighed down by the grinding corruption and disappointment that have come to define the last decade of their lives.
Many see his poems, some of which were translated from Pashto for The New York Times, as a counter to the daily spin showered on Afghans by the government, diplomats, religious leaders and the media.
O flag-bearers of the world,you have pained us a lot in the name of securityYou cry of peace and security,and you dispatch guns and ammunition
Seated on a makeshift bench, his wool pakol hat tilted slightly and his clothing stained with grease, Mr. Turab surveyed the evening beyond his concrete workshop bay, a landscape of rags, wires and waste. The squalid heat was broken intermittently by a standing fan connected to a car battery. A neighboring vendor hammered a glacier of ice, cleaving chunks to sell to drivers passing by.
''There is no genuine politician in Afghanistan,'' he said, briefly cracking a rare smile. ''As far as I know, politicians need the support of the people, and none of these politicians have that. For me, they are like the shareholders of a business. They only think of themselves and their profit.''
He continued: ''The Taliban are not the solution, either. Gone are those old days when the Taliban way of governing worked.''
He has no patience for preciousness in his own work or in others', and he is particularly merciless with government officials. He ridicules them, saying they should stitch three pockets into their jackets: one to collect afghanis, one for dollars and a third for Pakistani rupees.
For all that disdain, however, Mr. Turab has remained popular in influential corners of the government. And President Hamid Karzai recently invited him to the presidential palace in Kabul.
''The president liked my poetry and told me I had an excellent voice, but I don't know why,'' he said. ''I criticized him.''
In fact, he is quite widely in demand. Though he prefers to be home in Khost, Mr. Turab's travel schedule still far outpaces the average metalsmith's. People flock to his rare personal readings, and new poems posted on YouTube quickly become among the most-watched by Afghans. He is planning a trip to Moscow soon to receive an award from members of the Afghan diaspora there. And he visits the governor of Paktia, a friend, to perform on occasion.
Mr. Turab is the latest in a long roll call of cherished Afghan poets, among the most famous of them Rumi, the Sufi mystic whose works of love and faith remain popular across the world. In this country, poetic aphorisms are woven into everyday talk, embraced by Afghans from all walks of life. In pockets of Kabul, it is not uncommon to see men bunched together as they transfer audio files of readings over Bluetooth from one cellphone to another.
Though poetry is loved, it seldom pays. Some writers have taken government jobs, finding the steady paycheck and modest responsibilities conducive to their work. Mr. Turab, for his part, has stuck to his dingy garage on the outskirts of Khost City.
''This is my life, what you see here: banging iron, cutting it short, making it long,'' he said. ''I still don't call myself a poet.''
There is something else, which even the plain-spoken Mr. Turab seemed reluctant to confess: He is nearly illiterate. Though he can, with difficulty, read printed copy, he can neither write nor read the handwriting of others, he said. He constructs his poetry in his head, relying on memory to retain it and others to record it.
Mr. Turab grew up in a small village of Nangarhar Province, poor even by Afghan standards. His father was a farmer, and grew just enough to feed the family. Though they had little, he fondly remembers his youth -- particularly the days spent learning from the village poet, a man he grew to love for his sharp words and honesty.
After the Soviet invasion in 1979, Mr. Turab, a teenager at the time, moved with his family to Pakistan. He came of age there, returning to Afghanistan only two decades later, with a trade, a wife and a modest following as a poet.
He kept refining his craft after his return, cultivating a broader audience. Under Taliban rule, he dared to publish a book of his work -- a grave mistake.
''The Taliban beat me very badly,'' he said, shaking his head, then proffering a smile. ''After that, I decided publishing wasn't such a good idea.''
Though he is an unabashed Pashtun loyalist, he has no love for the Taliban, who are closely identified with Pashtun tribes. He says he loathes the terror they cultivate and the way they have destabilized Afghanistan. And he excoriates them, for being as inept and out of touch as the Western-backed government.
O graveyard of skulls and oppressionRip this earth open and come outThey taunt me with your blood,and you lie intoxicated with thoughts of virgins.
The dirt road outside his shop runs all the way to Pakistan, and its traffic is an economic lifeline. Vendors line the highway, selling everything from snow to keep the blistering heat at bay to seasonal fruit. Periodically a convoy of American vehicles passes, breaking the spell of an otherwise Afghan scene.
''Sometimes I'm amazed that things aren't falling apart,'' he said, clasping his hands together as he reflected on years of war and foreign presence here. ''But then I realize there is a social law here that holds the country together, even if there is no governmental law.''
Though he has been critical of the American occupation, he does note the progress that has come with it: roads, electricity and schools. It is other parts of the Western legacy in Afghanistan that he worries about.
''Democracy will hurt and eliminate our tribal laws,'' he said. ''The medicine prescribed by democracy was not suitable for this society's sickness.''

HEADLINE: A Summer of Troubles Saps India's Sense of Confidence

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS and BETTINA WASSENER; Gardiner Harris reported from New Delhi, and Bettina Wassener from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- For the last 10 years, India seemed poised to take its place alongside China as one of the dominant economic and strategic powerhouses of Asia. Its economy was surging, its military was strengthening, and its leaders were striding across the world stage.
But a summer of difficulties has dented India's confidence, and a growing chorus of critics is starting to ask whether India's rise may take years, and perhaps decades, longer than many had hoped. 
''There is a growing sense of desperation out there, particularly among the young,'' said Ramachandra Guha, one of India's leading historians.
Three events last week crystallized those new worries. On Wednesday, one of India's most advanced submarines, the Sindhurakshak, exploded and sank at its berth in Mumbai, almost certainly killing 18 of the 21 sailors on its night watch.
On Friday, a top Indian general announced that India had killed 28 people in recent weeks in and around the Line of Control in Kashmir as part of the worst fighting between India and Pakistan since a 2003 cease-fire.
Also Friday, the Sensex, the Indian stock index, plunged nearly 4 percent, while the value of the rupee continued to fall, reaching just under 62 rupees per dollar, a record low.
Each event was unrelated to the others, but together they paint a picture of a country that is rapidly losing its swagger. India's growing economic worries are perhaps its most challenging.
''India is now the sick man of Asia,'' said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at the financial information provider IHS Global Insight. ''They are in a crisis.''
In part, the problems are age-old: stifling red tape, creaky infrastructure and a seeming inability to push through much-needed changes and investment decisions. For years, investors largely overlooked those problems because of the promise of a market of 1.2 billion people. Money poured into India, allowing it to paper over a chronic deficit in its current account, a measure of foreign trade and investment.
But after more than a decade of largely futile efforts not only to tap into India's domestic market but also to use the country's vast employee base to manufacture exports for the rest of Asia, many major foreign companies are beginning to lose patience. And just as they are starting to lose heart, a reviving American economy has led investors to shift funds from emerging-market economies back to the United States.
The Indian government recently loosened restrictions on direct foreign investment, expecting a number of major retailers like Walmart and other companies to come rushing in. The companies have instead stayed away, worried not only by the government's constant policy changes but also by the widespread and endemic corruption in Indian society.
The government has followed with a series of increasingly desperate policy announcements in recent weeks in hopes of turning things around, including an increase in import duties on gold and silver and attempts to defend the currency without raising interest rates too high.
Then Wednesday night, the government announced measures to restrict the amounts that individuals and local companies could invest overseas without seeking approval. It was an astonishing move in a country where a growing number of companies have global operations and ambitions.
The Indian stock markets were closed Thursday because of the nation's Independence Day, but shares swooned at Friday's opening. Many analysts are predicting that the markets will continue to decline.
''I think things will get much worse before they get better,'' said Sonal Varma, an India economist at Nomura Securities in Mumbai. ''The government is between a rock and a hard place.''
The problem for India, analysts say, is that the country has small and poorly performing manufacturing and mining sectors, which would normally benefit from a weakening currency. Meanwhile, India must buy its oil, much of its coal and other crucial goods like computers in largely dollar-denominated trades that have become nearly 40 percent more expensive over the past two years.
That is helping feed inflation, which jumped in July to an annual rate of 5.79 percent from 4.86 percent in June, far above what analysts had expected.
The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, has recently responded to the rupee's weakness by raising interest rates, but those moves have already begun to hurt a huge swath of India's corporate sector. Growth rates had already slowed to 5 percent in the most recent quarter, and India now has a far harder time meeting its current-account deficit.
Analysts fear that higher inflation, softening growth, a falling currency and waning investor confidence could spin into a vicious cycle that will be difficult to contain.
''There's a risk of a spiral downward,'' said Mr. Biswas, the IHS Global economist. ''It will be very hard to break.''
The submarine explosion revealed once again the vast strategic challenges that the Indian military faces and how far behind China it has fallen. India still relies on Russia for more than 60 percent of its defense equipment needs, and its army, air force and navy have vital Russian equipment that is often decades old and of increasingly poor quality.
The Sindhurakshak is one of 10 Russian-made Kilo-class submarines that India has as part of its front-line maritime defenses, but only six of India's submarines are operational at any given time -- far fewer than are needed to protect the nation's vast coastline.
Indeed, India has fewer than 100 ships, compared with China's 260. India is the world's largest weapons importer, but with its economy under stress and foreign currency reserves increasingly precious, that level of purchases will be increasingly hard to sustain.
The country's efforts to build its own weapons have largely been disastrous, and a growing number of corruption scandals have tainted its foreign purchases, including a recent deal to buy helicopters from Italy.
Unable to build or buy, India is becoming dangerously short of vital defense equipment, analysts say.
Meanwhile, the country's bitter rivalry with Pakistan continues. Many analysts say that India is unlikely to achieve prominence on the world stage until it reaches some sort of resolution with Pakistan of disputes that have lasted for decades over Kashmir and other issues.

HEADLINE: A Balanced-Budget Amendment: For and Against

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Republicans and Democrats Both Miscalculated'' (Op-Ed, Aug. 12), R. Glenn Hubbard and Tim Kane favored a new balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to control chronic federal deficits. 
Our country's debt is a major problem that is slowing economic growth and inhibiting job creation. As voters come to a better understanding of the inverse relationship between debt and growth, the prospects for such an amendment will improve.
Yet Mr. Hubbard and Mr. Kane do not include a component that is vital for the success of their proposal: the spending that must be capped is primary spending -- all federal spending except interest.
No Congress can control interest spending, which is a result of previous spending decisions and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Nor should it. Fiscal responsibility should not rest upon Congressional interference with the Fed to keep interest rates artificially low to enable more federal spending. A result would be higher inflation.
Putting enforceable guard rails around primary spending by future Congresses as proposed in the Maximizing America's Prosperity Act avoids this unintended consequence and focuses Congress on spending it can and should control. If we are to have a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, let's make sure that it is an effective one.
(Rep.)
KEVIN BRADY Washington, Aug. 13, 2013
The writer, a Texas Republican, is chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.
To the Editor:
It is disturbing to read an analysis in the influential pages of The Times by R. Glenn Hubbard and Tim Kane suggesting that all that is needed to cure our debt problem is to do something worse than live with an ever-increasing debt problem: politicize our Constitution.
In the Great Depression of the 1930s, Herbert Hoover called for a severe belt-tightening by government and consumers in the hopes of preserving capital, but the exact opposite occurred: it brought our economy to a halt.
If Mr. Hubbard and Mr. Kane's ''cure'' is followed, both our economy and our constitutional democracy may be in serious need of repair. At a time when our federal taxes are at a 60-year low, they never mention a tax increase. Why the fear?

HEADLINE: For New York's Next Mayor, a Plan for City Schools

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''In Mayoral Race, Looking for Substance in Schools Conversation'' (Political Memo, Aug. 9) points out that the mayoral candidates have yet to put forward comprehensive plans for New York schools. But parents, teachers, students and community leaders have created a blueprint for how the next mayor can improve public education. 
Over the past year, A+ NYC Coalition, for which I am a parent leader and spokeswoman, developed the PS 2013 Education Roadmap through a series of community meetings and a five-borough bus tour that engaged many thousands of New Yorkers in direct dialogue about transforming the school system after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg leaves office. There is broad consensus around investing more heavily in community schools, delivering equitable resources to chronically underserved schools and reducing the role of standardized tests in high-stakes decision-making.
With less than a month before the Democratic primary, the mayoral candidates need to start discussing the future for our schools that so many New Yorkers already have envisioned.

HEADLINE: Anna Karenina and the Business Cycle

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Booms are alike, busts differ. 

 BODY:
Antonio Fatas and Ilan Mihov have a new paper in which they propose rethinking the way we classify business cycles. I'm still trying to decide what I think of their methodology, and I'm troubled by their dates - for example, I don't believe that the U.S. economy was operating at capacity in late 1992. But I'm very much in sympathy with their underlying view about the asymmetry between booms and busts; the question is why, exactly, it feels right.
Here's how I'd put it: Fatas and Mihov have an Anna Karenina view of booms and busts, in which all happy economies are alike, but each unhappy economy is unhappy in - well, not exactly its own way, but certainly to its own extent. Business cycle peaks are always times when the economy is operating at capacity; troughs are times when the economy is operating below capacity, but how far below varies from cycle to cycle. 
This is not at all what standard New Keynesian models say. In those models "potential output" is what the economy would produce if prices were perfectly flexible. (Leave on one side the question of whether flexible prices get you to full employment in a liquidity trap, especially with problems of debt overhang). In the short run, however, prices are sticky, so we're often not at potential; but the economy can run above as well as below potential, and in fact there would be no necessary reason why underemployment should be more common than overemployment.
Largely thanks to this theoretical conclusion, it has become standard to describe the job of monetary policy as one of "stabilization", rather than the achievement of full employment.
Like Fatas and Mihov, however, I don't think this is right. Or more accurately, I don't feel that it's right. What lies behind that feeling?
Partly, I think, it's the historical record: booms are more similar than busts. To take the extreme case, clearly we've never had a period when the economy was as far above capacity as it was below capacity in the Great Depression. And even in the postwar record, if we look at unemployment rates, troughs - local minima in the rate - are more closely clustered than peaks - local maxima:
This difference in spread would be even more pronounced, I believe, if we adjusted for changes in demography.
There's also the now very clear evidence that the old notion that wages are sticky downward in a way they're not sticky upward is entirely true - and downward nominal wage rigidity eliminates the symmetry between over- and under-employment. Here's the SF Fed data:
Last but maybe not least, there's the question of what's supposed to be going on when the economy is operating above capacity. How do you force people to work more than they would want to in equilibrium? Now, NK models do have an answer of sorts: they're always models characterized by imperfect competition, so prices are above marginal cost, and there's a sense in which the economy is always operating with some excess capacity in the sense that people are willing to produce more at current prices. But my vague sense is that this only gives you a limited amount of wiggle room, and that really big upward deviations in output can't happen, while really big downward deviations can.
So, why should you care? Well, Fatas and Mihov have it right: if the business cycle is a matter of the economy falling below capacity, rather than fluctuating around potential output, the costs of recessions are much bigger than often portrayed, and focusing on "stabilization" greatly understates the importance of good macro policy.

HEADLINE: Daily Report: 'Digital Inequality' Holds Back Millions in U.S.

BYLINE: ANDREW WILLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Nearly 98 percent of American homes have some form of high-speed broadband access, but tens of millions of people remain on the sidelines of the digital revolution. 

 BODY:
The Obama administration has poured billions of dollars into expanding the reach of the Internet, and nearly 98 percent of American homes now have access to some form of high-speed broadband. But tens of millions of people are still on the sidelines of the digital revolution, Edward Wyatt reports. 
"The job I'm trying to get now requires me to know how to operate a computer," said Elmer Griffin, 70, a retired truck driver from Bessemer, Ala., who was recently rejected for a job at an auto-parts store because he was unable to use the computer to check the inventory. "I wish I knew how, I really do. People don't even want to talk to you if you don't know how to use the Internet."
Mr. Griffin is among the roughly 20 percent of American adults who do not use the Internet at home, work and school, or by mobile device, a figure essentially unchanged since Barack Obama took office as president in 2009 and initiated a $7 billion effort to expand access, chiefly through grants to build wired and wireless systems in neglected areas of the country.
Administration officials and policy experts say they are increasingly concerned that a significant portion of the population, around 60 million people, is shut off from jobs, government services, health care and education, and that the social and economic effects of that gap are looming larger. Persistent digital inequality - caused by the inability to afford Internet service, lack of interest or a lack of computer literacy - is also deepening racial and economic disparities in the United States, experts say.
"As more tasks move online, it hollows out the offline options," said John B. Horrigan, a senior research fellow at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. "A lot of employers don't accept offline job applications. It means if you don't have the Internet, you could be really isolated."
Seventy-six percent of white American households use the Internet, compared with 57 percent of African-American households, according to "Exploring the Digital Nation," a Commerce Department report released this summer and based on 2011 data.

HEADLINE: Atlas Copco of Sweden to Buy Edwards Group

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Swedish engineering company Atlas Copco agreed on Monday to buy the British industrial company Edwards Group for up to $1.2 billion. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The Swedish engineering company Atlas Copco agreed on Monday to buy the British industrial company Edwards Group for up to $1.2 billion.
Under the terms of the deal, Atlas Copco said it had offered Edwards investors up to $10.50 a share, depending on the British company's financial performance this year. 
The deal represents a 24 percent premium on the closing price of Edwards on Friday. Atlas Copco will add the British company's range of vacuums used in industrial processes to its existing offerings of construction and mining equipment.
"It is a great fit for Atlas Copco," the company's chief executive, Ronnie Leten, said in a statement on Monday.
The deal for Edwards, whose investors include the private equity firms Unitas Capital and CCMP Capital Advisors, is a bright spot in Europe's sluggish mergers and acquisitions market.
Despite a recent increase, including Vodafone's $10 billion offer for the German cable operator Kabel Deutschland, the combined value of deals across the Continent is down more than 40 percent, at $259 billion, from the period a year earlier year, according to the data provider Thomson Reuters.
That contrasts with a 20 percent increase in the combined value of deals in the United States over the same period.
Atlas Copco, which was founded in 1873 and employs almost 40,000 people worldwide, has faced difficulties in its mining division, as global demand for commodities has remained volatile because of the financial crisis.
Edwards investors will initially receive $9.25 for each of their shares in the company, which is listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Depending on the company's performance the rest of the year, they could receive an additional $1.25 a share. In total, the deal is worth $1.6 billion, including debt.
The takeover is expected to close during the first quarter of 2014.

HEADLINE: End of the Options Backdating Era

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: The string of options-backdating cases showed how difficult it was to prosecute senior executives for corporate misconduct that involves arcane accounting issues. 

 BODY:
Before the clamor about the lack of prosecutions from the financial crisis and the current crackdown on insider trading, the practice of backdating stock options came to light seven years ago and prompted a flurry of prosecutions. The practice is now long forgotten, but it looks as if the last of those cases has finally concluded, and as the Grateful Dead put it so well, "What a long, strange trip it's been."
Last week, the former chief executive of Vitesse Semiconductor, Louis Tomasetta, and its former chief financial officer, Eugene Hovanec, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct an investigation into the company's options awards to cover up that they had been backdated. This came after two trials in which jurors could not reach a verdict on charges of conspiracy to commit securities fraud related to the backdating and inflation of the company's revenue. 
For those whose memories have faded, options backdating became known publicly in March 2006 when a Wall Street Journal article questioned whether executives selected an earlier date for the price at which options could be exercised, effectively giving them a lower price and making them more valuable. At the UnitedHealth Group, one of the companies mentioned in the article, its former chief executive paid a $468 million civil penalty and restitution to the company for mispriced options.
A number of companies - particularly those in the technology industry, which gave out stock options like candy on Halloween - began internal investigations into their awards. Because publicly traded corporations must properly report the value of options on their financial statements, any backdating could result in a misstatement that can be the basis for a charge of securities fraud.
The prevalence of options backdating led to a near feeding frenzy among different United States attorney's offices throughout the country who were fighting for cases. Charges were eventually filed in a number of different jurisdictions against executives responsible for approving the practices, usually accompanied by a parallel civil enforcement action by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But a few tied in with backdating were never accused of wrongdoing, like Steven P. Jobs at Apple. 
The United States attorney in San Francisco went so far as to set up a "Stock Options Task Force" to look at Silicon Valley companies. That office obtained the most notable conviction from this era involving the former Brocade Communications chief executive, Gregory Reyes. But even that was not an easy case. The conviction after his first trial was reversed on appeal. 
Not to be left behind, the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, which frequently pursues prominent securities cases, brought the charges against Dr. Tomasetta and Mr. Hovanec in December 2010.
One significant problem that prosecutors in New York faced was that Vitesse Semiconductor is based in Southern California, and almost no conduct related to the charges took place in New York. After the first trial ended in April 2012, Paul A. Crotty, a judge for the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, dismissed six of the seven charges in the case because no part of the securities fraud took place in the district, so venue was improper there.
The guilty plea Dr. Tomasetta and Mr. Hovanec entered does not involve actual options backdating but instead their efforts to create a paper trail at the company to make it appear that the options were properly backdated. And the information lists the location of the crime as "the Central District of California and elsewhere," showing that Manhattan may not have been the best place to pursue the case.
Compared to the Justice Department's recent run of successes in insider trading cases, the options backdating prosecutions were a mixed bag in singling out senior corporate executives. The cases show that prosecutors can be susceptible to jumping on a bandwagon when it appears that corporate misconduct took place.
Among the chief executives convicted, in addition to Mr. Reyes, were James Treacy of Monster Worldwide and Bruce Karatz of KB Home. Mr. Treacy received a two-year prison term, and Mr. Karatz was sentenced to eight months of home confinement after the district judge rejected the government's request for more than six years imprisonment. And much like the Vitesse Semiconductor executives, Mr. Karatz was convicted only on charges related to covering up the transactions. He was acquitted on 16 counts related to the actual backdating.
Other cases were more problematic for the Justice Department. The prosecution of former Broadcom executives collapsed, and the case was dismissed after charges of prosecutorial misconduct by an assistant United States attorney. A jury acquitted the former general counsel at McAffe, after which the S.E.C. dropped its parallel case.
In a civil enforcement action against a director of Engineered Support Systems, a district judge dismissed the S.E.C.'s case without requiring the defense to offer any evidence, noting that the government's own experts did not agree as to what was required for the issuing of stock options. 
The guilty pleas by Dr. Tomasetta and Mr. Hovanec are perhaps a fitting close to the options backdating era, admitting to the cover-up in exchange for a government recommendation that they receive probation for the violations. It was a practice that seemed to fit the old kindergarten excuse that "everyone else was doing it, so I didn't really think it was wrong." 
The conduct usually had a minimal effect on shareholders, centering mainly on disclosure about an obscure part of a company's financial statements. And the trials showed how difficult it was to prosecute senior executives for corporate misconduct that involves arcane accounting issues.
As we say goodbye to the options backdating cases, you can almost hear those final words of the Grateful Dead - it's time to "get back truckin' home."

HEADLINE: Banks Are Falling Short in Planning for the Worst, Fed Says

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Reserve said Monday that some banks did not pay enough attention to the risks that were particular to their assets and operations. 

 BODY:
Most large banks appear to have been sailing through the annual "health checkups" they have had to undergo since the financial crisis.
But on Monday, the Federal Reserve described some significant shortcomings in the banks' responses to the so-called stress tests.
Despite the severity of the recent housing crisis, the Fed said some banks were not taking into account the possibility of falling house prices when valuing certain mortgage-related assets for the tests. 
In other cases, banks assumed they would be strong enough to take business away from competitors in times of stress.
The Fed's findings are part of its efforts to improve the stress tests, which aim to ensure that banks have the financial strength to withstand shocks in the economy and markets.
The tests have created tension between the Fed and the banks. One reason is that the tests can determine how much a bank is allowed to pay out in dividends or spend on stock buybacks.
In March, the Fed announced that two out of 18 banks had effectively failed the latest tests. One was BB&T, a regional bank based in Winston-Salem, N.C. The other was Ally Financial, a consumer lender that has struggled to right itself since the financial crisis and still has not fully repaid its bailout money to the government. Also in March, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs passed the latest tests, but the Fed said their responses contained weaknesses, and the banks were required to resubmit their plans by the end of September.
"We continue to work with the Fed and will resubmit in September," Goldman Sachs said in a statement.
In its review released on Monday, the Fed appeared most concerned that banks were applying the tests too generally. In other words, banks did not pay enough attention to the risks that were particular to their assets and operations. Banks excluded material that was relevant to the bank's "idiosyncratic vulnerabilities," the Fed said.
Under the tests, the banks have to assume weakness in the economy and turmoil in the markets, and then calculate the losses they would suffer under such conditions. The banks then subtract those losses from capital, the financial buffer they maintain to absorb losses. If the assumed losses cause capital to fall below a regulatory threshold, the banks effectively fail the test.
As part of the stress tests, banks have to carefully lay out capital plans to show regulators that they would have the strength to operate through tough times.
But, again, some banks acted too formulaically, the Fed said.
The banks that showed weak responses based their capital plans solely on hitting regulatory requirements, rather than their unique risks, the Fed said.
One upshot of this is that banks may have to hold capital well above regulatory minimums to be considered properly capitalized in the Fed's eyes.
By making its expectations clearer, the Fed could sacrifice some of the unpredictability that could keep the banks on their toes when they apply the tests.
Perhaps anticipating that, the central bank warned that "designing an internal capital planning process that simply seeks to mirror the Federal Reserve's stress testing is a weak practice."
The Fed's review also contained hints that some banks still operate with some of the same hubris that got them into trouble during the crisis.
For instance, some banks "assumed that they would be viewed as strong compared to their competitors in a stress scenario and would therefore experience increased market share."
Bank of America acquired two large firms during the crisis that then burdened the bank with hefty losses.
JPMorgan's big acquisitions during the crisis caused less damage to its bottom line, and recently its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, promised, "We will be a port of safety in the next storm."
BB&T, which fell short in the last test, said in a recent securities filing that it had resubmitted its capital plan in June, adding that regulators had 75 days to review it. Ally is preparing to resubmit its capital plan, Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for the bank, said.
The Fed also said on Monday that 12 more banks would be included in the next stress tests, the results of which will be made public early next year. That group will not include the large nonbank financial firms, like the American International Group, that regulators recently designated "systemically important." Eventually, though, such firms will be subject to stress tests.

HEADLINE: A Trophy Owner Also Familiar With Turmoil

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: While Jeff Bezos&#8217;s purchase of The Washington Post may be the product of trophy hunting, he has demonstrated the skills needed to navigate tumultuous environments. 

 BODY:
Jeff Bezos's purchase of The Washington Post raises the possibility that he acquired the paper as a trophy to celebrate his success as the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com. The acquisition comes after the purchase of The Boston Globe by John W. Henry, the owner of the Boston Red Sox and a trading firm billionaire. The purchases are part of a broader trend toward private ownership of media companies. 
A classic economic study by Harold Demsetz and Kenneth Lehn finds that concentrated ownership might be explained by the "amenity potential" of certain companies, including mass media and sports teams. John Henry's holdings nicely illustrate both. As the authors explain, winning the World Series or "believing that one is systematically influencing public opinion" may provide consumption benefits to the owners even if profits are diminished. 
The study raises another possibility, however. Concentrated ownership works better in highly volatile environments, where rapid change and external forces make it difficult for public shareholders to monitor and judge the performance of managers. In such "high agency cost" environments, it may be more efficient for a single owner or a dominant shareholder to keep an eye on how managers are dealing with rapid change and disruptive innovation. "The noisier a firm's environment, the greater the payoff to owners in maintaining tighter control," the paper explains. "Hence, noisier environments should give rise to more concentrated ownership structures."
Mr. Bezos has proven highly talented at managing in disruptive, innovative environments. Amazon is a publicly traded company, but Mr. Bezos remains the dominant shareholder, consistent with what the Demsetz and Lehn study predicts. Perhaps the right to control The Washington Post is worth more when Mr. Bezos owns the company. Not because it's a trophy, or to save the world, but simply because an experienced and talented captain gets to steer the boat through the rough seas ahead. 
The Demsetz and Lehn study, published in the Journal of Political Economy (1985), is available here.

HEADLINE: Prosecutor in Enron Case Expected to Be Named to Justice Dept. Post

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Justice Department is expected to name Leslie R. Caldwell, the former lead prosecutor in the Enron case, as the next head of its criminal division, according to people briefed on the decision. 

 BODY:
The Justice Department is expected to name Leslie R. Caldwell, the former lead prosecutor in the Enron case, as the next head of its criminal division, according to people briefed on the decision. 
Ms. Caldwell, now a defense lawyer at the firm Morgan Lewis, served as first director of the government's Enron Task Force, running the criminal investigation of the collapsed energy giant from 2002 to 2004. She took on that role after stints as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and San Francisco.
In returning to government service, Ms. Caldwell will assume a post vacated this year by Lanny Breuer, who led the Justice Department's response to corporate misconduct during the financial crisis, bringing big corporate bribery and public corruption cases. He came under criticism for a dearth of prosecutions of Wall Street executives.
Mr. Breuer returned earlier this year to Covington & Burling, where he previously spent two decades before serving in the Obama administration. Since March, Mythili Raman has served as acting head of the criminal division.
A number of lawyers were considered for the position, including Mark F. Pomerantz, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison who, as a federal prosecutor earlier in his career, served as the head of the criminal division for the United States attorney in Manhattan; and Anne Milgram, the former New Jersey attorney general.
Ms. Caldwell is on vacation and did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reportedthe news of Ms. Caldwell's pending appointment.
A Pittsburgh native, Ms. Caldwell graduated from Penn State and received her law degree from George Washington University.

HEADLINE: Detroit Institute of Arts Won't File Objection in City's Bankruptcy Proceeding

BYLINE: RANDY KENNEDY


HIGHLIGHT: The institute has vowed to go to court to oppose any attempt to sell its art, but will not try to block bankruptcy proceedings. 

 BODY:
The Detroit Institute of Arts, whose world-class art collection has become a potential target for the city's creditors in Detroit's federal bankruptcy case, announced on Monday that it would not file an objection in court to the city's eligibility for relief under Chapter 9. Monday was the deadline for objections to the city seeking bankruptcy protection. 
The museum, which has vowed to go to court to oppose any attempt to sell its art to raise money for to the city, said in a statement that it "recognizes the city's severe financial distress and its need for the protection and powers of the bankruptcy court" to help get the city back on its feet. But it added that the city should not "undercut those goals by jeopardizing Detroit's most important cultural institution and the economic, educational and other significant benefits it brings to the city and the region."
The city's emergency manager, Kevyn D. Orr, has said that he has no intention of selling the art to raise money to satisfy creditors. And Michigan's attorney general issued a formal opinion in June stating that the collection, though owned by the city, is held in charitable trust for the people of Michigan and cannot be sold to help settle some of Detroit's billions of dollars in debts.
But Mr. Orr's office has hired the auction house Christie's to perform a detailed appraisal of the value of the collection, which experts have said is easily worth several billion dollars. In the statement Monday, the museum criticized Mr. Orr's decision to undertake the appraisal.
"Repeated statements that 'everything is on the table' and the emergency manager's retention of Christie's auction house to appraise the D.I.A. collection," the museum said, "further complicate and confuse an already complex proceeding."

HEADLINE: Not Really Made in China (or the United States)

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: The value created by new patterns of international trade may go largely to companies rather than to consumers, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is professor emerita of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. 
Tags and advertising slogans proclaiming manufacture in a specific country are fading, because goods assembled with components from many different countries represent a growing share of international trade.
"Made in U.S.A." still appeals to many consumers, but businesses have found that that classification can be iffy. 
And how do you decide what is an import and what is an export when imports are important inputs into many exports, and vice versa?
In their new book, "Outsourcing Economics," William Milberg and Deborah Winkler contend that neither the economics profession nor national trade accounts have caught up to that question.
No company illustrates this phenomenon better than Apple, considered a virtuoso in the realm of outsourcing as well as in design. Most iPhones are assembled in China, contributing to a huge trade surplus with the United States in recent years. But a detailed case study estimates that in 2009, the value added in China amounted to less than 4 percent of the total manufacturing cost.

In other words, iPhones are not really made in China, even though their final assembly takes place there. The cost of components imported from Germany, Japan, South Korea, the United States and other countries far exceeded the value added in China. Measured in these terms, rather than final sales, China's apparent trade surplus in iPhones is actually a deficit.
Rather than exporting iPhones, China simply represents a particularly visible part of Apple's global supply chain.
The traditional theory of foreign trade is based on the notion that some countries have a comparative advantage in the production of specific goods and services in a competitive global market. It offers few insights into the strategic behavior of corporate oligopolies choosing the optimal location for the performance of specific tasks.
Professors Milberg and Winkler define offshoring as "all purchases of intermediate inputs from abroad, whether done through arms-length contract (offshore outsourcing) or within the confines of a single multinational corporation."
They estimate that the value of imported inputs as a percentage of total nonenergy inputs in manufacturing in the United States reached 16.4 percent in 2010, up from 12.5 percent in 1998 and 6.2 percent in 1984.
Debates over the future of manufacturing in the United States sometimes raise the prospect of "reshoring" as wages rise in developing countries, but the number of companies (including Apple) that have moved some production back to the United States remains small, and the overall effect in terms of total value added has not been accurately measured.
Who cares if trade takes the form of offshoring (apart from the fact that it becomes more difficult to measure)? One could argue that it still offers potential benefits for consumers, even at the cost of extensive job loss.
But attention to global value chains and to decisions within companies moves analysis of trade away from markets toward institutions - both corporations and governments - that regulate or fail to regulate their practices.
Most large multinational corporations enjoy considerable market power, increasing their bargaining power with small supplier companies that operate under far more competitive pressure. Their resources make it easy for them to use the lowest-wage labor available. They can use these cost savings to increase their profit margins and overall profits rather than to lower prices for consumers in the United States. Apple's gross margins on iPhones from 2010 to 2012 exceeded 49 percent.
Traditional trade theory typically contrasts gains to consumers with losses to workers in specific industries. But with offshoring, the job losses extend beyond specific industries (such as clothing or textiles) to affect the manufacturing sector as a whole.
In the idealized world of perfect markets, high profits quickly faded away as new entrants joined the fray. In the world we actually live in, large companies take advantage of economies of scale and maneuver strategically to buffer themselves from price competition. As a result, they capture a large share of the gains to trade that would otherwise be passed on to consumers.
The growing separation of management, production and regulation has weakened the relative bargaining power of workers in the United States. Professors Milberg and Winkler assert persuasively that it has also weakened other links between profits and economic growth, funneling resources into the financial sector rather than into productive domestic investment. From their perspective, the changing structure of trade contributed significantly to a redistribution of income away from workers, increasing the indebtedness that drove the recent financial crisis and recession.
It's hard to fit their analysis onto a label or advertising slogan. But consumers, as well as workers, need to know more about the distribution of gains from trade, which matters far more than the specific countries where things are made.

HEADLINE: Breaking Out of a Cramped Economic Policy Debate

BYLINE: JARED BERNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: There are more and better choices to the challenges facing the United States than the polarized political dialogue would suggest, and other developed countries provide examples, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Jared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington and a former chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
The Justice Department's decision to oppose the merger of American and US Airways caught a lot of people by surprise. From the cruising altitude of 30,000 feet, it doesn't look much different from previous airline mergers, so it's not unreasonable for onlookers to wonder why this particular merger threatens consumers that much more than the others.
There are, in fact, some salient differences (e.g., that American and US Airways share many routes and control most of the slots at Ronald Reagan National Airport seemed unduly anti-competitive to the lawyers seeking to enjoin the merger), but at the end of the day, the two airlines' biggest problem is that they're late to the party. First, the more consolidation, the less competition, so those who go later are at a disadvantage against those who go first. Second, it's not obvious that previous mergers have been particularly beneficial to either consumers or the airline industry. (Perhaps if they weren't always bugging everyone to "power down anything with an on/off switch," this would all be going differently.) 
But what I found most interesting about this episode is what it says about the ways in which we shape economic outcomes. This merger dust-up is a microcosm worthy of attention in an era wherein the debate over the scope of government intervention in the economy is confined, misleading, and uninformed. The fact is we can and must shape outcomes-we do it all the time. But because this fact is discomforting to the mythological ideology of "free markets," we're often in denial in ways that skew the debate and severely limit the scope of our policies. 
If you dropped in from Mars and turned on cable news (though that in itself might lead you to hightail it back to Mars), you'd probably think that things break down like this. On one side are those who want the government, the Federal Reserve, the Justice Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, Fannie and Freddie, Obamacare and all the rest of them to just get out of the picture and let the "free market" solve whatever problems those agencies and their interventions are misguidedly trying to fix.
On the other side are the interventionists, the tinkerers, the Bernankes and Obamas with their stimulus, their jobs programs, social insurance, safety nets, fuel standards, and so on, grabbing the "free hand" by the wrist and trying to move it this way and that.
Of course, reality is more complicated, particularly as regards the first group (the second group really does want to do most of that stuff). Whether it's Tea Partiers opposing Medicare cuts, politicians protecting tax-advantaged investment income, or the Justice Department intervening in such a way as to preserve market competition, you'd be very hard pressed to draw neat lines between those who seek more or less intervention. When you drill down, it's usually more a matter of who wins and who loses.
Our Martian might think, for example, that traders in financial markets would oppose outside interventions that affect prices. Yet last Thursday, there was a big sell-off in equity markets based on the fear that the Federal Reserve was going to start doing less to support the economy.
The following graph provides another important and concrete example of what I'm talking about, one that's well known to American economists but underappreciated by the broader public. It shows real gross domestic product and employment trends in the United States and Germany over the great recession, which, as the G.D.P. lines show, hit just about as hard in both countries. Yet note the difference in the employment trends. German policy makers protected against job losses far more than we did. German unemployment, at 5.5 percent, is now two percentage points below that in the United States (that's over three million jobs in our labor market).
These trends reflect policy choices. Germans used "work sharing" to great effect, spreading the loss of growth and demand around by reducing workers hours, compensating them for some of their lost earnings, and keeping them on the job. In the United States, we usefully applied Keynesian stimulus, but much of that went to tax cuts, little went to direct job creation or protection, and when the stimulus prematurely faded, we'd already made the pivot to deficit reduction. Again, policy choices. (The United States actually enacted a work-sharing plan in 2012 but it is neither well known, well publicized, nor widely used.)
Or take poverty. According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the poverty rates pre-policy (before taxes and transfers) among advanced economies roughly cluster around 30 percent. Surprisingly, for all the cultural, institutional, and demographic differences, the market-driven poverty rates aren't that different. Yet others choose to go much further than we do to reduce market poverty. 
Health care provides another good example of a policy choice. The right's intense opposition of Obamacare is said to be motivated by the fear of the government's "taking over your health care." Again, that framing presents a false choice: about 45 percent of health care spending in the United States is already from the public sector, and it's widely recognized that health care is simply not a typical market good. You show up hungry at the supermarket, they don't give you food. You show up sick at the emergency room, they treat you. That simple reality has led every other advanced economy to take control of health care delivery in various ways to insure affordable coverage and cost.
And that's what we're finally trying to do as well, with some hints of early progress. Interestingly, some of the health care exchanges set up by the new law seem to be lowering costs through competition, using market forces within a publicly constructed framework through which regulated coverage is delivered, an interesting hybrid.
It's a waste of time to argue about whether public policy is going to play a role in shaping market outcomes, from health care to airlines to stocks and bonds. No advanced economies exist wherein policy does not play that role. Adam Smith himself recognized that sometimes the "invisible hand" is all thumbs, and wrote incisively about the importance of distributional outcomes and regulating commerce (he might well have signed on with the Justice Department in opposition to the airline merger).
The question is whether the interventions will promote fairness, opportunity, and growth. Too often, our political economy debate tries to preclude these choices in the defense of some pristine vision of unfettered markets. We're told we have to choose between growth and equity, innovation or regulation, factory jobs or globalization, budget deficits or private investment. That's all a ruse, and it has led to the cramped politics and limited policy debate in which we're stuck today. We can and must choose a better path.

HEADLINE: America Has No Leverage in Egypt

BYLINE: By STEVEN SIMON. 
Steven Simon, the executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies-United States, was senior director for the Middle East and North Africa at the National Security Council from May 2011 to December 2012.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- EGYPT has entered a dark tunnel, and it is difficult to say when, and in what condition, it will emerge.
Many Americans, in the meantime, are outraged that the Obama administration has not exerted its supposed leverage, in the form of military aid, to pressure the Egyptian army to restore a democratic form of government.
But it is time for some realism about that leverage. A yearly sum of $1.3 billion may seem persuasive, but this money has always been intended to secure foreign policy outcomes, not domestic political arrangements that the United States favors. (The State Department has announced that it will put ''on hold'' $250 million in civilian economic aid to Egypt; the annual military aid expenditure will remain untouched.) 
For $1.3 billion per year, America has ensured peace with Israel, priority access to the Suez Canal and, more recently, counterterrorism cooperation. This worked under the authoritarian regime of Hosni Mubarak and under the Muslim Brotherhood government of Mohamed Morsi, with whom President Obama had an effective enough working relationship to broker a deal to end the latest outbreak of fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
Despite the fact that American military aid to Egypt has always been intended as an inducement to strategic cooperation, successive presidents have been tempted to use it in other ways.
But this aid has never succeeded in persuading Egypt's rulers to govern the way Washington wants. Shortly after he took office in 1993, President Bill Clinton issued a not-so-veiled warning to Mr. Mubarak to reform the electoral process or face a cut in aid. Mr. Mubarak was unresponsive, and as violent resistance against him mounted, the White House backed off.
The administration of George W. Bush fared no better. When Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice demanded that Mr. Mubarak liberalize the country's political system to allow opposition parties greater representation, he responded by arresting the only liberal candidate with any name recognition in Egypt -- Ayman Nour -- for electoral fraud. (No one should doubt authoritarian rulers' capacity for irony.)
In response, Ms. Rice canceled an impending trip to Egypt, which led to Potemkinesque changes to the country's election rules. These reforms faded quickly, paving the way, in conjunction with an economic downturn, to the mass protests that eventually resulted in Mr. Mubarak's fall in February 2011.
Just as pressure from Presidents Clinton and Bush didn't succeed in bringing about domestic change, the alleged leverage supplied by American assistance failed to compel Mr. Morsi to heed Mr. Obama's repeated warnings to adopt a more inclusive approach to governing a deeply divided Egypt in the past year.
As far as Mr. Morsi was concerned, the need for his party to dominate Egyptian politics and escape the charge that he was collaborating with the West trumped not just the $1.3 billion on offer from Washington but also the $4.8 billion the International Monetary Fund was urging him to accept. When in history has a country the size of Egypt, with its proud history and self-conscious greatness, rearranged its domestic politics for the equivalent of just a billion dollars?
A decade ago, Turkey began making bold constitutional changes, institutionalizing civilian control over the military and reforming the judiciary, but these steps were taken to meet the membership requirements imposed by the European Union -- a status to which Turkey still aspires. Compared with the $1.3 billion America provides Egypt, E.U. membership promised incalculably greater rewards to Turkey. Indeed, if the E.U. had offered Turkey only what Egypt receives from Washington, the Turkish Army might still be running the country.
However great its hegemony may have once been in the Middle East, America no longer enjoys a strategic monopsony. Today, there are other buyers of Egyptian cooperation who can outbid the United States. Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia together have pledged $12 billion to Egypt's junta, and they have done so without the conditions that Congress places on American-appropriated funds.
Of course, the White House could still do something symbolic, cutting off aid to assuage America's moral critics. But presumably Mr. Obama hasn't done this for two reasons.
The first is to avoid making the United States the center of the story. If America cut all aid tomorrow, the Obama administration would be accused by all sides of undermining the country's security and meddling in its affairs. Egypt's current political crisis dates back to the 1930s, and it is one that Egyptians need to resolve themselves, without the distraction of American involvement. And since cutting aid is unlikely to work in any case, staking American prestige on such a doubtful outcome would be imprudent.
The second is that as violence and repression in Egypt deepen, the White House will ultimately be compelled to respond, even if its options are at best symbolic and, at worst, counterproductive.
Proponents of punitive action are correct to argue that the biggest threat America can wield is a cutoff of military aid. But this must be held in reserve for when things inevitably get worse.
In the interim, canceling a joint military exercise with Egypt was the tactically sensible thing to do. Having fired this warning shot, the administration still has at least one round of ammunition remaining. Egypt's nightmare will not disappear overnight; Washington needs to keep dry what little powder it has left.

HEADLINE: Still Tough Mothers, If a Bit Warmer

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
LENOX, Mass. -- Though they're marginal improvements on Mrs. Bates, the lady who sent little Norman around the bend in ''Psycho,'' these are not mothers you could bring anyone home to meet. One is a conniving, endlessly itinerant businesswoman so hard-bitten that she'll haggle over the price of her child's life.
As for the other, she'll do anything she can to humiliate her spinster daughter before others if she thinks it will hold the young'un in her thrall. Besides, she stinks up the place by regularly pouring her urine into the sink.
Yet the big-hearted folks at Shakespeare & Company, the long-lived repertory and teaching center in this Berkshire town, have come up with surprisingly sentimental productions of two shows that have seldom read as anything like Mother's Day cards. At the Tina Packer Playhouse, Bertolt Brecht's ''Mother Courage and Her Children'' finds the venerable Olympia Dukakis making nice in the title role of a 17th-century war profiteer who'll do whatever's required to keep on peddling. 
Across the compound, the smaller Elayne P. Bernstein Theater is occupied by a tender rendering of the brutal ''Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' Martin McDonagh's sinister 1996 family portrait of the ties that strangle, set in rural Ireland. The mother in the picture is played by the formidable Tina Packer. Yes, she's the one for whom that other theater is named, and the founder, longtime artistic director (until 2009) and sometime leading actress of Shakespeare & Company.
Of the two, the taut ''Beauty Queen'' is the easier to get right, and it's the more satisfying production. Watching Matthew Penn's staging of this show, memorably seen on Broadway in 1998, I was struck anew by how impeccably made it is. There's not a plank out of place in the construction of this haunted house of a play. And for the most part, the cast here, which includes Elizabeth Aspenlieder as Ms. Packer's put-upon daughter, inhabits it with a comfortable discomfort.
''Mother Courage,'' written by Brecht in the late 1930s, is a much baggier affair, a three-hour trawl through Central Europe during the Thirty Years' War, replete with dissonant songs, projected scene-setting titles and instructional commentary by the characters. Like much of Brecht, this willfully alienating work has proved hard for Americans to conquer. And this production, staged by Tony Simotes, who succeeded Ms. Packer as artistic director, sometimes goes soft when it needs to be tough.
Still, I was glad to have the chance to see Ms. Dukakis, widely known for her work in film (''Moonstruck'') and television (''Tales of the City''), onstage in a role she has previously played four times. Ms. Dukakis is 82 now. And while she would seem to have the stamina and theatrical chops of a woman several decades younger, she brings to Brecht's archetypal survivor the full, seen-it-all weariness of someone who has spent fourscore years on this planet.
Ms. Dukakis isn't the tirelessly entertaining grandstander that Meryl Streep was in the 2006 New York Shakespeare Festival production. Ms. Streep pulled out every showbiz weapon in her arsenal to keep both her character and the production alive and moving. Ms. Dukakis gives a more naturalistic performance, suggesting a woman always struggling against the downward pull of time and gravity, a Beckettian figure who can't go on but will go on.
Her Mother Courage is earthy and witty enough that you can understand why two men, a chaplain (Apollo Dukakis, the star's brother) and a cook (John Douglas Thompson), would vie for her favors. She has a winningly ribald rapport with the Cook, in particular, even if the vibrant Mr. Thompson, a brilliant and natural Shakespearean, is not as clearly a natural for the stylizations of Brecht.
The range of acting styles, which run from amateurish exaggeration to Ms. Dukakis's almost Method-like muttering, gives this production a wobbly diffuseness. But like its title character, it keeps moving forward, while usually holding the attention.
It is also, at moments, truly affecting. Ms. Dukakis's Mother Courage is more of a mother than usual, a woman with palpable affection for the three children she keeps in harness (literally, since they pull her cart). This interpretation is probably cozier than what Brecht had in mind, but it has its emotional dividends.
Every time this Mother Courage loses one of her children to the never-ending war, she becomes so stooped, you expect her to keel over altogether. But she straightens up. Mother Courage is the ultimate trouper, after all. So, it would seem, is Ms. Dukakis.
Ms. Packer, who has shepherded Shakespeare & Company through many an economic storm since its establishment in 1978, would probably make a fine Mother Courage, though she might be tired of playing that role in life. She is not perfectly cast as Mag Folan, the saturnine, house-ridden old woman who presides over ''The Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' As anyone knows who saw her in the illuminating ''Women of Will,'' an exhaustive portrait of Shakespeare's female characters (staged in New York this year), she is by nature dynamic and exultant.
Embodying a negative force of energy -- in this case, a meanspirited woman who never leaves her rocker if she can help it -- doesn't come as easily. Ms. Packer is not the slyly malevolent dead weight that Anna Manahan was on Broadway. You can feel Ms. Packer chafing to get out of that chair and do something, anything, and she sometimes leans toward Dickensian gargoylishness.
But like Ms. Dukakis in ''Courage,'' Ms. Packer finds a way to get the audience on her side. From the beginning, she lets us see how scared Mag is of Maureen (Ms. Aspenlieder), the daughter who so resentfully lives with and cares for her. Mag's obvious fear tips us off more than need be as to what course the plot will take, and it makes Maureen seem as much of a monster as Mom is from the get-go.
Or it would, except that Ms. Aspenlieder is such an effortlessly likable presence. She wears Maureen's vulnerability visibly, though without apologizing for her character's nastiness.
It's a lovely, unstrained performance, never better than when Maureen entertains that unheard-of phenomenon, a prospective lover, played by a first-rate David Sedgwick. (Edmund Donovan, in the more antic role of his younger brother, is also good.) And Ms. Aspenlieder and Ms. Packer bring everyday familial anger to high-volume confrontations that are all the more disturbing when they take a turn into nerve-scraping violence.
The relative emotional openness of the women here lets oxygen into an airtight play in ways that detract a bit from its suspense. Ms. Packer has said in interviews that she wasn't entirely comfortable with the play's morbidity. ''It's very honest and very funny,'' she told The Boston Globe, ''but I don't know that you come out of there feeling, 'My God, there's hope for the human race.' ''
So Mr. Penn, Ms. Packer and company have let a few rays of light into the pitch darkness of Mr. McDonagh's pastoral noir. Perhaps appropriately, this allows us a summertime view of a bitter winter play.
''Mother Courage and Her Children'' runs through Sunday, and ''The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' through Sept. 15, at Shakespeare & Company, 70 Kemble Street, Lenox, Mass.; (413) 637-3353, boxoffice@shakespeare.org

HEADLINE: Ex-Prosecutor In Enron Case Coming Back

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
The Justice Department is expected to name Leslie R. Caldwell, the former lead prosecutor in the Enron case, as the next head of its criminal division, according to people briefed on the decision. 
Ms. Caldwell, now a defense lawyer at the firm Morgan Lewis, served as first director of the government's Enron Task Force, running the criminal investigation of the collapsed energy giant from 2002 to 2004. She took on that role after stints as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and San Francisco.
In returning to government service, Ms. Caldwell will assume a post vacated this year by Lanny Breuer, who led the Justice Department's response to corporate misconduct during the financial crisis, bringing big corporate bribery and public corruption cases. He came under criticism for a dearth of prosecutions of Wall Street executives.
Mr. Breuer returned earlier this year to Covington & Burling, where he previously spent two decades before serving in the Obama administration. Since March, Mythili Raman has served as acting head of the criminal division.
A number of lawyers were considered for the position, including Mark F. Pomerantz, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison who, as a federal prosecutor earlier in his career, served as the head of the criminal division for the United States attorney in Manhattan; and Anne Milgram, the former New Jersey attorney general.
Ms. Caldwell is on vacation and did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the news of Ms. Caldwell's pending appointment.
A Pittsburgh native, Ms. Caldwell graduated from Penn State and received her law degree from George Washington University.

HEADLINE: Strong Market

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON -- The Swedish engineering company Atlas Copco agreed on Monday to buy the British industrial company Edwards Group for up to $1.2 billion.
Under the terms of the deal, Atlas Copco said it had offered Edwards investors up to $10.50 a share, depending on the British company's financial performance this year. 
The deal represents a 24 percent premium on the closing price of Edwards on Friday. Atlas Copco will add the British company's range of vacuums used in industrial processes to its existing offerings of construction and mining equipment.
''It is a great fit for Atlas Copco,'' the company's chief executive, Ronnie Leten, said in a statement on Monday.
The deal for Edwards, whose investors include the private equity firms Unitas Capital and CCMP Capital Advisors, is a bright spot in Europe's sluggish mergers and acquisitions market.
Despite a recent increase, including Vodafone's $10 billion offer for the German cable operator Kabel Deutschland, the combined value of deals across the Continent is down more than 40 percent, at $259 billion, from the period a year earlier year, according to the data provider Thomson Reuters.
That contrasts with a 20 percent increase in the combined value of deals in the United States over the same period.
Atlas Copco, which was founded in 1873 and employs almost 40,000 people worldwide, has faced difficulties in its mining division, as global demand for commodities has remained volatile because of the financial crisis.
Edwards investors will initially receive $9.25 for each of their shares in the company, which is listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Depending on the company's performance the rest of the year, they could receive an additional $1.25 a share. In total, the deal is worth $1.6 billion, including debt.
The takeover is expected to close during the first quarter of 2014.

HEADLINE: Banks Coming Up Short in Planning for the Worst, Fed Says

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
Most large banks appear to have been sailing through the annual ''health checkups'' they have had to undergo since the financial crisis.
But on Monday, the Federal Reserve described some significant shortcomings in the banks' responses to the so-called stress tests.
Despite the severity of the recent housing crisis, the Fed said some banks were not taking into account the possibility of falling house prices when valuing certain mortgage-related assets for the tests. 
In other cases, banks assumed they would be strong enough to take business away from competitors in times of stress.
The Fed's findings are part of its efforts to improve the stress tests, which aim to ensure that banks have the financial strength to withstand shocks in the economy and markets.
The tests have created tension between the Fed and the banks. One reason is that the tests can determine how much a bank is allowed to pay out in dividends or spend on stock buybacks.
In March, the Fed announced that two out of 18 banks had effectively failed the latest tests. One was BB&T, a regional bank based in Winston-Salem, N.C. The other was Ally Financial, a consumer lender that has struggled to right itself since the financial crisis and still has not fully repaid its bailout money to the government. Also in March, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs passed the latest tests, but the Fed said their responses contained weaknesses, and the banks were required to resubmit their plans by the end of September.
''We continue to work with the Fed and will resubmit in September,'' Goldman Sachs said in a statement.
In its review released on Monday, the Fed appeared most concerned that banks were applying the tests too generally. In other words, banks did not pay enough attention to the risks that were particular to their assets and operations. Banks excluded material that was relevant to the bank's ''idiosyncratic vulnerabilities,'' the Fed said.
Under the tests, the banks have to assume weakness in the economy and turmoil in the markets, and then calculate the losses they would suffer under such conditions. The banks then subtract those losses from capital, the financial buffer they maintain to absorb losses. If the assumed losses cause capital to fall below a regulatory threshold, the banks effectively fail the test.
As part of the stress tests, banks have to carefully lay out capital plans to show regulators that they would have the strength to operate through tough times.
But, again, some banks acted too formulaically, the Fed said.
The banks that showed weak responses based their capital plans solely on hitting regulatory requirements, rather than their unique risks, the Fed said.
One upshot of this is that banks may have to hold capital well above regulatory minimums to be considered properly capitalized in the Fed's eyes.
By making its expectations clearer, the Fed could sacrifice some of the unpredictability that could keep the banks on their toes when they apply the tests.
Perhaps anticipating that, the central bank warned that ''designing an internal capital planning process that simply seeks to mirror the Federal Reserve's stress testing is a weak practice.''
The Fed's review also contained hints that some banks still operate with some of the same hubris that got them into trouble during the crisis.
For instance, some banks ''assumed that they would be viewed as strong compared to their competitors in a stress scenario and would therefore experience increased market share.''
Bank of America acquired two large firms during the crisis that then burdened the bank with hefty losses.
JPMorgan's big acquisitions during the crisis caused less damage to its bottom line, and recently its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, promised, ''We will be a port of safety in the next storm.''
BB&T, which fell short in the last test, said in a recent securities filing that it had resubmitted its capital plan in June, adding that regulators had 75 days to review it. Ally is preparing to resubmit its capital plan, Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for the bank, said.
The Fed also said on Monday that 12 more banks would be included in the next stress tests, the results of which will be made public early next year. That group will not include the large nonbank financial firms, like the American International Group, that regulators recently designated ''systemically important.'' Eventually, though, such firms will be subject to stress tests.

HEADLINE: Economy Is a Casualty in Germany's 'Noncampaign'

BYLINE: By NOAH BARKIN | REUTERS

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Germans sleep better, Bismarck once said, when they don't know how sausages and laws are made.
A century and a half later, Chancellor Angela Merkel seems to be modeling an election campaign on the musings of Bismarck, the ''Iron Chancellor.'' She is avoiding detailed discussion of what she would do with a third term, emphasizing instead her personal appeal over policy prescriptions.
In five weeks, Germans will vote in what has been billed as the most important election of the year in Europe, a continent struggling to emerge from years of financial and economic crisis. Yet there is virtually no debate about the major problems facing Germany -- like handling its departure from nuclear energy, the aging of its population and articulating a vision for the euro zone. 
Differences between the major parties are also hard to identify. Ms. Merkel has pushed her Christian Democrats so close to the opposition Social Democrats and Greens on energy, wages and family policy that the parties have become virtually indistinguishable for many voters.
This has given the parliamentary election campaign a surreal feel. There is no doubt that it is finally under way: Colorful party posters in the streets and Ms. Merkel's first week of rallies, after her return from an Alpine hiking vacation, attest to that.
But there is no excitement in the air. The opinion polls showing the conservatives with a comfortable lead over the Social Democrats have barely budged for months.
As so often happens in Germany, a new word -- Nichtwahlkampf, or noncampaign -- has cropped up in the media to describe the state of affairs.
Compounding the angst have been two studies, from the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and the Bertelsmann Foundation, showing a sharp drop in German voter participation.
According to the Friedrich Ebert study, 18 percent fewer Germans vote in national elections than did three decades ago, the second-largest decline among West European democracies after Portugal.
At about 70 percent, Germans still vote at a higher rate than their counterparts in Britain and the United States, at 65 percent and 57 percent, respectively. But that hasn't prevented soul-searching, with Germans asking whether the absence of political debate represents a threat to democracy itself.
''One reason people are voting less is that the parties have become so similar,'' said Klaus-Peter Schöppner, the head of the polling institute Emnid. ''The big ones no longer distinguish themselves from each other on the important issues.'' In the early 1990s, Mr. Schöppner says, about 30 percent of Germans said it made no difference to them whether the Christian Democrats or Social Democrats were in government. Now that figure stands at a stunning 70 percent.
Last month, President Joachim Gauck, who traditionally steers clear of domestic politics, publicly chastised German lawmakers for failing to articulate their policy differences.
''Those who avoid clarity today are creating the nonvoters of tomorrow,'' said Mr. Gauck, a former Lutheran pastor and East German dissident.
Asked last week about that, Ms. Merkel was dismissive. ''If there are similarities between the parties, that is not such a bad thing,'' she said. ''I don't think the people want to hear about differences all the time. They just want their problems solved.''
It would be unfair to put all the blame for rising voter apathy on Ms. Merkel, said Mr. Schöppner and Manfred Güllner, head of the Forsa research institute.
A major factor, they argue, is the increasingly fractured party landscape that has forced politicians to contemplate coalitions that would have been unthinkable in the past.
In this new world, voters can back the Social Democrats or the Greens only to see their party of choice end up in a partnership with the traditional archenemy, Ms. Merkel's conservatives. That has convinced some Germans that there is no point in showing up on election day.
Another explanation is a growing sense that politicians are looking out for themselves instead of working for the public good, Mr. Güllner says.
That feeling has deepened with a series of scandals. Two of Ms. Merkel's ministers were forced to resign for plagiarizing their doctoral theses. The campaign of her Social Democrat challenger Peer Steinbrück got off to a disastrous start when it emerged that he had made &#x20ac;1.2 million, or $1.6 million, in speaking fees while he was a member of Parliament. Now many dismiss him as greedy.
Another reason why voters are tuning out may be the complexity of the issues. Many simply do not understand the ins and outs of the euro zone crisis, the intricacies of shifting from nuclear power to renewable energy or the details of online surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency.
''Who really understands what is going on there? And who really understands what politicians are calling for on these issues?'' Mr. Schöppner asked.
Ms. Merkel's response is to keep things simple, like Bismarck.
At her first major campaign rally last week, she skated over the surface of the issues. Speaking in Seligenstadt, a medieval town near Frankfurt, Ms. Merkel barely touched on Europe and made no mention of the biggest policy initiative of her second term -- the Energiewende, or energy shift.
Her popularity ratings of about 60 percent are the envy of other leaders in Europe. Still, it is difficult to find a German who is genuinely enthusiastic about Ms. Merkel. Her monotone 25-minute speech in Seligenstadt left even the most ardent supporters cold.
But she does represent stability, security and continuity. According to a new book ''The German: Angela Merkel and Us'' by Ralph Bollmann, she is in ''perfect sync'' with the national mood.
She does not overburden Germans with detail. What she lacks in vision and inspiration, she makes up for in trust.
Strip the pageantry and policy out of an election campaign, and all you have left is the person. That may mean fewer voters show up Sept. 22, but the outcome is not in doubt.
Noah Barkin is the Berlin bureau chief for Reuters.

HEADLINE: Weak Yen Works for Japan as Exports Rise

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japanese exports rose in July at the fastest annual pace in nearly three years, Ministry of Finance data released Monday showed, as the benefits of a weak yen started to take hold and brisk sales of cars and electronics to the United States, Asia and Europe showed a recovery in overseas demand. 
The trade deficit in July was still one of Japan's biggest, at ¥1.02 trillion, or $10.4 billion, as the weak yen and rising oil prices made energy imports more expensive, which may drag on corporate profits ahead.
Analysts expect Japan to maintain a steady recovery, although some warn of risks like the continued slowdown in China, Japan's biggest trading partner.
''As a trend, exports are recovering and will keep growing because the positive effect of the weak yen will strengthen in coming months,'' said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo. ''Hopefully that will offset risks, notably the possibility that China's economic recovery will remain weak.''
The 12.2 percent increase in exports compared with July last year was less than a median estimate for a 13.1 percent increase in a poll of analysts by Reuters, but was the biggest gain since December 2010.
Exports to the United States, Asia and Europe all accelerated. Export volume also rose for the first time in more than a year, offering more evidence that overseas demand could strengthen further.
''We expect exports to continue to recover,'' said Hiroaki Muto, senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. ''The details are encouraging because you can see that exports to Japan's main markets are bouncing back.''
The United States urged Japan on Monday to open its auto and insurance markets more to foreign companies as the two countries pursue bilateral talks linked to a broader international trade agreement.
The United States hopes to make a proposal to Japan on its trade barriers in September, said Michael Froman, the U.S. trade representative, as part of a drive to reach a conclusion on the trade initiative, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, by the end of the year.
Reports that the Japanese government is willing to phase out tariffs on 85 percent of goods under negotiations for the agreement suggest a ''good initial step,'' Mr. Froman said.
''The foreign share of the Japanese auto market is about 6 percent,'' Mr. Froman said in Tokyo. ''The foreign share of the U.S. auto market is closer to 40 percent. I don't think there is any question that the U.S. market is quite open.''

HEADLINE: Rising Treasury Yields Keep Markets in a Slump

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market dropped on Monday for a fourth consecutive trading session as investors continued to worry about the recent rise in interest rates in anticipation that the Federal Reserve would soon begin to wind down its huge economic stimulus. 
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 70.73 points, or 0.47 percent, to 15,010.74. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 9.77 points, or 0.59 percent, to 1,646.06. The Nasdaq composite index fell 13.69 points, or 0.38 percent, to 3,589.09.
Investors had little data to digest on Monday, so the focus for many remained the continuing climb in bond yields. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.88 percent, from 2.83 percent Friday, as the note's price declined 15/32, to 96 23/32.
The 10-year Treasury yield has risen sharply from a low of 1.63 percent reached in early May as the economy has improved and as investors begin expecting the Fed to start tapering its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program as early as next month.
''We've been in this artificially low interest rate environment for so long, it's hard to figure out what normal is,'' said Jim Dunigan, chief investment officer with PNC Wealth Management.
The quick rise in bond yields has worried some investors because it leads to higher interest rates on many kinds of loans, including home mortgages and corporate loans.
''I do think we're not too far away from that point in time where this heavy increase in bond yields is going to start impacting the markets,'' said Doug Peebles, chief investment officer of AllianceBernstein Fixed Income.
Home builders were hit hard on Monday as traders were concerned that higher mortgage rates could upset a recovery in the housing market. Lennar, PulteGroup and D.R. Horton all fell roughly 4 percent.
Bank stocks dropped after a report from the Federal Reserve appeared to indicate that large bank holding companies -- including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America -- may need to raise additional capital. JPMorgan fell $1.46, or 2.7 percent, to $51.83, while Bank of America lost 27 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $14.15. Morgan Stanley dropped 66 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $25.81.
Wall Street will be focused on the Fed this week, trying to forecast its intentions. On Wednesday the Federal Reserve will publish the minutes of its July policy meeting, and on Thursday the Fed starts its annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo.

HEADLINE: Obama Presses for Action on Bank Rules

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and PETER EAVIS; Michael D. Shear reported from Washington and Peter Eavis from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama urged the nation's top financial regulators on Monday to move faster on new rules for Wall Street, telling them in a private White House meeting that they must work to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.
Aides said Mr. Obama also told the regulators that the United States needed a more simplified and certain system of financing housing. The president recently endorsed proposals to reduce the government's role in providing mortgages. 
Administration officials and some lawmakers have expressed frustration that critical parts of Mr. Obama's overhaul of the financial system, which was voted into law three years ago and is known as the Dodd-Frank act, remain unenforced as an alphabet soup of federal agencies wrangle over how to adopt it.
In particular, top presidential aides have highlighted the failure in putting the Volcker Rule into effect. It would prohibit banks from risking institutional money in certain speculative investments. Last month, Jacob Lew, the Treasury secretary, complained in a speech that the regulators were moving too slowly to confront the dangers of banks that are so large that governments cannot allow them to fail for fear of bringing down the economy.
''If we get to the end of this year, and cannot, with an honest straight face, say that we've ended 'too big to fail,' we're going to have to look at other options because the policy of Dodd-Frank and the policy of the administration is to end 'too big to fail,' '' Mr. Lew said.
The meeting on Monday was an attempt to raise those concerns directly with the agencies that are responsible for turning the law into reality. Among those in attendance were Mr. Lew; Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve; and top officials at the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration.
Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Obama wanted to convey ''the sense of urgency that he feels about getting these regulations under Wall Street reform implemented promptly.''
''There are some important rules that have been put in place,'' he added. ''More work needs to be done.''
Congress passed Dodd-Frank in 2010 in response to the financial crisis of 2008. Since then, regulators have been working to turn the mammoth law into workable regulations, often in the face of opposition from lobbyists for banks that opposed the law.
Among the rules that have yet to be put into effect, according to Treasury Department officials, are enhanced prudential standards for banks and certain other institutions, capital and margin rules for derivatives, new mortgage disclosure regulations and the Volcker Rule. Treasury officials said they expected regulators to finish work in those areas by the end of the year.
As the banks have returned to profitability, the Obama administration has sounded increasingly impatient about the pace of bank regulation. Its desire to speed things up comes at what appears to be an opportune time. The fear that banks are too big, and could jeopardize the wider economy if they fail, is shared by people on both the left and right. Congress has introduced two bills in recent months that envision far more drastic overhauls than Dodd-Frank, both with bipartisan support.
''The politics are pretty good for the administration if they can do something on this,'' Nolan McCarty, a professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton.
Some lawmakers also have expressed concern that the regulators are moving too slowly. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and several other senators have proposed new laws that would reinstate a firewall between banks and investment firms like those in the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act.
Senators David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, and Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, have introduced separate legislation that would increase the amount of capital that the nation's biggest banks are required to carry.
''For too long, financial watchdogs were asleep on the job, allowing Wall Street megabanks to become too complex to manage and regulate and 'too big to fail,' '' said a spokeswoman for Senator Brown.
She said Senator Brown was ''hopeful that today's meeting will lead to progress in ensuring that taxpayers and our financial system are no longer threatened by 'too big to fail' banks.''
The administration may also want to sound the right notes as the financial crisis's fifth anniversary approaches. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the event blamed for paralyzing the world financial system, occurred on Sept. 15, 2008. The fact that many rules have not been completed so long after Lehman's failure could be a source of embarrassment to the administration and regulators.
''They certainly don't want that story dominating things over the next couple of months,'' said Marcus Stanley, policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, a group that has called for stricter regulation of financial firms.

HEADLINE: With Proposed Rail Expansion, Northwest Confronts Its Clean Image

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
SPOKANE, Wash. -- The Pacific Northwest's sense of itself can sometimes seem green to the point of parody: a medium-roast blend of piney peaks and urban cool, populated by residents who look descended from lumberjacks or fishermen.
Now, plans by the energy industry to move increasing amounts of coal and oil through the region by rail, bound for Asia, are pulling at all the threads of that self-portrait. 
Last September, the first trains of crude oil from the Bakken fields in North Dakota began chugging through. Since then, energy companies have drafted proposals for new storage, handling and shipment capability almost equivalent to the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which is facing a deeply uncertain path of federal regulatory approval.
Mile-long trains from the coal mines of Wyoming already run daily, and the load could more than double if three big proposed export terminals gain approval and financing.
The expected outrage has ensued.
The proposals ''do violence to many Northwesterners' concept of their place and what it stands for,'' Alan Durning, the founder and executive director of the Sightline Institute, an environmental research group in Seattle, said in an e-mail.
Environmental groups led by the Sierra Club have filed a federal lawsuit accusing the BNSF Railway, which dominates the freight system, of violating the federal Clean Water Act by letting coal spill into waterways from its tracks. The State of Washington, in assessing the permit application of a proposed coal terminal near Bellingham, said in July that it would take a macro-environmental approach, looking at impacts of the project along the entire length of the coal transit route, including the burning of the coal in China.
But with the promise of jobs, the effort is moving ahead. The biggest oil shipment project yet proposed, which would be able to process about 360,000 barrels a day, was given an initial lease approval by the Port of Vancouver, Wash. The reality of the Northwest's environmental image has always been more nuanced than the stereotype suggests. Huge dams on the Columbia River make Washington and Oregon Nos. 1 and 2 in the nation in renewable hydroelectricity. But the cheap electricity from those dams fostered an aerospace industry that is hardly carbon neutral. A multistate planning compact made the region a national leader in energy efficiency. But Washington's big oil refineries can pump out more old-fashioned gasoline than all but a handful of other states.
In the rail debate, the new, more complicated reality could be heard in the voice of Steve Salvatori, a Spokane City Council member who described himself as a fiscally conservative, socially moderate Republican. He sees energy development as hugely important and positive for the nation, he said.
''I'm very excited over the possibility of us being energy independent, and I love the domestic job capability that that brings,'' he said.
Because of a constriction point on the rail grid known as the Spokane Funnel, every one of those energy trains on the horizon -- 60 a day by some estimates, empty and full -- would come right through the middle of Spokane, Washington's second-largest city, with a population of 209,000.
''Spokane is the canary in the mine,'' said Ken Casavant, a professor of economics and the director of the Freight Policy Transportation Institute at Washington State University. ''They're in the middle.''
Spokane grew up with the rattling of the rails as its theme song. As a transfer hub for freight and passenger service -- four competing intercontinental lines once met on the edge of town -- the city hitched its star to the idea of an America on the move. The graceful, filigreed architecture of downtown speaks to a moment around World War I when that economic chemistry reached its zenith.
But where the coastal areas around Seattle -- a hotbed of energy-rail opposition -- are largely liberal, Spokane is more conservative, and while the Puget Sound region has boomed in the post-recession years, Spokane has struggled. The unemployment rate here was 8.1 percent in June, according to federal figures, compared with 5.9 percent in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area.
Bart Mihailovich, whose Spokane Riverkeeper group has been collecting spill samples along the waterways near the city and is a plaintiff in the federal lawsuit, said even if critics of the rail expansion are successful in some areas of western Washington, plans could shift to other localities and the results would be the same for Spokane: trains going through, bound for the coast. ''Spokane doesn't win,'' he said.
One of the major issues has been safety. Mr. Salvatori stressed that he is not yet convinced that there will be risks to Spokane. Questions about spilled coal dust raised by the federal lawsuit should be something that the railroad should be able to disprove, or not. ''Dust should be verifiable,'' he said.
A spokeswoman for BNSF, Courtney Wallace, said that a widely reported figure used by critics -- that each car on a train can lose a ton of coal in transit -- was a rough approximation made years ago by the railroad, and that the dust losses were mostly close to the mines. Mitigation with a surfactant, begun in 2011, and the loading of coal into rounded loaf shapes have reduced that amount further still, she said.
Spokane's City Council president, Ben Stuckart, said in an interview that concerns about oil trains have risen since a deadly derailment and fire in Quebec last month, but that the evidence of coal spillage was already there. ''Yesterday down at the gorge, volunteers found that, right by our river at Hangman Creek,'' said Mr. Stuckart, pointing to a sandwich-size bag of dark chunks on a conference table.
The BNSF spokeswoman, Ms. Wallace, said that freight growth is economic growth. Even if none of the proposed terminals is built, she said, freight traffic through the region, which she said is down 26 percent from its peak in 2006, will increase as the nation's economy rises.
''This is a good thing,'' Ms. Wallace said in an e-mail, ''especially for a state like Washington, where one in four jobs is tied to trade.''

HEADLINE: Pregnant, and Disputing the Doctor

BYLINE: By CATHERINE SAINT LOUIS

 BODY:
During her pregnancy, Emily Oster didn't appreciate her doctor's habit of issuing blanket rules: Don't gain more than 35 pounds. No need to discuss amniocentesis -- you're not 35. No eating in the delivery room.
An edict to limit coffee to two cups a day particularly irked Dr. Oster, a health economist at the University of Chicago whose workday was powered by a ''pretty steady caffeine drip.'' 
Her ob-gyn issued decrees without explanation, much as a parent says ''no'' and expects compliance. But Dr. Oster, a Ph.D. trained in statistics who is not a medical doctor, could not imagine making an informed decision without some data. Her new book is the result of weekends sifting through PubMed and other scientific databases; reading a textbook, Steven Gabbe's ''Obstetrics''; and chewing over issues with friends in the field to figure out which pregnancy rules were supported by convincing evidence.
''Expecting Better'' will be a revelation for curious mothers-to-be whose doctors fail to lay out the pros and cons of that morning latte, let alone discuss real science. And it makes for valuable homework before those harried ob-gyn appointments, even for lucky patients whose doctors are able to talk about the rationale behind their advice.
But her confrontational approach may well alienate some readers, not to mention doctors, and some experts are questioning the accuracy of her advice on alcohol.
Some of myths she attempts to explode were already on the ropes. It's widely known that bed rest -- recommended to supposedly prevent preterm labor -- is supported by little evidence and could cause harm. And Dr. Oster, 33, notes that ''fertility declines with age, but not as fast as you might expect.'' But as luck would have it, she got scooped by an article in The Atlantic that argued -- with statistics -- that a decline in fertility in a woman's 30s has been oversold.
She's on fresher terrain dissecting two tests performed late in pregnancy. The nonstress test, done to assess fetal distress, depends on measurements of the heart rate and the fetus' movements. Simply clapping loudly can wake the fetus and get her moving. Good to know.
And if an ultrasound finds that amniotic fluid is too low, Dr. Oster writes, there are two possible solutions. Make sure the so-called deepest vertical pocket is being measured; alternately, drinking two liters of water before the test can raise amniotic fluid levels. That's useful advice, especially since a low reading can lead to induced labor.
Yet some of her conclusions are less well supported by medical research. After reviewing small studies showing that exercise has little impact on rates of C-sections, fetal growth or labor length, she concludes that exercise is ''fine'' for pregnant women but so is abstaining for nine months. The latter approach overlooks the broad health benefits of exercise, pregnant or not.
Dr. Oster's thoughts on drinking alcohol while expecting have already generated controversy. In her view, there is no good scientific evidence that light drinking negatively impacts the fetus. Pregnant women can be comfortable with ''1 to 2 drinks a week in the first trimester'' and one drink daily afterward, she writes.
Similar assertions have long been made, but her explanation may be unique: a woman who drinks slowly lowers the amount of alcohol and acetaldehyde, its toxic byproduct, reaching her fetus.
Most government agencies and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say that no amount of alcohol has been proved safe for the developing fetus, a position Dr. Oster calls ''draconian.''
Bill Dunty, a program director of the division of metabolism and health effects at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, called her explanation ''oversimplified'' and said it could ''potentially mislead women to think they are not exposing their fetus to alcohol.''
Women vary in their ability to absorb and metabolize alcohol, according to Dr. Dunty. ''It is unrealistic to believe that an individual can inherently control the amount of alcohol or its metabolites that reach her fetus by taking longer time to drink an alcoholic beverage,'' he said.
Dr. Oster contends that acetaldehyde is processed ''by the baby's liver and doesn't get into the brain.''
However, the fetal liver is not formed until at least week 20, and it doesn't become fully functional until just before birth, says Jacquelyn Bertrand, a senior scientist at the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
What's more, ethanol crosses the placenta and becomes part of the amniotic fluid, said Dr. Bertrand, who has a Ph.D. in psychology and has studied the neurodevelopment of children with prenatal alcohol exposure. Even with very slow drinking, ethanol builds up in the amniotic fluid. which bathes fetal tissue for a considerable time, she said, adding that all fetal organs, especially the brain, are very vulnerable because sometimes they are in direct contact with amniotic fluid.
Throughout ''Expecting Better,'' Dr. Oster paints a fairly antagonistic picture of the doctor-patient relationship, castigating what she views as the restriction of women's freedom.
Dr. Jeffrey L. Ecker, the chairman of the committee on obstetrics practice for A.C.O.G., acknowledged that doctors used to take a ''directive approach of 'Do this, don't do that, end of story.''' But now, he said, relationships with expectant patients have evolved into more of a ''shared decision-making model.''
''I wouldn't equate offering a recommendation, even a recommendation that doesn't have the strongest possible evidence, with restricting someone's freedom,'' Dr. Ecker said.

HEADLINE: Trifling With the Arts and Humanities

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
More than eight months ago, the high-wattage Broadway producer Rocco Landesman announced his departure as chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. Mr. Landesman, who took the job in 2009, will be hard to replace but not impossible. The White House has taken too long to nominate a successor. It also needs a new leader for the National Endowment for the Humanities, which has been missing a permanent chief since May. 
Both of these small-but-vital endowments have able acting leaders. But almost by definition, interim bosses do not have the influence permanent leaders do. A strong voice at the top -- nominated by the president and approved by Congress -- would be particularly helpful now that Congressional Republicans are threatening major budget cuts that neither agency can easily absorb.
The House Appropriations Committee has proposed cutting each budget by half. Present financing levels are about $155 million each, a mite in the federal government's overall $3.5 trillion budget. Even at these modest levels, the endowments are essential to art and enlightenment all across the country, and they help local economies in the bargain. Grants range from smaller awards, like $50,000 to the Nicolaysen Art Museum in Casper, Wyo., to bigger ones, like $3.5 million this year for the digital preservation of historic American newspapers dating from 1836 to 1922.
Mr. Landesman has spent much of his time stressing art's contribution to local economies -- $26 in local economic activity, he said, for every $1 spent by the endowment. House Republicans have not been listening. Representative Hal Rogers of Kentucky has belittled endowment investments as ''nice-to-have'' programs.
The White House's job is to find persuasive leaders for both agencies to explain why culture is central to a civilized society, not merely ''nice to have.''

HEADLINE: European Union Sets Emergency Session on Suspending Aid to Egypt

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
LONDON -- European Union foreign ministers will meet in an emergency session on Wednesday to discuss suspending aid to Egypt, but the continuing military crackdown there has been a devastating blow to European efforts to negotiate a political solution and fill a vacuum left by Washington.
The European foreign ministers are under pressure from their voters to act, but it is less clear whether any step they take can be more than symbolic in an Egyptian situation that senior European officials acknowledge to be embittered and divided.
The European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, worked to earn trust on all sides and had remarkable access to leaders of both the military and the Muslim Brotherhood this summer when the United States was being criticized by all sides. At the same time, senior officials concede, she and her envoy, Bernardino León, could do little to promote a compromise or even a useful dialogue.
''Unlike Washington, we were seen as having no historical baggage, no hidden agenda, and we used to see everyone,'' a senior European official said in an interview. ''They saw the added value we could bring by talking to everyone. That was the European advantage.'' 
Without the intimate ties the United States has to the military or a history of nearly uncritical alliance with Egypt's former president, Hosni Mubarak, the Europeans were more trusted by the democrats, secularists and Islamists, and they were heard by the military, too. How sincere both sides were in their discussions remains unclear, though the official said there were moments in the last few months when Ms. Ashton felt that both sides were ''speaking the same language and things were moving.''
European officials remain hopeful that some sort of accord can be worked out. ''We believe a political solution is possible, and we have to insist upon it,'' Mr. León said on Monday in Brussels. ''All violence from both sides needs to stop. There are no easy solutions, no easy way out. But the E.U. will keep striving for this.''
But efforts to create confidence-building measures and produce meaningful negotiations about an inclusive and democratic political process never quite came to fruition, for the Europeans or for the Americans. ''Everyone agreed with us and said, 'Yes, we have to talk and get together and make it happen,' but it never did,'' the official said. ''Now there's a blame game on all sides.''
The Europeans are facing a lot of criticism, as are the Americans, for ''being blind, not seeing what's going on, not condemning terrorism,'' the official said. ''So it becomes more difficult to have the same level of access.''
Throughout her visits, officials said, Ms. Ashton pressed for the inclusion of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egyptian political life; the release of the ousted president, Mohamed Morsi; and a quick return to the democratic process. Ms. Ashton is said to believe that there is a danger of discouraging the Brotherhood and other Islamists in the region from believing that the democratic process can work for them, which will only give more ammunition to the radical Islamists who favor the use of force against force, another European official said.
But it became increasingly clear that the military continued to see the Brotherhood and Morsi supporters as a threat to Egypt's future, while the Islamists themselves refused to accept what they considered to be a military coup that overthrew the democratically elected Mr. Morsi.
Egypt is important but only part of a larger regional struggle of Islam versus secularism and Sunni versus Shiite, the official said. ''It's an historical process, and you can only judge it much further down the line,'' the official said. ''From a day-to-day tactical basis, you can say it didn't work, let's do something else. But we want to help bring Egypt to where Egyptians want it to be, to a democratic path as an important neighbor for Europe.''
The doors are not closed, and Ms. Ashton and Mr. León are ''ready to go back, but there has to be something to do,'' the official said. ''The idea was to create an environment for people to talk together, but only they can decide whether or not to do it.''
Late last week, the Swedish foreign minister, Carl Bildt, forecast a period of severe repression, with hard-liners in command in Cairo, but said the Europeans should keep talking to all sides so as to be ready, if the opportunity arose, to play a role in achieving a solution.
The official would not speculate on what the European Union foreign ministers might do on Wednesday, but a number of them have already spoken about rethinking the bloc's aid program and relationship with a government so obviously dominated by the military that has just cracked down so violently.
The European Union, together with member nations, is by far the largest donor of nonmilitary aid to Egypt, with continuing programs worth some $800 million. But many of those are already blocked by the political turmoil, so not much is happening, European officials said.
Even those sums are dwarfed by what the military government is getting from Sunni allies like Saudi Arabia, which has already vowed to make up the difference if Western aid is cut or suspended.
So Europe's real leverage is not so much money as it is tourism and private investment, the officials say. While Egypt is in turmoil, no one is investing, and nearly all European governments have advised their citizens not to travel to Egypt.
European nations are Egypt's biggest trading partner, according to the Egyptian statistics office. The trade volume between Egypt and the European Union reached almost 24 billion euros in 2011 (then $34.5 billion), compared with $8.2 billion with the United States. And European nations sell about $400 million a year in military equipment to Egypt.
Last year, the bloc and its member countries pledged a combined 5 billion euros ($6.7 billion) in multiyear loans and aid for Egypt.
American military aid to Egypt dwarfs civilian aid: of the $1.55 billion in total assistance the White House has requested for 2014, $1.3 billion is military and $250 million is economic.
Briefing reporters in Brussels after an ambassadors' meeting to prepare for their foreign ministers, Mr. León said there was ''practical unanimity,'' adding that ''it is absolutely important for Europe's foreign relations to be engaged constructively in Egypt and at the same time respond to the situation.''
He said Europe would keep working with ''democratic forces'' in Egypt. ''We will respond to the situation and will act as a constructive actor in giving a political solution,'' Mr. León said. ''The E.U. will keep striving for a political solution.''

HEADLINE: The Struggle for Power in Egypt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Democracy in Egypt Can Wait'' (Op-Ed, Aug. 17):
Charles A. Kupchan argues that democracy in Egypt can wait until the country develops functioning, responsible government. This was America's policy in Egypt for 30 years under Hosni Mubarak until the people rose up in a revolution for which the Americans and the C.I.A. were unprepared.
American policy experts have consistently ignored the aspirations of the people, who have been obliged to endure tyrannical regimes long tolerated by the United States. 
Everything happening in Egypt is the direct result of Mr. Mubarak's corrupt rule, which America never challenged for reasons of expedience. Now the struggle is between the Army and the Islamists, with the United States powerless to determine the outcome.
Only serious compromises can prevent more bloodshed and violence. The sole constructive role for America is to negotiate such compromises that can lead to a stable democracy.
RICHARD CUMMINGS Sag Harbor, N.Y., Aug. 17, 2013
The writer is a former attorney adviser, Near East South Asia region, United States Agency for International Development.
To the Editor:
''Democracy in Egypt Can Wait'' is the most sensible point of view I've heard since millions of Egyptians surged into the streets at the end of June to protest the government of Mohamed Morsi. It should be read carefully by all American officials before they presume to declare what is best for a society in transition.
Democracy is more than casting ballots. When Mr. Morsi's government -- elected in rushed circumstances and without institutions to sustain the process -- did not operate democratically, the same populace that ousted the previous regime wanted a recall. With no provisions for such a vote, citizens spoke with their feet, all across the country. For better or worse, the military stepped in to carry out the recall.
Now, with two intransigent sides dug in, the way forward is murky and dangerous. Our role can only be to encourage an end to violence and steps toward responsible government. Under the circumstances, full democracy may well have to wait.
KAREN EL-BADRY Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Aug. 17, 2013
To the Editor:
Western diplomats may think that reconciliation is possible between the Muslim Brotherhood and the secular military in Egypt. But they do not understand the society in which the current turmoil is taking place.
There is no way that members of the Muslim Brotherhood can reconcile themselves to losing power after having won a popular election. Since the 1920s, the Muslim Brotherhood has been trying to convert Egypt into an Islamic state, although the vast majority of Egyptians do not wish to live under Shariah law.
The Muslim Brotherhood fought for 90 years to get power. Do Western diplomats think that it will be willing to give up power after getting a taste of it?
The present leaders of Egypt who deposed the government of Mohamed Morsi understand that there is no point in trying to sit down with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood and negotiate a middle way. The only option left for the present leaders is to fight them and subdue them, for the sake of Egyptian society. I hope that the military will move to a civilian government in due course.
LUCIENNE CARASSO BULOW New York, Aug. 18, 2013
The writer is working on a book about growing up Jewish in Egypt.
To the Editor:
While the civil conflict in Egypt is sad, it does not directly affect our national interests. We can encourage restraint and civil conduct among the Egyptians, but we cannot force them, and withdrawing our aid will end any influence we might have.
It has taken centuries of wars, revolutions and religious upheavals for Western society to overthrow sovereign rule and evolve to our current democratic system. It will surely take countries like Egypt decades, even generations.
Egyptians must work their own way through their problems; it is their conflict, not ours. We must learn patience.
FREDERICK M. TRAPNELL Los Altos, Calif., Aug. 18, 2013
To the Editor:
It is unacceptable for the American media and the Obama administration to frame the anti-government protesters as being composed only of members of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Yes, many of the protesters are members of or support the Muslim Brotherhood, but many others are not members of the Muslim Brotherhood. They are Egyptian citizens who simply do not support the military coup that unseated Mohamed Morsi and do not accept that their budding democracy has been stolen by the Egyptian military.
Report this crisis as what it is: another popular revolt against an unpopular military, right-wing-dominated government.

HEADLINE: Where Words Mean As Much as Objects

BYLINE: By TOM MASHBERG

 BODY:
Four years ago, the American Museum of Natural History agreed to return to the Apaches 77 objects from its collection, including headwear, feathers, bows and arrows, medicine rings and satchels containing crystals and charms.
But none of the items have gone back because of an unusual, if persistent, disagreement with representatives of the Apaches over whether the museum will officially designate the items as sacred relics that should never have been taken.
At first glance, the dispute would seem to hinge on semantics: the museum is prepared to refer to the objects, many more than a century old, as ''cultural items,'' while the Apaches insist that they be designated as ''sacred'' and ''items of cultural patrimony,'' legal classifications set out under federal law. The Apaches say this is hardly a case of being fussy. They say the items are imbued with their religion's holy beings, that tribal elders attribute problems like alcoholism and unemployment on reservations to their unsettled spirits, and that the museum's position is insulting to them and their deities. 
''This is them telling us they know more about Apache culture than the Apaches,'' said Vincent Randall, cultural preservation director with the Yavapai-Apache Nation in Arizona, one of four Apache tribes allied in the dispute.
The museum, home to tens of thousands of American Indian artifacts from scores of tribes, says that no insult was intended.
While the institution declined to detail how it came to its decision about the items, it said in a statement that it had closely followed the 1990 federal law that governs such repatriations, known as the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.
''Determining classifications under Nagpra is a complex process,'' the statement said, referring to the law, ''and the museum made the judgment consistent with established criteria. Upon return, the Western Apache are free to use and classify the cultural objects fully in accordance with tribal custom and traditions as they determine.''
The museum said the items the Apaches seek were ''lawfully obtained by a respected anthropologist approximately 100 years ago,'' which the Apaches dispute.
That scholar, Pliny Earle Goddard, was employed by the museum in 1914 to live among the Apache and study their rituals, according to copies of letters written by Mr. Goddard at the time.
The Apaches, who number 55,000 across more than a dozen distinct groups in Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, have been seeking the return of items scattered in museums around the country since the early 1990s.
Under the federal law, museums are asked to classify items they intend to repatriate. ''Sacred objects'' are defined as those needed by tribes and their spiritual leaders to practice religion, while ''objects of cultural patrimony'' are defined as items that have historical importance to the tribe as a whole, as opposed to merely personal and everyday items. The law, which requires museums to cover the cost of returning items, does not include a classification known as ''cultural items,'' but it also leaves to museums the final decision on just how to classify the objects they are returning.
Federal officials who oversee the Repatriation Act agree that the museum is abiding by the letter of the law, though they noted that, in practice, such institutions almost always identify the items by formal category.
David Tarler, a training and enforcement official for the repatriation program, said some Indian tribes feel the use of the term ''cultural patrimony'' in the documentation amounts to an acknowledgment that the objects should never have been removed from tribal hands without consent. Mr. Tarler, who has monitored the Apache case since it arose in 2005, said such an admission is ''an important matter of healing'' for those tribes. ''They want affirmation that they have always owned the objects tribally,'' he said.
The repatriation act is intended to help American Indians reclaim burial and religious items and other objects of enduring significance that were taken from reservations when the tribes were suffering under resettlement, poverty and military control. It was a time, Indians and historians say, when communal spiritual items were filched by unscrupulous visitors, confiscated by soldiers, or sold and bartered by hungry tribe members who lacked such authority.
''We were hunted down and overrun, and this is all part of our historical trauma that we still carry around,'' said Ramon Riley, cultural resources director for the White Mountain Apache Tribe in eastern Arizona.
Mr. Riley, who is 73, and his fellow leaders from the San Carlos, Tonto and Yavapai tribes say they are morally bound to demand the designations they deem more respectful. ''These are not playthings,'' he said. ''We use them in ceremonies to connect us with our creator.''
The Apaches say the Natural History Museum's stance angers and perplexes them because the museum has used the desired designations on three earlier occasions, in 1998, 1999 and 2007, when repatriating Apache ceremonial caps, lightning sticks and similar articles. They also point out that the museum has used the more formal wording in the Federal Register in 19 of the 21 American Indian repatriations accords it has made since 1998.
Tribe members visited the museum in 2005 to identify the items, sent letters to the museum and federal officials explaining why the items are singular, and went before a review committee set up under the federal law, which agreed that the items were part of the tribe's cultural heritage.
The Apaches renewed their talks with the museum in January, soon after the Field Museum in Chicago agreed to classify 146 tribal items as sacred objects of cultural patrimony based on ''a greater understanding of Apache beliefs.'' In doing so, the Field altered its 2006 decision to classify 56 of those objects as cultural items only, and submitted a revised notice to the Federal Register, where such returns must be announced.
Some two dozen museums have adopted the Apaches' position in making their returns, including the Denver Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the state museums of Arizona and New Mexico.
The Apaches, though, also have a dispute with the Smithsonian Institution, which is not governed by the 1990 Repatriation Act, over its refusal to return six objects that the tribe deems both sacred and patrimonial.
Mr. Randall said the social ills plaguing his tribe compel the Apaches to remain at loggerheads with the natural history museum in New York.
''If we disrespect the holy people, we suffer terrible consequences,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Scandal-Weary San Diego Asks A Question: Where's the Mayor?

BYLINE: By ROB DAVIS and JENNIFER MEDINA; Rob Davis reported from San Diego, and Jennifer Medina from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO -- In the five weeks since Mayor Bob Filner was first accused of sexual harassment by an aide, San Diego has almost felt like a city held hostage.
On Monday, television cameras were lined up at City Hall hoping to catch a glimpse of his return, since it was supposed to be his first day back after two weeks at a rehabilitation program and a week of personal leave. His top aide said she had no idea where he was.
About 1,000 residents volunteered to fan out across this normally unhurried, sun-drenched city, hustling to collect the 101,157 signatures needed to force a recall election. And the City Council president said his goal was to get rid of the mayor ''and get this city back on track.''
Sixteen women, the latest a great-grandmother, have now stepped forward to accuse Mr. Filner, 70, a Democratic former congressman, of inappropriate behavior. Calls for his resignation have been piling up, including demands from national Democratic leaders and the entire City Council. Last month, the county Democratic Party officially urged him to resign and Senator Barbara Boxer published a letter on her Web site saying that he had ''betrayed the trust'' of women and asked him to step down. 
As Monday passed, there was no sign of the mayor at City Hall. He was seen on television walking into a downtown office building, followed a short time later by the lawyer Gloria Allred, who is representing some of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment.
As she left the building Monday evening, Ms. Allred told reporters that the two sides were in settlement talks mediated by a retired federal judge. She declined to provide details, and would not say whether Mr. Filner was directly involved in the negotiations, but other city officials -- including Council President Todd Gloria -- were taking part.
Mr. Filner has consistently rejected resigning. Every other route poses more of a challenge to his opponents, who were exploring obscure city laws regarding his use of public money. The petitioners seeking a recall must collect signatures of registered city voters at a rate of 2,600 a day by Sept. 26. If they fail, they will have an additional 30 days for a supplemental petition. A spokeswoman for the recall effort, which began on Sunday, said they had collected several thousand signatures already.
Anger continued to grow over the city's near-paralysis.
''Contrary to what the mayor apparently thinks, this is not going away,'' said Mr. Gloria, a Democrat. ''Fewer people than ever respect him, meaning he cannot get anything done. The city has run better without him here; he should give us that opportunity permanently by resigning. The Council will continue to question him and his decisions and try to get this city back on track like San Diegans deserve.''
Since he was elected mayor last year, and for decades while he was in Congress, Mr. Filner built a reputation for liberal politics and personal abrasiveness. But there had been no public accusations like those plaguing him now. He was known to keep up a relentless public schedule, appearing on the nightly news at every opportunity. But when the accusations began, he became much less visible. While he was away, his top aide said she had the locks on his office changed to ensure he would not have access, though his office did put out a news release detailing the $120,000 in small business grants he apparently approved.
As local news reports have detailed the accusations -- from the ''Filner headlock,'' in which the mayor gripped a woman so that she could not escape, to asking a 67-year-old part-time City Hall worker if she thought he was able to ''go for eight hours straight'' -- the city has been the source of a stream of late-night jokes.
Mark Cafferty, executive director of San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation, said, ''Every conversation I have with people who are thinking of doing business here -- whether they are in another part of the country or another part of the world even -- starts and ends with the jokes from Conan O'Brien.''
He added: ''It's paralyzing things, projects that had started or should be getting started. It's becoming more bizarre and circuslike by the moment.'' The mayor, he said, has tarnished ''the image that the city is a place to be taken seriously.''
Mr. Cafferty now considers tracking the jokes as a part of his job. His current favorite is Mr. O'Brien's East Coast vs. West Coast Municipal Government Perv-Off, comparing Mr. Filner to the New York City mayoral candidate Anthony D. Weiner. The San Diego mayor won.
Lee Burdick, the mayor's chief of staff, told reporters that she changed the locks to Mr. Filner's office in an effort to protect him from any evidence being removed or touched. Ms. Burdick has served as the public face for City Hall for much of the time the mayor has been gone.
''The scenarios of how this could work out is more complicated than a Rubik's cube,'' she said at an event last week. ''And I've never been able to solve a Rubik's cube, so I won't even try to predict the outcome of all of this.''
The absence of the mayor did not stop some of his supporters from rallying in front of City Hall, singing ''We Shall Overcome,'' and saying the accusations amounted to a media conspiracy.
''There's an establishment here in San Diego -- they want to get rid of Filner,'' said Floyd Morrow, 81, who was a city councilman in the 1960s and ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 2008. He said he did not believe the women had been sexually assaulted. ''I believe they want to get their 10 seconds of fame.'' But even as he spoke with a crowd of about 80 supporters of Mr. Filner, organizers collected dozens of signatures to force Mr. Filner out of office.
Money Hut, a payday loan shop, along with dozens of other local businesses, placed copies of the recall petitions in the store Monday morning, advertising the ''Recall Bob'' effort by hanging a hastily made sign in front of the strip mall storefront.
Beverly Needham, a retired government contractor who voted for Mr. Filner's Republican opponent and was eager to sign a petition, did not mince words.
''I think he's a sleazeball,'' she said. ''Anybody who can treat another person like he has -- he has shocked so many women.''
Mr. Filner filed an official response to the recall petition last week, heralding his efforts to create new jobs, improve relations along the border with Mexico and create more bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly roads. He made no mention of the accusations of sexual harassment.

HEADLINE: Prime Lot, Empty for Years (Yes, This Is Manhattan)

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
This hole in the ground is the length of three city blocks. It is a carpet of sand, weeds and prairie grass sloping down to the river, interrupted only by a low ridge of broken bedrock. Around it, a black chain-link fence catches the plastic cups, paper and other debris that roll along like tumbleweeds.
But this 6.4-acre parcel is not sitting in the middle of a decaying rust-belt city. It is nestled in the middle of Manhattan, between 38th and 41st Streets on First Avenue, overlooking the East River, amid a residential real estate boom.
Yet it has sat fallow for six years, long enough for young trees to rise at the edges of the property. 
How one of the most valuable undeveloped pieces of earth has sat empty for years -- even after New York City approved a $4 billion project there in 2008 -- is a mysterious and confusing tale of ambition, infighting, clashing personalities and bad timing. At its heart is Sheldon H. Solow, an irascible but talented billionaire developer who is an intermittent presence in his office on 57th Street after a career that reaches back more than a half century.
''This lot seems to be a prime candidate for development in the current market,'' said Ross Moskowitz, a real estate partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, who is not involved with the Solow site. ''With interest rates still very attractive and the capital markets looking for product, there appears to be unlimited appetite and demand for residential housing in New York.''
Mr. Solow is not talking. Nor is his son Stefan, 38, who appears at the office, but not often at the same time as his father.
''I can't tell you anything,'' said a family adviser, Thomas D. Thacher III.
Mr. Solow, 85, does not have much time to make his move. He must build the foundation for the office building or one of several apartment towers by November, or risk losing his permits and public approvals.
Mr. Solow, a tall, well-dressed man who has been plagued by rumors about his health for three years, is an imposing figure with an impregnable confidence in his own vision. He has amassed quite an art collection, which includes works by Picasso, Matisse, Botticelli, Morris Louis, Balthus and Rothko.
He solidified his reputation in the 1970s when he built the swooping, 50-story office tower at 9 West 57th Street, which remains one of Manhattan's most sought-after addresses because of its unobstructed views of Central Park. By Mr. Solow's past account, he collaborated with the architect Gordon Bunshaft on the design.
The developer has a fierce determination to do things his way, regardless of others' advice or economic pressures. He refused to rent out the underground retail space at 9 West 57th for 30 years, waiting for the right tenant. Finally, Mr. Solow installed his own restaurant, Brasserie 8 ½, and lined the walls with some of his art.
Mr. Solow has also developed a reputation as one of the country's most litigious individuals, responsible for at least 200 lawsuits. He has sued friends, enemies, tenants and banks, not often with success.
In 2000, Mr. Solow and the Fisher real estate family won a hotly contested auction for 9.2 acres of land along First Avenue. The hole in the ground is the largest of three noncontiguous parcels between 35th and 41st Streets that made up the property, which he bought from Consolidated Edison for $630 million.
Mr. Solow spent nearly $100 million demolishing the Waterside power plant there and cleansing the land of toxic materials. In 2008, he had won city approvals for a $4 billion project designed in collaboration by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Richard Meier & Partners that included seven towers, five acres of public gardens and walkways, a public school and affordable housing. He also shed his partner, the Fisher family, after a bitter falling out.
The property between 38th and 41st Streets, on the east side of First Avenue, was to include a semicircular public pavilion designed by the architect Richard Meier.
But the city was in the grips of a severe recession, so little happened.
Since 2009, Mr. Solow's executive suite has had a revolving door as he fired one general counsel and chief operating officer after another, including Steven Cherniak, a 27-year veteran of the company. His long-running legal battle with Citigroup over a loan for the property ended with an $85.7 million judgment against him.
During the recession he also stopped work on Two Sutton Place North, a 37-story apartment building on East 61st Street, near York Avenue, and stubbornly refused to lease space in his signature building, 9 West 57th, which had a large block of vacant space after the Bank of America moved out.
It appeared to many in the real estate industry that Mr. Solow was having cash-flow problems.
Stefan Solow stepped in during his father's occasional absences from work, and quietly tried to settle a number of lawsuits, lease the vacant space in the tower at 9 West 57th and sell some land. Executives who have dealt with both men say the father and son are not often on the same page.
More recently, the Solows have offered conflicting signals as to their intentions. Their new broker, Scott Panzer of Jones Lang LaSalle, has signed new tenants -- Tiger Global Management and Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, at the top of 9 West 57th for some of the highest rents in the city, although real estate executives say there is still more than 600,000 square feet of space available.
Work has also resumed on Two Sutton Place North.
Mr. Solow, who has rarely if ever sold a property or an artwork in his vast holdings, did both this year. In February, he closed on the $172.5 million sale of a two-acre parcel on First Avenue between 35th and 36th Streets, part of the Con Ed property, to Michael Stern at JDS Development, who has already broken ground on a pair of residential buildings on the site.
The same month, he sold a painting through Christie's in London -- one of Modigliani's portraits of his lover Jeanne Hébuterne -- for $41.2 million, roughly $13 million more than he paid for it in 2006.
Characteristically, Mr. Solow also filed a fresh lawsuit, this one in federal court accusing Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, UBS and other banks of racketeering and a conspiracy to violate antitrust laws.
According to executives who know Mr. Solow, he reconvened his development team about three months ago, eager to begin work on the hole in the ground, to demonstrate that he was serious and to capitalize on a surging market. But the group has not met again.
''He bought the land cheap,'' said Edward Rubin, an architect and a former member of Community Board 6. ''The rental market is really hot. Why it's still a hole in the ground, I don't know.''

HEADLINE: Saudi Arabia Promises to Aid Egypt's Regime

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND; Sarah Mousa contributed reporting from Cairo, Scott Sayare from Paris, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Saudi Arabia has emerged as the foremost supporter of Egypt's military rulers, explicitly backing the violent crackdown on Islamists and using its oil wealth and diplomatic muscle to help defy growing pressure from the West to end the bloodshed in search of a political solution.
As Europeans and the United States considered cutting cash aid to Egypt, Saudi Arabia said Monday that it and its allies would make up any reduction -- effectively neutralizing the West's main leverage over Cairo. With Egypt's economy in free fall, the country's authorities might not have survived international outrage at a crackdown that has left as many as 1,000 dead and 4,000 wounded without the deep pockets of its Persian Gulf allies.
In recent days, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has publicly condemned the Muslim Brotherhood, sent field hospitals to Egypt and in rare public comments vowed continued support. The foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, traveled to Europe, where he pushed back against efforts to punish Egypt's rulers. And Saudi Arabia delivered a blank check to Cairo, promising to shower it with money as needed. 
''The kingdom stands with Egypt and against all those who try to interfere with its domestic affairs,'' King Abdullah said Friday in a televised speech.
Saudi Arabia, which itself is a close ally of Washington, has not only undermined Western efforts to press for compromise, but has also revealed diminished United States influence across the Arab world. The United States and Europe have been unable to convince Cairo -- or to persuade Riyadh to press the generals toward moderation.
The Saudis, though, are not alone in this. Two other United States allies, Israel and the United Arab Emirates, have also supported the Egyptian military and sought to push back against Western entreaties that it temper its actions against the Brotherhood and the ousted government of President Mohamed Morsi and his supporters.
Saudi Arabia, which historically preferred to work its checkbook diplomacy from behind the scenes, jumped at the chance to help reverse a revolution that it opposed from the start.
The Saudis complained bitterly when President Hosni Mubarak, a longtime ally, was forced from power, and even more bitterly when the Muslim Brotherhood emerged as Egypt's primary political force. And its leaders may have been comfortable with Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, who had served as the Egyptian government's military attaché in Riyadh, according to the general's official biography on the Egyptian military's Web site.
''The Saudi monarchy is absolutely afraid of an Islamist-based democracy movement,'' said Amanda E. Rogers, a lecturer in Arabic at Emory University in Atlanta and contributor to Muftah, a blog about the Middle East and North Africa.
The Saudis have long wielded their great wealth in regional causes. But even by Saudi standards, their efforts in Egypt stand out. Within a week of the Egyptian military's July 3 takeover, they had announced a $12 billion rescue package that dwarfs direct military and economic grants from the United States ($1.5 billion) and the European Union ($1.3 billion) combined. The gulf Arabs' deep pockets made the United States' contribution seem important largely for its symbolism.
Within hours of the king's speech on Friday, the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud, was on his way to Paris, where he said the French president, François Hollande, supported the Egyptian generals' road map. That seemed to contradict the statements of other European countries condemning the new government for failing to control the violence.
Back in Saudi Arabia by Monday, the prince boasted that France had come around to his country's point of view because of ''truths and not assumptions.'' It was unclear, however, if the French government shared that interpretation.
''Concerning those who announced stopping their assistance to Egypt or threatening to stop them, the Arab and Islamic nation is rich with its people and capabilities and will lend a helping hand,'' Prince Saud said, in a statement carried on the Saudi Press Agency's Web site.
Saudi Arabia blamed the United States and other allies for failing to support Mr. Mubarak in 2011 when Egyptians took to the street provoking his ouster. But their criticism was mostly in private, and low-key. Even after the Muslim Brotherhood-backed government of Mr. Morsi was elected, the kingdom responded quickly to keep the treasury solvent with a substantial $5 billion in aid.
By July 10, one week after the military takeover, the Saudis had put together a package of aid totaling $12 billion: $5 billion from the kingdom, $3 billion from the United Arab Emirates and $4 billion from Kuwait.
Unlike American aid, much of the Saudi assistance goes directly into Egyptian coffers with no strings attached. Much of it is cash transferred directly to the Egyptian Central Bank, with the rest grants of free or subsidized oil products, which free an equivalent amount of money for Egypt to budget as it wishes.
By contrast, American and European governments have insisted -- often for legal reasons under their own laws -- that aid is monitored and often channeled through nongovernmental relief groups.
There is a strong rivalry between Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf allies of the Egyptian military, on the one hand, and Qatar and Turkey, on the other, both of which are big supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. Qatar has often outspent even the Saudis in pursuit of its foreign policy goals, and has put much of its money into Arab Spring causes like battling governments in Libya and Syria.
The Saudis, on the other hand, have championed shoring up the established order, which in Egypt is represented by the generals.
''The Saudis feel they need to create a diplomatic and economic bloc to support Egypt, or it will collapse,'' said Hussein al-Shobokshy, a Jeddah-based Saudi columnist who often writes on Egyptian-Saudi relations. ''Prince Faisal is taking the pole in championing the cause right now; he is carrying the banner for Egypt,'' he said.
Anwar Majid Eshki, the chairman of the Middle East Center for Strategic and Legal Studies, a Saudi-based research center, said Saudi officials were buoyed by what they perceived as Prince Saud's success in France. ''We are getting that message out to the friends of Saudi Arabia, in Europe and the United States, this is our assessment of the situation,'' he said.
Over the weekend, however, the European Union officially condemned the violence and blamed the military regime for doing little to stop it.
Ordinary Egyptians have long had something of a love-hate relationship with Saudi Arabia. Some 1.5 million to 2 million Egyptian guest workers are employed there, but many come back soured by the experience.
Last year, rioting outside their Cairo embassy forced the Saudis to close it; protesters were angry at the decision to sentence an Egyptian human rights lawyer, Ahmed al-Gezawi, to prison and 300 lashes. The Saudis claim he was a drug smuggler; Mr. Gezawi's supporters say his lawsuit against King Abdullah, challenging human rights violations against Egyptian guest workers, was the cause of the prosecution.
Now, however, on the issue of financial aid, at least among the sizable anti-Muslim Brotherhood camp, there is plenty of applause for the Saudi stance. ''I would lick the floor rather than take that aid from America,'' said Mahmoud Salama, a businessman in Cairo and a recent returnee from Australia.
''I don't agree with many things in Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis know that Egypt is their back, their biggest neighbor, and that they should support us when we need support.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 27, 2013 

 CORRECTION:
An article last Tuesday about Saudi Arabia's financial and diplomatic support of the violent crackdown by Egypt's military-led government on Islamists referred incorrectly at one point to Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is Prince Saud, not Prince Faisal.

HEADLINE: Butter Chicken in Ahmedabad

BYLINE: ZAHIR JANMOHAMED


HIGHLIGHT: What does the politics of vegetarianism reveal about Gujarat? 

 BODY:
Himanshu Desai, a 53-year-old businessman, runs a fast-food restaurant, Sandwichworkz, near the Indian Institute of Management campus in Ahmedabad, the most populous city in the western state of Gujarat. Mr. Desai, a tall, portly man who was born near the Gujarat city of Surat and grew up in Delhi, serves meat food- an uncommon choice in the state capital, especially for a Hindu. His friends advised him against it, pointing to the brisk business vegetarian food outlets did in Gujarat. "When KFC came to Gujarat, there were agitations," said Mr. Desai, laughing. "My father taught us that eating meat did not make us lesser Gujaratis or lesser Brahmins."
After finishing college in Delhi in the mid-1980s, Mr. Desai moved to Ahmedabad, where he met his wife, Takshashila Desai. Yet he was uncomfortable living in the city, as he felt pressure to hide his consumption of food. "It was something forbidden," he said. "Back then we had to go to some dark alley across town in the Old City and find a Muslim joint just to eat nonvegetarian food. It was never like that in Delhi." 
The Desais grew tired of the resentments of the vegetarians and left for Nigeria in 1999, when a friend offered him a job as a cotton trader. In Lagos, Mr. Desai fell in love with a French cafe and began to appreciate the social functions of a café. The Desais hoped that someday they would start one of their own, by the sea or up in the mountains.
After several years in Africa, followed by a short stint in Singapore, the Desais moved in 2008 to Oklahoma City, where most of their extended family had settled. Mr. Desai was 48 when they arrived, and the economic recession had already hit the United States. He found a job as a collector for Capitol One Bank but faced challenges. "My accent was very visible," said Mr. Desai. "The customers would often refuse to talk to me." They assumed he was calling from India. "I faced a lot of abuse because of the accent and the feeling that Indians are taking away American jobs," Mr. Desai recalled. Mrs. Desai worked at a Subway sandwich store.
Three years later, in 2011, Mr. and Mrs. Desai were "fed up with the racism" and tired of the "lack of opportunities" in the United States. They returned to India with the old dream of a restaurant of their own in the mountains or by the sea. The Desais couldn't afford the mountain resorts, the coastal cities, or the capital, New Delhi. They returned to Ahmedabad.
Mr. Desai scouted the city for locations for his café. He found 10 places appealing, but nine owners refused to rent space to him because he wanted to serve food that had meat in it. "It is because the Gujaratis don't want to eat meat in front of their family members or their friends," said Mr. Desai. "Many friends advised me not to serve nonvegetarian food and they warned me about the agitations."
Eventually, Mr. Desai found a landlord who had lived in the United States and owned a space adjacent to the Indian Institute of Management, where students from all corners of India studied. There were two nonvegetarian restaurants across the street, a Subway sandwich store and a Domino's pizza outlet. Mr. Desai was euphoric and moved into the space last fall.
He named his café Sandwichworkz. A large number of customers walked out after noticing offerings with meat on the menu. "I guess I chose the wrong name for a city like Ahmedabad. An ordinary Gujarati cannot even begin to think that a sandwich can have meat in it," said Mr. Desai. He seemed exasperated. "I am tired of this attitude in Gujarat that because I only eat vegetarian food I am better than you, or that I am less of a proud Gujarati because I eat meat. "
In 2011, KFC opened its first location in Gujarat but faced protesters, who held up signs that read, "KFC Go Back." Most companies, Mr. Desai said, have learned that "if you want to succeed in Gujarat, you should serve vegetarian-only food." He pointed out that Subway opened its first-ever vegetarian outlet in Ahmedabad, with a Jain counter. (Many Jains are not only strict vegetarians but refuse to eat potatoes, garlic or onions.) In March, The Times of India reported that KFC had announced plans to offer more vegetarian fare in Gujarat. McDonalds intends to establish vegetarian outlets in the state.
Mr. Desai, whose wife is a strict vegetarian, is struggling to stay in business but remains somewhat hopeful. "Ahmedabad is changing slowly," he said. "About 10 years earlier, you had go across to the Muslim part of town to have nonvegetarian food. You can say that now you do not have to hide as much to eat nonvegetarian."
Few places would embody that cultural change as much as Pleasure Trove, an upscale restaurant, which serves meat. It opened in 2008 by the Ashram Road area of Ahmedabad in a mostly vegetarian, Hindu area. Zakir Dauwa, a 33-year-old Muslim, owns Pleasure Trove, where dinner for one costs at least 500 rupees, or $8 - rather expensive for Ahmedabad.
Mr. Dauwa pointed out that only two restaurants served meat on the long Ashram Road. He is in the middle of negotiations to open two new nonvegetarian restaurants in mostly Hindu areas of the city.
In the aftermath of the 2002 sectarian riots in Gujarat, fear would have made it unthinkable for a Muslim to run a nonvegetarian restaurant in a primarily Hindu part of Ahmedabad. But Mr. Dauwa believes things are changing. "It is because of the goodness of the H-class people," he said. "They are giving us space now." He said "H-class" instead of "Hindu," he explained, for fear that anyone hearing him might mistakenly think he was speaking ill of the majority community.
Mr. Dauwa belongs to the Chiliya sect of Shia Muslims, a community famous for running restaurants and hotels across Gujarat, which mostly serve vegetarian food. During the 2002 riots, many Chiliya-owned businesses were attacked, despite their vegetarian menus and names like Abhilasha, which means desire in Hindi. Mr. Dauwa's businesses were among those ransacked by mobs. "We lost a restaurant or two in 2002," he said.
A 2008 report by Harvard Law School students supervised by a Harvard lecturer, Sharanjeet Parmar, estimated that Muslims in Gujarat lost 3,800 crore rupees, or $760 million, "through the large-scale destruction of homes, businesses and properties. These losses continue to economically cripple the Muslim community six years later," the report found.
But Mr. Dauwa does not want to look back. "We had insurance," he said. "It is no big deal." He paused. "I do not want to talk about 2002."
Mr. Dauwa is equally cautious when he speaks about Narendra Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat today and during the 2002 riots, who is the de facto prime ministerial candidate for the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in India's national elections in 2014. "Putting 2002 aside, you can say that he is an efficient leader. Business is good. And that is good for us." A few moments later, Mr. Dauwa added, "But this is putting 2002 aside."
Muslims, who number about 9 percent of Gujarat's population, are not the only meat eaters who are treated as outsiders in Gujarat. Low-caste Hindus and non-Gujarati Hindus are also often denied housing because of their diets. Mr. Desai said he has been denied accommodations because "many housing societies have strict by-laws against consuming meat or eggs."
There are indications that the consumption of meat has increased in Gujarat. Yet eating meat still carries a stigma in the state. Asking whether someone eats meat is often a sly way to ascertain the person's caste, and some in Gujarat see it not as a dietary choice but as a rejection of Hinduism and the Gujarati identity itself. In Gujarat, there is often a sense that meat eaters are an entirely distinct, and often lesser, category of people. "Maas khane wale logon ka vyavhar alag hota hai," Mr. Modi once told a journalist from an Indian magazine - "Meat-eating people have a different temperament."
In 2003, marking the 135th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi's birth in Gujarat, Mr. Modi said, "Gujarat's main strength lies in its vegetarianism." Last year, when a reporter asked Mr. Modi to explain the high rates of malnourishment in Gujarat, he cited vegetarianism as a possible cause, adding, "Gujarat is by and large a vegetarian state."
For the past two years, I have been living and working on a book in Juhapura, a Muslim ghetto in Ahmedabad where an estimated 400,000 live with little in the way of paved roads, schools or government facilities. It was once a mixed area, but Hindu-Muslim riots in the city in 1985, 1992 and 2002 changed that, and I have been able to find only six Hindus in Juhapura now. My apartment there, for example, was once occupied by a Hindu-Muslim couple, but after the 2002 riots, the Hindu wife felt uncomfortable living in all-Muslim Juhapura and the husband felt uneasy as a Muslim in Gujarat. Today they live outside of Mumbai and vow never to return to the state.
A few months ago, I invited a few Hindu friends to attend a wedding near my apartment. One of them refused. "I do not like the way Muslims chew chicken from the bones and then toss them all over the wedding grounds," he said. He had never visited Juhapura and never attended a Muslim wedding. "This is what I have been told," he said. Later, I convinced him to visit Juhapura. He found it "fine" but was bothered by the "smell of non-veg food." It was an odd thing to say-we were standing nowhere near a restaurant that served meat.
But attitudes are changing, according to Mr. Dauwa. "More people, especially businessmen from China and Japan, are visiting Gujarat and many of them want non-vegetarian food," he said. "And also, Gujaratis are becoming wealthier, and when they live abroad they pick up nonvegetarian eating habits."
Mr. Dauwa has found that the path to commercial success lies in staying away from discussions of politics and the 2002 riots. We spoke about Mr. Desai and his Sandwichworkz a few miles away. I mentioned that Mr. Desai would refuse to serve rude customers. Mr. Dauwa laughed. "That is not a luxury I have," he said. "I want to be the kindest I can be. I greet and welcome each customer myself. I ask about their meal, make sure everything went all right." He sees Pleasure Trove as a bridge to improve relations with the Hindus of his city. "We have improved relations with H-class people through this restaurant," he said. "You can say that food is bridging the divide." Mr. Dauwa paused, and then offered a faint smile. "A little bit."

HEADLINE: Morning Agenda: The S.E.C.'s Tougher Stance

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The S.E.C. extracts its first admission of wrongdoing under a new policy. | Hiring the children of the elite is a time-tested practice in the United States. | President Obama urges regulators to move faster on rules for Wall Street. | The Fed identifies shortcomings in banks&#8217; responses to stress tests. 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission has signaled that it was now taking a harder line on securities settlements, as it extracted its first admission of wrongdoing under a new policy, DealBook's Alexandra Stevenson reports. The S.E.C. said on Monday that the hedge fund manager Philip A. Falcone had agreed to admit wrongdoing and to be barred from the securities industry for at least five years to settle accusations of market manipulation. He and his fund, Harbinger Capital Partners, must also pay more than $18 million.
The deal comes after the S.E.C. had, in a rare move, overruled its own enforcement staff to reject a previous settlement with the hedge fund manager. The original agreement, which had called for a two-year ban from raising new capital and no admission of wrongdoing, "had irritated the S.E.C.'s new chairwoman, Mary Jo White, people briefed on the matter said, and frustrated many others within the agency who saw that deal as too lax," Ms. Stevenson reports.
The new terms reflect a change that Ms. White outlined this year, aiming to overturn a longstanding policy of allowing parties to settle without admitting or denying wrongdoing. Monday's agreement sets a potential precedent for the S.E.C. 
HIRING THE WELL-CONNECTED ISN'T ALWAYS SCANDALOUS | An investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into whether JPMorgan Chase had hired the children of powerful Chinese officials to help the bank win business "is sending shudders through Wall Street," Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.
"If JPMorgan Chase is found to have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by hiring the children of the elite, then the entire financial services industry is probably in a heap of trouble. Virtually every firm has sought to hire the best-connected executives in China and, more often than not, they are the 'princelings,' the offspring of the ruling elite."
Hiring the children of powerful executives "is hardly just the province of banks doing business in China: it has been a time-tested practice here in the United States."
OBAMA URGES ACTION ON BANK RULES | President Obama urged the top financial regulators on Monday to move faster in implementing new rules for Wall Street, telling them in a private meeting that they must work to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis, Michael D. Shear and Peter Eavis report in The New York Times.
"Aides said Mr. Obama also told the regulators that the United States needed a more simplified and certain system of financing housing," The Times writes. "Administration officials and some lawmakers have expressed frustration that critical parts of Mr. Obama's overhaul of the financial system, which was voted into law three years ago and is known as the Dodd-Frank Act, remain unenforced as an alphabet soup of federal agencies wrangle over how to adopt it."
ON THE AGENDA | 
J.C. Penney, the embattled retailer, reports earnings before the market opens. Best Buy, Saks and Barnes & Noble also report results this morning. Terrence A. Duffy, president and executive chairman of the CME Group, is on CNBC at 4 p.m. Chad Hurley, co-founder of YouTube, is on Bloomberg TV at 6 p.m.
BANKS FALL SHORT IN STRESS TESTS, FED SAYS | Most big banks appear to have been easily passing the annual "health checkups" they have had to undergo since the financial crisis, DealBook's Peter Eavis writes. But on Monday, the Federal Reserve identified some shortcomings in the banks' responses to the checkups, known as stress tests.
"Despite the severity of the recent housing crisis, the Fed said some banks were not taking into account the possibility of falling house prices when valuing certain mortgage-related assets for the tests," Mr. Eavis writes. "In other cases, banks assumed they would be strong enough to take business away from competitors in times of stress."

HEADLINE: Coalmines and Aliens, Again

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A thought experiment encounters the unthinking. 

 BODY:
Brad DeLong catches John Cochrane being remarkably dense:
Paul Krugman recommended, with refreshing clarity, that the US government fake an alien invasion so we could spend trillions of dollars building useless defenses. (I'm not exactly sure why he does not call for real defense spending. After all, if building aircraft carriers saved the economy in 1941, and defenses against imaginary aliens would save the economy in 2013, it's not clear why real aircraft carriers have the opposite effect. But I'm still working on the nuances of new-Keynesianism, so I'll let him explain the difference. I'm not a big fan of huge defense spending anyway.) 
As I've explained before, the alien thing was a modern riff on Keynes's coalmine thought experiment. It's worth quoting that one in full:
It is curious how common sense, wriggling for an escape from absurd conclusions, has been apt to reach a preference for wholly 'wasteful' forms of loan expenditure rather than for partly wasteful forms, which, because they are not wholly wasteful, tend to be judged on strict 'business' principles. For example, unemployment relief financed by loans is more readily accepted than the financing of improvements at a charge below the current rate of interest; whilst the form of digging holes in the ground known as gold-mining, which not only adds nothing whatever to the real wealth of the world but involves the disutility of labour, is the most acceptable of all solutions.
If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coalmines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again (the right to do so being obtained, of course, by tendering for leases of the note-bearing territory), there need be no more unemployment and, with the help of the repercussions, the real income of the community, and its capital wealth also, would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is. It would, indeed, be more sensible to build houses and the like; but if there are political and practical difficulties in the way of this, the above would be better than nothing.
In a way, I'm amazed by economists who find this sort of thing absurd on its face. Leave macroeconomics on one side: what about the theory of the second best? This theory - which is just basic micro - says that when some markets are distorted, for whatever reason, social costs and benefits across the economy don't correspond to private costs, so that unprofitable, even seemingly wasteful activities can sometimes be beneficial. And an economy in which millions of willing workers can't find work is surely one with massive distortions of some kind.
Oh, and let's always remember that Keyensians like me don't believe that thing like the paradox of thrift and the paradox of flexibility are the way the economy normally works. They're very much exceptional, applying only when interest rates are up against the zero lower bound. Unfortunately, that happens to be the world we're currently living in.

HEADLINE: Who Gets to 'Snow-Fall' or 'Jockey' at The Times, and Why?

BYLINE: MARGARET SULLIVAN


HIGHLIGHT: The latest multimedia extravaganza is &#8220;The Jockey,&#8221; another effort from sports. 

 BODY:
At Wired magazine's annual business conference in New York last May, the executive editor Jill Abramson made the observation that at The Times, "snow-fall" had become a verb.
"Everyone wants to snow-fall now, every day, all desks," she said.
The reference was to the elaborate Pulitzer-winning multimedia effort from late last year, "Snow Fall: Avalanche at Tunnel Creek." As The New Republic wrote this week, the project "marked a significant shift in the culture of the newsroom, where digital blockbusters are now seen as a way to become a star." 
Now there's a new effort in the "Snow Fall" genre: "The Jockey," written by Barry Bearak, and detailing - through words, and Chang W. Lee's photographs and integrated video - the experiences and career of Russell Baze, the winningest jockey in America. The writing approaches poetry at times - "the serene musicality of hoofbeats and hard breathing" at a sunrise workout - and the visuals are inventive and absorbing. You can feel the thoroughbreds surging out of the gate and the steam coming off their coats. 
It took many months - and many talented people - to produce. Like "Snow Fall," the project has been widely praised, and has brought readers and viewers to The Times that it wouldn't normally have. Jason Stallman, the sports editor, said that numbers for "The Jockey" paled in comparison to those for "Snow Fall," which everyone knew going in; it's a different kind of project, he said, which appeared in the summer doldrums. He added, "Chasing 'Snow Fall' numbers is a fool's errand." That project initially generated more than 3.5 million page views.
As Ad Age wrote, it's also a way for The Times to bring in a new kind of revenue and to experiment with more elegant ways of weaving custom ads into the overall project design. The revenue potential of video production is very much on the mind of the leadership at The Times these days.
Is the finished project - gorgeous as it is - really worth it, from a journalistic standpoint?
A reader, Bruce Lambert, from Hempstead, N.Y., who is a retired Times reporter, has a reaction to both projects that I found worth considering:
Despite having no personal interest in skiing, I found "Snow Fall's" writing, layout, photos and graphics to be engrossing, almost sweeping me away like the powerful avalanche it portrayed. But after finishing it, I wondered why so much talent, effort and expense was devoted to the story of a few elite athletes in a luxury sport who knowingly and needlessly took risks that turned out so badly.
After a minute or two of the equally visually impressive "The Jockey," I decided not to expend any more time on this profile of an apparently superb rider in the sport of kings; no offense to those who prepared it so well. Especially at a time of constrained journalistic resources, why has The Times so far chosen only limited feature topics?
Why not, instead, pick an issue of far greater import - global warming, the Great Recession, income-wealth disparity, gun safety, stop-and-frisk, health care financing, Middle East turmoil or fracking, to name a few possibilities.
On Monday, I asked Dean Baquet, the managing editor, why the two major multimedia extravaganzas so far have been sports-related feature stories, and whether - as Mr. Lambert wondered - they are the most sensible use of resources. Each of the projects, he acknowledged, "took many, many months to produce" and involved writers, editors, graphics and technology people.
"Sports is very visual," he said, in a way that "document-driven" investigative work is not. Sports stories offer narrative storytelling possibilities that lend themselves to this kind of effort. And the topics are "less competitive" in nature, allowing a long gestation period.
How well will this approach hold up over time?
Writing in Slate, Farhad Manjoo offered this prediction: "I suspect that years from now, we'll look back at 'Snow Fall,' 'The Jockey' and their copycats in the same way we now regard 1990s-era dancing hamster animations - as an example of excess, a moment when designers indulged their creativity because they now have the technical means to do so, and not because it improved the story or readers' understanding of it."
Even Mr. Baquet admitted that such efforts "could have been handled in 900-word feature stories," not 10,000 word extravaganzas. But he strongly believes they are worth the resources. Editors pitch ideas at the twice-monthly enterprise meeting, and a group of editors and graphics people make the decisions on who gets to "snow-fall," with an eye to what projects lend themselves best to the new approach, are worthwhile, and stand a realistic chance of succeeding, given all the elements. Many more are proposed than accepted, he said.
The Times has no intention of slowing down, but the pace isn't particularly fast either. The plan is to produce "four or five" such projects a year, Mr. Baquet said. "We're just learning how to do them. We're not capable to doing zillions yet." One that's in the works is on a very serious news-related subject, he said, but did not want to go into detail.
My take: I like the innovation - it is nothing short of necessary. And the projects are beautifully executed.
But I'm with Mr. Lambert in hoping that when The Times is fully up to speed, editors will make room, more often than not, for journalistic subjects that really matter, and to balance news value with the expenditure of resources.

HEADLINE: Global Entry Program Expands

BYLINE: TANYA MOHN


HIGHLIGHT: Global Entry, a program designed to expedite security screening, will now include travelers from more countries. 

 BODY:
Global Entry, a program that allows preapproved, low-risk travelers entering the United States to bypass customs agents and be screened at automated kiosks, has expanded to include more international travelers. 
Qualified citizens from the United Kingdom, Germany, the Republic of Korea and Qatar are now eligible to apply for Global Entry membership, one of several United States "trusted traveler" programs to expedite security screening.
In addition, some current Global Entry members can now apply for similar streamlined entry programs offered by Korea and Germany.
Created as a pilot program in 2008 to facilitate international travelers as quickly and securely as possible, Global Entry is administered by United States Customs and Border Protection, part of the Department of Homeland Security.
Before the addition of four new countries that formally began Aug. 9, United States citizens, legal permanent residents and some citizens of the Netherlands, Mexico and Canada were eligible to apply or have benefits. Currently, nearly 300 Global Entry kiosks are available at 34 American airports and 10 preclearance locations in Ireland and Canada, serving 98 percent of all incoming air travelers, said Stephanie Malin, a spokeswoman for the agency. 
Applicants must fill out an online application, pay a $100 application fee, undergo a background check and interview and submit fingerprints. Once approved, membership is valid for five years.
"Expanding Global Entry to more travelers from key allied nations will strengthen United States aviation security while improving the efficiency of the U.S. entry process for all travelers," Roger Dow, president and chief executive of the U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, said in a statement. The move, he said, will also boost the economy and enable the agency "to focus its screening resources on potentially riskier unknown travelers."

HEADLINE: When Lenders Are Not Paid Back

BYLINE: PHILLIP SWAGEL


HIGHLIGHT: The bankruptcy cases of cities and automakers, and the threat to use eminent domain to write down mortgage values, may make it harder and more expensive for American consumers to borrow, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Phillip Swagel is a professor at the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland and was assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department from 2006 to 2009. 
Much of the lending done in the United States relies on having both collateral and contractual obligations (loan covenants) that together provide the lender with assurance that the funds lent out will be repaid. Drivers falling behind on an auto loan, for example, will eventually find themselves without wheels - the car is the collateral. The house is likewise the collateral for a mortgage; lenders can foreclose on borrowers in default, though with rules that differ across states.
In financial markets, borrowers might pledge instruments like mortgage-backed securities as collateral for cash loans, whether for a term of years or just overnight. Rather than putting up physical assets as collateral, governments often instead promise to repay bondholders out of a dedicated stream of income like the tolls on a bridge or out of unspecified revenue from future taxes. The attraction of such collateralized borrowing is obvious for both sides, since the borrower generally can obtain funds at a lower interest rate than with an unsecured loan, in which lenders would typically find themselves back in the line for recovery in a bankruptcy proceeding if the borrower defaulted. 
It is not surprising that a financial crisis involving trillions of dollars of bad loans led to legal conflicts and policy debates about the role of collateral and the sanctity of contracts. In several prominent cases, there have been disputes over the ability of lenders to enforce the terms set when the loan was made, including the ability to seize collateral. These include the 2009 automaker bankruptcies, Detroit's municipal troubles and, most recently, efforts to use the process regarding eminent domain to force mortgage write-downs. 
These issues involve sometimes difficult trade-offs between the treatment of borrowers facing distress and the potential harm to future borrowers who will find their access to credit constrained if lenders cannot rely on the security of collateral or the sanctity of contracts. The varied resolutions of these debates over collateral and contracts thus have important economic implications for borrowers of all kinds, including businesses, governments and families, and for the overall economy.
It seems likely that people owed money by the city of Detroit will get less than promised. One of the many interesting elements in the city's bankruptcy proceedings is the treatment of the holders of general obligation bonds, which are $530 million out of the city's $18 billion in total debt. In the past, this type of municipal bond was considered relatively safe in that the borrowing authority was seen as having an implicit commitment to raise taxes as necessary to pay off the obligation. The proposal from Kevyn Orr, Detroit's emergency manager, however, would have these bonds paid back at only 20 cents on the dollar.
With Detroit city services already threadbare, and with Mr. Orr's bankruptcy proposal foisting losses on retired city workers and current employees through reductions in pensions and other benefits, it seems only fair for bondholders to share in the pain. This might seem especially the case when much of the loss would fall not even on bondholders, but instead on specialized companies that have collected premiums to provide insurance against just the possibility of such a municipal default.
Bond insurers are likely to file suit, but success by Mr. Orr in upending the heretofore accepted view of general obligation bonds could inflict considerable pain on other municipal borrowers, who might well expect to pay higher interest rates to investors nervous that one day other cities might follow Detroit's example. Indeed, several other cities in Michigan are reported to have delayed their bond sales out of concern over interest rates demanded by investors after Detroit's July 18 bankruptcy filing.
Even before the city's ordeal, the bankruptcy cases of Chrysler and General Motors likewise challenged notions of the sanctity of contracts and the security of collateral, with unintended negative consequences for other borrowers. Along the lines of the proposal by Mitt Romney on Nov. 19, 2008, the Obama administration put the two car companies through a managed bankruptcy with "post-bankruptcy financing" and assurance to "car buyers that their warranties are not at risk." (The quotes are from Mr. Romney's commentary on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times but apply precisely to the Obama bankruptcy plan.)
In carrying out the bankruptcies, the administration gained court approval for proposals that reversed the order of priority of the creditors' claims by giving better financial outcomes to junior creditors like funds controlled by some unions than to more senior creditors like banks that had lent to G.M. and Chrysler and investors who owned the two companies' bonds. Academic research has found that unionized companies faced higher borrowing costs relative to non-unionized companies for a year after the Chrysler bankruptcy filing, presumably reflecting the compensation demanded by lenders to put money at risk of being rearranged to favor the administration's political allies. 
This research focused particularly on the financial market impact of government pronouncements and court decisions that were especially relevant to creditors' rights, like the announcement on April 26, 2009, that the government had agreed to give the United Automobile Workers a key stake in Chrysler even before striking a bargain with the more senior lenders, and the May 5, 2009, court decision that challengers to the bankruptcy proposal could not remain anonymous.
Other research has looked instead at the impact of announcements that revealed that the two companies would be bailed out and finds no evidence of an impact on borrowing costs. This differing result makes sense: lenders to G.M. and Chrysler might well have been heartened by the possibility that TARP funds would be used to prop up the two companies, since this could make it more rather than less likely that their loans would be repaid. Only the specific events that threatened the collateral or contracts would be expected to indicate concerns on the part of creditors.
The negative effects from the bankruptcy travails of the two auto companies and the home of their headquarters are relevant for the city of Richmond, Calif., which has sent letters to lenders offering to buy the loans on 624 homes at discount, with a looming threat to use eminent domain powers if the financial companies controlling the mortgages do not go along. Working with the firm Mortgage Resolution Partners, Richmond seeks to reduce the principal balance of the mortgages it acquires and allow homeowners to refinance into loans with lower payments with the aim of helping some families avoid foreclosure.
The idea behind the eminent domain proposal is that the mortgages involved are at considerable risk of default and are properly valued at a discount reflecting the costs involved with the foreclosure process; the threat of eminent domain is thus meant to prod a lender into accepting reality by writing down the loan to its fair value. The difficulty, of course, is determining this fair value. Many borrowers whose loans are involved in the Richmond proposal are actually still current on their mortgages. A lender might hesitate to take a write-down on a loan that so far is paying off.
Richmond faces a number of lawsuits seeking to stop its use of eminent domain, while the Federal Housing Finance Administration put out a statement indicating that it could order Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to cease doing business in areas "employing eminent domain to restructure mortgage loan contracts." The Obama administration has stated that it is not clear that mortgages seized through eminent domain would qualify for refinancing through the Federal Housing Administration. With Fannie, Freddie and the F.H.A. together covering around 90 percent of new mortgages, a lack of access to these sources would greatly reduce the availability of mortgages for homeowners in Richmond.
Without government-supported financing, people seeking a mortgage in Richmond would need to find a bank willing to make them a loan and hold it on the bank's balance sheet. It could be quite difficult to get a mortgage in a locale that uses the eminent domain power, since lenders will naturally hesitate to hold housing credit risk when there is uncertainty about the ability to collect on the collateral by foreclosing on a delinquent borrower rather than writing down the mortgage.
An important reason that mortgage rates are lower than interest rates on auto loans and credit cards is that a home provides reasonably good collateral for the lender (even when it can take years in some states to foreclose on residents who stop making mortgage payments). Use of eminent domain to seize mortgages could change this, just as other developments that weakened the value of collateral in the auto industry or the understanding of loan provisions in municipal finance have had unintended negative consequences for other potential borrowers.
If the effort in Richmond succeeds, the 624 homeowners involved and more in other cities that use the eminent domain approach will benefit from lower payments (and the investors in Mortgage Resolution Partners will see a payoff), but potential home buyers nationwide will be examined with a more jaundiced eye from their lenders than is now the case. Indeed, the reaction of financial markets to the Chrysler bankruptcy suggests that favorable court rulings or other such tidings could lead to higher mortgage interest rates nationwide even before the final outcome is known on the legality of this use of eminent domain. 
Just as other municipalities in Michigan are finding it more difficult to borrow in the wake of Detroit's proposal to change the historical understanding of its bond obligations, so too might American families face a steeper challenge as they look to become homeowners if lenders cannot count on homes' standing as collateral behind mortgage loans.

HIGHLIGHT: The Kia Cadenza takes second place among full-size sedans, and the next generation of Nissan pickups will get a turbo diesel. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 As far as Consumer Reports rankings go, it seems to have been a year of upsets in the large sedan segment. First, the publication crowned the redesigned 2014 Chevrolet Impala as this year's best sedan - the first time a domestic entry has topped the list in 20 years. Now, a Kia has beat Toyota for the No. 2 spot among 12 sedans. Consumer Reports picked the Kia Cadenza over the gasoline-powered Toyota Avalon as runner-up to the Impala. The hybrid model of the Avalon, however, tied with the Cadenza, because its improved fuel economy numbers (over the gasoline model) gave it a slightly higher score. (Reuters)
 In a deal forged with Cummins, Nissan announced Tuesday that its next-generation full-size Titan pickup would be available with a turbocharged 5-liter V-8 diesel engine. Nissan says the engine will be rated at 300 horsepower, will produce more than 500 pound-feet of torque, and will, among the current constellation of full-size pickups available in the American market, be the only diesel option available for light-duty pickup customers. (Nissan USA) 
 It has been years since there was any official Citroën-related activity in Brooklyn, but passers-by in the borough's industrial Gowanus neighborhood may have seen faded lettering bearing the automaker's name along the frieze of a brick building near the corner of 3rd Avenue and 7th Street. It was once, according to DNAinfo, a Citroën repair shop and parts warehouse. But because of the brickwork's deteriorating condition, the building's owners decided to cover its exterior with a stucco-esque reinforcement that was a less expensive alternative to repairing the wall brick-by-brick. Unfortunately, that means curtains for the already vanishing Citroën sign. Perhaps some enterprising Brooklyn artist will offer to recreate the logo. (DNAinfo New York)
 As sales of the youth-aimed entry-level brand Scion weaken, Toyota is allowing dealerships to drop the brand from its showrooms, says a report from Automotive News. Scion has been around for only about 10 years, but its sales peaked more than half a decade ago. Aside from the FR-S - the Subaru-powered sports car that also appears as the Subaru BRZ in the United States and the Toyota GT86 abroad - Scion's model lineup hasn't been updated in a while. According to a report from The Truth About Cars, Toyota showed some of its dealers sketches of two concepts - an FR-S-based convertible and a compact utility vehicle - bearing the Scion badge.

 Buy nothing but Fords for long enough and you could become an honorary president of Ford's truck division. That's what happened to Floyd Pullin of Confluence, Pa. Since the 1920s, Mr. Pullin has owned only Fords. Back then, Prohibition was in effect and you could still buy a Model T new. Times have changed - Henry Ford is no longer at the helm of Ford Motor Company and the bars are open again - and although Mr. Pulling is now 102 years old, he just bought his 16th Ford, a 2013 F-150 STX. As a birthday present to its loyal lifelong customer, Ford gave him an honorary title for a day. (Ford
 If a study from Kelley Blue Book and a book by John Gray are to be believed, Mars could be full of Lincolns and Venus packed with Volvos soon. Not really, of course, but figuratively. Kelley Blue Book, where many people turn when seeking information about new and used cars before buying, surveyed 13,000 American adults to find the buying preferences of men compared with women. The study found that men are more likely to shop among domestic or European luxury brands, while female shoppers gravitated more toward imports. More specifically, male shoppers were 174 percent more likely to seek out Lincoln models and females 119 percent more likely to go for Volvos, according to the study. (Market Watch)

HEADLINE: Many Wall St. Banks Woo Children of Chinese Leaders

BYLINE: DAVID BARBOZA


HIGHLIGHT: Bankers and lawyers said banks competed to see who could hire the most politically connected recent college graduates. 

 BODY:
For more than a decade, Wall Street's biggest banks have hired the sons and daughters of senior Chinese government officials in the hopes that they can open doors and secure deals in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
The hirings were not well publicized, but they were no secret. The grandson of former Chinese President Jiang Zemin once worked for Goldman Sachs; the daughter of former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao used to work for Credit Suisse; and in 2006, the son-in-law of Wu Bangguo, then a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party, helped Merrill Lynch win a deal to arrange a $22 billion listing of the state-owned banking giant I.C.B.C.
While Wall Street may be familiar with the recruiting of the children of China's political elite, a new Securities and Exchange Commission investigation has raised the question of whether hiring the children of officials of state-controlled companies crosses a line. The S.E.C. is examining whether JPMorgan Chase tried to win business in China by hiring the children of two senior Chinese officials, in possible violation of American anticorruption statutes. 
The focus of the investigation, first disclosed by The New York Times on Sunday, has prompted a scramble among the Hong Kong rivals of the New York bank to assess the potential risks of their own hirings. JPMorgan has not been accused of any wrongdoing and has said it is cooperating with the inquiry.
Many of the major banks declined to comment. But in a series of interviews, bankers and lawyers said the practice of hiring the children of government officials was so widespread that banks competed to see who could hire the most politically connected recent college graduates.
"If you don't have any of them, you may be at a disadvantage," said Jeffrey Sun, a lawyer at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe who is based in Shanghai. "For international banks, if you don't have any of them, it's difficult for you to get into the circle. You need intelligence. You need access to information. And this is one way to get that. Even though it's an 'inconvenient fact' for most Chinese like me, that's real life."
The recruitment of the children of China's elite has gone on even as Wall Street banks in China have reined in other practices.
In recent years, United States authorities have stepped up enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which essentially prohibits American companies from giving "anything of value" to a foreign official to win "an improper advantage" in business. As a result, bank employees are usually restricted from paying for the travel, meals or entertainment of Chinese officials.
"I can't even take a Hong Kong official to a rugby match," complained one Hong Kong banking employee, who asked not to be named. "It'd be considered a bribe."
But the investment banks continued to compete to hire the sons and daughters of senior Chinese officials because the practice was considered less risky and was rarely prosecuted, legal experts and Hong Kong bankers say.
Although many of those hired have worked diligently, others have been placed on the payroll with little or no work expected of them.
"Some of them never even come into the office," said one Hong Kong banker. "But everyone does it. We have lost business as a direct result of some state-owned company boss placing a kid at our rival."
The practice has flourished partly because there seemed to be a good defense, legal analysts say. Banking is a relationship business, and for global companies, hiring well-connected individuals occurs around the world.
Also, many of the children of senior Chinese officials who get jobs with the major banks are highly educated, with degrees and M.B.A.'s from the world's top universities.
There is another reason, analysts say, that major Wall Street banks hire this way: proving an investment bank won a deal because of hiring just one individual would be a challenge for regulators in the United States.
"Banks all over the world hire well-connected people to build existing relationships," said David M. Webb, a former investment banker who is now a corporate governance expert based in Hong Kong. "It'll be hard to prove there's a direct connection" to the banks' winning a particular deal, he said.
Why American authorities are now beginning to look at the hiring of the sons and daughters of senior leaders - the so-called princelings - is unclear.
Most China-related cases previously brought by the S.E.C. and the Justice Department have involved global companies accused of bribing Chinese officials with gifts, entertainment and travel junkets. In 2007, Lucent settled with the Justice Department over the financing of 315 trips for Chinese government officials to Las Vegas, Disneyland and Universal Studios, among other stops.
In the case of JPMorgan, the S.E.C. has begun a civil inquiry into whether the bank violated United States antibribery laws when its Hong Kong office hired the son of Tang Shuangning, chairman of the state-owned China Everbright Group, and the daughter of the deputy chief engineer of China's Ministry of Railways, according to a confidential government document reviewed by The New York Times, as well as public records.
After the two were hired, JPMorgan won deals with the China Everbright Group and the China Railway Group, which operated under the influence of the railway ministry. The ministry was broken up this year after a series of corruption scandals.
In a statement on Monday, the China Everbright Group denied there was any wrongdoing when it selected JPMorgan.
The background of the railway official and his family is intriguing.
JPMorgan brought on Zhang Xixi, a Stanford graduate and the daughter of Zhang Shuguang, in 2007. She has since left the bank. Her father, the former deputy chief engineer at the railway ministry, was detained in 2011 on corruption accusations. To date, he has not been prosecuted.
According to records reviewed by The Times, the Zhang family owned a $1 million home in Walnut in Southern California, even though Chinese government officials rarely earn more than $15,000 a year.
Still, United States investigators will need to prove that in hiring Ms. Zhang, JPMorgan directly won business influenced by her father.
"These cases will need to be built on a lot more than simply the fact that a bank hired the relative of a party official," said William F. McGovern, a former S.E.C. official who is now with the New York law firm Kobre & Kim.
Government investigators, he said, "are likely trolling through internal e-mails and transaction records to find evidence that the hire was part of a corrupt exchange of favors for business. That is no easy task."
If investigators do turn up evidence that JPMorgan won investment banking business in China directly related to the hiring of the children of two officials, it could shake up the world of finance here in China.

HEADLINE: Currency Volatility Is Unnerving Investors

BYLINE: NATHANIEL POPPER


HIGHLIGHT: The experiences in many emerging markets are the flip side of the economic situation in the United States, where the economic data has recently been improving. 

 BODY:
Lawmakers and central bankers in India, Indonesia, Turkey and several emerging-market economies are scrambling to contain the damage from falling currencies and to keep foreign investors from heading for the exits.
Money has poured out of those economies over the last few weeks, pushing down the prices of a wide array of assets, including stocks, bonds and currencies. On Tuesday, the Indian rupee fell to a record low against the dollar, while the Indonesian rupiah dropped to its lowest level against the dollar since 2009.
In an effort to slow the exodus of foreign money from Turkey, the country's central bank raised a key interest rate on Tuesday. That came as the Reserve Bank of India announced that it would start buying Indian government bonds later this week to "address the risks to macroeconomic stability." 
"At this point in time I personally see the current government is completely in panic," said Arvind Singhal, the chairman of Technopak Advisors, a consulting firm in Delhi. The strengthening of the American economy appears to be one of the catalysts for the problems in the emerging economies. A booming United States stock market has been a magnet for investors who might have otherwise invested in overseas stocks.
More important, the American economic recovery is causing the Federal Reserve to reconsider the need for the stimulus measures that have fueled the boom in places like India and Turkey.
Many of these nations fueled their economic growth with an unprecedented flow of money from foreign investors. Those investors, in turn, were encouraged by the low-interest-rate policies of the Fed, which made it easy to borrow money and send it abroad.
Last year, $1.2 trillion poured into emerging economies from around the world, nearly six times the amount going in just a decade ago, according to a report out Tuesday from HSBC.
As the Fed is taking the first steps toward letting rates rise in the United States, investors are pulling back their money. As they do, the local economies worsen, setting off a self-perpetuating cycle of market drops. Mutual funds that hold emerging market bonds, for example, have seen investors pull out money every single week since May, according to the data firm EPFR.
The sell-offs have recalled some of the emerging market crises of previous decades.
Many analysts say they believe that even the most troubled countries are insulated from that sort of economic collapse, but the optimism that was common a few years ago has largely dried up.
"I don't see any near-term positive indicators out there for investors to start piling back into emerging markets," said Kevin Daly, who invests in emerging markets debt for Aberdeen Asset Management in London.
The experiences in many emerging markets are the flip side of the economic situation in the United States, where the economic data has been improving.
In the United States, the stock markets closed Tuesday with little change. Both the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index rose modestly, while the Dow Jones industrial average slipped slightly. The S.& P. 500 gained 6.29 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 1,652.35. The Nasdaq picked up 24.50 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 3,613.59. The Dow fell 7.75 points, to 15,002.99.
The most acute problems in the emerging markets began in May, when Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, gave the first signals that the Fed might begin trimming back the bond purchases it had been making to support the economy. Since then, a wide array of global assets have moved in tandem with forecasts of how soon the Fed might slow the bond purchases.
The changes at the Fed, though, have not hit evenly across the developing world. Initially, the hardest hit countries were those that were also exposed to an economic slowdown in China. Australia, which relies heavily on exports of commodities to China, fell sharply earlier in the summer.
The fear that Indonesia may not be able to continue attracting that money helped push the main stock index in Jakarta down 3.2 percent on Tuesday. Over the last month, the index has dropped 11.6 percent.
The most urgent fears have centered around India, where the economy is more than twice as large as Indonesia's, and where the current account deficit is projected to be more than twice as big this year.
Investors have sold 24 percent of the money they had in Indian bonds since May, according to a Credit Suisse analysis of Indian government figures. All of that money leaving the country makes the national currency, the rupee, worth less.
For ordinary Indians, the falling value of the rupee has quickly made foreign goods more expensive, fanning inflation.
Indian lawmakers have taken a number of steps aimed at stemming the tide of money rushing out of the country. The government has tried to limit the amount of investments Indian companies can make overseas, and has also tried to curtail purchases of gold and silver from abroad. All of these measures, though, have appeared to make the problems worse.
"Initially the government just tried to talk their way through by saying everything is all fine, but it did not work," Mr. Singhal, the consultant, said. "Then they get into active intervention in the market, but that hasn't worked either"
Central bankers are in a somewhat difficult position because in order to keep more money in the country and tame inflation, interest rates need to rise. But higher interest rates make it harder for local companies to borrow, potentially limiting economic growth. That is leading to unusual measures like the bond-buying program that the Indian central bank announced Tuesday.
Some Indians are pinning their hopes on the arrival of Raghuram Rajan, a highly regarded University of Chicago economics professor who is set to take over the helm of the Reserve Bank of India in September.
But many economists say they believe that the problems are unlikely to significantly improve before the national elections bring in a new government next year.
"As a patriot, I'd definitely say they should be able to" stabilize the currency, said Ajay Chaturvedi, the founder of a HarVa, an Indian outsourcing firm. "But I don't think as a finance guy that they'll be able to."
In the bond market in the United States on Tuesday, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 17/32, to 97 8/32. Its yield dropped to 2.82 percent, from 2.88 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: The Future of the Charitable Deduction

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Tax credits rather than deductions might be a more equitable way to encourage charitable giving, but there&#8217;s little appetite for change, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
The deduction for charitable contributions is among the oldest and most popular in the tax code. According to the Treasury, it reduces federal revenues by $54 billion, making it the fifth-largest tax expenditure. Whether or not it is curtailed to raise revenue for tax-rate reductions, there are growing concerns about the deduction and also about the mission and operations of some tax-exempt institutions. 
The charitable deduction was added to the tax code in 1917, when taxes were sharply raised to pay for World War I. The concern was that raising the top income tax rate to 67 percent from 15 percent would deprive rich people of the surplus from which they had been making charitable contributions.
The New York Times was among those expressing concern about this. An Aug. 24, 1917, editorial said: "There is a necessary social effect to this taxation of great incomes. It diminishes or dries up the springs of philanthropic eleemosynary and educational life."
The deduction for charitable contributions allowed the wealthy to continue making contributions from before-tax income.

Although there was wide popular support for giving charitable contributions a tax break, there were those who questioned it. The historian Joseph Thorndike quotes a 1916 report by the Commission of Industrial Relations expressing concern that the wealthy would come to control the nonprofit world as they already controlled the profit-making world. As the report said:
The dominion by the men in whose hands the final control of a large part of American industry rests is not limited to their employees, but is being rapidly extended to control the education and "social service" of the nation.
This control is being extended largely through the creation of enormous privately managed funds for indefinite purposes, hereinafter designated "foundations," by the endowment of colleges and universities, by the creation of funds for the pensioning of teachers, by contributions to private charities, as well as through controlling or influencing the public press.
This is still a problem today. As one can see in the table from Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, the vast bulk of charitable gifts in dollar terms come from the wealthy, those making more than $200,000 a year.
If the priorities of the wealthy were the same as those of the nonwealthy, this probably wouldn't matter too much. But they are not. As the following chart from a blog post by Catherine Rampell in The New York Times shows, those with moderate incomes are far more likely to contribute to churches and other religious organizations, while the wealthy give relatively little of their total contributions to such groups. Education, health and arts organizations are much more significant recipients of contributions by the wealthy than by the nonwealthy.
Although those with low incomes are not less generous than the wealthy, the bulk of them either have no federal income tax liability or use the standard deduction and therefore cannot deduct their contributions.
By contrast, the value of the charitable deduction rises with income because tax rates rise with income. For someone in the top bracket, the federal government provides a de facto subsidy of 40 percent.
As I noted last week, Congressional leaders are committed to reducing the top tax rate, maintaining the same level of revenues and the existing progressivity of the tax code. This means that deductions that largely benefit the wealthy, like the one for charitable contributions, are likely to be on the table. Not surprisingly, charitable groups have been lobbying against any curtailment of their deduction for some time.
It should be kept in mind, however, that if the top tax rate falls to 25 percent from 39.6 percent, as Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, says he hopes, this action alone will automatically reduce the value of the deduction by almost half. Instead of saving 40 cents in taxes for each dollar contributed, only 25 cents will be saved.
Scholars are divided on the charitable deduction. Writing in The New York Times, Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago has said it needs to be rethought. He notes the unfairness of giving a large tax reward to the wealthy while giving nothing to those with modest incomes.
Also writing in The Times, Robert J. Shiller of Yale says we shouldn't undermine the generosity of Americans, who give far more to charity than the citizens of any other country. He suggests expanding the deduction by making it available to those who don't have enough deductions to be able to itemize.
One obvious compromise would be to convert the charitable deduction to a tax credit: some percentage of contributions could be subtracted directly from one's tax liability rather than from taxable income. This would equalize the tax reward across incomes and could be done in a way that raised net revenue to pay for rate reductions.
Whether or not the charitable deduction is part of tax reform, Congress should take the opportunity to examine the operations of charitable organizations. Some have been criticized for being excessively political, contrary to law. There are also concerns about abuse by some managers of nonprofits, who pay themselves excessively while spending little on actual charity.
On June 13, the Senate Finance Committee published an options paper for reforming the charitable deduction and abuses by tax-exempt organizations. While complete abolition of the charitable deduction is one option, it is one very unlikely to be adopted. The combined lobbying clout of the churches, universities, hospitals, art museums and other recipients of charitable contributions will see to that.
The deduction for charity is also very popular with the public. A Dec. 11, 2012, McClatchy-Marist poll found 69 percent of voters opposed to ending it, with 28 percent in support.

HEADLINE: In High Costs of City's Litigation, a Litany of Missed Opportunities

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com; Twitter: @jimdwyernyt

 BODY:
Suppose you were in charge of New York City and had $10 million to spend. That's enough money to repave 65 miles of streets, or pay for 80 police officers or 159 teachers, or cover the cost of 887 seats in Head Start.
Or, going all-out crazy, you could cut the personal income tax bill of every city taxpayer by $4.47, according to the calculations of the city's Independent Budget Office. 
Another way to spend that money is fighting lawsuits with scorched-earth litigation tactics.
Here is a letter from a federal official dated Aug. 9, 2004, offering the city a way to avoid expensive litigation over claims that the city's Fire Department had discriminated against black applicants. The official, Electra Yourke of the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, wrote that she was worried that a formal process known as conciliation would fail before it even got started. ''As of this date, I have not even been able to convene a meeting with'' city representatives, she wrote, listing possible solutions.
The city wanted none of them, and a year and a half later, brought the discussions to an end.
''I write to confirm our telephone conversation earlier this month,'' Georgia Pestana, a city lawyer, said in a letter on Dec. 27, 2005. The city ''declines to conciliate.''
And that brought in the Justice Department, which filed a lawsuit in support of the people who had charged the city with discrimination.
In 2013, the case is still rattling through the federal courts. A judge ruled against the city and appointed a monitor; the city appealed and won back a bit of ground. But most of the findings remained intact.
So the lawyers for the people who sued are going to court to have their legal fees paid, to which they are entitled if the judge agrees that they are the ''prevailing'' party.
''We asked for $8 million in fees, and $500,000 in expenses,'' said Darius Charney, a staff attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, which provided some of the lawyers for the winning side.
The city will haggle over how much is owed, whether the hourly rate should be $525 an hour or $450, and so forth. So the city's bill will not necessarily be all $8 million claimed.
But wait: what about the losers -- the city Law Department?
The city lawyers still get paid, of course; they worked hard, they had desks and computers, pensions and health care plans, vacations and bosses and secretaries and paralegals, heat in the winter and air-conditioning in the summer.
So whatever amount the winning side gets -- let's say it ends up at $5 million -- you can roughly guess that the losing side will have already paid that much, too, for its own costs. There's your $10 million to play with. Or more than 30 miles of new pavement and 400 seats in Head Start.
Why wasn't this case settled? The mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, has said the city was fair in its testing.
''We tried to do a conciliation, but the city refused to participate,'' Mr. Charney said.
Under Mr. Bloomberg and Michael A. Cardozo, the corporation counsel, the city has generally refused to enter into consent decrees -- lawsuit settlements overseen by the courts. These, it was argued, unwisely limited the authority of managers. They stifled innovation. Experts would be second-guessed. And the city was not discriminating -- or so it argued over and over.
Given an opportunity to avoid the litigation that went on for years over the police stop-and-frisk practices and which recently concluded with a stunning loss, the city chose to fight, at enormous cost. Here's the missed chance: The city agreed in 2003 to settle a racial-profiling lawsuit that had been filed in 1999, under the previous administration.
When the terms of that settlement were expiring in 2007, the stop-and-frisk numbers were just becoming public. The city declined to continue the oversight terms of the previous settlement. ''The city bought themselves a new lawsuit,'' said Chris Dunn, a lawyer with the New York Civil Liberties Union. ''They could have extended the terms for a couple of years, which would have been a low-cost, no-cost proposition.''
Since Mr. Bloomberg took office, the budget for the city's Law Department has increased by more than 56 percent -- almost double the rate of inflation, and much faster than nearly all city agencies except for the Education Department.
The stop-and-frisk litigation costs will certainly run into multimillion-dollar sums. Asked how much the case has cost the city so far, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cardozo said the number was not at hand.
Miles and miles of street paving, to be sure.

HEADLINE: Tall Monuments To End of a Boom And Easy Credit

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
In a city where skyscrapers sprout like weeds, none grew as high as the Sapphire tower in Istanbul.
Today, it stands as a symbol of how far the mighty may fall.
Like a vast majority of new buildings that have blanketed the Istanbul hills in recent years, the Sapphire -- at 856 feet it is the tallest in Turkey and among the loftiest in Europe -- was built on the back of cheap loans, in dollars, that have flooded Turkey and other fast-growing markets like Brazil, India and South Korea. The money began to flow when the Federal Reserve and other major central banks cut interest rates to the bone in 2009 and cranked up the printing presses in a bid to spur recovery in the United States and other advanced industrial nations.
But now, with expectations mounting that the Federal Reserve, led by its departing chairman Ben S. Bernanke, may soon begin to tighten its monetary spigot, Istanbul's skyline could well be a harbinger of an emerging-market bust brought on by unpaid loans, weakening currencies, and, eventually, the possible failure of developers and banks. 
This week, stocks and currencies in several developing Asian markets, including India, Indonesia and Thailand, have been hit hard. Global investors continued to withdraw funds from emerging markets, as interest rates edge up in anticipation of the Fed's move to reduce its stimulus efforts in the United States. Indonesia's benchmark index, which fell 5 percent on Monday, dropped 3.2 percent more on Tuesday. India's stock market fell 0.3 percent after sliding 5.6 percent in the previous two trading sessions.
Some analysts see it as the markets reacting to an end -- real or perceived -- of the Bernanke boom. ''What we are witnessing is a huge bubble, a Bernanke bubble if you will,'' said Tim Lee of Pi Economics, an independent consultancy based in Greenwich, Conn.
Not everybody is as alarmed as Mr. Lee. Still, 16 years after emerging markets in Asia imploded after local currencies collapsed, even optimists are starting to grow nervous over the rapid accumulation of dollar-denominated debt not just in Turkey but in other now-struggling economies like Brazil, India and South Korea.
As it turned out, some of the biggest beneficiaries of the Fed's largess were not so much in the developed world, but among the politically connected elite in emerging nations like Turkey, where vanity towers, glitzy shopping malls and even grander projects to come -- a third bridge across the Bosporus and a vast new airport -- have become representative of the nation's new dynamism, economic as well as geopolitical.
What these elites have so far ignored, Mr. Lee warns, is that their obligations carry with them a significant and pressing danger: currency risk.
Unlike the risky loans made to subprime borrowers in the United States or Irish real estate developers in the euro zone, dollar debts taken on by companies erecting skyscrapers in Istanbul, manufacturing steel in India and prospecting for oil in Brazil, need to be largely paid back in dollars by entities that earn most of their revenues in their home currency.
When the Turkish lira or the rupee in India was strong -- as these currencies were until recently -- local companies had every incentive to borrow in dollars at comparatively lower interest rates.
But when local currencies start to weaken, in line with diminished economic prospects, then the effect is twofold: paying off dollar loans becomes more costly for the borrower, and the lender becomes increasingly skittish about his exposure to a fragile currency and may move to reduce or even slash credit lines.
While Brazil has the largest amount of dollar loans outstanding at $287 billion, few countries have relied on this source of money as much as Turkey, where dollar loans of around $172 billion represent 22 percent of the overall economy.
In recent months, the Turkish lira has lost 4.5 percent of its value against the dollar. Adding to this, protests have hit Istanbul's main public square over an unpopular building sponsored by a developer with close political and cultural ties to the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Goldman Sachs is forecasting a dollar-lira rate of 2.2, representing a 15 percent mini-devaluation from the current level of 1.95. ''The Turkish economic miracle was built on liquidity and a massive appreciation of the Turkish lira,'' said Atilla Yesilada, an economist at Global Source partners in Istanbul, who has lived through Turkey's previous financial crashes in 1994 and 2001.
These loans -- many of them relatively short term -- also highlight a recurring characteristic of the emerging-market growth boom: the powerful nexus between ambitious governments eager to promote high-profile investments and politically connected business groups ready to take on such projects.
The Sapphire tower in Turkey is a perfect example in this regard.
The 54-floor tower, which received a ceremonial baptism from Prime Minister Erdogan when it opened in early 2011, is the signature property of the Kiler Group, one of the many construction-themed conglomerates that have achieved extraordinary success since Mr. Erdogan came to power in 2003. Like Mr. Erdogan, whose family comes from the northern Black Sea region, these businessmen hail from Turkey's conservative Islamist provinces.
According to regulatory filings, 154 million liras of the group's total 164 million liras in debt is denominated in dollars -- about $79 million using current exchange rates. Of that figure, $25 million is related to the Sapphire tower, company officials say. Most of the group's debt is short term, and in a reflection of the project's risk, regulatory documents show that the cash generated by the property goes directly to the project's primary creditor, Akbank, the fourth-largest bank in Turkey.
Given the differential between dollar loans at 6.5 percent and lira credit costing 11.5 percent, it was no surprise that the Kiler Group and others chose to borrow in dollars. The company, in its most recent filings, acknowledged this risk: if the American dollar gains 10 percent against the Turkish currency, the loss to the company would be 11.8 million Turkish liras.
According to Rasim Kaan Aytogu, chief financial officer for the Kiler Group, the Sapphire tower's share of that total is $25 million. He contends that because the project books its revenue in dollars it is not exposed to currency fluctuations. He also says that demand for apartment units is strong, with 66 percent of them sold.
''This is a unique property in all of Europe,'' he said. ''And it is becoming a travel destination.''
But Turkish real estate experts say that sales of the apartments, which cost from $1 million to $10 million, have lagged and that the tower does not have the prestige of rival properties, including towers built by Trump and Zorlu. And according to company filings, revenue from visitors ogling the view from the tower's observation deck have undershot targets from the outset.
The Kilers are not alone in their ability to make a big splash in Istanbul by deploying dollar debt and political muscle.
Even more influential has been the Kalyon Group, another real estate conglomerate with close ties to Mr. Erdogan. Kalyon is the main developer behind Mr. Erdogan's controversial effort to build a replica of Ottoman-era army barracks as a shopping mall near Taksim Square.
As troubles were beginning to brew in Turkey, the leader of the Kalyon Group, Cemal Kalyoncu, remained confident that nothing would change. Asked in an interview with a local paper how the consortium of companies that won the tender for the airport would obtain the money, Mr. Kalyoncu said the group would look for loans outside Turkey.
''Financing this should be no problem at all,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Many Wall St. Banks Woo Children of Chinese Leaders

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
For more than a decade, Wall Street's biggest banks have hired the sons and daughters of senior Chinese government officials in the hopes that they can open doors and secure deals in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
The hirings were not well publicized, but they were no secret. The grandson of former Chinese President Jiang Zemin once worked for Goldman Sachs; the daughter of former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao used to work for Credit Suisse; and in 2006, the son-in-law of Wu Bangguo, then a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party, helped Merrill Lynch win a deal to arrange a $22 billion listing of the state-owned banking giant I.C.B.C.
While Wall Street may be familiar with the recruiting of the children of China's political elite, a new Securities and Exchange Commission investigation has raised the question of whether hiring the children of officials of state-controlled companies crosses a line. The S.E.C. is examining whether JPMorgan Chase tried to win business in China by hiring the children of two senior Chinese officials, in possible violation of American anticorruption statutes. 
The focus of the investigation, first disclosed by The New York Times on Sunday, has prompted a scramble among the Hong Kong rivals of the New York bank to assess the potential risks of their own hirings. JPMorgan has not been accused of any wrongdoing and has said it is cooperating with the inquiry.
Many of the major banks declined to comment. But in a series of interviews, bankers and lawyers said the practice of hiring the children of government officials was so widespread that banks competed to see who could hire the most politically connected recent college graduates.
''If you don't have any of them, you may be at a disadvantage,'' said Jeffrey Sun, a lawyer at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe who is based in Shanghai. ''For international banks, if you don't have any of them, it's difficult for you to get into the circle. You need intelligence. You need access to information. And this is one way to get that. Even though it's an 'inconvenient fact' for most Chinese like me, that's real life.''
The recruitment of the children of China's elite has gone on even as Wall Street banks in China have reined in other practices.
In recent years, United States authorities have stepped up enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which essentially prohibits American companies from giving ''anything of value'' to a foreign official to win ''an improper advantage'' in business. As a result, bank employees are usually restricted from paying for the travel, meals or entertainment of Chinese officials.
''I can't even take a Hong Kong official to a rugby match,'' complained one Hong Kong banking employee, who asked not to be named. ''It'd be considered a bribe.''
But the investment banks continued to compete to hire the sons and daughters of senior Chinese officials because the practice was considered less risky and was rarely prosecuted, legal experts and Hong Kong bankers say.
Although many of those hired have worked diligently, others have been placed on the payroll with little or no work expected of them.
''Some of them never even come into the office,'' said one Hong Kong banker. ''But everyone does it. We have lost business as a direct result of some state-owned company boss placing a kid at our rival.''
The practice has flourished partly because there seemed to be a good defense, legal analysts say. Banking is a relationship business, and for global companies, hiring well-connected individuals occurs around the world.
Also, many of the children of senior Chinese officials who get jobs with the major banks are highly educated, with degrees and M.B.A.'s from the world's top universities.
There is another reason, analysts say, that major Wall Street banks hire this way: proving an investment bank won a deal because of hiring just one individual would be a challenge for regulators in the United States.
''Banks all over the world hire well-connected people to build existing relationships,'' said David M. Webb, a former investment banker who is now a corporate governance expert based in Hong Kong. ''It'll be hard to prove there's a direct connection'' to the banks' winning a particular deal, he said.
Why American authorities are now beginning to look at the hiring of the sons and daughters of senior leaders -- the so-called princelings -- is unclear.
Most China-related cases previously brought by the S.E.C. and the Justice Department have involved global companies accused of bribing Chinese officials with gifts, entertainment and travel junkets. In 2007, Lucent settled with the Justice Department over the financing of 315 trips for Chinese government officials to Las Vegas, Disneyland and Universal Studios, among other stops.
In the case of JPMorgan, the S.E.C. has begun a civil inquiry into whether the bank violated United States antibribery laws when its Hong Kong office hired the son of Tang Shuangning, chairman of the state-owned China Everbright Group, and the daughter of the deputy chief engineer of China's Ministry of Railways, according to a confidential government document reviewed by The New York Times, as well as public records.
After the two were hired, JPMorgan won deals with the China Everbright Group and the China Railway Group, which operated under the influence of the railway ministry. The ministry was broken up this year after a series of corruption scandals.
In a statement on Monday, the China Everbright Group denied there was any wrongdoing when it selected JPMorgan.
The background of the railway official and his family is intriguing.
JPMorgan brought on Zhang Xixi, a Stanford graduate and the daughter of Zhang Shuguang, in 2007. She has since left the bank. Her father, the former deputy chief engineer at the railway ministry, was detained in 2011 on corruption accusations. To date, he has not been prosecuted.
According to records reviewed by The Times, the Zhang family owned a $1 million home in Walnut in Southern California, even though Chinese government officials rarely earn more than $15,000 a year.
Still, United States investigators will need to prove that in hiring Ms. Zhang, JPMorgan directly won business influenced by her father.
''These cases will need to be built on a lot more than simply the fact that a bank hired the relative of a party official,'' said William F. McGovern, a former S.E.C. official who is now with the New York law firm Kobre & Kim.
Government investigators, he said, ''are likely trolling through internal e-mails and transaction records to find evidence that the hire was part of a corrupt exchange of favors for business. That is no easy task.''
If investigators do turn up evidence that JPMorgan won investment banking business in China directly related to the hiring of the children of two officials, it could shake up the world of finance here in China.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
