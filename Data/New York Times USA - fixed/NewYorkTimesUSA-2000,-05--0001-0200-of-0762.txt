To the Editor:
Re "Love Me, Love My Dog Goes Only So Far, Even in the Informality of the Dot-Com World" (New Economy column, April 24):
The 9-to-5 routine may be stressful for many pets. If a company decides to allow dogs at work, it should have a pet policy that has specific rules regarding leashing, confinement, off-limit areas, cleanup, nuisance behavior and flea control. 
 Workplaces must be safe and healthful for pets and humans, and the needs of co-workers must be considered. But those employees "already doing their best to get along with the other bipeds" might discover that a furry paw or ear can relieve stress, combat depression and promote social interactions among workers.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Michael Jordan movie is sports marketing in new and thinner air.

BYLINE: By David Barboza

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
IN February 1997, Don Kempf was sitting in the back row of an IMAX theater when he had what he now says was a brilliant thought.
After years of working as a management consultant, he wanted to do something entrepreneurial, perhaps something involving sports. And the big screen tipped him off. 
 "All of a sudden I had this vision of Michael Jordan, eight stories high on the screen with his tongue flying out, coming right at me," said Mr. Kempf, 33, a lifelong Chicago Bulls fan. "And it was at that moment when everything clicked into place."
Now, two years after persuading the National Basketball Association and Mr. Jordan to cooperate on an IMAX film that chronicles the life of Mr. Jordan and follows him through his last N.B.A. championship run, Mr. Kempf and his brother Steve, 29, are getting a lesson in big-time sports marketing.
Although the Kempf brothers raised $7.2 million to produce the 45-minute large-format film, the N.B.A. and Mr. Jordan have taken a huge stake in the project. And the league and Mr. Jordan are putting their considerable marketing muscle behind "Michael Jordan to the Max," which opens at IMAX theaters nationwide on May 5.
With the help of the Jordan machine, the producers are preparing a $10 million marketing blitz in one of the biggest promotions ever for an IMAX film, one that includes handing out thousands of "Michael Jordan to the Max" posters at N.B.A. arenas, creating giant billboards depicting "His Royal Airness," and stocking IMAX sites with all sorts of Jordanalia, including a companion book to the IMAX film.
"The idea is to create this ubiquitous Michael Jordan everywhere environment," said Karen Baker, a spokeswoman at Beyond DDB, a division of DDB Worldwide, which was hired to promote the film.
The N.B.A. is also promoting the film in television spots during the playoffs on NBC, TBS and TNT. And MVP.com, the online sports retailer that Mr. Jordan founded last year with John Elway and Wayne Gretzky, is the film's top sponsor.
The producers are projecting the film to gross $100 million in the first year, and Mr. Jordan's agent, David Falk, is predicting huge ticket sales.
"I think this is going to take IMAX out of museums," Mr. Falk said. "Just like he legitimized the air technology in sneakers, he's going to get behind this new technology."
The film will get the broadest release possible, according to the producers, opening in more than 50 of the nearly 100 IMAX theaters in the United States, rivaling the huge IMAX opening earlier this year of Disney's "Fantasia 2000."
And the Smithsonian Institution in Washington has agreed to break its tradition of airing films only about aviation and space flight to show "Michael Jordan to the Max," putting the story among its highly prized daytime slots at the National Air and Space Museum.
"We're expecting a blockbuster," said Walton Ferrell, a spokesman at the Smithsonian. "Funding from Congress continues to shrink, so we're encouraged to think outside the box. And we know the film will make money, and that money will go back into the educational program."
Indeed, the selling of "Michael Jordan to the Max" is yet another example of how closely Mr. Jordan and Mr. Falk guard the superstar's image and how sophisticated they have become in marketing it.
No longer content to simply endorse products, Mr. Jordan is changing the rules, redefining his marketability.
"He's determined that he's the product," said Alan Brew, a corporate identity specialist at Addison, a branding and communications firm. "Michael Jordan is not a sports star anymore; he's almost become a one-man Disney."
A month ago, Mr. Jordan, now an executive with the Washington Wizards N.B.A. team, told a reporter that after his multimillion-dollar sponsorship contracts expired in the next few years, he would shift toward managing his own businesses.
That lesson has not been lost on the N.B.A., which has been moving aggressively to find new ways to profit from the league.
N.B.A. Entertainment, a unit created in 1982, produces television and movie programming centered on the N.B.A. There is also a theme restaurant, N.B.A. City in Orlando, a series of popular N.B.A. home videos and even a sitcom in the works. And this week, the N.B.A. was host to a celebrity fashion show featuring N.B.A. players alongside the actress Carmen Electra, as a way to increase sales of its merchandise and promote the idea that the league is a trendsetter in the fashion world.
"The line between sports and entertainment has become nearly nonexistent," Mr. Brew at Addison said. "It's now an organization that is entertainment-based rather than sports-based."
Indeed, "Michael Jordan to the Max," could not come at a better time for the N.B.A. The playoffs are just under way, and the league is suffering from television ratings that are down sharply since Mr. Jordan retired in 1998. But Mr. Jordan's star has not yet dimmed.
"There's no question he has staying power; he hasn't disappeared from the map at all," said Gregory K. Leonard, an economist who in 1997 released a study showing that in the early 1990's, Mr. Jordan bolstered league revenues by about $53 million a year. "But it's unclear how long this will last because there haven't been that many precedents."
The IMAX film will allow the N.B.A. to ride the coattails of the most celebrated person to ever play the game. And if the film does gross $100 million in the first year, the N.B.A. and Mr. Jordan can thank Don and Steve Kempf, who produced and directed the IMAX project with James D. Stern, a theater and film producer from Chicago.
Mr. Stern, 40, a self-described "hoop head" and minority shareholder in the Chicago Bulls, helped the Kempf brothers approach the N.B.A. and Mr. Falk in early 1998. With permission, filming got under way just before the playoffs in 1998.
The Kempfs, through their company, Giant Screen Sports, also raised millions of dollars to finance the project, mostly from family members, friends of the family and other private investors.
But the N.B.A. and Mr. Jordan then joined the project, taking a two-thirds stake in the deal. They also had final say over the content of the film. The filmmakers also agreed to pay Mr. Jordan $1 million last year for four hours of his time.
Mr. Jordan spent about two hours in his former Chicago Bulls uniform performing dunks for a slow-motion sequence, which uses the same bullet-time technology that was used in the movie "The Matrix." He also spent two hours sitting at center court at the United Center in Chicago, where Mr. Stern interviewed him about his career.
"That's not a lot of money for Michael," Mr. Falk said. "He signed a contract, and that was the only thing required."
Mr. Falk said he became involved in the project not only because it was a great way to preserve Mr. Jordan's legacy in a new format (an IMAX film can be 90 feet high by 100 feet wide) but because it was important to protect the Jordan image.
Before Mr. Falk signed a contract, though, he said that there were a number of "Jordan factors" that had to be agreed to, and that among other things, the project had to consider the involvement of "Michael's corporate family."
In the end, Mr. Falk said he hired the music supervisor from Mr. Jordan's Warner Brothers film "Space Jam," and he brought in MVP.com as a lead sponsor. (Television ads from Nike and Gatorade also appear in the film.)
And for those who can't get enough of Mr. Jordan, there are plans to use more of the half-million feet of IMAX film that was left on the cutting-room floor and perhaps splice together a CD-ROM, or a second feature. Don Kempf says he satisfied with the effort. "We expect to do well with this film," he said.

HEADLINE: Buffett Holds Court at Berkshire Weekend

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: OMAHA, April 30

 BODY:
With the stock of Berkshire Hathaway on the rise again after taking a beating in the last year -- and the New Economy stocks Warren E. Buffett has shunned now looking more risky -- shareholders came to his annual meeting over the weekend willing to grant him some vindication. But maybe -- just maybe -- he could pep up his portfolio, some said, by venturing into technology.
"Two months ago, when Berkshire stock was trading at around $45,000 -- down from almost $80,000 last year -- people were ready to throw tomatoes at Warren Buffett," said Andrew Kilpatrick, a Birmingham, Ala., stockbroker and author of a book on Mr. Buffett. "But, by gosh, the price is coming back and the mood is changing." 
 Mr. Buffett himself is not the sort to claim vindication. But he said it was so difficult to find good values of any kind in the stock market that, over the coming decade, he may cut his holdings in publicly traded companies to about 10 percent of his investments (from an estimated 33 percent now) and put the rest into buying companies outright.
Most of the 10,000 shareholders gathering at the Omaha Civic Auditorium on Saturday were fierce Buffett loyalists, come to enjoy the parties and perhaps have their photos snapped with their hero.
But several gently asked why Mr. Buffett could not find a way to make money on technology stocks. Gaylord Hansen from Santa Barbara, Calif., said he had lost money on his Berskshire investment last year but made up for it with four tech stocks.
"Are we asking too much," he asked, "that you put your brain to work and spend a little bit, maybe 10 percent of our money, in the only play in town, which is technology?"
Nothing doing, replied Mr. Buffett, repeating his stock answer: "We will never buy anything we don't understand." Later, he said he doubted anybody -- not even his friends Bill Gates and Andrew Grove of Intel -- truly knew which technology stocks would be doing best 10 years from now.
Mr. Buffett's willingness to shun publicly traded shares more generally reflects his conviction that the market is overvalued. Alice D. Schroeder of PaineWebber, often regarded as the leading analyst of Berkshire, estimated that the company now has about 33 percent in publicly traded stocks, with the rest representing wholly owned companies like Geico, the rapidly growing auto insurer and Dairy Queen.
Several other well-known investors also have acknowledged that tech stocks are beyond them. Only last Friday, George Soros said that because of his losses in technology investments, he was shifting to a more conservative strategy.
Thomas Kamei, a 10-year-old shareholder from Kentfield, Calif., whose mother Nancy is an investment analyst, asked if the Internet might hurt some of Berkshire's investments, including The Washington Post and Wells Fargo bank. Mr. Buffett said he recognized a threat but said he did not know how it would play out.
Many Berkshire investors are just as happy to treat it like a value-oriented mutual fund. Leaving the meeting, Jack Rhodes, a retired executive from Peoria, Ill., and his wife, Betty, said that they could invest in high-fliers on their own. "Berkshire is just the safe part of our portfolio," Mrs. Rhodes said. "We have lots of technology and telephone stocks -- the ones that are moving, the ones that make you nervous."
Many Berkshire shareholders were happy to concentrate on the long term, saying that their faith in Mr. Buffett's philosophy of investing in old economy standbys had not been shaken. "It's going to be all right," said Sam Park, a neurologist from Tulsa, Okla., who has 90 percent of his portfolio in Berkshire Hathaway. "The underlying business value is there."
Dr. Park said that, even at the current price, most of the Berkshire stock he has been accumulating for years are "still way ahead." To discourage short-term trading, Mr. Buffett has never split Berkshire's shares, although a few years ago the company issued B shares that represent a small fraction of an original share's value.
After outperforming the Standard & Poor's 500 index of stocks for most of the last 35 years, Berkshire gained only half a percentage point last year. On March 10th the shares hit a low of $40,800. In his annual report a few days later, Mr. Buffett said he might consider buying shares of Berkshire back. With that expression of confidence, the stock rebounded.
The meeting, conducted by Mr. Buffett with his vice chairman and alter ego, Charles T. Munger, rambled along for six hours, with the two graying executives playing the role of business school professors and shareholders the awe-struck students. Mr. Buffett may be one of the few chief executives to have a shareholder seriously ask whether he wanted to succeed Alan Greenspan (no).
Some shareholders asked how the big commercial insurance company that Berkshire bought in 1998, General Re, could be turned around after losing more than $1 billion last year. General Re, Mr. Buffett said, would seek higher prices.
A shareholder whose brother works at Coca Cola complained to Mr. Buffett, who sits on the Coke board as one of the company's major investors, about the generous severance package for Douglas Ivester, the recently replaced chief executive. "It was definitely the right decision for Coke," to reach a severance agreement, Mr. Buffett said, while adding, "I would not want to defend the small details."
On one technology matter, Mr. Buffett did have some opinions. While not explicitly condemning the Government's proposal to break Microsoft in two, Mr. Buffett said, "We've got something that works very well and it probably doesn't make a lot of sense to tinker with it -- I would not go in with a meat ax."
Berskshire's performance showed no signs of cooling the weekend's usual carnival spirit, including a jazz and champagne reception at Borsheim's, Berkshire's Omaha jewelry store that is one of the nation's largest.
In a film that opened the meeting, Mr. Buffett strummed a ukulele and sang about investing. Later, he pulled on a baseball uniform and strode to the mound at Omaha's minor league baseball stadium to hurl a few looping pitches that he described as fast balls.

Hard Questions for Government Advisers

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
As stock analysts pored over Friday's filings in the government's proposal to split Microsoft in two, some marveled as much about what was missing as what was included.
In particular, bankers and analysts who have read an affidavit prepared by the firm of the investment banker Robert F. Greenhill, which defended the feasibility of such a step, said the affidavit fell short of justifying why a breakup would be good for Microsoft shareholders. 
 Analysts criticized the lack of financial data to back up Greenhill & Company's assertion in the affidavit that "there will not be a material decrease in the market value of the current Microsoft shareholders' holdings."
"My response is, show me the numbers," said David Readerman, an analyst who tracks Microsoft for the investment firm Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco. "At 9:30 a.m. Monday morning, the bell will go off and investors will have to calibrate the impact of this legal document on their personal net worth," Mr. Readerman said. "But there are no numbers to substantiate the claims."
Analysts also say that the breakup technique Greenhill proposes, which includes spinning off one of the Microsoft businesses in an initial public offering, is too simple an approach. They note that most of the dozen or so companies cited in the affidavit as successful spinoffs, and which Mr. Greenhill compares with Microsoft, made such moves voluntarily.
In December, Greenhill & Company, an investment boutique, was hired by the Justice Department to help the government study the financial implications of a Microsoft breakup.
It was a logical choice: Mr. Greenhill, the firm's chairman, is a 37-year Wall Street veteran and a well-respected deal maker. He has been assisted in the Microsoft study by another Greenhill partner, Jeffrey P. Williams, a banker who has counseled AT&T and once headed Morgan Stanley's telecommunications and media group. The two prepared the affidavit jointly.
Mr. Greenhill and Mr. Williams declined to comment on the filing.
On Friday, the federal government and 17 states asked Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to split Microsoft into two separate companies: one focused on operating systems like Windows, the other devoted to software applications and Internet activities. The Greenhill affidavit outlined the process for making that happen, including the initial public offering for a new class of stock in the spun-off company.
At times, though, the affidavit reads mainly like a business school primer, explaining at length how stock analysts value companies, while doing little to address Microsoft specifically. The only reference to any financial analysis of their own was on page 17, when Messrs. Greenhill and Williams wrote that they "performed a sum-of-the-parts analysis assuming a range of assumptions and believe our estimates and adjustments to be based on reasonable and rational business judgments based on the currently available public information." But they did not include the analysis itself in the affidavit.
Other salient details were also absent, analysts said. The document did not detail growth or revenue projections for the separate concerns, and the consumer market was largely ignored. And when addressing other companies that might be comparable in size and profitability to the operating-systems concern, Mr. Greenhill and Mr. Williams were vague, giving no example except for Microsoft itself.
"I was very surprised, said Ed Yardeni, chief global economist and investment strategist at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "It was a fairly minimalist analysis." But given the sensitivity of the Microsoft case, Mr. Yardeni said that keeping to what he described as a "limited mandate" may have been appropriate. Mr. Yardeni said he believed that Mr. Greenhill and Mr. Williams, or their lawyers, might have left out their financial analysis because they did not want the specific data to become the target of criticism.
"Sharing numbers is a no-win situation," he said. "They didn't want to be the baseline at which everyone shoots."
Mary Meeker, the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst who has followed Microsoft for more than a decade, said that Friday's filings, including the Greenhill document, were only a first step in what was sure to be a complicated negotiating process.
"We've entered a new century where the complexity of breaking up companies that rely on code and people is far more complex than anything seen before," Ms. Meeker said. "A breakup is an extraordinarily aggressive tactic by the government, given the root of the problem."
Ms. Meeker, like the other analysts, took issue with the companies the Greenhill affidavit cited as successful spinoff models. She noted that many of them, including the retailer The Limited, which spun off Abercrombie & Fitch, were not technology concerns.
And she noted that most of the spinoffs had been voluntary. This was a point the affidavit conceded, although it added, "Even court-ordered separations such as the Standard Oil and the 1984 AT&T breakups are perceived as having produced sizable positive returns to shareholders, assuming they held on to the original holdings."
Perhaps more important, analysts said, companies in recent years that have chosen to spin off businesses have generally done so because the newly separate company was worth more on its own. The network equipment maker Lucent Technologies, spun off from AT&T in 1996, now has a stock market value of $198 billion, surpassing AT&T, which is valued at $146 billion.
But AT&T spun off Lucent in part because local telephone companies were sometimes wary of buying networking equipment from AT&T, a company that was planning to compete for their local calling customers.
Microsoft's situation is very different. To begin with, Microsoft is holding steadfast in its desire to remain a single company. And it is not clear that customers would be more likely to buy Microsoft applications software if that business was separate from Microsoft's Windows operating-system business.
Rick Sherlund, the analyst at the Goldman Sachs Group who follows Microsoft, warned, too, that the company's viability depends in part on how well it delivers on the next generation of Windows products. As such, he said Greenhill & Company's findings "do not seem to address the full range of issues" needed to assess Microsoft's future.
"Everyone is taking a retrospective view, not a prospective view," Mr. Sherlund said. But that again might be due to the limited scope of Mr. Greenhill's mandate, he added.
The investing public has already had some opportunity to register its reaction to a Microsoft breakup. As the prospects of a forced split have become more plausible, and analysts have warned that the company's overall growth was slowing, the stock price has sharply fallen, down 19 percent since April 4 when the court found that Microsoft violated antitrust law.
At any rate, it is likely that Mr. Greenhill and Mr. Williams will get their day in court -- literally -- to explain their opinion. Judge Jackson is expected to begin hearings on May 24 in preparation for issuing his final decision on how to deal with Microsoft. And Microsoft says it will ask for extensive discovery and in-court testimony. If so, Mr. Greenhill and Mr. Williams will most likely be asked to produce any data they have prepared to back up their findings.

HEADLINE: Pondering The Impact Of a Breakup;
Some Say It May Be Too Late To Dismantle Microsoft

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 30

 BODY:
In the government's proposal to break up Microsoft and set new ground rules for its business practices, the beneficiaries are supposed to include other software companies -- especially the little guys.
But so far, reaction to the government's proposed helping hand seems muted, or outright skeptical, among software developers -- the primarily small and midsized companies that create a variety of products that make computers work faster or more easily, or that act as tools used by other programmers. 
 Why so little rejoicing?
Some developers view the plan the Justice Department and 17 states filed last Friday as too backward looking, aimed at a personal computer software industry the Internet is already passing by. And some of these same developers and others predict Microsoft, even split in two, will remain too mighty a force to counter.
"Microsoft is the ocean," said Mark Eppley, a veteran software industry executive who is president at Laplink Inc., a maker of software that enables users to synchronize the files on their desktop and portable computers. "Even if you divide it into Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, I still have to swim in it."
Mr. Eppley's company is an example of one that has been able to continue to compete, even though Microsoft offers a similar utility program called "the briefcase" as a free part of the Windows 98 and 2000 operating systems. Laplink, based in Bothell, Wash., has been able to survive by offering more features than are available through Microsoft's briefcase.
Mr. Eppley noted that Laplink, like most other companies in the software business, was now moving its products rapidly to Internet versions. And said he hoped that Microsoft would not develop its own Internet formats for storing and retrieving files -- because unified or divided, Microsoft would present a formidable competitor.
Executives at some other small companies still focused on the traditional personal computer software business said they did not see how a Microsoft breakup would create new possibilities for them.
"It is is not obvious where the opportunity would occur if a breakup were to occur," Lawrence A. Zulch, chief executive officer of the Dantz Development Corporation, a company in Orinda, Calif., whose software is used for making back-up copies of personal computer data and files. "We don't see a logical fracture line that wouldn't turn into a dominant company that would overtake the other one and create a new Microsoft. So it's not clear how it would help the personal computer industry and, therefore, us."
By proposing to separate Microsoft's Windows operating system business from its Office applications software business, the government hopes to unleash personal computer makers to pursue new business strategies and relationships that Microsoft has opposed. The government would also be counting on the breakup to re-ignite the kind of brush fire of innovation in the personal computer software industry that flourished in the early days of the PC in the 1980's.
By the early 1990's, Microsoft had pretty well won the war for operating systems -- the software that controls the basic operations of a computer. But before Microsoft's Office suite of desktop personal computer applications became the de facto industry standard, the industry was awash with small and medium-size software publishing firms developing hundreds of different kinds of competing application programs. These applications ranged from word processors, databases and spreadsheets to programs used for enabling PC's to communicate and utility programs for helping PC's work better.
But since the mid-90's, with Office dominating applications, new investment in the software industry has largely flowed instead to products for the Internet. The traditional software industry has languished, with even name-brand products like Wordperfect changing corporate owners, while many other companies merged or went out of business and the survivors scrambled for niches that gave some shelter from competition's risks.
In interviews, many -- though not all -- industry executives who discussed the government's plan for Microsoft said they were skeptical that slicing off Microsoft's application business would create a meaningful resurgence in applications software. Besides predicting that the spun-off company would continue to dominate PC applications, many executives argued that there were simply no longer enough opportunities for growth in the traditional applications field.
"Taking Office and Windows apart doesn't seem to prepare for the future," said William Gurley, a venture capitalist at Benchmark Capital in Menlo Park, Calif. "The majority of new innovation and spending isn't going into desktop. It feels like that game is over."
Still, some industry executives who have battled Microsoft for years said they could now envision new designs for software products that might not have been viable in a Microsoft-dominated world.
"We won't be selling packaged software the way we did in the 1980's," said Mitchell D. Kapor. He was founder of the Lotus Development Corporation, a company that was once a leader in spreadsheets and other applications. But after the Microsoft Office onslaught, Lotus sought refuge by selling itself to I.B.M. in 1995.
"Now it's worthwhile conducting some experiments in new kinds of application architectures," said Mr. Kapor, who is now an investor and venture capitalist. "If the applications aren't linked to the operating system, there are some real possibilities for innovation." But he declined to be specific, for competitive reasons.
Some other software designers said that it would be almost impossible to predict the consequences of the splitting of Microsoft -- and that unintended consequences might surprise the industry and the Justice Department.
"We really don't know what these things will do; it's hard to debug remedies," said Daniel S. Bricklin, who was co-inventor of the software spreadsheet and is now co-founder of the Trellix Corporation. Trellix, based in Concord, Mass., publishes an application software program that helps users create documents suited for reading on the World Wide Web, rather than being printed out.
One example of an unintended consequence of the government's antitrust case may already be taking place, in the view of Hal Varian, an economist who is dean of the School of Information Management & Systems at the University of California at Berkeley.
Mr. Varian said that the Justice Department is hoping that a newly spun-off applications company would make a copy of Microsoft Office available for use with Linux. He was referring to the Linux operating system, which many Microsoft denigrators hope can be a viable alternative to Windows. "But because of Microsoft's monopoly," he said, "Sun Microsystems recently began giving away a free copy of Star Office for Linux."
By offering its own free alternative to Microsoft Office, Mr. Varian said, Sun might discourage any new Microsoft spin-off from trying to compete in the Linux market. That, presumably, would not be the kind of competitive response the government would hope for with a Microsoft breakup.
Yet, several executives in the Linux community said they hoped that a Microsoft spinoff would create versions of its applications for Linux, making the free operating system much more attractive to non-technical computer users. So far, Linux has tended to be an operating system only a geek could love.
"If Microsoft shows up on Linux, everything would change; it would be a big enabler for Linux," said Michael Boiche, cofounder and chief executive of Eazel, a company designing software intended to make Linux easier to use.
One formerly competitive sector of the computer industry that appears to have been overlooked by the government proposal is programming languages, a field that Microsoft also dominates.
Programming languages like C, C++, Basic and Java are used by software developers to build desktop computer applications like word processors and Web browsers. But they are also used for creating network applications like Web-searching programs that reside on network server computers and are queried by multiple people using individual Web-browser programs.
Development tools are any variety of software programs that help software programmers do their jobs. And just as in automotive repair, it matters whether a mechanic's tools are based on the metric system or gauged in fractions of inches, so do programming languages govern the basis for software tools.
The government proposal would place Microsoft's development tools business within the new applications company. But several executives said that not enough attention had been paid to the importance of programming languages in giving Microsoft a commercial and technical advantage. Microsoft's Visual Basic program is but one of several of the company's development tools that help it dominate this part of the software world.
Software developers say that Microsoft's vast influence in programming languages not only gives the company special advantages in developing applications; it also tends to bind outside developers to Microsoft's operating systems and applications programs.
"The tools business doesn't seem important to people, but it's really very important," said one industry executive, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "If there is no vibrant tools business than there is no applications business."

HEADLINE: Wired Offices, Same Workers

BYLINE: By James Grant; James Grant is the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.

 BODY:
In the new church of American finance, the first article of faith is progress. More and more goods and services will be produced with fewer and fewer hours of labor, world without end.
Evidence in support of this belief would appear to be conclusive. First, there is the revolution in computer technology. Second, there seems to be official affirmation in the national productivity statistics. 
 To compute these statistics, the Labor Department divides the volume of our national economic output by the hours worked to create it. In the third and fourth quarters of 1999, the productivity of American nonfarm labor rose at annual rates of 5 percent and 6.4 percent, the fastest in years. Expectations are running strong that the next productivity report, to be released on Thursday, will be just as brilliant.
It will be a miracle if it is. If the strength of the recent productivity reports seems unbelievable, it is perhaps because they are. James Medoff, a Harvard economics professor, and Andrew Harless, an economic consultant in Needham, Mass., have uncovered deep-rooted flaws in the data. Their conclusion is that the numbers were distorted in the melee associated with the run-up to the year 2000. If they are right, as it seems apparent they are, the "New Economy" is about to lose some of its luster.
Nobody who has ever changed a typewriter ribbon would deny that computer technology has lightened labor's burden. Then again, so has air conditioning. Indeed, without climate control, there could be no electronics. To date, Willis Haviland Carrier, the Bill Gates of the air conditioner, has been a greater benefactor to humanity than Bill Gates.
In a paper presented to the Congressional Budget Office last June, Robert J. Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, broached a surprising discovery. Since 1995, Mr. Gordon wrote, "there has been no productivity growth acceleration in the 99 percent of the economy located outside the sector which manufactures computer hardware."
In other words, the most notable contribution of computers to the recent growth in productivity has been in manufacture of more computers.
On the eve of the new millennium harried workers were replacing computers and computer software that might go haywire once the ball was dropped in Times Square. The looming crisis of the computer clocks caused two important distortions in the government's statistics, Professors Medoff and Harless have found. The number of hours that Americans worked were minimized, and the volume of output produced by their labor was exaggerated.
Innocently, the government assumed that nonproduction workers clocked an average of 37.6 hours per week in the months during which everybody who had anything to do with the maintenance and smooth running of a computer system was sleeping on the floor of his or her office in full crisis mode. By underestimating the number of hours worked, the government flattered the efficiency with which the work was performed.
What was this work? The wholesale substitution of muscular new computers and software for the non-Y2K-compliant kind. In the government statistics, a step up in computing power registers not only as a rise in quality but also as an increase in output. So the high-tech preparation for the new year created a kind of statistical boom. It was a mirage.
"To an observer unaware of the Y2K issue," Mr. Medoff and Mr. Harless wrote in their study, which I commissioned for Grant's Interest Rate Observer, "it might appear that the new computers must have possessed an extremely large amount of computing power -- otherwise, why would people be so eager to buy them? And since the Labor Department's price index didn't take account of the Y2K issue, it would make a similar misattribution, and conclude that an extreme amount of computing power was now available at a reasonable price. As a result, the statistics would show productivity increasing particularly quickly. And so they did."
The faulty perception of a new age of productivity growth has served as a kind of skyhook on which Wall Street has hung some of the most optimistic stock-market valuations in history. At the least, Thursday's number should give the brokers something to talk about.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Gore's Prepared Remarks on Foreign Policy

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks prepared for delivery yesterday by Vice President Al Gore to the International Press Institute in Boston, as provided by the Gore campaign:
Twenty-five years ago today, the last helicopters lifted off from the roof of our embassy in Saigon. Although that brought an end to the war in Vietnam -- a conflict I witnessed with my own eyes -- it did not bring an end to its influence on our thinking about foreign policy. 
 Even now, a decade after the end of the cold war, we hear echoes of the old arguments. Some seem to believe that with the fall of the old Soviet empire, we have nothing more to fear in the world and should dramatically cut our defense budget. Others keep insisting that we continue to prepare to face down a cold war threat that no longer exists and persistently ignore the world as it is. I believe that both groups are locked in a self-destructive argument over a false choice. . . .
We are now in a new era. . . . We are now in a global age. . . .
We need a new security agenda for the global age based on forward engagement. . . .
In the global age, we must be prepared to engage in regional conflicts selectively -- where the stability of a region important to our national security is at stake, where we can assure ourselves that nothing short of military engagement can secure our national interest, where we are certain that the use of military force can succeed in doing so, where we have allies willing to help share the burden and where the cost is proportionate. America cannot be the world's policeman. But we must reject the new isolationism that says: Don't help anywhere, because we cannot help everywhere. . . .
But perhaps the biggest change in our approach to the classic agenda is how we engage two countries that once were only known to us as enemies: Russia and China.
During the cold war, we worked to contain these two powers and limit their reach. Our task in the 21st century is not making them weak, but instead to encourage forces of reform.
That is why we have worked hard these past seven years to help Russia make a transition to a market-based democracy. We have helped Russia privatize its economy and build a civil society marked by free elections and an active press. We have brought Russia into a working relationship with NATO through the Permanent Joint Council and the Partnership for Peace program. We have been able to work with Russian forces successfully inside a NATO framework in the Balkans.
We have helped safeguard Russian nuclear material against the danger of theft. We have made it possible for thousands of Russia's nuclear scientists and weapons experts to find peaceful pursuits. And we have helped Russia to reduce its nuclear arsenal by nearly 5,000 warheads.
This work has not been without difficulty, or controversy. We strongly disagree with Russia's course in Chechnya. Russia must intensify its own work to stop the flow of dangerous technologies that irresponsible groups and rogue states can use to create weapons of mass destruction.
Russia must still take decisive steps to combat corruption and achieve reform. But a new cold war is not the right path to progress. Engaging Russia is the right thing to do. . . .
For these same reasons, we must also follow a policy toward China that is focused on results, not rhetoric.
Make no mistake: we have strong disagreements with China over human rights and religious freedom, and over Chinese treatment of Tibet. These issues cannot -- and must not -- be ignored or marginalized. They must constantly be pursued. Human rights and human dignity speak to the deepest bonds we share, across all borders and nationalities. America has to prod China to make progress in all these areas, and as president, that's exactly what I'll do.
We also have concerns over tensions building between China and Taiwan. We need to maintain our commitment to the "one China" policy, but urge China and Taiwan to intensify their dialogue and to resolve their problems by peaceful means. The administration is honoring its obligation to make defensive weapons available to Taiwan. But I am deeply concerned that those in the Congress who are pushing the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act are blind to its consequences: a sharp deterioration in the security of the region.
It is wrong to isolate and demonize China, to build a wall when we need to build a bridge. . . .
I strongly support permanent normal trade relations with China, and I will continue to press the Congress to support it this year. I support China's membership in the World Trade Organization, to make China abide by the same rules of international trade that we follow today. . . .
From what we can tell of his foreign policy, Governor Bush does not prepare us to meet the grand challenges of both the classic and new security agendas. . . .
Governor Bush dangerously fixates on the cold war past when speaking of the use of force. He suggests that he would not intervene to relieve even the brutal repression of ethnic cleansing and genocide. No wonder it took him six weeks to say anything about our action against the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Is that the right message for America to send to people around the globe struggling for freedom?
Stuck in a cold war mindset, Governor Bush continues to view Russia and China primarily as present or future enemies. While we must remain vigilant against any deterioration in our relationships, the reality of the global age is that Russia and China are indeed competitors, but also vital partners in our efforts to tackle problems menacing to us all.
Just this past week, Governor Bush used his brief meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov to issue a warning that his intention would be to build and deploy a global Star Wars system that he believes could defend the U.S. and all our allies against any missile launch from any source. In the 1990's, most serious analysts took a look at the implausibility of this endeavor, the fantastical price that our taxpayers would be expected to pay, and the dangerously destabilizing consequences of traveling down that path and rejected this notion. Governor Bush wishes to return to it, and chose the worst possible venue in which to launch -- for lack of a better phrase -- his risky foreign policy scheme. . . .
When it comes to the challenges of the new security agenda, Governor Bush's foreign policy is noticeably blank. Although Africa represents a vast untapped market, has major health and environmental concerns that directly impact us, and the reaches of modern terrorism took American lives in two of our embassies on that continent, Governor Bush said that Africa "doesn't fit into the national strategic interests." Is that a responsible assessment of our national interest?
One has to assume that these gaps in Governor Bush's foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership. Since 1994, the Republicans in Congress have recklessly tossed aside decades of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy.
They have refused to adequately fund our diplomatic and international development efforts, from promoting peace in the Middle East to fighting drugs in South America. They have held our contributions to the United Nations hostage to their own political agenda for years. They have repeatedly tried to sabotage this administration's programs, even in places like Bosnia and Kosovo where what is needed is steadiness and continuity of purpose. They have made themselves the sworn enemies of a worldwide effort to deal with the global environment.
And in the end, despite their constant assertion of concern for our alliances, they have rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In one blatant partisan move, they have profoundly shaken the confidence of our allies in American steadiness, purpose and in our capacity to lead.
Governor Bush joined with the isolationist, partisan Republican majority in Congress in opposing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He chose politics over principle. . . .
I believe America can do better -- for our own national security, and for the ideals we must model to the world.

HEADLINE: Approval Expected for Transit Spending Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 30

 BODY:
Despite continued, fierce opposition from finance experts and transit advocates, officials here say the Legislature will approve the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's $17 billion capital plan, perhaps as early as this week.
Analysts say that even with changes made in the last few weeks, the plan still rests on a vast pile of debt that will force fare increases and will hobble the authority's ability to make capital improvements in the future. It would require the largest sale of municipal bonds in history, $22 billion over five years. 
 "Our criticism of the old plan is our criticism of the new plan," said Frank J. Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit group here that studies state and local finances. "They haven't changed much. It's still a nightmare."
The plan, covering this year through 2004, envisions the first major expansion of the transit and commuter rail system in generations. It would begin construction of a Long Island Rail Road connection to Grand Central Terminal, and conduct the engineering work to prepare for building a full-length Second Avenue subway line and a subway connection to La Guardia Airport.
"But if the financing isn't real, the plan's not real," said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer with the Straphangers Campaign, a transit advocacy group. "This plan puts those projects farther away, not nearer. It's a phony plan."
In recent weeks, Mr. Russianoff and others have started complaining that the plan will short-change city residents. They note that most of the money to be spent on the Long Island project is in the first years of the plan, while the money for the Second Avenue and La Guardia projects lags several years behind. When the time comes to put shovels in the dirt for the city projects, they predict, the money will be gone.
E. Virgil Conway, the M.T.A. chairman, dismissed such predictions. "That would be highly irresponsible," he said. "A system is a system and you hope that people understand the interrelation of the parts." Overall, he said, "I think our plan is well conceived."
Legislators and aides in both the Assembly and the Senate say the decision has been made to approve the plan. "I would say that we are 80 percent there on the details," Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Nassau County Republican who has taken the lead role on the plan in his house, said last week. "It should be done very soon."
For the plan to go forward, the Legislature must pass a bill permitting the authority to refinance its existing debts through the sale of $12 billion in bonds. The entire plan must be approved by a review board that includes representatives of the Senate and Assembly leaders, who blocked an earlier version of the plan but have signaled that the latest one will pass muster.
In addition, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature have promised $1.6 billion from a November bond issue for M.T.A. capital projects.
Mr. Pataki has forced a profound change in the way the authority pays for its upkeep and improvements, by largely withdrawing the state from the role it once played as the major source of money. New York City has also cut back sharply.
For the new capital plan, those changes have forced the the authority to rely mostly on borrowed money, to be repaid through riders' fares over the next 30 years. The authority would sell $10 billion in new bonds, a burden that critics say the agency's budget cannot support without huge fare increases.
Mr. Conway said that there was similar criticism when the last capital plan was proposed five years ago. "They were pounding the table and screaming to stop this," he said. "And what happened? We had the first fare reductions in the history of the entire system," a reference to the volume fare discounts introduced in recent years.
That plan worked and so will the new one, he said.
But the last plan involved $3.5 billion in new debt, not the $10 billion envisioned under the new one.
And in fact, the 1995 plan has left the authority facing deficits in the hundreds of millions of dollars each year. That is because the amount of money the authority has had to take out of its fare revenues to pay off debts has climbed from $500 million in 1995 to $1 billion this year. And it will reach $1.6 billion a year with all the debt envisioned in the new plan.
In addition to fears about the $10 billion in new debt, there has been sharp criticism of the bond refinancing. That deal would lower annual payments on the debt somewhat in the early years, but it would increase the cost of repayment by $5.4 billion over the 30-year life of the bonds. Finance experts in government and in the private sector call that bad policy, but many add that they see no other way to get the authority through the next several years.

HEADLINE: After Visit, Congressman Wouldn't Halt Iraq Sanctions

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 28

 BODY:
The first American member of Congress to go to Iraq to assess the impact of economic sanctions on the population has concluded that while some of the suffering he saw was "heartbreaking," he could not support lifting the embargo imposed by the United Nations after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
Representative Tony P. Hall, an Ohio Democrat, visited Iraq from April 16 to 20 and released a report this week that called for more attention to the Iraqi population's problems by the United States. 
 "I left Iraq convinced that a great deal more could be done to address its people's humanitarian needs, and I am determined to do all I can to persuade the U.S. government to take these steps," he said after being shown examples of daily life in Iraq by representatives of Unicef, the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies and the Iraqi Health Ministry.
But Mr. Hall said that Iraq continued to pose a military threat and that until the government of Saddam Hussein cooperates in eliminating weapons of mass destruction as required by the United Nations, "lifting sanctions would be irresponsible." American opponents of sanctions had hoped to enlist his support.
"If Iraq's government would show it is serious about easing its people's suffering -- instead of using their problems to support its bid to end sanctions -- it would be easier for me to see sanctions as the primary culprit," Mr. Hall said in his report.
He criticized Iraq for trying to import items that could have military uses under cover of the program that allows Iraq to sell unlimited quantities of its oil to meet civilian needs. That tactic has contributed to delays in the Security Council process of approving import contracts.
Mr. Hall, who has been active in international relief and development projects since he was a Peace Corps volunteer 30 years ago, has been sympathetic, he said, to calls from religious leaders and aid workers who contend that sanctions are causing suffering for civilians and who demand that the United Nations lift them. But he said he did not believe that ending the embargo would provide much comfort to Iraqis.
"That said," Mr. Hall wrote, "I also believe that the U.N.'s Sanctions Committee, and particularly its U.S. representatives, ought to use much better judgment." He said that too many Iraqi purchases were held up because of a very small percentage that raise security concerns.
He also recommends that to show its concern for ordinary Iraqis, the United States should support a proposed World Health Organization study on the effects of depleted uranium or other chemical pollutants used in ammunition during the Persian Gulf war against Iraq in 1991. Iraqis say those substances are contributing to high rates of leukemia.
Mr. Hall said such a study could also aid American veterans of that war who have lingering illnesses or questions about their exposure to possibly harmful materials.
Measures to build confidence are needed on both sides, Mr. Hall said in his report, in which he described the suffering of many Iraqis as terrible and said damage to health and morale was bound to last a long time. "Sanctions imposed by the United Nations are partly to blame," he said, "but it is the stalemate -- and not the sanctions -- that causes the Iraqis to suffer."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ISSUES;
BUSH TO ADVOCATE PRIVATE ACCOUNTS IN SOCIAL SECURITY

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush plans to push soon for a fundamental overhaul of Social Security, reopening an issue that could be among the most combustible and bitterly debated of the presidential campaign.
In the next month, his aides said, Mr. Bush intends to begin pressing his case for the establishment of individual investment accounts within Social Security, a change that would be the most far-reaching to the program since it was established during the Depression. 
 Mr. Bush believes that the accounts, which would allow workers to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock and bond markets, are an essential component of any plan to ensure the retirement system's long-term viability, his advisers said.
Private accounts would allow workers to capture some of the historically high returns offered by Wall Street over the long run, thereby reducing the need to close a looming shortfall in Social Security's finances through benefit cuts or higher taxes, Mr. Bush's aides said.
While they acknowledged that some voters would find the idea unsettling, the advisers noted that nearly half of households owned stock directly or through retirement accounts, creating a new "investor class" that extends well into the middle class and is increasingly eager to have control over its own finances.
"People have an understanding of how markets work, and are used to securing a higher return on their savings," said one adviser to Mr. Bush. "The debate on Social Security will be joined in a way that we believe will be open to new ideas."
Yet to most Democrats, including Vice President Al Gore, creating individual investment accounts is tantamount to abandoning Social Security's role as the provider of a guaranteed benefit for the elderly.
Mr. Gore's aides said they would portray Mr. Bush's approach as too risky for many individuals because it would leave their retirement security exposed to the ups and downs of the stock market. They expect that argument to have particular resonance if Wall Street remains as volatile as it has been in recent months.
Mr. Gore's team also intends to make a case that establishing personal accounts would have a huge economic cost because it would require using the portion of the projected federal budget surplus that would otherwise go to reducing and eventually eliminating the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public.
Mr. Gore has made eliminating the public debt the centerpiece of his economic agenda, saying that to do so would push interest rates down and give the entire economy a boost. The vice president backs a plan that would leave Social Security intact but would extend its solvency to 2050 by allocating interest savings from the reduction in the national debt to the retirement system.
"One of the reasons Social Security has been so successful is that it's a social compact between generations, one generation taking care of the next generation," said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman. "To play around with privatizing it, when in fact there's no need to privatize it, will only lead to bad results."
Under current projections, Social Security will start paying out more in benefits than it is taking in through payroll taxes starting in 2015, as the baby boomers begin retiring in large numbers. By 2037, under current projections, it will have run through a "trust fund" of i.o.u.'s it has collected from the government, and from that point on will be able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits.
Mr. Bush plans to give a major speech on Social Security sometime in May, and to press the issue from then on, his aides said. He will not offer a detailed plan, but rather will commit himself to a set of principles that he would use as the basis for bipartisan negotiations if he was elected president.
Those principles start with the establishment of private accounts. Mr. Bush will probably not specify what portion of a worker's payroll taxes could go into the accounts, but he is leaning toward making participation in the accounts voluntary, his advisers said. Under this approach, a portion of the retirement benefit would be guaranteed and a portion would fluctuate with the performance of the investment account.
As the system stands now, payroll taxes on today's workers go to pay benefits for current retirees. Mr. Bush's plan would start shifting Social Security toward a system in which each worker saved something for his or her own retirement.
"The key is going to be augmenting the current pay-as-you-go system with a prefunded system based on personal accounts," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, the Bush campaign's chief economic adviser.
Mr. Bush will also pledge not to increase payroll taxes, and not to reduce benefits for anyone in or nearing retirement. He has left open whether the retirement age, which is already rising gradually to 67 from 65, might eventually need to be increased again.
Most of the privatization proposals put on the table in the last few years envision about two percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax paid by each worker being channeled into individual accounts. Privately, Mr. Bush's aides say they envision a plan of roughly the same scale.
To divert that portion of the payroll tax into the accounts while also paying benefits to current retirees would require using all or most of the roughly $2 trillion in surplus Social Security revenues the government expects to collect over the next decade.
Under Mr. Gore's plan, all of the Social Security surplus would go to reducing the national debt held by the public. Mr. Bush's approach would almost certainly have to forgo large-scale reduction in the public debt. But because Mr. Bush's plan would give workers their own retirement accounts, it would decrease the government's long-term obligation to pay benefits out of tax revenues, which is another form of debt reduction.
The subject is devilishly complex even for economists. It has long been an unwritten law of politics that there is little to gain and much to lose from making an issue of Social Security, and the deadlock on it in Washington over the last few years suggests that there is still great hesitancy among the general public, as well as among politicians, in grappling with its problems.
The major political test is likely to be in the big industrial states that both campaigns consider essential to their electoral prospects, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.
Those states, and other crucial battlegrounds like Florida, have high proportions of older voters, who in the past could have been counted on to react strongly against any major changes to Social Security. Democrats remain confident that Mr. Bush's proposal will help drive older voters to Mr. Gore, but Republican strategists said that assumption might prove outdated.
"The question that this election cycle will test," said one adviser to Mr. Bush, "is whether times have changed enough through the emergence of a new investor class, and through the recognition that Social Security is going broke, that new solutions can be found."
The adviser said that neither party could be sure of the answer. Still, the issue is likely to help Democrats mobilize their traditional constituencies. In particular, Democrats said any push by Mr. Bush to privatize Social Security would be met by stiff resistance from labor unions.
"This is an enormous issue for us," said Gerald Shea, an economic policy strategist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "Especially if the Republican candidate promotes it, I wouldn't be surprised if this is the major issue on the minds of working families when they decide who to vote for."
In a poll last May by Princeton Survey Research Associates, 58 percent of Americans favored a system that would include private accounts. The idea was opposed by 33 percent.
But the results were almost precisely the opposite when the same survey asked workers to choose between a program that guaranteed a monthly benefit based on lifetime earnings, as under the current system, and a program that would allow individual investment in the market without a guarantee. Given that choice, 59 percent favored the guaranteed payment, while 33 percent backed private investment.
"The American people seem to favor the idea of individual retirement accounts in theory," said Evans Witt, the president of Princeton Survey Research Associates. "The question is, how do you do it, and what does it cost, and does it put my benefits at risk?"

HEADLINE: To Colombians, Drug War Is Toxic Enemy

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: RIOBLANCO DE SOTARA, Colombia

 BODY:
The children and their teachers were in the schoolyard, they say, playing soccer and basketball and waiting for classes to begin when the crop-duster appeared. At first they waved, but as the plane drew closer and a gray mist began to stream from its wings, alarmed teachers rushed the pupils to their classrooms.
Over the next two weeks, a fleet of counternarcotics planes taking part in an American-sponsored program to eradicate heroin poppy cultivation returned here repeatedly. Time and time again, residents charge, the government planes also sprayed buildings and fields that were not supposed to be targets, damaging residents' health and crops. 
"The pilot was flying low, so there is no way he could not have seen those children," said Nidia Majin, principal of the La Floresta rural elementary school, whose 70 pupils were sprayed that Monday morning last June. "We had no way to give them first aid, so I sent them home. But they had to cross fields and streams that had also been contaminated, so some of them got sick."
In fact, say leaders of this remote Yanacona Indian village high in the Andes, dozens of other residents also became ill during the spraying campaign, complaining of nausea, dizziness, vomiting, rashes, blurred vision and ear and stomach aches. They say the spraying also damaged legitimate crops, undermining government efforts to support residents who have abandoned poppy growing.
Such incidents are not limited to this village of 5,000, say critics in Colombia and the United States, but have occurred in numerous parts of Colombia and are bound to increase if the fumigation program is intensified, as the Clinton administration is proposing as part of a $1.6 billion emergency aid package to Colombia.
Critics say they frequently receive reports of mistakes and abuses by the planes' Colombian pilots that both the American and Colombian governments choose to ignore.
State Department officials deny that indiscriminate spraying takes place, with an American Embassy official in Bogota describing the residents' claims of illnesses as "scientifically impossible."
But to local leaders here the situation brought on by the spraying remains one of crisis. "The fumigation was done in an indiscriminate and irresponsible manner, and it did not achieve its objective," said Ivan Alberto Chicangana, who was the mayor when the spraying occurred.
"The damage done to the physical and economic well-being of this community has been serious," he said, "and is going to be very difficult for us to overcome."
He and other local leaders say that people were sick for several weeks after the spraying, and in interviews a few residents complained of lasting symptoms. Three fish farms with more than 25,000 rainbow trout were destroyed, residents said, and numerous farm animals, mostly chickens and guinea pigs, died, while others, including some cows and horses, fell ill.
In addition, fields of beans, onions, garlic, potatoes, corn and other traditional crops were sprayed, leaving plants to wither and die. As a result, community leaders here say, crop-substitution projects sponsored by the Colombian government have been irremediably damaged and their participants left impoverished.
The spraying around this particular village has since stopped, residents say, though they fear that it could resume at any time, and it continues in neighboring areas, like nearby Guachicono, and year-round elsewhere in Colombia.
Peasants in the coca-growing region of Caqueta, southeast of here, last year complained to a reporter that spray planes had devastated the crops they had planted after abandoning coca, and similar reports have emerged from Guaviare, another province to the east.
Indeed, American-financed aerial spraying campaigns like the one here have been the principal means by which the Colombian government has sought to reduce coca- and opium-poppy cultivation for nearly a decade. The Colombian government fleet has grown to include 65 airplanes and helicopters, which fly every day, weather permitting, from three bases. Last year, the spraying effort resulted in the fumigation of 104,000 acres of coca and 20,000 acres of opium poppy.
Yet despite such efforts, which have been backed by more than $150 million in American aid, cocaine and heroin production in Colombia has more than doubled since 1995.
In an effort to reverse that trend and weaken left-wing guerrilla and right-wing paramilitary groups that are profiting from the drug trade and threatening the country's stability, the Clinton administration is now urging Congress to approve a new aid package, which calls for increased spending on drug eradication as well as a gigantic increase for crop-substitution programs, to $127 million from $5 million.
Critics, like Elsa Nivia, director of the Colombian affiliate of the advocacy organization Pesticide Action Network, see the eradication effort as dangerous and misguided. "These pilots don't care if they are fumigating over schools, houses, grazing areas, or sources of water," she said in an interview at the group's headquarters in Cali.
"Furthermore," she added, "spraying only exacerbates the drug problem by destabilizing communities that are trying to get out of illicit crops and grow legal alternatives."
Those who have been directly affected by the spraying effort here also argue that fumigation is counterproductive. In this cloud-shrouded region of waterfalls, rushing rivers, dense forests and deep mountain gorges, poppy cultivation was voluntarily reduced by half between 1997 and 1999, to 250 acres, said Mr. Chicangana, the former mayor.
He said it was well on its way to being eliminated altogether when the spraying began. "We were collaborating, and now people feel betrayed by the state," he lamented.
"The fumigation disturbs us a bit," said Juan Hugo Torres, an official of Plante, the Colombian government agency supervising crop-substitution efforts, who works with farmers here. "You are building trust with people, they have hopes, and then the spraying does away with all of that."
In an interview in Washington, R. Rand Beers, the American assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, said aerial spraying flights are strictly monitored and targets are chosen carefully.
The fumigation program is devised so that pilots "shouldn't be anywhere close to alternative development projects," he said, since "officials in the air and on the ground should be equipped with geographic positioning devices that pinpoint where those activities are taking place."
"If that happened, the pilot who flew that mission should be disciplined," Mr. Beers said referring to the accusations made by residents here. "That shouldn't be happening."
But the area fumigated here is wind-swept mountain terrain where illicit crops and their legal alternatives grow side by side, making accurate spraying difficult. And in some other places, pilots may be forced to fly higher than might be advisable, for fear of being shot at by the guerrillas, whose war is fueled by the profits of the drug trade.
As for the complaints of illness, the American Embassy official who supervises the spraying program said in an interview in Bogota that glyphosate, the active ingredient in the pesticide used here, is "less toxic than table salt or aspirin." Calling it "the most studied herbicide in the world," he said it was proven to be harmless to human and animal life and called the villagers' account "scientifically impossible."
"Being sprayed on certainly does not make people sick," the official said, "because it is not toxic to human beings." Glyphosate "does not translocate to water" and "leaves no soil residue," he added, so "if they are saying otherwise, to be very honest with you, they are lying, and we can prove that scientifically."
But in an out-of-court settlement in New York state in 1996, Monsanto, a leading manufacturer of glyphosate-based herbicides like Roundup, though not necessarily identical to those used here, agreed to withdraw claims that the product is "safe, nontoxic, harmless or free from risk." The company signed a statement agreeing that its "absolute claims that Roundup 'will not wash or leach in the soil' is not accurate" because glyphosate "may move through some types of soil under some conditions after application."
In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has approved glyphosate for most commercial uses. But the E.P.A.'s 1993 recertification study noted that "in California, where physicians are required to report pesticide poisonings, glyphosate was ranked third out of the 25 leading causes of illness or injury due to pesticides" over a five-year period in the 1980's, primarily causing eye and skin irritation.
In addition, labels on glyphosate products like Roundup sold in the United States advise users to "avoid direct application to any body of water." Directions also warn users that they should "not apply this product in a way that will contact workers or other persons, either directly or through drift" and caution that "only protected handlers may be in the area during application."
The doctor in charge of the local clinic here, Ivan Hernandez, recently was transferred and could not be reached for comment about the impact of the spraying on the health of residents. Gisela Moreno, a nurse's aide, refused to speak to a visiting reporter, saying, "We have been instructed not to talk to anyone about what happened here." When asked the origin of the order, she replied: "From above, from higher authorities."
Here in Rioblanco de Sotara, half a dozen local people say they felt so sick after the spraying that they undertook a 55-mile bus trip to San Jose Hospital in Popayan, the capital of Cauca Province, for medical care. There, they were attended by Dr. Nelson Palechor Obando, who said he treated them for the same battery of symptoms that more than two dozen residents described to a reporter independently in recent interviews.
"They complained to me of dizziness, nausea and pain in the muscles and joints of their limbs, and some also had skin rashes," he said. "We do not have the scientific means here to prove they suffered pesticide poisoning, but the symptoms they displayed were certainly consistent with that condition."
Because this is an area of desperate poverty where most people eke out a living from subsistence agriculture, there is no stigma attached to growing heroin poppies, and those who have planted the crop freely admit it. Yet even those who claim never to have cultivated poppies say that their fields were also sprayed and their crops were destroyed.
"They fumigated everywhere, with no effort made to distinguish between potatoes and poppies," complained Oscar Ceron, a 32-year-old farmer. "We could even hear their radio transmissions on the FM band, with the ground command referring to us in a vulgar fashion."
Other farmers said the air currents constantly swirling down from the 14,885-foot Sotara volcano, on whose flank this town sits, blew the herbicide over fields planted with legal crops.
"A gust of wind can carry the poison off to adjacent fields, so that they end up more badly damaged than the field that was the original target, which sometimes is left completely intact," explained Fernando Hormiga.
In the United States, glyphosate users are specifically warned not to spray by air "when winds are gusty or under any other condition that favors drift." The instructions also say that "appropriate buffer zones must be maintained" to avoid contaminating surrounding areas.
Once word got out about the illnesses that followed the spraying here, prices for milk, cheese and other products that are a mainstay of the local economy dropped by more than half. "The rumors are that the land is contaminated, so we no longer get orders from outside, and the middlemen can now name their own price," said Fabian Omen, a farmer and town councilman.
Worse still, government and private creditors are nonetheless demanding that the loans made for crop-substitution projects like the fish farms must still be repaid, even though the enterprises themselves have been destroyed.
Asked about the lack of an integrated policy that implies, Alba Lucia Otero, the Plante director for Cauca Province, expressed frustration. "The state is a single entity, but we work on one side while those doing the fumigation work on another," she said. "There should be coordination, but they take their decision at the central level, and we are not consulted."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Speech Distorts Bush's View Of Foreign Policy, Aide Says

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The top foreign policy adviser for Gov. George W. Bush argued today that Vice President Al Gore had misrepresented Mr. Bush's views on how to deal with Russia and China and had taken "a series of positions that are at complete odds with how he has acted for the past seven years."
In a telephone conversation with reporters, Mr. Bush's adviser, Condoleezza Rice, offered a response to a speech by Mr. Gore that, while reported in newspapers today, had not yet been delivered. Based on the advance text of the speech, Ms. Rice said Mr. Gore had glossed over the Clinton administration's cuts in military procurement and had ignored his involvement in a largely failed effort to convert Russia to capitalism. 
 She was particularly critical of Mr. Gore's sometimes meandering commitment to free trade.
"Where was he when it was time to stand up and be counted in Seattle?" she asked, talking about the meeting of the World Trade Organization in December that was disrupted by violent protests, and where an administration effort to start a new round of global trade talks had collapsed. Mr. Gore stayed away from the meeting, partly to avoid angering union members who were demonstrating. President Clinton attended the session for a day and a half.
"And when it has come to the vote on China," Ms. Rice said, referring to the scheduled vote in late May over whether Congress will approve permanent normal trading relations with Beijing, "he's been missing in action."
Mr. Gore offered his strongest endorsement yet of the China trade pact in a speech in Boston today, saying he would work to win votes for its approval, even if it meant angering his labor constituency. But Ms. Rice was not impressed. "It's about time," she said. "The vote's in three weeks."
The exchange was particularly notable because foreign policy has played only a bit role in the presidential campaign. Mr. Bush has delivered one major speech on the subject, devoted almost entirely to security issues. That left him vulnerable to Mr. Gore's assertion today that the Texas governor "dangerously fixates on the cold war past" but has not dealt with the major issues of economic globalization that form some of the toughest foreign policy challenges.
Ms. Rice, who was a Russia specialist on the National Security Council in President George Bush's administration, said Governor Bush was planning a series of foreign policy speeches, starting with trade. But she said that the timing of those speeches had not been set.
In her critique of Mr. Gore's speech, Ms. Rice said she was particularly mystified about why he raised the issue of Russia.
"The vice president himself oversaw Gore-Chernomyrdin," she said, referring to meetings between Mr. Gore and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, on issues that included security and economic transformation. "At the time it was very clear that Chernomyrdin and others who the vice president was calling 'reformers' were stealing the country blind, with the money going into Swiss bank accounts."
The essence of Mr. Gore's critique today was that Mr. Bush was aligned with right-wing Republicans and regarded both Russia and China as "future enemies" rather than partners and competitors. Ms. Rice argued that Mr. Gore had deliberately misstated Mr. Bush's views, incorrectly casting him as a cold warrior and an isolationist. "The interests of the U.S. are served by engagement with Russia and China," she said, "but you have to engage them in a realistic way, not a romantic one."
"I would not call either country a threat, but both are challenges," she said, using terminology close to Mr. Gore's. She said Mr. Gore had mischaracterized Mr. Bush's views on missile defenses, an area of dispute with Russia. She enlisted Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a mainstream Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, to declare that Mr. Gore's speech was a compendium of foreign policy problems "rather than a strategic vision."
She also said Mr. Gore had participated in decisions to "cut military procurement by 13 percent" since the beginning of the Clinton administration.

Iran to Start Trial Of Jews Accused of Spying
Thirteen Jews will go on trial today in Iran in the feared Revolutionary Court. The Jews are accused of spying for Israel, in a case that has been caught up in the swirl of Iran's internal political battles and could undo its tentative overtures to the West.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Drawing Lessons From the Opponent's Father

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 30

 BODY:
With a fullblown attack today on Gov. George W. Bush over foreign policy, Vice President Al Gore seemed to be executing a classic incumbent strategy, one made especially classic by Governor Bush's father, then the vice president, against another sitting governor in 1988.
The Gore campaign has been sifting through the detritus of the elder Mr. Bush's steamrolling of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts and has unearthed useful lessons. Those lessons, for an incumbent vice president defending a relatively popular administration against a sitting governor, are becoming increasingly evident. The basic thrust: try to hamstring the opponent by raising questions about his record and his readiness to be president. 
 Neither the Gore campaign nor the Bush campaign particularly likes the analogy. The Gore team says it is having a high-minded policy debate and is not employing negative personal attacks. The Bush campaign says Mr. Gore, unlike Vice President George Bush in 1988, is misrepresenting the governor's record.
Their routes may be different, but the Gore campaign arrives at the same place Governor Bush's father arrived a dozen years ago. They both present a sitting vice president as the responsible steward of the current peace and prosperity. And they both cast the challenger as risky and irresponsible and his state as an alien universe that is culturally out of the mainstream. Already, Texas has been portrayed as such an aberration that it almost resembles, well, Massachusetts in 1988.
Governor Bush began this campaign much the way Governor Dukakis began his, as the respected if little-known executive of a state that had appeared to make strides economically and socially.
By the end of the 1988 campaign, of course, Mr. Dukakis had become a laughingstock. His "Massachusetts Miracle" was in shreds. Boston Harbor had become synonymous with pollution and neglect. And Mr. Dukakis himself had become the emblem of effete liberalism, impractical ineffectuality and, perhaps worst of all, insufficient patriotism.
Part of this was Mr. Dukakis's fault. He did not think Vice President Bush's attacks were worth answering. And he slapped on a helmet and climbed into a battle tank, providing perhaps the most enduring, if hapless, image of his campaign.
This time around, Mr. Gore's chief criticism of Mr. Bush was initially confined to the governor's "risky tax scheme." But he has ratcheted up that criticism every day. Now the word "risky," supplemented by "irresponsible" and "reckless," is applied to the entire Bush world view. The risky tax scheme begets a risky economic plan, which encompasses risky health and education plans and so on.
So in a major foreign policy speech in Boston today, Mr. Gore criticized Mr. Bush for talking about a costly and controversial Star Wars missile defense plan in his meeting with the foreign minister of Russia and said the Texan "chose the worst possible venue in which to launch -- for lack of a better phrase -- his risky foreign policy scheme."
He continued, "I won't even guess at the new math needed to make his risky foreign policy scheme and his risky tax scheme add up."
On the domestic policy front, Mr. Gore has portrayed Mr. Bush's Texas as a backwater with substandard education and inadequate health insurance and its residents as so gun-happy that the governor signed a bill allowing them to take weapons into churches. Further, Mr. Gore likes to link Governor Bush with the "failed" policies of his father and refers often to "the Bush-Quayle recession."
Today Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush was "stuck in a cold war mindset" and that he would have to fill in the "gaps" in his knowledge of foreign policy with the right-wing isolationist ideology of Congressional Republicans like Senator Jesse Helms.
But if Mr. Gore has learned from the 1988 campaign, so has Governor Bush. Instead of allowing Mr. Gore to define him the way Vice President Bush defined Governor Dukakis, Governor Bush has tried to the avoid the extremist conservative box Mr. Gore has tried to put him in.
Governor Bush has spent much time reaching for the political center, especially on issues like education and health care, which have traditionally been viewed as more favorable to Democrats. And he has emphasized bipartisanship and his ability to work with Democrats.
Governor Bush has also been quicker to respond to attacks than was Governor Dukakis. Unlike Mr. Dukakis, Governor Bush is not only resisting Mr. Gore's caricature of him but is constructing his own caricature of Mr. Gore, as the candidate who does not tell the truth and is bent on a campaign of destruction. The constant refrain from the Bush campaign is that Mr. Gore "will say anything to get elected."
Mr. Gore has pushed away any suggestion that he is being negative, saying he believes the country wants a healthy debate on the issues people care about. He has already signaled what some of those issues will be and how he intends to use them, as in recent days, when he excoriated Mr. Bush's record on the environment by calling Texas the most polluted state in the country, citing Houston's chronic air pollution as an example.
And while some in the Gore campaign have been studying the 1988 campaign -- its similarities include an incumbent vice president who began the campaign in double digits behind a governor -- his spokesman rejects the idea that the 1988 Bush campaign is any kind of model.
"We're putting out our positive vision," said Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore. "The difference is that in 1988, Bush's goal was to pull down Dukakis."
For an incumbent to portray a challenger as too much of a risk is hardly unprecedented. Lyndon B. Johnson's devastating "countdown" commercial imprinted on television viewers the image of nuclear destruction should they elect Barry Goldwater. And Jimmy Carter suggested that Ronald Reagan was too extreme to have his finger on the nuclear button.
It was in this long tradition that Vice President Gore's first television commercial, once he secured the nomination, said to viewers: "Al Gore is ready. Is George W.?"

HEADLINE: Seattle Absorbs Microsoft News Without Fuss

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash., April 30

 BODY:
It is an idea once considered unthinkable, and still widely viewed here as unlikely. And it is an idea that many people respond to with visceral criticism, or diatribes about a distant federal government picking on a homegrown winner.
But in the Seattle region, where Microsoft has generated a staggering amount of wealth, only to see more than $100 billion of it vanish in recent weeks, the idea of breaking up the company hardly seems to be setting off widespread panic. 
 "I really don't see the need for it, but if you ever did split up Microsoft, I think the new companies would just grow like weeds," explained Dana Nielsen, the owner of Ray's Cafe, a diner in a mall near the Microsoft campus here. "So your stock would be worth more than ever."
Some express an almost messianic faith in the company's chairman. "This is Bill Gates we're talking about here," said Alan Paisley, a Seattle guitarist. "I wouldn't put it past Gates to somehow come out of this whole thing smelling like a rose. You get two or three little Microsofts running around out there, it could be very profitable for all concerned."
Such an analysis is stoutly rejected by Mr. Gates himself, who said Friday that "no one should think that shareholder value would be preserved" if the company he founded 25 years ago were dismantled. But even the mayor of Redmond, where the software giant has its headquarters, said the prospect of a breakup is not engendering nightmares.
"People say to me, are you worried?" said Mayor Rosemarie Ives. "The answer is, not really. I'm confident that the innovation and creativity that have always been characteristic of Microsoft are going to continue, no matter what the form is."
With about 40 percent of all Microsoft shares in the hands of people who live in the Puget Sound region, the recent plunge in the company's stock, coupled with sharp declines in the shares of many Internet companies, could be the beginning of a major jolt to the area. Microsoft's stock is now down by nearly 45 percent from the all time-high of nearly $120 it reached late last year, meaning that Microsoft has lost more market value than the combined worth of all of the 25 next-biggest Northwest-based companies, including Boeing and Amazon.com.
But as calamitous as all that sounds, life has not wildly changed here as a result -- not yet, anyway. Local economists say they know of no big projects that have been scuttled because of Microsoft's dive.
Interviews with small-time Microsoft investors, who are remarkably easy to find in malls and streets here, turn up only isolated cases of semi-woe. One man explained that he recently backed out of a deal to buy a house -- not because he could no longer afford to do so, but because he just could not bear to cash out any of his Microsoft stock at $65, even though he bought most of it for a fraction of that. Whatever happens in the antitrust case, he said, he was sure it would come back up.
"People are looking to Standard Oil or the breakup of the Bell system as an example," said Roger Qualman, executive vice president of a commercial real estate services company that studies economic trends in Redmond and the other towns across Lake Washington from Seattle. "While people here don't think breaking up Microsoft is a good idea or an outcome to be desired, I don't think that they fear it, either. Quite to the contrary, in a lot of cases."
Many economic analysts say that breaking up Microsoft is not at all analogous to the dividing of Standard Oil or AT&T, two other companies that lost epic antitrust battles with the government but also saw the values of their divided parts soar. Others also argue that Microsoft's recent stock decline stems from problems beyond the antitrust case, like lower-than-expected earnings or investor concerns that the company is poorly positioned as competition over software increasingly moves toward the World Wide Web.
Still, the operative faith here still seems to be that Microsoft is a good bet, no matter what happens with the breakup proposal. Many people said they were convinced that now was a good time to pick up more stock.
"I sold a bunch off last year at $106, then I got nervous and bought back in" at around $86, said Lou Kiersky, a retired Boeing engineer, who was at the Crossroads shopping center, near the Microsoft campus, late last week watching a chess match being played out on a giant floor board in the mall. "I should have waited and bought back in now. Now would be a good time."
Asked what would happen if the company were split up, Jack Brown, a ski and bicycle technician at the Sports Authority, barely paused before answering: "Short term, down. Longer term, up. Way up." He shot his thumb in the air in confidence.
Whether the abiding faith in the company here is misplaced remains, of course, to be seen. And while most people continue to say a breakup is unlikely, no one seems to have any clear idea of how such a plan would be implemented -- and whether, most importantly, one or more of the new companies might be headquartered outside of the Seattle area.
The Seattle region has had its share of both boom days and busts, in part because of the fortunes of Boeing, the mammoth aircraft manufacturer that still provides more than five times as many jobs locally as Microsoft. In the early 1970's, when the aircraft industry hit a particularly bad patch during the recession, 1 in 9 people in King County lost their jobs, said Dick Conway, co-publisher of the Puget Sound Economic Forecaster, a newsletter. A much-remembered billboard implored the last person leaving Seattle to turn out the lights.
Microsoft's history, in contrast, is one of seemingly unbridled growth, both in its work force and its stock price. It has added about 1,000 local jobs each year, while its market value has increased exponentially.
On the campus here, many Microsoft employees are clearly aghast at the idea that they could be forced to move to keep their jobs. The consistent public refrain from employees is faith that the company will prevail, and an insistence that it is "business as usual" in the meantime.
"Microsoft hires type-A personalities," said Tod Nielsen, a vice president for product and business planning. "We don't focus on things beyond our control. So instead of sitting back and worrying about the case, we focus on what we can control."
Said Peggy Brown, group manager for internal technical education: "People are working on the same products, the same tasks. People do feel this case is a setback, but at some point, it's going to end" in a positive way for the company.
Bruce M. Brooks, a director of community affairs for the company and a former deputy mayor of Seattle, said he detected a "quiet confidence," both on campus and in the wider community, that the case would be resolved favorably. People in the region do ask him about the antitrust battle all the time, he said, but not in a particularly anxious way.
"The case is kind of like the weather," Mr. Brooks said. "You sort of talk about it as the icebreaker, if you will. Then you get down to business."
Microsoft officials also pointed out that they still get 1,000 job applications a day and that their annual attrition rate, 7.4 percent, is well below the average for the high-technology industry. But its recent troubles do have competitors suggesting, and not so subtly, that now might be a good time for Microsoft employees to look around for new jobs.
"There will be some confusion on the Microsoft campus for quite a while," said Kelly Jo MacArthur, senior vice president and general counsel for the Seattle-based Real Networks, which makes audio and video software for the Internet.
"That confusion might lead to an opportunity for the rest of the high-tech community in Seattle," Ms. MacArthur continued, "as employees at Microsoft are weighing their futures."
Outside the campus, there is a certain amount of gallows humor about Microsoft's travails and their possible impact on the area.
"People are still very concerned about soaring housing prices here," Mr. Conway said. "Well, that problem may well be cured."
The general opinion seems to be that Microsoft will not be split up, but that feeling is by no means unanimous. Some people feel that the company faces eventual evisceration because it "didn't play ball with the politicians in Washington," as one man said.
Mr. Kiersky, the retired Boeing engineer, also thinks the company will face a split.
"There's not much they can do," he said, shaking his head. "There are too many people in the government, the Congress, our justice system, all gunning for them."

HEADLINE: Mayor Drops Unpopular Plans for Trash Hubs

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART

 BODY:
With the closing of the Fresh Kills landfill fast approaching, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has sharply revised his long-term plan for disposing the city's household garbage.
To the surprise and relief of several critics of his old plan, the new plan does not include proposals to build a huge new waste plant in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, and a somewhat smaller plant near Hunts Point in the Bronx. It would also ensure that no borough handled another's garbage, and it would make Linden, N.J., a major hub for transferring garbage into rail containers destined for out-of-state landfills. 
Greg Brooks, chief of staff for the Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden, called the new plan "a very good victory for the community." Leslie H. Lowe, executive director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, called it "a vast improvement." And John McGettrick, a Red Hook civic leader and prominent opponent of the mayor's first garbage plan, described it as "a positive development."
The mayor's plan, which was first reported yesterday by The Daily News, will be presented to the City Council tomorrow.
Under the new plan, Mr. Brooks said, Red Hook residents would no longer face the prospect of garbage trucks making hundreds of noisy, smelly trips each day through their neighborhood. He added that residents near a garbage plant in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn would no longer have to cope with hundreds of trucks a week rumbling past with garbage from Queens.
"The borough president is very, very pleased," Mr. Brooks said yesterday, adding, "It's a shame that it took two years for them to come to their senses."
City officials are under intense pressure to come up with a long-term garbage plan. The state has set a deadline of December 2001 for the closing of Fresh Kills, the 3,000-acre landfill on Staten Island.
But with the city continuing to generate 13,000 tons of residential garbage each day, officials have cobbled together an interim system that relies almost entirely on trucks, which are dirty, expensive and hard on the city's streets and bridges.
Caravans of garbage trucks are making hundreds of thousands of extra trips out of New York City. Along Canal Street, a major route to the Holland Tunnel, air pollution has increased 16 percent, state officials say. And over the next five years, the city expects to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new garbage trucks, extra trips and additional landfill fees.
In the meantime, city officials have been searching for better long-term solution.
At the center of the mayor's first long-term plan was a proposal to build three giant garbage hubs, one in Newark, a second to the south in Carteret, N.J., and a third in Red Hook. The new plan, by contrast, would make greater use the city's existing network of smaller transfer stations. Some transfer stations would be refurbished or expanded. Some would be converted into plants that pack garbage into containers.
From these smaller stations, much of the city's garbage -- perhaps 6,500 tons a day -- would then be sent by barge to a 20-acre site planned for Linden, where local officials have embraced the garbage business as a way to revitalize the economy. A Houston waste company, BFI, would operate the Linden hub, which is expected to cost $50 million. Kathryn Forsyth, a spokeswoman, said BFI would load garbage into sealed trains and haul it to landfills around the country.

HEADLINE: A CONVERSATION WITH: VICTOR FUCHS;
An Economist's View Of Health Care Reform

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Dr. Victor Fuchs is an economist who also sees himself as a humanist, a person who is interested in values and who inquires how economics can help people to think about social problems and arrive at solutions. Economics, he explains, is about choice. It asks how people respond to incentives, how they respond to constraints. And so, Dr. Fuchs observes, "economics is the quintessential policy science."
Dr. Fuchs, an emeritus professor of economics, holds half a dozen titles at Stanford University and is continuing his research while serving on the steering committee of Stanford's Center for Biomedical Ethics and as a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research. He is also a past president of the American Economic Association and a member of the American Philosophical Society and of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences. 
 Dr. Fuchs, 76, visited Princeton University last week, lecturing and meeting with graduate students. On a gray and chilly morning, sitting at a small square table in a drafty section of his hotel's breakfast room, he discussed how economic analysis could inform the nation's wrenching debates about health care.
Q. There has been a lot of talk about health care reform, and at least one major initiative, the Clinton health care plan. Do you foresee another, more successful attempt to reform health care on the horizon?
A. The Clinton plan was a combination of ignorance and arrogance and it turned out to be a disaster. But I never believed for a minute that they could get major health care reform. Health care reform requires a substantial political investment.
You're talking about one-seventh of the economy and huge numbers of interest groups of all kinds. To change the status quo in a major way means you have to achieve a tremendous political reform first. I've been on record for a long time saying that I only see a major health care reform coming to the U.S. in the wake of a war, a large-scale recession or large-scale civil unrest.
Q. Don't Americans want health care reform?
A. Two-thirds of the American people say they favor universal coverage, but the minute you start to spell out what that means -- subsidization for the people who are poor and who are sick, and that the plan has to be compulsory -- they are less supportive.
Q. We subsidize health care in a way, don't we? What about Medicare?
A. You pay for Medicare but there's going to be more and more resistance to it. Remember, Medicare started as a small program. It was going to be $4 billion or something like that. There's a generalized resistance to higher taxes. People don't exactly realize that a lot of their taxes are going to transfers to the elderly. They just know they are fed up with paying higher taxes. The average working person today pays more in Social Security and Medicare taxes then he pays in income taxes. But they don't express it directly that way. They just don't want to pay more taxes.
Q. What about current proposals to provide Medicare coverage for prescription benefits?
A. We see proposals to expand Medicare. And they're politically popular. But then they're going to have to try and figure out how to pay for it. One thing I'll go on record as saying is that the Clinton proposal for paying for prescription drugs makes absolutely no sense. It is a proposal to cover the cost of drugs from the first dollar up to a cap.
Q. What's wrong the Clinton prescription proposal?
A. The purpose of insurance is to protect the people who have big expenses. So you ask why do they propose a plan that does just the opposite? Because that's politically popular. People don't think they're paying for somebody else's drugs. Everybody thinks they're going to get a benefit. But that's not insurance. That's not what insurance is for.
Q. So will Congress succeed in expanding Medicare coverage and reforming health care?
A. That's a political forecast, isn't it? All my life I've tried to spend more time trying to figure out what the government should do than what they will do.
Q. What should be done about health care?
A. I think we should have universal coverage financed by a general, broad-based tax which is earmarked for health care -- such as a value-added tax -- which would give every American a voucher to be part of some health care plan.
I think that plan should not be a minimal sort of "safety net for the poor" plan, but neither should it be one that would cover what every American would be willing and able to pay for. I like to think of it as a multitiered system where every American has basic coverage and people have options to buy more, not subsidized by taxes but with their own after-tax dollars.
The individual plans could decide if they want a co-payment, such as $10 for each prescription or a co-payment for an office visit. I don't operate at the level of trying to specify details. I try to see what is the broad strategy, what is the broad vision that we want to bring to this. I'm trying to get across two points: universal coverage for a plan, but one that is not completely egalitarian.
I think we are hung up with the idea that everything we do in health care must be egalitarian, and we wind up with a very nonegalitarian system. What I'm arguing for is some kind of middle ground.
Q. What happens now to the uninsured? Aren't they simply doing without the most basic health care?
A. No. The truth is we do provide health care for everyone one way or another. We have poverty clinics, we have county hospitals.
Even surveys by the people who are most inclined to be concerned about the uninsured show that the uninsured get about two-thirds of the health care they would get if they had insurance.
So people do get care. They don't get the same care that others necessarily get. They don't get it under the same conditions that other people get it. But there are not many people who simply die in the streets, although they're the ones who make the newspapers.
Q. There is widespread concern about the nation's health care bill. What do you think of the proposed ways of cutting it?
A. Any time you want to reduce health care spending one of two things comes up. Let's reduce physicians' incomes or let's cut drug industry profits. But these are one-time cuts. These are not cuts that reduce the rate of growth. Unless you cut the underlying forces that allow for growth, you make a tiny little difference.
If you cut physicians' net incomes by 20 percent, it's a difference of one-tenth of 1 percent per annum in the growth rate of health care costs over 20 years. Cutting drug industry profits would get you even less, because half of drug industry profit is less than 20 percent than physicians' net income. As a rough estimate, drug industry profits might come to about 3 percent of health care spending.
If you cut that in half, it would be 1.5 percent. Spread that over 20 years and you've got three-quarters of a percent per annum. That's the direct effect. The indirect effect could be much larger because if you cut drug industry profits in half you might have a big effect on the amount of investment in new research and development. That would show up in fewer new drugs and less spending.
Q. Then what does it mean to say the prices of drugs are too high?
A. From an economist's point of view? We mean that the market conditions are not producing a socially optimal allocation of resources. The classic example is a monopoly. If a company has a monopoly, then we usually expect that their prices will be higher than their socially desirable rate. But that's a question that the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice ought to be looking into. It's independent of whether we cover the elderly for drugs.
Q. What is driving up the cost of health care?
A. The principle factor by far is medical innovations like new drugs, new surgical procedures and new diagnostic techniques. This is not just my opinion. I surveyed the 50 leading health economists in the country on this question. Over 80 percent of them agreed with me.
Q. We spend more money on health care than other industrialized nations. Are we healthier?
A. Let's put it this way. We spend 40 percent per capita more for services than people in Canada. We do get some services that they don't get. We get easier access. We don't have the long waiting lines.
But basically their health outcomes are about the same as ours. If you take as your first cut, Do we live longer? Do we have less morbidity? Do we have less disability? The answer is no. It's about the same.
Medical care is one thing, health is something else. I've been doing research in this field since 1965 and I almost invariably find that the health of people has little to do with the quality or quantity of health care.
There are some areas in the United States that have twice as many physicians per capita as other areas. There is no evidence that that shows up in the health of the population -- none whatsoever.
Some areas in the U.S. have medical schools and some areas don't have medical schools. There is a widespread belief in the academic medical community that the presence of a medical school raises the standard of care -- people are closer to the frontiers of medicine, the doctors there can go to the grand rounds. I don't find any evidence whatsoever that having a medical school in an area produces lower mortality rates. Nor is it true that we're any sicker now from all this managed care and denial of services and so on.
It's also very clear that over time the introduction of some drugs and some medical procedures does improve health. Neonatal intensive care units, the survival of low-birth-weight babies. That's improved enormously, and almost all of it is due to better medical interventions: both better scientific understanding what it takes to keep a 1,000 gram baby alive and the technology to do it.
On the other hand, I don't want to overstate the payoff because medical research has done virtually nothing to lower the incidence of low birth-weight babies.
In the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular area, the combination of a much more aggressive treatment of hypertension and better drugs had a big payoff in lowering deaths from heart attacks and -- probably more important -- in deaths from strokes.
Q. Are you saying that even though some medicine makes a difference, more medical care can't do much to make us more healthy?
A. I'm saying that almost everyone is getting the medical care that matters to health. Adding more care does not make much difference. The stuff that's really effective, the antibiotics, the appendectomies and so forth -- people get them. Health depends much more on the things we do to and for ourselves or that we don't do.
It depends on cigarette smoking, it depends on obesity, it depends on certain environmental conditions.
Q. So if more medical care does not make us healthier, what should we do to improve our health?
A. Improved health will come about through changes in the physical and psychosocial environments and in individual behavior and in medical advances, not in increasing the quantity of medical care at a given point in time.

HEADLINE: U.S. Factory Index Rose Again in April

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Manufacturers registered further growth in April, though at a slightly slower pace than the month before, while the increase in prices for raw material also moderated.
Yet the figures released yesterday by the National Association of Purchasing Management, along with a separate government report of a surprising rise in construction spending in March, paint a picture of such a strong economy that Federal Reserve policy makers might feel required to raise interest rates more aggressively when they meet later this month, economists said. 
 The purchasing managers' group said its manufacturing index, based on a national survey of executives who buy raw material for industries, registered 54.9 in April, weaker than the 55.8 reported for March and the lowest since a reading of 54.4 last August. The April figure was below the 55.5 that Wall Street analysts had expected.
Still, any reading above 50 indicates growth, and the purchasing managers' index has been above that level for 15 consecutive months.
The index is the first national reading for April on the performance of manufacturing, still a crucial sector of the economy.
The price index remained high at 76 in April but was down from a spike to 79.8 the month before.
In the other report, the Commerce Department said yesterday that construction spending rose by a surprisingly strong 1.4 percent in March, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of $765.2 billion. It was the third consecutive monthly increase, a result largely of spending on big government projects, the department said.
Analysts had forecast that construction spending would be unchanged or even decline.
The persistent strength in manufacturing and construction, along with other recent reports showing rises in consumer prices and workers' salaries, were cited by several economists as evidence that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates more steeply than the quarter-percent increases made before.
Kathleen Camilli, director of economic research for the investment firm Tucker Anthony in New York, said the latest reports indicated that "the economy is growing at an overly robust pace." She expects an increase of half a percentage point when the Fed meets on May 16.

HEADLINE: In Pittsburgh, a Redevelopment Too Far?

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, April 25

 BODY:
There have been so many blockbuster redevelopment projects in this gritty, resilient city in the past six years that a corner of Mayor Thomas Murphy's office is cluttered with ceremonial shovels that gleam with his dig-we-must determination.
Still missing from that proud display, however, is the groundbreaker spade for one of the mayor's most controversial ideas: a plan to raze or gut 61 buildings and displace up to 125 businesses in one fell swoop through the tattered old retail core of downtown Pittsburgh. In their place, Mr. Murphy envisions an ambitious cluster of trendy restaurants, upscale national stores and underground parking for 1,000 cars to serve surrounding office towers and perchance lure affluent suburban shoppers back to their urban roots. 
 It is such a sweeping plan that, even beyond the cries of outrage from longtime merchants still able to make a profit in Market Place, the area in question, Mayor Murphy has drawn no less an adversary than the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which calls the plan "one of the most wrongheaded revitalization proposals to appear anywhere in this country in the last 30 years."
Such is the warning of Richard Moe, president of the trust, which is based in Washington and is the nation's largest private preservation organization. Mr. Moe calls the Pittsburgh plan a "reversion to the worst of urban renewal in the 60's and 70's," when whole neighborhoods were swept away.
"It's an anomaly," Mr. Moe said, describing how the national trend in most other cities is to selectively revitalize and showcase time-worn neighborhoods, rather than to replace them wholesale.
From LoDo in Denver to South Beach in Miami, from the Lowerton district of St. Paul to the Seventh Street renewal in Washington, preservationists are citing dozens of less sweeping, more selective renovation programs across the country as profitable success stories that Pittsburgh would be wiser to emulate. But the mayor insists he needs something fast and singular, on the scale of the Copley Plaza renewal in Boston, to save downtown Pittsburgh.
For all the opposition here and beyond, Mayor Murphy offers a smile of resolve and an encyclopedic accounting of the city's hard-earned recovery since the catastrophic collapse of its steel mill economy a generation ago. In $4 billion worth of current projects, he cites two new ballparks, a new convention center and hotels, office complexes offering 6,000 new jobs and a dozen other projects. The weary-looking Market Place stretch, he insists, is "the hole in the doughnut" that absolutely must be redone to make the urban whole palatable to investors.
"In virtually everything we've done, from building ballparks to dealing with old industrial properties, we have faced enormous resistance," the mayor said, looking beyond his office shovels at a master-plan map vivid with splotches of large-scale change. "Every one of these has been a struggle; it's the nature of changing."
To critics demanding a more tempered approach, Mr. Murphy, a 56-year-old son of a steelworker who rose from the nitty-gritty of civic politics to wield mayoral power, replies that the city has well employed the selective "Main Street" style of renewing building by building in other old neighborhoods. But the Market Place area, he insists, requires something more extensive and faster -- a single project of urban renewal that he wants completed in two to three years rather than 10.
"The urgency we feel," the mayor emphasized, is rooted in the region's steady loss of residents for 30 years, with the city fighting to secure a more eclectic future as its population fades to 350,000, half its old blue-collar peak.
Across the executive corridor, City Councilman Jim Ferlo exults no less in the city's resurgent pattern of fresh development. But he draws the line at the mayor's Market Place proposal, viewing it as ultimately more arrogant than ambitious.
"Retailers there have been paying their tax bills for a hundred years, and suddenly they're blights on the city?" said Mr. Ferlo, a Democrat like the mayor in this one-party city.
The councilman complains that some of those very taxes would subsidize the arrival of national chains that would then enjoy a monopoly position in the $480-million redevelopment, which would cover about five acres radiating from Fifth and Forbes Avenues. Mayor Murphy says the plan would involve $53 million in city subsidies, but opponents estimate it would be twice that.
Like most other opponents, Mr. Ferlo agrees that a stylish but far more measured upgrading is badly needed in the area. It now presents a tired mix of seedy novelty shops and respected longtime merchants like the 130-year-old Original Oyster House, one of several establishments that would be exempted from removal under the mayor's plan.
But Gabriel's shoe repair around the corner would have to go, as would other humbler shops revered by neighborhood regulars like Bernie Lynch, a volunteer leader of the fight against Mr. Murphy's plan.
"They'd destroy a real historic district to build a pretend historic district," said Ms. Lynch, strolling the neighborhood and savoring her first-name familiarity with merchants.
"The mayor is offering a leasing agent's dream and a city's nightmare," she said, adding that the Institute for Justice in Washington was already preparing a lawsuit for the local owners who would be displaced by national competitors.
The mayor denies Ms. Lynch's contention that the project would be a thinly disguised mall. He said the neighborhood's three-story scale would be retained, and up to 20 existing building facades. But opponents say the character of one of the city's oldest neighborhoods would be lost.
The opposition, coalescing as the Golden Triangle Community Development Corporation, has offered a $256 million counterproposal to rehabilitate facades and modernize the area's dilapidated upper floors for business and housing. Mayor Murphy, trying to finesse the five votes he needs on the nine-member City Council, recently added some housing to his plan.
The outcome remains uncertain, with the proposal not yet formally submitted and some Council members underlining the failure of an earlier mayoral initiative, the construction of a Lazarus department store two years ago. It was built downtown with $48 million in public subsidies and a guarantee to pay no city rent until it reaches $41 million in annual sales, a level it has thus far failed to approach.
Down at ground zero, Patty Maloney, a local card store merchant on Wood Street, offered hearty laughter at the mayor's promise to help relocate the scores of displaced retailers to within a 10-minute walk of Market Place. As president of the Golden Triangle association, Ms. Maloney said she had found only 30 open retail spots for all the displaced, none comparable to what she had now.
"The thing is we own this building, picked the location, took the risk and built this business up -- we did everything we were supposed to do," she said, asking how a conglomerate of upscale newcomers given a monopoly franchise could match that investment in the city and its people.
"The chains can't do the things local businesses can do in the neighborhood," Ms. Maloney asserted, denying the mayor's complaint that merchants have let the area drift downward for decades.
"Young people aren't leaving this city because there's no Banana Republic, no Pottery Barn downtown," Ms. Maloney argued, emphasizing the need for high-tech jobs that she said could be invited by creating office space above existing shops.
But it is this very need for jobs that Mayor Murphy insists can only be solved by the image of a fresh Pittsburgh renewed at its very heart.
"We have to create a scale of development that changes the dynamic of downtown," he said, warning against the alternative of incremental change. "We need to move more quickly," he added, at once treasuring and regretting what he described as the city's small-town resistance to change.
"There's an old joke we have about ourselves in Pittsburgh," the mayor said. "It goes: If the world ends, you want to be living in Pittsburgh because you'll have 10 more years to live."

HEADLINE: May Day Is Marked With Demonstrations On Right and Left

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, May 1

 BODY:
Anti-capitalist protesters clashed with the police today in central London, tearing down the golden arches of a McDonald's and spray-painting a hammer and sickle on a statue of Winston Churchill in a May Day protest.
In Berlin, a march against "capitalism and imperialism" this evening erupted into violence in the Kreuzberg neighborhood, a stronghold of leftist activism. More than 100 police officers were injured as they used water cannons, tear gas and nightsticks against a crowd of 10,000 anarchists. At least three dozen leftists were arrested. 
 Elsewhere in Europe, the workers who are usually commemorated on May Day took a back seat to the far right, as neo-Nazis rallied in German cities and nationalist parties demonstrated in France.
In Paris, about 3,000 members of the far-right National Front party marched to the Opera behind a woman on horseback dressed as Joan of Arc, whom France's anti-immigration party has adopted as its patron saint.
Labor unions and mainstream leftist parties in Europe also used the day to stage peaceful street rallies. Tens of thousands gathered in Madrid and some 15,000 demonstrated in Istanbul.
Russia's May Day celebrations were a mere shadow of the Soviet-orchestrated extravaganzas. Only about 15,000 people in Moscow joined a non-Communist trade union march. Most Russians took the opportunity to go to the country.
In South America's largest city, Sao Paulo, Brazil, hundreds of thousands of people gathered to protest low wages and high unemployment. Some 20,000 workers, students and leftist activists marched through Ecuador's capital, Quito, protesting the government's plans to adopt the United States dollar as the official currency.
In China, most people had the day off and visited friends and relatives. Three thousand people designated "model workers" by the government attended a flag-raising ceremony in Tiananmen Square in Beijing.

HEADLINE: Administration Forecasts Larger Reduction of the National Debt

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
The Clinton administration said today that the federal government expected to pay off substantially more of the national debt this year than previously projected.
In a statement, President Clinton said the federal government intended to pay off $216 billion in debt during the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, or 6.2 percent of the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public. 
 In February, the administration projected that it would pay off $167 billion this year.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said in a news conference at the White House today that the larger reduction was the result of the strong economy generating higher than expected tax revenues.
Mr. Summers said there had been a surge in payments for 1999 tax liabilities made around the April 15 filing deadline and in corporate and individual tax payments so far in 2000.
By the end of the fiscal year, he said, the government will have paid off $350 billion in debt since fiscal year 1998, reflecting the shift from decades of federal budget deficits to large and growing surpluses.
Mr. Summers said debt reduction in April, May and June, the three months in which the government typically takes in the most money, should total $185 billion, up from $114 billion in the same period last year.
"I think what we can take satisfaction in is that as a country we are not just making continued progress in reducing our national debt, but we are making progress at an accelerated pace," he said.
The Treasury Department is reducing the debt by rebuying bonds and other securities it has issued and by not renewing others on maturity.
Administration officials used the news to strengthen their claim to being a force for fiscal prudence and the guardian of economic expansion. They sought to contrast their focus on debt reduction to calls from Republicans, who have a majority in Congress, and from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, for big tax cuts.
"We should not jeopardize the longest economic expansion in history with risky tax cuts that threaten our fiscal discipline," Mr. Clinton said.
Republicans said that they, not the administration, deserved credit for putting the government back in the black and that only by returning the surplus to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts could they stop Democrats from spending the surplus.
Republicans said that by keeping increases in government spending in check, there would be plenty of money for sizable tax cuts and for debt reduction.
Mr. Summers said the administration had not yet calculated a new surplus estimate for the fiscal year. In February, the administration estimated that the total surplus this year would be $179 billion, including $148 billion from excess Social Security payroll tax revenues.
Today's figures suggested that the surplus would be tens of billions of dollars higher than projected -- an improvement that would probably ripple into the surplus projection for next year, giving Congress a bigger pool of money as it turns this week to writing the spending bills that would finance the government's operations in 2001.

HEADLINE: US Airways Flight Attendants Ratify Pact

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The union representing flight attendants at US Airways Group said yesterday that its members had voted to adopt a new labor contract that when first agreed to in March, ended a tense standoff that had threatened to shut down US Airways, the No. 6 airline in the United States.
More than 78 percent of the 6,926 acceptable ballots returned were in favor of the five-year deal, which includes immediate 5 percent pay raises and 5 percent signing bonuses, plus 6 percent more in incremental raises over time. The Association of Flight Attendants represents about 10,000 flight attendants at US Airways, which is based in Arlington, Va. 
 US Airways said yesterday that it welcomed the approval, which left it with contracts with all major labor groups, as it tries to carry out an operational turnaround.
The contract does not contain parity review provisions, which are in the contracts with other labor groups and which the airline had originally pushed for in this contract.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Unveils Some Tactics It Will Use to Fight Breakup Plan

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY and STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Fighting to defeat the government's proposal to break the company in two, Microsoft plans to ask the trial judge next week for broad authority to obtain hundreds of pages of government records on the case, and for permission to summon witnesses to argue that the proposal is unwarranted and out of bounds.
"Their extreme request for relief invites questions on how they came to the observations and conclusions in their declaration," William H. Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, said yesterday. 
 The effort could take many months, going "well into the fall," Mr. Neukom said. Government officials called the company's action simply a stalling tactic, possibly intended to delay the ruling until the next administration took office. Microsoft denied that intent, and outside experts noted that the company might not gain any particular advantage from a delay.
If a new administration were more sympathetic to Microsoft, it could in theory settle or drop the federal case at any time -- even if an appeal were before the Supreme Court. But the case brought by the 19 state attorneys general who are the Justice Department's partners in the case would remain active. The attorneys general have repeatedly said they would persevere no matter what the Justice Department did.
Microsoft says it has lobbied both likely presidential nominees, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, to influence their views of the case and to counter lobbying by its competitors. Mr. Bush has made a few unspecific comments about the case sympathetic to Microsoft, while Mr. Gore has declined to discuss it.
The Justice Department and 17 of the state attorneys general filed their remedy request with the court in Washington on Friday. It asked Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to split the company in two. One company would hold the Windows operating system and the other Microsoft's application programs. The proposal would also impose a range of restrictions on conduct while the breakup is carried out. Two states declined to join in the proposal.
Microsoft is to file its response by May 10, and will make its formal request for the information and witness testimony. The government says gathering the information can be done in two or three weeks. But while Mr. Neukom said Microsoft earnestly wanted to move the case to the Court of Appeals as soon as possible, he said Microsoft still would need the extra time.
Of the Microsoft request for discovery, one person close to the government's case said, "If a person is convicted of bank robbery, does he have the right to find out how the prosecutor came up with his sentence?"
Microsoft's stock took a beating last week after the government's intention to seek a breakup was reported. But yesterday, in the first trading session since the government plan was formally submitted, the stock rose $3.6875, closing at $73.4375.
The judge is not obligated to accept Microsoft's request. Judge Jackson has said he wants to complete the remedy phase quickly. Microsoft made a similar request for months of delay to prepare for the opening of the trial two years ago and Judge Jackson rejected it.
The Microsoft request for more information and for witnesses is just one of the company's tactics in fending off a possible breakup. For example, Microsoft has asserted that the government proposal made expansive claims for the increased competition it says would come from a breakup. Company lawyers call that sheer speculation and Microsoft further says the government ignored the efficiency benefits that come from having one corporation making both Windows and office applications that work within that operating system.
Robert E. Hall, an economist at Stanford University who advised the Justice Department on an earlier Microsoft case, predicts that the company's lawyers will investigate that issue in court.
While the proposal is to break the company up, he said the economics were similar to those of two companies in adjacent markets that had merged. And the Justice Department's own guidelines, Mr. Hall notes, call for the government to give relatively more weight to efficiencies in such mergers.
"There's a thoughtless neglect of efficiencies in the government's analysis, and I think that will be an attractive target for Microsoft," Mr. Hall said.
For its part, Microsoft already argues that the government's breakup proposal would make it far more difficult, if not impossible, for the company to develop innovative products that result from putting together a wide range of software technologies.
For example, Microsoft's Pocket PC software for handheld computers combines Windows software and technology of the Microsoft suite of business applications called Office in one product. Similarly, its planned computer game product, the X-box, to go on sale next year in competition with Sony, Nintendo and Sega, uses technology from both Microsoft's operating systems and applications divisions.
But a government official said nothing would prevent the two new companies resulting from a breakup from collaborating on a product in most circumstances, though the proposal does include specific anticollusion provisions.
The government's plan says the company's software tools programs, used to create other programs, would go to the applications company -- even the developers making tools for Windows. That might seem to be an inefficient step, but it may not be the wayward move it seems, according to some computer experts.
Prof. Michael Cusumano at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, co-author of "Microsoft Secrets," said there was already a lively market for makers of Windows development tools. Though skeptical that the government proposal would bring much new competition, Mr. Cusumano was also unconvinced by some of Microsoft's arguments that the software industry would suffer from lost efficiency.
"There will be enormous incentives for the two companies to work together," he said.
Along with those arguments, Brad Smith, deputy general counsel for Microsoft, has extensively researched previous antitrust cases and said none of them offers a clear parallel.
In Friday's proposal, and in public statements since then, Justice Department officials pointed to the breakup of AT&T as a precedent. But Mr. Smith argued today that the precedent was two sided.
While AT&T was broken up as part of a settlement in 1984, the government also lifted decades of regulations that had controlled AT&T's business practices. "And it was that antiregulatory aspect of the decree that allowed AT&T enter new markets and grow," Mr. Smith said, "while this proposal puts into place many regulatory restrictions on our behavior."
A government official noted, however, that some new regulations were also imposed on AT&T and its former subsidiaries in 1984, many of which remain in place today.
Mr. Neukom also pointed to another piece of research from Mr. Smith's work. "Never," he said, "has there been a litigated antitrust case at the end of which a federal court has been asked to order the divestiture" of part of a unified company.
In all of the previous cases, he and Mr. Smith said, the government split up a company along clear divisional lines -- AT&T and its local phone companies, Paramount Pictures and its chain of movie theaters.
Microsoft, in contrast, is a single company with different products but less clear internal divisions. The government asserts, however, that the proposed split falls across a clear divisional line at Microsoft.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
All Is Calm on Wall Street As Big Gauges Move Ahead

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Stock prices moved broadly higher yesterday in a session that lacked the volatile swings that characterized so many trading days in April.
Major market gauges were up from the start. The gains included technology, led by Microsoft; financial service stocks; major retailers like Wal-Mart Stores; and biotechnology stocks. 
 "It was a nice, consistent performance," said Michael Clark, head of United States stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. "It was different from what we have seen in the recent past."
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 77.87 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,811.78. Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Wal-Mart led the advance in the blue-chip index.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 15.82 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,468.25. Gains in Cisco Systems, Nortel, EMC and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter helped to fuel the gain.
The Nasdaq composite index continued an advance that began in earnest last week. It rose 97.42 points, or 2.5 percent, to 3,958.08. The index is now down just 2.7 percent for the year. But it is 22 percent below its record high of 5,048.62, set March 10.
Phil Roth, chief technical market analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said the Nasdaq may now be poised to improve. "The market for Nasdaq stocks made a climactic low in mid-April, tested it in late April and is now in an interim recovery that could continue into the summer," he said.
"But I think this is a temporary recovery in Nasdaq, and that most investors who are overexposed in technology should look for exit points."
Small stocks had a good day.
The Russell 2000 index rose 12.68 points, or 2.5 percent, to 518.93. The Russell is up 2.8 percent so far this year.
Market breadth was good, but trading volumes were light. On the New York Stock Exchange, nearly two stocks rose in price for each one that lost value.
Volume on the Big Board was 966 million shares. On the Nasdaq stock market 1.47 billion shares changed hands.
Microsoft was strong yesterday. On its first trading day after the Justice Department and 17 states asked a federal judge to split the company in two, the software giant gained 3 11/16 , to 73 7/16 .
Even with yesterday's advance, Microsoft shares are down more than 37 percent so far this year. Some analysts said yesterday they see value in the stock.
Some portfolio managers said, however, Microsoft's stock is likely to remain under a cloud for some time.
"Do I see value in Microsoft?" asked Henry Herrman, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed, which manages about $40 billion in assets. "Sure I see value. But I also see a company that while not comparable to Philip Morris, will not be a technology leader for quite a while."
Other technology stocks that did well included Cisco Systems and the EMC Corporation. Cisco gained 27/64 , to 7 17/16 . And EMC rose 3 3/4, to 142 9/16 .
Biotechnology stocks had a big day. The Nasdaq biotech index rose 5.2 percent.
Among the biggest gainers were Genentech, which jumped 11 1/2, to 129; and Human Genomics Sciences, which rose 12 5/8, to 89 3/16 .
Financial service stocks gained, as investors continued to grapple with how banks and brokerage firms will be affected by further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
Citigroup gained 3/4, to 60 5/16 . J. P. Morgan rose 1 3/8, to 129 3/4. Chase Manhattan climbed 1 5/8, to 73 3/4. And Morgan Stanley Dean Witter closed at 79 3/4, up 3.
Policy Management Systems, a maker of software for insurance and financial service companies, gained 5 3/8, to 18 5/8, after Electronic Data Systems offered to buy the company for $18 to $20 a share in cash.
But Young & Rubicam fell 5 5/8, to 50 1/16 , after WPP Group said over the weekend that it had pulled out of negotiations to buy the company.
Despite the improved tone, Mr. Roth from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said that at some point he expects stocks to fall.
"Old-economy stocks and new- economy stocks will go down together to build a real bottom," he said.
"And you need to see cash build up in equity accounts. Right now, only 4 percent of money in equity mutual fund accounts is in cash, which is the lowest number ever. That implies to me that portfolio managers are wildly optimistic, which by itself is a reason to be cautious."

Treasury Prices Fall
 By Reuters
Treasury bond prices weakened in thin trading yesterday, still defensive after economic data released last week raised fears of higher inflation and underscored the potential for a more aggressive credit tightening by the Federal Reserve later this month.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 12/32 , to 103 21/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.04 percent from 5.96 percent on Friday.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 3-month and 6- month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.540	97.000	High Rate	5.77%	5.93%	Investment Rate	5.94%	6.20%	Low Rate	5.73%	5.80%	Median Rate	5.76%	5.92%	Total applied for	$27,013,089	$22,765,475	Accepted	$13,356,999	$11,660,475	Noncompetitive	$1,417,253	$1,176,154

THE STATES
 
LAST TO HONOR KING
With the signature of Gov. Jim Hodges, South Carolina yesterday became the last state to honor the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with an official holiday. The bill was signed despite protests from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which had opposed the legislation because it also created Confederate Memorial Day on May 10. The organization said two such contrasting ideologies should not be linked. A spokesman for Mr. Hodges said he would have preferred a bill honoring only Dr. King but had to accept the Confederate holiday as the price for passage. The N.A.A.C.P. has also objected to a Senate bill, now before the House, to move the Confederate battle flag from the Capitol dome to a memorial in front of the building. Meanwhile, officials in North Carolina said that despite the furor in South Carolina, a Confederate flag would be over the Capitol in Raleigh on May 10, as is required annually under a legislative decree. The flag also is flown every Jan. 19, Robert E. Lee's birthday. Representative Eva Clayton said the dome was not the proper place for such a flag. David Firestone (NYT) 

BABBITT TO RETURN HOME
There has been considerable speculation in Arizona that once Bruce Babbitt finished his tour as secretary of the interior, he would return to the state to run for governor, a job he held from 1978 to 1986. But Mr. Babbitt said over the weekend that he had other plans. He would return to Arizona, he told The Arizona Republic, but not to run for governor. "I'm out of politics, but I'm back to Arizona," he said. "I'm a little homesick. I want to re-engage as a citizen." He did not say what he planned to do. But he made it clear that he was tired of Washington's "witch-hunting mentality," referring to the 19-month investigation by an independendent counsel into his handling of permits for Indian reservation casinos. He was cleared of any wrongdoing. "Maybe I was the poster child for the repeal of the independent counsel statute," he said.

THE DEMOCRATS
 
RUBIN PLAYS DOWN SPOT ON TICKET
Former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, one of many prominent Democrats mentioned as a potential running mate for Vice President Al Gore, seemed to reject the idea yesterday, calling it "a curious notion." Discussing economic policy and what he saw as key issues in the campaign, Mr. Rubin said that while he has been around politics for many years, including a stint as a Democratic fund-raiser, he viewed running for and serving in office as a special field, "something unto itself." Mr. Rubin suggested that it was unwise to choose a nominee who had not been tested by other campaigns. "I have never run for office," he said. "You don't want somebody in a presidential campaign, which is the ultimate of political experience in this country, who hasn't been tested by running before." Mr. Rubin spoke on Political Points, the Webcast of The New York Times and ABC News. (NYT)
 
THE GREENS
 
NADER COURTS AUTO WORKERS
The consumer advocate and Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader discussed an endorsement yesterday with leaders of the United Automobile Workers in Detroit. Mr. Nader said that he did not directly ask for an endorsement and that the union would not endorse a candidate until after a Congressional vote, scheduled for late May, on establishing permanent normal trade relations with China. Mr. Nader, the auto workers and other major unions oppose the bill. Instead of asking for endorsements, Mr. Nader said: "I just tell people what we're doing." Union officials were unavailable for comment. The union, which has criticized President Clinton's trade policies, broke with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in October, when the labor federation endorsed Vice President Al Gore. (AP)

HEADLINE: Pham Van Dong, Voice of Vietnam's Revolt, Dies at 94

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

 BODY:
Pham Van Dong, who led the Vietnamese Communists' delegation to the Geneva peace talks in 1954 that ended the French war in Indochina and then served as Hanoi's prime minister for three decades, died a day before the 25th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, The Associated Press reported from Vietnam yesterday. He was 94.
Mr. Dong, who has sometimes been compared to China's late Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, a charming but tough diplomat and bureaucrat who politely played a secondary role to his country's chief Communist leader, had been hospitalized on life support for months before his death on Saturday, officials told The Associated Press. 
 The officials said that Mr. Dong died at a Hanoi hospital, and that a state funeral is planned for Friday.
Mr. Dong was one of the early revolutionaries who joined Ho Chi Minh to found the Viet Minh, was imprisoned by the French colonial regime, helped defeat both the French and the Americans and later reunified Vietnam under Communist rule on April 30, 1975.
He became premier of North Vietnam after independence from the French in 1954 and headed the government of all Vietnam from 1976 to 1987. He remained a fiercely loyal Communist, but he acknowledged to an American journalist and author, Stanley Karnow, in 1981, that rebuilding Vietnam after decades of war was more difficult than anticipated.
"Yes, we defeated the United States. But now we are plagued with problems," Mr. Karnow quoted Mr. Dong as saying in his book, "Vietnam: A History" (Viking, 1983). "We do not have enough to eat. We are a poor, undeveloped nation. Vous savez, waging a war is simple, but running a country is difficult."
In retirement, Mr. Dong was a government adviser but he still warned in speeches about the dangers of economic reforms. In his final years he was increasingly frail and nearly blind.
Mr. Dong was born March 1, 1906, in Quang Ngai province, then part of the French protectorate of Annam in the central part of Vietnam. His father was a member of the elite Mandarin class and a private secretary to one of Vietnam's last emperors.
Like a number of other privileged young Vietnamese his age, he learned nationalism in his youth at the prestigious Lycee Quoc Hoc, in Hue, the old imperial capital of Vietnam. A turning point in Mr. Dong's life came in 1925 when he joined a student strike in Hanoi, and then had to flee to China when it was put down by the French. Ho Chi Minh was organizing a covert opposition in southern China, and Mr. Dong joined his Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth Association, learning the precepts of Marxism and the skills of Leninist party organization.
In 1929, Mr. Dong returned to Vietnam to organize Communist cells, but was soon caught by the French and sent to the dreaded prison island of Poulo Condore in the South China Sea where he was confined for seven years. The experience only made him a more committed Communist, and after his release he resumed his underground organizing in Hanoi.
In 1939, following another failed uprising, Mr. Dong fled to south China again and joined his mentor, Ho, who had established a guerrilla base there, recruiting and training soldiers and cadres to cross into northern Vietnam.
In 1941, Mr. Dong became a founding member of the Viet Minh, a nationalist organization whose domination by the Communists was disguised to draw in a wide variety of patriotic Vietnamese disgruntled by French rule. Only later would Ho and Mr. Dong and other Communist leaders acknowledge their true purpose. In 1960, after their victory over the French, Mr. Dong said, "In our country, to be a patriot means to love socialism. Patriotism is closely linked with socialism and the Communist is the most genuine patriot."
At the end of World War II in August 1945, as the French were trying to re-establish control of their colony in Vietnam, the Viet Minh formed a provisional government with Mr. Dong as finance minister and Ho as president. Open fighting between the returning French and the Viet Minh soon broke out, the beginning of 30 years of war.
Mr. Dong journeyed with Ho to Paris in 1946 for peace talks, trying to gain independence, but when the talks broke down, full scale fighting resumed, with the Americans aiding the French and the Chinese Communists helping the Viet Minh.
At the war's end in 1954, after the French were badly defeated at the battle of Dien Bien Phu, Mr. Dong was chosen to head the Viet Minh delegation to the Geneva conference. It should have been a moment of complete triumph for Mr. Dong, but he felt betrayed by Zhou, the Chinese premier, who headed China's delegation to the talks and seemed more interested in avoiding further war with the Americans after the Korean War and agreed to divide Vietnam between a Communist north and a non-Communist south.
According to one version, Zhou invited Mr. Dong to a dinner party, but to Mr. Dong's fury, also invited a brother of Ngo Dinh Diem, a Catholic anti-Communist who went on to become the leader of South Vietnam. Mr. Diem's brother was seated in the place of honor at Zhou's left, and Mr. Dong overheard the two men talking about their love of China's Qing Dynansty porcelain.
"When you are the envoy to Beijing," Mr. Zhou is quoted as saying to Mr. Diem's brother, "I hope you will see more of Qing ceramics." To Mr. Dong, this clearly implied that not only would China agree to the division of Vietnam, which would cost the Viet Minh half their victory, but that China would recognize the newly created government in South Vietnam.
This was the beginning of a terrible feud between the Vietnamese and Chinese Communists which lingered through the American war in Vietnam, unknown to Washington, and which burst into the open in 1979 when China invaded the northern part of Vietnam. Many historians say that if America's leaders had been more knowledgeable, they would not have asserted that the United States had to fight in Vietnam to stop the Chinese Communists. That was one of the primary reasons invoked by Washington for becoming involved in Vietnam.

HEADLINE: Albany Battles Acid Rain Fed By Other States

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 1

 BODY:
The New York State Legislature today completed passage of a bill that seeks to reduce the amount of air pollution that drifts into New York from coal-burning power plants in Midwestern and Southern states.
The measure would stop New York companies from keeping the money they make by selling pollution credits, earned by cleaning their own smokestacks, to major polluters in the Midwest and the South. The credits are now sold on the open market to utilities with older power plants that find it cheaper to buy such credits instead of modernizing their plants and cutting their emissions. 
 The action is the first by a state that directly challenges a major provision in the federal Clean Air Act of 1990: setting up a marketplace in which companies can trade the right to pollute, in the form of credits, as a commodity. Some New York utility companies immediately threatened a court challenge to the new legislation, saying the law could violate constitutional protections for interstate commerce.
It is not clear the degree to which the legislation will reduce pollution and acid rain in New York State, in large part because polluters in the South and the Midwest could turn to other companies in other states to buy their pollution credits. But experts say the legislation will ultimately limit the amount of pollution credits available to polluters in the Midwest and the South and thereby force up the price of such credits.
The federal Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the credit program, said it supported New York's attempt to regulate pollution credit trading by companies within its own borders.
Kim Rubey, a spokeswoman for the agency, defended the credit trading program. But, she added, "We are also in favor of providing maximum flexibility to states like New York in our common effort to protect public health and the environment."
Federal regulations permit a company that cuts pollution below federal levels to sell credits it has earned to a company unable or unwilling to meet those federal emission levels. The goal is to reward companies that reduce their toxic emissions below the federal standard, while forcing companies that exceed the standard to buy the right to continue polluting.
Over all, the free-market approach has resulted in cleaner air nationwide. But there has been a glaring glitch, according to environmental experts. Major polluters in the South and the Middle West have found it cheaper to buy pollution credits instead of cutting toxic emissions that have blown downwind into New York and contributed to the state's acid rain problem.
The legislation adopted today is intended to help correct that problem, essentially penalizing power companies in New York when they sell pollution credits to coal-burning power plants in the Midwest and in the South, whose pollution is a major cause of acid rain in the state.
The measure essentially calls for the state to seize all proceeds that a utility would receive from such polluters as part of a transaction for pollution credits. The bill allows state regulators to impose a fine equal to the amount of such a sale; the fine would be used to promote development and use of nonpolluting energy sources like solar power.
John F. Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council, an environmental group, said the measure could help protect regions of the state that have been ravaged by acid rain, most notably tracts of wilderness in the Adirondacks. He said government studies estimated that in fewer than 40 years, half of that region's nearly 3,000 lakes and ponds would be too acidic to sustain the fish and plants that now live in them if the acid rain problem continued unabated.
"It makes no sense for New York to clean up its own smokestacks and then hand the right to pollute to its neighbors," said Mr. Sheehan, whose group played a major role in pushing the bill through the Legislature. "This legislation puts an end to New York's squandering of the benefits of its own responsible actions toward clean air."
The measure drew harsh rebukes from representatives of the state's powerful utility industry, who said it potentially violated the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution prohibiting states from enacting laws that restrict trade outside their borders. Proponents of the measure say companies still have the ability to sell credits to whomever they want but run the risk of incurring penalties when the credits go to out-of-state companies that contribute to New York's acid rain problem.
Carol E. Murphy, executive director of Independent Power Producers of New York, said she expected utility companies to sue the state over the measure. "Either you have a national trading program or you don't," she said. "I haven't talked to anybody who doesn't think this law is unconstitutional."
In all, New York utility companies have sold roughly 700,000 credits between 1995 and 1998 to polluters in the other states, according to a recent report issued by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The credits now cost about $140 each and allow polluters to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide, a major contributor to acid rain and smog. New York's pollution credits account for roughly 4 percent of all the sulfur dioxide emitted in the United States, government and private estimates indicate.
The bill was passed by the Republican-controlled State Senate by a 59-to-0 vote early this afternoon. The Assembly, which has a Democratic majority, passed the bill by a 129-to-15 vote earlier this year. The measure now goes to Gov. George E. Pataki. He has expressed support for such legislation in the past, but aides said today that he wanted to review the measure carefully.
Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat who is the bill's primary author in the Assembly, said the measure did not diminish the need for federal legislation that would force plants in the Midwest and the South to reduce pollution that caused acid rain in New York. "The legislation we passed is self-help for New York," he said. "But it also focuses attention on the need for the Congress to meet us halfway by stopping other states from dumping on us."
Carl L. Marcellino, a Republican who is the legislation's main sponsor in the State Senate, said the state's action should send a message to Washington that the current system had allowed utilities in regions like the Midwest to burn high-sulfur coal at the expense of states like New York. "At the very least, I believe this legislation will force Congress into action and ultimately require the federal government to reduce acid rain," he said.
The pollution credit trading system was approved by Congress at the urging of economists and some environmentalists, who said it would bring about pollution reduction with the least amount of government intervention and the most efficiency. The act gave New York utilities a windfall of pollution credits because a New York State law had forced those companies to cut emissions in the 1980's to levels below what the federal law requires.
The legislation adopted today seeks to prohibit power companies from selling their pollution credits to companies in 10 Southern and Midwestern states by providing for fines against utilities making such sales. Those states are Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana and Wisconsin. It also prohibits sales to four neighboring states: New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware.

Leafs Carry The Beacon For Canada

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.

 BODY:
THE Toronto Maple Leafs have their own burden of failure, their personal cross to bear, without taking on an entire country's as well. Thirty-three years without a Stanley Cup or even a trip to the finals is well along the road to other droughts of lore, but there can be no getting around the inescapable and nationalistic truth.
The drying-out of Canada as a once bottomless well of National Hockey League champions illuminates the Leafs as the last team from north of the border not to go south before the second round of the playoffs. 
 This is not to confuse Edmonton and Ottawa, the only other qualifying Canadian teams this season, with those erstwhile outfits from Winnipeg and Quebec that have actually emigrated deep into Nielsen Land, or any others trying to resist the bottom-line urge. But those teams are also part of the wagon-train reality of N.H.L. 2000, the slow and sad expatriation of the Canadian game.
"Sure, there is a more nationalistic approach around us because the economics have affected the ability of the Canadian teams to compete," said Pat Quinn, the Maple Leafs' coach, before the Devils wasted his team, 5-1, last night at Continental Arena in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals the Devils now lead, 2-1. "You just hope your players don't feel it."
It's doubtful the Leafs are feeling anything more than the frustration of the Devils shutting them out for five straight periods, or until it didn't matter last night. While there was no trademark contrast of styles on a night the Devils opened up and embarrassed Toronto at its own game, there remains the obvious polarity of what and whom these franchises represent.
If, as Quinn contended, the Leafs are as important to English-speaking Canada as the Yankees are to baseball-worshiping America, then this particular series symbolically boils down to Canadian Yankees versus YankeeNets, the pride of a nation against the identity-challenged, sellout-deprived boys from the 'burbs. It is another battle in the failing holy war to prevent the sport from being ripped from its roots, for the sake of better arena and television deals.
If the Leafs don't rally, this will be the seventh consecutive year that the Stanley Cup has not spent the off-season on Canadian soil, a record. The six years from 1936 to 1941 matches the current streak, one obliterated by Canada's domination between 1956 and 1990, when it captured 26 of 35 cups.
Summers up north have been getting colder and drier, with nothing to drink from. After Montreal won in 1993, Quinn's Vancouver Canucks became the last Canadian team of the decade to reach the finals, in 1994.
"Interest does wane," Quinn said, describing the malaise that overtakes Canada as it watches the playoffs sink deeper into America's Sun Belt. It's as if the Expos were playing the Blue Jays every October, and if no radical restructuring of the game's finances is done, Quinn agreed the possibility exists that Toronto and Montreal, the original Canadian two, could eventually be the only two left.
In Vancouver, the 1994 run to Game 7 in Madison Square Garden already feels as dated as it does in New York (for different reasons). "They've had staggering losses over the last two years," Quinn said. "What can you do? The players get a disproportionate share of the money. It's not their fault. We give it to them."
With more Americans and Europeans in the N.H.L., there is less sentiment for smaller Canadian markets. Even Garry Valk, the Leafs left wing who grew up in Edmonton and deplores the negativism he hears every summer at home in Vancouver, said he doubts many Canadian players would resent more teams relocating to the States.
The players have become conditioned by the owners and the league marketing gurus who pose as front-office visionaries and measure the soul of a sport by the dollar it turns.
"You can't compare what Calgary can offer to what an Anaheim can," Valk said. "It's that way in baseball, and it's that way in hockey."
For what it's worth, Valk and Tie Domi said they and their teammates pulled for Montreal and Vancouver as those teams made unsuccessful late-season playoff runs. "You want to see as many Canadian teams as possible because they need the postseason revenue," Valk said. "It's good for hockey."
Unfortunately, what players root for bears little consequence to what they'll sign for. American cities with little hockey orientation have greater revenue potential, foretelling a day when Canada's string of cup-less years could be as long as the Leafs'.

HEADLINE: Deal Places Mohawk Casino At Kutsher's In the Catskills

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
In another round of billion-dollar poker involving a proposed casino for the Catskills, the world's largest gambling company announced yesterday that it had signed an option to buy Kutsher's Country Club, the oldest resort in the Catskills, to create a 1,400-acre entertainment complex and gambling hall that would be owned by the St. Regis Mohawks tribe.
The resort would sit on Anawana Lake in Sullivan County, five miles north of the site at Monticello Raceway that federal officials approved last month, after a four-year-long application for a $500 million casino and entertainment complex for the Mohawks. 
 But the leaders of the Mohawk tribe recently abandoned that plan and signed an unusual agreement with Park Place Entertainment, which owns 28 gambling operations in New Jersey, Nevada, Mississippi and overseas. The agreement grants Park Place the right to develop and manage Mohawk casinos throughout New York.
That new agreement is being viewed with increasing skepticism by political and governmental officials who helped gain support for the original plan.
The announcement yesterday by Park Place appears to be another attempt to outmaneuver the tribe's original partners in Monticello, Catskill Development, and seize control of a project that the developer estimates could generate more than $1 billion a year. Some gambling analysts doubt that Park Place truly wants a hall in Monticello that would undercut its three casinos in Atlantic City. The company said yesterday that it would build a resort hotel with up to 2,000 rooms in addition to the casino. The project would rival the Foxwoods casino in Connecticut and employ 4,500 people in a county whose resort industry has been slowly dying for 30 years.
"We intend to build a destination resort on the site of Kutsher's," said Clive Cummis, general counsel for Park Place. "We'll build a hotel and casino, upgrade the golf course. This would be a giant step forward in the rebirth of Sullivan County."
Mr. Cummis said Park Place believed it would inherit the federal approval granted to the original Mohawk project and proceed quickly, but officials at the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the National Indian Gaming Commission, which oversees management contracts between casino operators and tribes, said the company would have to file a new application for Kutsher's, a process that could take two to four years. Kutsher's resort was built in 1907.
For that reason, Senators Charles E. Schumer and Daniel K. Inouye and other supporters of the tribal casino were bewildered by the tribe's sudden alliance with Park Place, just when the long-sought Monticello Raceway casino seemed assured. They had supported Catskill Development's plan to put 30 acres in trust for the tribe under a seldom-used provision of federal law. The trust would establish a sovereign Indian territory for a gambling hall and bypass New York's prohibition on casinos.
"I was surprised and not prepared for this sudden change," said Senator Inouye, vice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "I am certain that those of us who have been trying to assist the St. Regis Mohawk tribe would like to hear directly from them about what has happened, or is happening."
Local officials in Sullivan County told four Mohawk chiefs at a meeting Friday night at the Town Hall in Thompson, Sullivan County, that they would not look kindly on a casino at Kutsher's, or a delay in the county's long-awaited casino project. The chiefs said they wanted to put a casino at the raceway, according to two people who attended the meeting, but were also considering another location, which the two men presumed to be Kutsher's.
"It is extremely important that it be located at the Monticello Raceway," said Anthony P. Cellini, supervisor of the town of Thompson. "If they change locations now, there'll be very little support from local people. Our residents have had this golden carrot dangled in front of them for too long. To delay this for another two to four years is not acceptable."
There is widespread speculation among gambling analysts, Sullivan County officials and some dissident Mohawks that Arthur M. Goldberg, chief executive of Park Place, is intent on delaying and derailing a Sullivan County casino to protect his Atlantic City casinos, which generate 30 percent of the company's profits. Other analysts say that Mr. Goldberg wins whether he gains control of the casino project in Monticello or whether it is delayed, perhaps forever, by regulatory reviews and lawsuits.
Mr. Cummis struck a deal on Friday with Mark Kutsher, the head of the family that owns the country club, under which Park Place agreed to buy 50 acres within 60 days and a five-year option to acquire the remaining 1,350 acres. Park Place, which said it would transfer the 50 acres to the Mohawks, agreed to hire the Kutsher family, as well as its employees, and to continue to use the Kutsher name in some manner.
"Arthur Goldberg is a builder, not a blocker," Mr. Cummis said. "We're going to get this built and done, just as we did with the Paris in Las Vegas, on time and on budget."
The Mohawk chiefs, who did not consult the lawyers they hired to work on gambling ventures before they signed the Park Place deal, granted Park Place broad casino development rights on April 14 in return for a $3 million loan to bolster the tribe's financially crippled Akwesasne Casino at the reservation in Hogansburg, N.Y., and 70 percent of the profits. Fearing problems in Monticello, the tribe turned its back on Catskill Development and made the deal with Park Place, which will almost certainly cause a lawsuit by Catskill Development.
Robert A. Berman, a partner in Catskill Development, has called the Park Place deal "the greatest rip-off of an Indian tribe since the Dutch grabbed Manhattan for $24." If Park Place eventually has a casino in Sullivan County, it may have to strike a deal with Catskill Development, which has vowed never to do so and has begun talks with other tribes for a casino in the area.
The Mohawks have not notified federal officials or Catskill Development that the tribe has abandoned the project at Monticello Raceway.
"I can't imagine that the tribe, or anybody who recognizes how long it takes to get land into trust for gaming, would want to undo four years of work," said Rick Chiff, deputy chief of staff at the National Indian Gaming Commission. "We're proceeding with the Monticello contract because that's the one that's before us and that's the one that's greenlighted."
Many residents of Sullivan County have viewed gambling for decades as a way to revive the county's economy. But a series of efforts to legalize gambling failed, so the major gambling companies, real estate developers and many politicians paid little attention.
In recent years, however, Gov. George E. Pataki has said that he favors Indian casinos in former resort areas like the Catskills and western New York. And then, while federal approval of the casino at the Monticello Raceway was inching forward in Washington last year, real estate developers, who had contributed thousands of dollars to Mr. Pataki and the Republican Party, began snapping up large tracts in Sullivan County for hotel projects.
Mr. Goldberg of Park Place got involved in talks with the tribe last fall, as did the company's consultant, Alfonse M. D'Amato, the former senator. Donald J. Trump and other casino operators in Atlantic City who feared the competition lobbied against the project in Albany, while Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey lobbied vigorously against it in Washington, and, as recently as April 7, he warned that the Mohawks would bring crime to the Catskills and northern New Jersey.
But Mr. Torricelli has had a change of heart. The senator, who is friendly with Mr. Cummis and Mr. Goldberg and has received thousands of dollars in political contributions from executives at the gambling company, said he now recognized that the battle against Indian gambling has been lost.
"I think gaming in Monticello is probably an inevitability," Mr. Torricelli said. "It seems to me that Park Place is offering a good deal."
The emergence of Park Place has made Governor Pataki's next step more uncertain. He had chastised Mr. Torricelli last summer for opposing the New York casino, and both critics and supporters of gambling said that he had seemed to be lining up to approve a Monticello casino.
The role of Park Place "adds to the long list of questions surrounding this whole situation," said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Governor Pataki. "Every day seems to bring another new development."

HEADLINE: AS POLITICAL GIFTS SET A RECORD PACE, SOME STOP GIVING

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
Soft-money donations to the political parties are on a pace to set a record this year, but more and more large corporations have quietly stopped giving them.
In some cases, senior executives say they want to distance themselves from what they describe as the capital's unseemly culture of cash and influence, while others acknowledge that their companies are simply not getting much in return for the money. 
 Thirty-one corporations that in each previous election cycle since 1993-94 contributed at least $100,000 in soft money -- unlimited and largely unregulated gifts to the parties -- have not donated any soft money in the current cycle, covering the last 15 months, according to a computerized study of Federal Election Commission records. The list includes prolific past contributors like Revlon, Advanced Micro Devices, Miramax Films, and Starwood Hotels and Resorts.
None of the 31 companies have made statements announcing an end to their soft-money contributions, and many still make much smaller, federally regulated donations through political action committees. But some executives confirmed, although not for attribution, that their companies had adopted, or were weighing, a permanent ban on writing soft-money checks.
Only a few large companies -- General Motors, Monsanto, AlliedSignal, Time Warner, none of them among the most recent 31 -- have formally announced in recent years that they have sworn off soft money.
Few corporations have followed suit, in at least some cases because they do not want to risk angering legislators in Washington. "There are more and more companies out there who are refusing to give money, but they are not advertising their decision," said Charles E. M. Kolb, president of the Committee for Economic Development, an association of corporate executives fighting for a campaign finance overhaul that would outlaw soft money. "I suspect that there are more and more companies asking themselves if this is really worth it. What's just as interesting, though, is the fact that companies are scared to tell people."
Several executives said their corporations had stopped giving soft money because they had found better use of their resources, like lobbying, contributing to political action committees and acting as hosts for fund-raising events. Others have stopped giving because they believe that soft money plays an unhealthy role in the political process.
While more companies quietly join the ranks of those forgoing soft-money donations, other corporate interests, senior executives and labor unions are redoubling them. Since January 1999, the Democratic and Republican Parties have raised $160.5 million in soft money, according to data compiled last week by the nonpartisan watchdog Common Cause. That was nearly double the $84.6 million in soft money raised by the parties in the first 15 months of the 1996 election cycle. By November, the parties will have raised nearly $500 million in soft money, some experts predict, as against $262 million in the 1996 cycle.
But the addition of 31 companies to the roster of those turning their backs on giving soft money does add muscle to the effort of two organizations of corporate leaders that are pushing for a soft-money ban.
The effort began in 1995, when Jerome Kohlberg, a founder of the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, created Campaign for America to fight for an overhaul of the nation's campaign finance system. Mr. Kohlberg is being assisted by Warren E. Buffett, the acclaimed value investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. Last fall, Campaign for America reported that 121 companies that had given at least $100,000 each in 1994 or 1996 had since stopped contributing soft money.
The other group, Mr. Kolb's Committee for Economic Development, has an even larger number of corporate executives, although not all of them have persuaded their companies to stop giving soft money.
A senior vice president at one company that has stopped giving soft-money donations said that "there was not much benefit" to them, especially inasmuch as membership fees of the parties' most elite donor clubs had jumped to $250,000 from $100,000.
"What happens is by the time you give the base amount to the House Republicans, Senate Republicans, House Democrats and Senate Democrats, it costs the company a total of $60,000 and you find you don't get a lot of action for it," this executive said. "As companies go through cost-cutting measures, it's an expense that is harder to justify."
This executive's company, which stopped giving soft money in late 1998, has since found no negative ramifications in its dealings with lawmakers. "When we were giving $10,000 or $15,000," the officer said, "it was never enough; you are constantly asked for more. The no-money pledge is better than the some-money pledge."
Some longtime fund-raisers and political strategists say they have seen recent signs of what they call "donor fatigue," especially among corporate executives who are bombarded with solicitations for the parties' elite donor clubs and almost weekly black-tie dinners and political retreats at resort hotels. The fund-raisers say the fatigue is the fault of both parties' enormous appetite for soft money.
"Just in the last few weeks, I have had several clients of mine say they are getting out of this soft-money business," said Lanny J. Davis, a lawyer and lobbyist at Patton Boggs.
"Both political parties have gotten so excessive in trying to beat the other in the soft-money hunt," Mr. Davis said. "I'm part of the problem, and I've never seen such disgust with the practice in all my years here. It has reached critical mass."
In past election years, the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee were the most aggressive soft-money solicitors. This year, however, the Senate and House fund-raising committees of each party are also pushing hard to collect big soft-money checks. With the battle for control of Congress intensifying, many donors are being solicited by multiple party committees at the same time, exhausting some supporters.
Other fund-raisers, however, play down the danger of donor exhaustion, noting that more corporations are writing larger checks than ever.
Last week, for example, the Republican National Committee brought in $21.3 million -- the most ever raised in a single event -- at its gala in Washington saluting the party's apparent presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush. The Republicans received six-figure contributions -- and fund-raising assistance -- from Philip Morris, AT&T and the National Rifle Association, all three of which are among the most generous soft-money contributors to the party this year. The Democrats hope to raise a similar amount at a tribute to President Clinton later this month.
One longtime Republican lobbyist predicted that more corporations would shun soft-money giving if they learned that competitors were doing the same. "I think we are going to see a rush to the exit, if not a stampede," the lobbyist said. "People are beginning to say it does not make sense in the context of our budgeting and our giving."
Mr. Kolb, whose Committee for Economic Development has enlisted more than 250 executives and retired executives to endorse a soft-money ban, said an interesting question would be whether companies that had stopped giving believed that their interests were given short shrift by Congress as a result.
General Motors, which stopped soft-money giving in 1997, thinks not. Bill Noack, a G.M. spokesman, said the company had found that its decision had not affected relations with Congress at all.
"There are so many issues that affect us -- the environment, safety and trade -- there is something every day," Mr. Noack said. "And I can't say our decision has made an impact at all."
(The company, through its political action committee, still makes regulated donations, with a $5,000 legal maximum, to federal candidates.)
Like G.M., Monsanto, which had given $88,700 in soft money during the 1995-96 election cycle, stopped giving it in 1997. And like G.M., St. Louis-based Monsanto, which merged in April with Pharmacia & Upjohn, found that relations with Congress were unaffected, a spokeswoman said.
"Before we gave -- and after we stopped giving -- we always had wonderful relationships with the members in Congress who represent our company in Missouri," said the spokeswoman, Linda Fisher, Pharmacia's vice president for government affairs. "We support them through our PAC and fund-raisers, and we have found that to be the most successful way to have our voice heard."
Among the 31 companies that have most recently abandoned soft-money giving -- identified through a computerized check for The New York Times by the nonpartisan Campaign Study Group of Springfield, Va. -- some, of course, may find reason to make such a donation before November.
Further, among these companies, some top executives have stepped up their contributions. The Spanos Companies, for instance, contributed $295,000 in soft money in 1997-98, and none in the last 15 months. But its chairman, Alex G. Spanos, gave $250,000 to the Republican National Committee in March 1999, records of the Federal Election Commission show.
And while neither Revlon nor its chief executive, Ronald O. Perelman, has given any soft money this cycle, Mr. Perelman has given a total of $7,000 in federally restricted contributions to various candidates.

Landlords Seek Rise In Rents, Up to 15%

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Landlords of the one million rent-stabilized apartments in New York City yesterday proposed a rent increase of 9 percent for a one-year lease and 15 percent for a two-year lease. They cited higher operating costs, notably the price of fuel oil for heat and hot water.
"Significant inflationary pressures are building," said Jack Freund, vice president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlords' group. It will detail its position at a hearing today before the city's Rent Guidelines Board. The board has scheduled a preliminary vote for Monday on the maximum rent increases on stabilized apartments for leases renewed in the year starting Oct. 1. 
 The debate over rent is intensifying this year, after a long period of modest increases. For five of the last six years, the board has approved increases of 2 percent for a one-year lease and 4 percent for a two-year lease.
But last week, the board released its annual study of the landlords' operating costs, showing a rise of 7.8 percent. At the same time, the board's chairman, Edward S. Hochman, proposed changes in the rent formula that could result in increases of 8.5 percent for a one-year lease and 12 percent for a two-year lease, although he said he did not expect those numbers to be adopted.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who appoints the rent board, called those numbers "very, very high" and stressed that no decisions had been made. BRUCE LAMBERT

Bid to Keep Printers in City

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration announced plans yesterday to establish an $8 million fund to help commercial printing and graphic arts companies that want to relocate within New York City.
Under the program, which is intended to assist a growing number of printers and graphic artists who find themselves priced out of commercial space in the city, the companies can receive up to 50 percent of their moving costs, with a limit of $200,000 per company, officials said. Robert M. Harding, the deputy mayor for economic development and finance, said the goal was to "help companies take advantage of affordable opportunities in today's booming real estate market, ensuring the long-term growth" of the printing industry. 
 To become eligible for the money, the companies must agree to remain in the city for five years, officials said. JAYSON BLAIR

HEADLINE: Wined, Dined, Wooed on Trade: Just 2 Lawmakers Travel to China

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, May 1

 BODY:
Measured on a per-vote basis, it was probably one of the more expensive lobbying efforts ever undertaken by the Clinton administration.
Hoping to sway legislators who remain undecided on whether to grant China permanent normal trade relations in a vote set for this month, President Clinton set aside money earlier this year to fly wavering lawmakers to China where they could gauge trade and human rights conditions for themselves. 
 But, in the end, only two undecided congressmen showed up.
Two trips had originally been proposed, one led by Commerce Secretary William Daley and another by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. But these quickly became political no-flight zones for politicians worried about coming under attack by organized labor lobbyists who argue that permanent trade status would erode human rights in China and cost American jobs.
So Secretary Daley's trip, which was to have included a dozen legislators, was "consolidated" with that of Secretary Glickman's. And when Mr. Glickman lifted off last week from Andrews Air Force Base in a C32-A, the Air Force version of the civilian Boeing 757, he had only two undecided congressmen in tow -- and administration officials were refusing to identify them until the flight had left, lest they be pressured at the last minute to drop out.
And so began the education of Representative Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat, and Representative Ruben Hinojosa, a Texas Democrat, neither of whom had been to China before. They were treated royally in Beijing, where they met with a deputy prime minister and watched the sun rise over the Great Wall.
In Shanghai, they had a private audience with China's chief negotiator with Taiwan. And in Hong Kong, they met with the chief executive of China's newly reclaimed territory and dined with its business elite at the exclusive China Club.
About a dozen administration officials accompanied them, as well as two congressmen who support making China's trade status permanent, Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican, and Norman Dicks, a Washington Democrat. And dozens more people chaperoned the men from place to place on the ground.
Congressmen Meeks and Hinojosa seemed bemused by so much attention, sometimes falling behind the throng that moved through a program meant to show them how much the United States would lose if it did not grant China the permanent trade status. China's favorable status has been subject to annual review by Congress since the suppression of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989, though it has always been approved.
Mr. Meeks appeared particularly suspicious of the over-orchestrated show, and skipped a supermarket visit in Shanghai in order to meet with common folk. With a consular official translating at his side, Mr. Meeks trudged up the stairs of a middle-class apartment block and along the dirt paths of a migrant worker neighborhood in his gray summer suit, addressing startled Chinese along the way with his big American hello.
"Do you like China?" he asked a young migrant from Anhui province who invited him into her barren, whitewashed room.
"Of course, I do," she replied, "I'm Chinese!"
Mr. Meeks questioned everyone he met about human rights ("I've never had any trouble," one elderly man replied in a typical exchange) and what they thought about China joining the World Trade Organization ("Well, of course you should support it; we want to compete with the rest of the world," said Cui Qian, a middle-aged businesswoman).
Between stops, he fought to reconcile what he had heard from the labor unions in Washington with what he saw in China. He detected none of the repression or exploitation so often talked about.
"The Chinese seem to think that economics are more important to them than whatever form of government they have right now," he concluded.
Mr. Meeks was uncertain what advantage labor unions could expect if Congress does not grant China permanent trade status when it votes on the measure later this month. "That's something I'll have to ask them," Mr. Meeks said, noting that the issue is muddled even in his own district, the borough of Queens.
United Parcel Service, which has a large operation at Kennedy International Airport, supports permanent trade status and China's membership in the World Trade Organization because the company is lobbying for a cargo route to China. The Teamsters support the company in that bid, which would create union jobs, but are nonetheless lobbying against permanent normal trade relations, or P.N.T.R.
Mr. Meeks and Mr. Hinojosa watched workers unload sacks of American soybeans from barges in Shanghai. China is the biggest buyer of American soybeans and is importing $700 million worth of them in the current season.
"There's a lot of demand for imported soybeans in China and if we don't give them P.N.T.R. that demand will go to the Argentineans or the Brazilians," said Philip Laney, who represents the American Soybean Association in China and was on hand to lobby the congressmen.
China has said it will apply to enter the World Trade Organization regardless of the Congressional vote, and the United States is unlikely to stand in its way -- in part because such a move would infuriate Taiwan whose membership is being held up until China joins.
China's entry does not require the support of Congress. And although President Clinton promised China during the negotiations that the annual Congressional review of its trade status would end, a Geneva-based trade official said, "China can come in regardless of what Congress votes, provided that the U.S. representatives in the General Council and the Working Party approve the conditions, along with the other member governments."
While no one is sure exactly what would happen if Congress votes against permanent normal trade relations, China could join and then invoke Article XIII of the Marrakesh Agreement that established the trade organization, allowing Beijing to withhold from the United States commitments it makes to other organization members.
"If the United States misses this opportunity it will actually lose the tremendous market of China and will be giving away the opportunity for participating in this market to its competitors," China's trade minister, Shi Guangsheng, said last month. "In that case, the United States, especially U.S. companies, will suffer the most."
That has many American business people in China worried.
"China's government has no qualms about rewarding political cooperation with economic opportunity," said Jeffrey Bernstein, founder of Emerge Logistics, which handles distribution of foreign products on the mainland, an industry likely to open most dramatically to foreign participation if China joins the trade organization.
"Jeopardizing American companies' natural advantage in distributing products provides a wonderful opportunity for our European, Asia and Australian friends," he said.
Larry Wortzel, director of the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center says more than 200,000 American jobs are directly related to China trade.
The House of Representatives will vote on China's trade status during the week of May 22. Legislators familiar with the vote say it is still 10 to 15 votes short of passage.
The White House has been working with Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat, on "parallel legislation" that would set up a watchdog Congressional commission to review Chinese trade and human rights policies and perhaps recommend sanctions against Beijing within the limits of organization rules.
Mr. Meeks and Mr. Hinojosa, for their part, remained undecided as they headed home this weekend.
"You do get a different feel once you have been here," Mr. Meeks said. "Theory and practice are two different things."

HEADLINE: Bergen County Sheriff Halts Jail Construction, Saying Project Is Over Budeget

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., May 1

 BODY:
The Bergen County sheriff blocked construction at the new county jail today, saying he would not allow work to resume until county officials explained why the project was over budget and running late. County officials countered that the sheriff was waging a misleading, partisan battle to divert attention from what they called his own poor performance.
The sheriff, Joseph L. Ciccone, a Democrat, held a news conference in a vacant cell block of the new jail on River Road to cite an analysis published last month by The Record of Hackensack, which asserted that the projected cost of the project was $16 million over budget, after an initial estimate of $45 million. 
 Sheriff Ciccone, who unseated the Republican incumbent for sheriff in November 1998, said that the county executive, William P. Schuber; the county administrator, Charles A. Nurnberger; and the Republican-dominated Board of Freeholders had ignored his requests for information on the overruns.
"Sixteen million dollars over the original price tag," Mr. Ciccone said. "If that happened in the private sector, someone would be fired."
The first phase of construction was completed in March, and last month more than 600 inmates were moved into the new building.
Mr. Ciccone said he would not allow the start of construction on the project's second phase -- adding administrative space to the new building and renovating part of the old jail for 300 more beds -- because it involves the same project manager, the Gilbane Construction Company of Mercerville, N.J. And with 150 beds now vacant in the new jail, Sheriff Ciccone said he also questioned whether the work on the old jail was necessary.
County officials acknowledged there had been delays, but added that the sheriff's cost figures were all wrong. Officials said an architect estimated that the project would cost the county $45 million, but that was in 1993, three years before the project was sent out for bids. The estimate also failed to include the expense of hiring a construction manager, which cost $4.3 million.
Mr. Nurnberger said the actual initial cost was more like $53 million, including the cost of the project manager, by the time bids were solicited in 1996. Inflation had increased the cost as the county fought and won a lawsuit brought by the City of Hackensack in 1993 seeking to prevent the jail from being constructed on the site, which is along the Passaic River. There were also change orders totaling $2.7 million, making the total cost to the county about $56 million, Mr. Nurnberger said.
Scott Chilcote, Gilbane's project executive, confirmed that the first phase was completed 11 months late. He said the delays included the discovery of huge concrete slabs buried deep underground that had been part of a defunct sewage treatment plant.
"Every time you put a shovel in the ground, you don't know what you're going to find," Mr. Chilcote said.
Anthony Cassano, the chairman of the seven-member Board of Freeholders, said the sheriff was trying to divert attention from his own problems.
"It's a smoke screen," Mr. Cassano said. "His performance has been incredibly lackluster."
He cited three escapes from the old jail this year. He also said the sheriff had already exhausted his overtime budget for the year.
The number of beds, Mr. Cassano said, had been dictated by a court order stemming from a 1990 lawsuit by the state public advocate seeking to ease crowding at the old jail.
Mr. Cassano said the county was seeking a court injunction to allow the work to continue. Judge Sybil R. Moses of the State Superior Court is to meet with both sides on Tuesday in her chambers at the Bergen County Courthouse.

HEADLINE: Placing Hopes In the Net;
Indonesia Entrepreneur Tries To Redeem Business Dynasty

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia

 BODY:
South of a park called Dreamland on an abandoned airfield surrounded by slums, Edward Suriadjaya is testing the Internet's powers of redemption.
In a country dominated by corporate dynasties, Mr. Suriadjaya is famous as the scion who broke his family's bank and cost his family the car company his father founded in 1957, Astra International. 
 Now, Mr. Suriadjaya (pronounced sir-ya-JAI-ah) has returned to the corporate stage as a high-technology entrepreneur planning to build a stable of dot-coms and turn Jakarta's old airport into Indonesia's Silicon Valley. In the process, he wants not only to resurrect a fallow property investment but also to prove at last that he was an unwitting pawn of politics and to help restore his family's position.
"I'm putting my future at stake," he said in a recent interview. "I believe that information technology, as an enabler for the Indonesian nation, is in line with the development of technology in the world and has a very good future."
His vehicle is PT CyberCity Indonesia, a holding company with what he calls a "bag of goodies" he hopes will attract $76.5 million in new investments with a stock offering set for year-end. Inside the bag are stakes in an Internet service, two Web portals, an incubator for Net-related businesses, a multimedia academy and a 7.5-acre sliver of a 109-acre piece of overgrown airport that he hopes to turn into a high-technology commercial and residential sanctuary.
"Clicks and bricks," Mr. Suriadjaya intoned in his sonorous Indonesian drawl. He says he already has a heavy list of backers, including the governments of Indonesia, Malaysia and Japan as well as Microsoft.
There is no shortage of naysayers. Many point to Mr. Suriadjaya's reputation. "I'm always skeptical about whatever Edward does," said Manggi T. Habir, president of the credit-rating agency Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia.
While the Suriadjayas' influence with Indonesia's new government has produced criticism, some skeptics wonder about Mr. Suriadjaya's high-technology connections. They question the seriousness of a project that despite claiming to have set up at least five different ventures, has yet to establish a corporate Web site. CyberCity, they say, is more about bailing out a $50 million project Mr. Suriadjaya was in charge of developing on the site of the old Kemayoran domestic airport before the colossal failure of the bank he ran, Bank Summa, in 1992.
Mr. Suriadjaya is not the only Asian tycoon to become a pioneer of the new economy. Though brash unknowns have won many of America's new fortunes, the high-technology start-up scene in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand is dominated by the rich and powerful. Skeptics say it is a sign of how much buzz surrounds the Internet; in Asia, as elsewhere, there is nothing like an Internet play to give an old-economy stock a new shine. Others say it is a symptom of economies in which wealth is still tightly concentrated and local capital markets are developing too slowly to fuel the speedy growth of the new economy.
"There are a lot of entrepreneurs who want to start up but don't have resources," said Vasant Chatikavanij, executive vice president of Loxinfo, a Thai Internet service. "They end up selling themselves cheap. They sell to companies like us."
Indonesia may seem an unlikely locale for dot-com mania. Most bankers and economists will not even discuss its Internet potential. This, after all, is a country with a government that still depends on the International Monetary Fund to make ends meet; a country where a personal computer costs nearly twice the average annual income. Only 4 of every 1,000 Indonesians use the Internet, according to the International Data Corporation, compared with 14 of every 1,000 Asians over all. Most people do not even have a phone.
But analysts and Internet entrepreneurs like Mr. Suriadjaya say such statistics highlight the promise. Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous nation, already has more Internet users than Singapore, and millions of wealthy urban residents with money to spend online. New and cheaper ways of connecting to the Internet, like TV set-top boxes and mobile phones, they say, will quickly extend the Net to more of Indonesia's 200 million people.
"There's a large market coming out of the crisis that has spending potential," said Jonathan Morris, 26, a Bostonian who dropped out of the Harvard Business School a year and a half ago to start Indonesia's most popular Web site, astaga.com.
Mr. Suriadjaya, 51, comes to the Internet world with more business experience -- and, some say, more baggage. The eldest son of William Suriadjaya, a respected businessman who built Astra from a small importer of diesel generators into a $2.4 billion automotive giant, Edward Suriadjaya started out as a salesman at an Astra unit. He then ventured into finance, first with a bank in Germany and later a finance company in Hong Kong.
In 1988, he bought a small Indonesian bank, renamed it Bank Summa and expanded rapidly through the Summa Group. By 1991, Bank Summa was among the country's largest private banks, with about $1 billion in assets, most in loans to Summa companies and much of that for property investments.
One such investment was the $50 million Jakarta International Trade Fair Corporation, a joint venture of Mr. Suriadjaya's Griya Nusantara Pratama, the Indonesian State Secretariat, Jakarta's city government and a group of Japanese investors. The corporation was to develop 109 acres of the old Kemayoran airport, which had closed in 1985.
But in mid-1990, Indonesia adopted a tight fiscal policy, and Summa's world began to unravel. The property market sank, and Bank Summa was faced with $303 million in losses in 1991. Mr. Suriadjaya's father moved in to bail out Summa, removing his son as chairman and pledging Astra shares against the bank's obligations. The more he struggled to prop up the bank, the lower Astra's share price sank and the deeper Bank Summa's hole grew. By late 1992, the central bank closed Summa amid a depositor run. To help meet the bank's $690 million in liabilities, the Suriadjayas relinquished virtually their entire 76 percent stake in Astra to several businessmen close to President Suharto.
That is only half the story, according to a version of events that Mr. Suriadjaya said could be told only now that Mr. Suharto has fallen. The government set him up, he said, by encouraging him to lend, only to later impose restrictions and then remove government pension funds from Bank Summa to precipitate its collapse. He said his father would eventually spell out who was behind the intrigue in a tell-all biography. "I blame ourselves for being naive," Mr. Suriadjaya said. "We refused to be a crony."
Mr. Suriadjaya suggested he was victimized because his first wife, who died of cancer the year the family lost Astra, was the daughter of President Sukarno, whom Mr. Suharto ousted in 1965. Astra had long been uncharacteristically independent of the Suharto clan. And Mr. Suharto was reportedly less than appreciative when, in mid-1990 Bank Summa built a network of banks for rural Muslim communities with a powerful cleric named Abdurrahman Wahid.
Now, Mr. Wahid is Indonesia's president, the Suhartos are fending off prosecutors, and the Suriadjayas are rebuilding. In 1998, Edward Suriadjaya was reinstated as a board member of Jakarta International Trade Fair. Last December, his father was named chairman.
The family's comeback has forced President Wahid to counter accusations that the Suriadjayas have become neocronies. Last month, the president sold his stake in the Muslim finance company he set up with Edward Suriadjaya in mid-1990 after it bought a stake in Mandiri Inti Finance, a company Edward Suriadjaya took control of last January.
Mandiri was trying to raise funds for a last-minute bid to buy back the Suriadjayas' stake in Astra -- it was on the block after being seized from the indebted cronies who had bought it seven years earlier -- before the government sold it to a Singapore-led consortium.
Mr. Suriadjaya denies trying to capitalize on his presidential connections. "If I were doing it, why didn't I do it before, when we were fighting for our existence?" he said.
Last month, Mandiri Inti Finance changed its name to Siwani Trimitra and said it would start raising funds for CyberCity. But most of Mr. Suriadjaya's Internet deals have so far been conducted by L & M Group Investments, a financially troubled engineering company in Singapore, which Mr. Suriadjaya's younger brother, Edwin, ended up controlling after taking over a different Singapore company.
Edwin Suriadjaya remains listed as L & M's deputy chairman, and his father is chairman; Edward Suriadjaya became a member of the board last year and, after slowly building up his stake in the company, was named chief executive last month.
Underscoring the tangled shareholdings and cross-shareholdings that make Indonesian business so nebulous, L & M owns part of CyberCity together with Jakarta International Trade Fair and Edward Suriadjaya's own Griya Nusantara Pratama, which still owns part of Jakarta International. Just how much of CyberCity each owns, Mr. Suriadjaya said, is "now being arbitrarily decided." CyberCity, in turn, owns only a portion of the five Internet-related ventures it is involved in.
Nevertheless, investors are using L & M's stock as way to bet on the project. It rose 20 percent in November when L & M announced that MyWeb Inc.com, an American set-top box maker, would take a 10 percent stake in CyberCity and help build an Internet service in Indonesia, then fell 8 percent when the deal fell apart a month later. Soon afterward, when L & M said it was in talks to replace MyWeb with Microsoft, the stock rose more than 40 percent.
L & M's share price has drifted down about 28 percent this year, tracking the decline of Asia's stock markets. But L & M has also been dogged by concerns about whether partnerships will materialize. The company has announced that SingNet, Singapore Telecommunications' Internet unit, was considering a 30 percent stake in CyberCity, and that Detecon Marketing Consulting, a unit of Deutsche Telekom, would buy 10 percent. On Friday, L & M said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with SingTel to help develop CyberCity but gave no details. Detecon said it was in talks but that no deal had yet been reached.
In February, L & M finally signed a deal with Microsoft -- not to take a stake in CyberCity but rather to help build a news and information Web site in return for a share of the revenue the site generates. The site is scheduled to start this month. The only CyberCity venture that appears to be up and running is the Jakarta Multimedia Academy, which L & M established with Malaysian Technology Development, a government-owned venture capital concern.
"We support CyberCity fully, but we're still waiting for something to be realized," said Pandji Choesin, executive director of the Indonesian Association of Internet Service Providers.
Mr. Suriadjaya wants to sell a 50 percent stake in CyberCity for $26.5 million by June 28, when he plans to officially introduce it at an Internet trade show at Kemayoran. He hopes to raise another $50 million by the end of the year, despite the fact that there are still no revenue projections for the group. "From June 28 onward, I trust that the price tag of our company will be in excess of $100 million," he said.
Such a big capital buildup might not be unusual for an Internet start-up, but it would represent an especially neat turnaround for Jakarta International Trade Fair's original airport investment.
Property analysts say prices in Jakarta have fallen at least 50 percent the last 10 years, though with no sales anywhere in two years it is hard to tell. Mr. Suriadjaya said CyberCity was valuing its 7.5-acre property at $5 million, a price that would make Jakarta International's entire 109-acre spread at Kemayoran worth around $73 million -- a 46 percent paper profit.
Mr. Suriadjaya rejects criticism that his high-technology vision is a property deal in disguise, though he does not deny that CyberCity could be good for the local real estate market. "We know we have to push it as a cyberinitiative because that's where most of the funds are basing their decisions," he said. "We're not cheating anybody."

HEADLINE: Actors Strike Against Radio and Television Advertisers

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 1

 BODY:
For the first time in 12 years, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists called on their combined membership of about 135,000 actors to stop working on all television and radio commercials at 12:01 a.m. today until an agreement could be reached with advertisers.
Residual payments for commercial work are at the heart of the disagreement between the actors -- who rallied here today and in New York, Chicago and San Francisco -- and television and radio advertisers. For years, actors in commercials used on network television have received payments every time an ad runs in a practice known as "pay per play." For commercials on cable television actors receive a flat rate. 
 A placard stating "Please Don't Squeeze the Actor" summed up the attitude of an estimated 2,000 actors as they marched down Wilshire Boulevard today.
Frank Simmons, an actor who marched, said the disparity between the two sides could be vast. For example, he cited the residual payments he received for working in a recent General Motors commercial. Over a three-month period on cable, he said he received a flat fee of $1,100, although the commercial was shown several times a day.
During the same period on the networks, he said the commercial brought him nearly $40,000.
"This is about as good as economic times are going to get and by suggesting to get rid of residuals they're basically asking for a pay cut," said Greg Krizman, a spokesman for the guilds.
Commercial advertisers want the flat rate used by cable to be adopted across the board while the unions want to see pay-per-play extended to cable advertising.
Under the advertisers' most recent proposal, the lead actor's fees for unlimited use of a commercial on cable in a 13-week cycle would increase 60 percent.
Actors' representatives say that times have changed since they negotiated the flat-rate portion of their contract. In those days, cable was a struggling enterprise and unions across the country were making concessions during hard economic times.
But in today's booming economy, with cable television well entrenched union representatives say it is time to share the wealth.
"They boast of record profits," said Todd Amorde, a Screen Actors Guild board member and joint chairman of the unions' strike committee. "We want our fair share. It's very simple."
Advertisers counter that with the decline in network viewership and an audience dispersed over a greater number of networks, they must show a commercial more often to reach viewers. They have contended that the unions' demands would increase the cost of cable television commercials by 350 percent.
"We think the use of the concept is obsolete particularly with the exploding venues for watching television," said John A. McGuinn, chief negotiator for the Association of National Advertisers Inc. and the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the two major industry trade groups.
He noted that the per-use concept was born in the 1950's when the three networks delivered 90 percent of the television households. The three network now deliver less than 50 percent of the audience, he said.
Talks between the two groups broke down in mid-April and attempts in recent days by federal mediators to bring the two groups back together were unsuccessful.
Screen Actors and American Federation representatives, who have said they would try to shut down production on television and radio commercials made after the strike began, said they knew of no production going on today.
Richard E. Posell, an entertainment lawyer who represents production companies, said he knew of no companies that were shooting today and predicted they would not work, at least in the United States, during the strike.
"The loss of commercial business is an enormous blow to the entertainment community and the economy at large particularly Los Angeles and New York," Mr. Posell said.
He noted that commercial production is estimated to represent about 60 percent of Screen Actors Guild income, or about $720 million annually.
"It's a lot of money," he said. "It's going to effect not only the production business but I think the economy of Southern California."

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on May 2 about a strike by actors in television and radio commercials misspelled one striker's surname and referred incorrectly to his comments about the pay disparity between cable and network television. The actor is Frank Simons, not Simmons. He said he would have earned $40,000 if his commercial had run as often on the networks as on cable. He did not say that that occurred.

HEADLINE: Lush Wine From A Pacific Breeze

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV 

DATELINE: LOMPOC, Calif., May 2

 BODY:
The Santa Ynez Valley stretches west through central Santa Barbara County, reaching toward this small city and the Pacific Ocean beyond. It's a land of relaxed beauty, where narrow roads curl through the knobby, windswept Santa Rita Hills, through rows of walnut trees and strawberry fields, past acres of cabbage and broccoli and, here and there, a few sparse vineyards. It's certainly not Burgundy, where grapevines are planted everywhere, right to the edge of the highway, or Napa Valley, where the wineries are as densely packed as a suburb full of split-levels, but make no mistake: this is wine country.
And in the last few years, the Santa Barbara wine region has grown astonishingly. Since 1997, the amount of land planted with grapes has shot up to more than 18,000 acres, from about 10,000, and the number of wineries in the county has almost doubled in the last decade, to about 50. Most of that acreage was planted by big wineries like Beringer, Robert Mondavi and Kendall-Jackson, which, recognizing the quality of Santa Barbara grapes and the relative affordability of the land, bought up huge tracts in the Los Alamos Valley and the Santa Maria Valley to the north. 
 But the true measure of excitement here is focused a little farther south, on the western Santa Ynez Valley, where smaller parcels of land, ranging from just a couple of acres to a few hundred, have been planted with pinot noir and chardonnay grapes. Growers expect these Burgundian varietals to flourish in the cool climate that is moistened by fogs blowing in almost daily off the Pacific Ocean, and the first wines, made from vines planted three years ago, show excellent potential. The chardonnays are almost crisp with citrus flavors, while the pinot noirs, flamboyant in their youth, should achieve elegance as the vines mature.
"You're going to see some brilliant wines coming out of Santa Barbara," said Alan Phillips, the winemaker and general manager of both Foley Estate and LinCourt Vineyards, which have planted about 250 acres, mostly of chardonnay and pinot noir, on undulating slopes facing south and west. "The cool climate wines are absolutely stunning."
Equally exciting are the passionate young winemakers like Steve Beckmen, 31, of Beckmen Vineyards and Andrew Murray, 28, of Andrew Murray Vineyards, who have seized on Rhone varietals, particularly syrah, and have planted new hillside vineyards in the warmer central part of the valley.
THE best Santa Barbara syrahs are rich and complex wines, layered with nuances as in the northern Rhone Valley of France, syrah's home territory, rather than lightly likable, as so many California syrahs have been.
"When I started making syrah, I think there were four other people in the state who were doing it," said Bob Lindquist of Qupe, who made his first syrah for Zaca Mesa in 1982 and who saw the potential for Rhone grapes early on in the Santa Ynez Valley. "Now, I think there are 25 syrah makers in Santa Barbara County alone."
Santa Barbara is not the only booming region in California. San Luis Obispo County, the Monterey Bay region and Sonoma County have all experienced similar rapid development. But this sleepy county about 100 miles north of Los Angeles may be the most unlikely California region to be joining the top echelon of wine producers. It's far better known for the relaxed city of Santa Barbara, for its beautiful hills that have offered refuge to the likes of Ronald Reagan and Michael Jackson and for its 18th-century adobe missions. In fact, the missions were the first in the county to make wine, a sweet and sturdy beverage that no doubt had its secular as well as its sacramental uses. Wine was made in the county right up through Prohibition but seemed to die out after World War II.
Not until the late 1960's and early 70's, well after the California wine industry began to take off, did Santa Barbara again try its hand at grape growing and winemaking. Pioneers like Firestone Vineyards, Zaca Mesa and Sanford & Benedict arrived, with little idea of what grapes to plant and where.
Many early arrivals planted cabernet sauvignon in areas ill suited for the grap, producing weedy, vegetal wines. Others planted chenin blanc and riesling, noble grapes that have never achieved much popularity in California. But some got it right almost immediately. The 130-acre Sanford & Benedict vineyard, the first planted in the western part of the Santa Ynez, has been a superior source of pinot noir and chardonnay grapes for 25 years, while the 900-acre Bien Nacido vineyard, first planted 30 years ago, graces the labels of many of the county's finest bottles.
By the mid-80's, acclaimed wineries like Au Bon Climat, Qupe, Babcock Vineyards and Sanford Winery were firmly established, soon to be joined by others like Foxen Vineyard, the Lane Tanner Winery and Fess Parker Winery and Vineyard. Big organizations like Beringer had begun to make inroads, but the winemakers were largely a small, close-knit community, many of whom had learned their craft together, and the county reflected their irreverence.
By most accounts, Jim Clendinen of Au Bon Climat, an iconoclastic winemaker who wore long, shaggy hair after it had been stylish and a goatee before goatees came back, worked feverishly to draw attention to Santa Barbara wines, traveling the world to tout their quality. In Santa Barbara County, he and Mr. Lindquist of Qupe had a cooperative agreement to share production facilities at the Bien Nacido vineyard, an arrangement that has set a collegial standard for the county.
"Jim Clendinen has been huge, as far as his ambassadorial role in bringing attention to the area and paving the way for others to follow, and to illustrate what the potential of Santa Barbara County could be," said Greg Brewer, 31, of Brewer-Clifton, one of the county's hottest winemakers today. "In the late 80's and early 90's, he was a larger-than-life figure here."
Though they had eked out a reputation for seductive, elegant pinot noirs and ripe yet nicely acidic chardonnays as well as a few good syrahs, Santa Barbara wines were still largely a footnote in California.
BUT that made Santa Barbara all the more attractive to wealthy wine lovers in Southern California, who saw greater opportunities to make an immediate mark in the wine industry nearby, rather than in Northern California, where they would be greeted with yawns, if they were noticed at all. That and the fact that prime Santa Ynez vineyard sites are a relative bargain, under $20,000 an acre, compared with $35,000 to $45,000 an acre in the Carneros district of Napa Valley, by one winemaker's estimate.
Ron Melville, who owns a securities firm in Los Angeles, actually bought land in Napa Valley before settling on several hundred acres in the Santa Rita Hills, where he built Melville Vineyards and Winery. He hired Mr. Brewer to oversee his operations. Melville will release its first bottles, from the 1999 vintage, later this year. The families of both Mr. Beckmen and Mr. Murray moved up from Los Angeles, choosing Santa Barbara over Northern California to build wineries. Fess Parker, the Hollywood actor who played Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone in the 50's and 60's, opted for elbow room and wide open spaces in Santa Barbara County in the late 80's, over densely populated Northern California.
Like many in the county, Mr. Parker points to great untapped potential in the region, and with recent purchases in both the western Santa Rita Hills and the central Santa Ynez, he is doing his best to tap it. He owns hotels in Santa Barbara and in Los Olivos, a quiet town of cafes, galleries and wine-tasting rooms, where Mr. Parker is trying to develop a world-class restaurant.
"My goals here are not modest," he said. "I want this to be the French Laundry of Santa Barbara County. Napa Valley wasn't any fun until the restaurants came in."
Mr. Parker's winery, a sprawling ranch-style building with a rambling veranda, is on Foxen Canyon Road, a winding country lane of stunning vistas of hills and valleys, sprawling coastal oak trees and wildflowers, with hawks and vultures drifting overhead. While most of the small wineries on this route that links the Santa Ynez Valley with the Santa Maria Valley welcome visitors, Mr. Parker's is one of the few equipped to handle big groups, complete with a large tasting room, a smiling staff and a gift shop where you can buy wines, local foods and of course, coonskin caps.
Such an operation sends cold chills through many in the county, who see wineries as harbingers of the kind of large-scale development they detest. Traffic jams are unknown in Santa Ynez, short of the tourists who slow to gawk at the twirling windmills in the town of Solvang, where the main draw is not wineries but a quaint and kitschy Scandinavian theme with plenty of clogs and shoppes.
"This is kind of where Napa was 25 years ago," said Gary Burk, a marketing and production executive with Au Bon Climat and Qupe, who incidentally makes very good pinot noirs and chardonnays under his own label, Costa de Oro. "Are we going to stay a little country place that makes wines, or are there going to be wine trains and bed-and-breakfasts all up and down Foxen Canyon Road? I don't know if everybody wants that. Some people will welcome that, I think especially the newer people. The older people prefer making wines in a more casual environment."
In an effort to slow development, the county has put up numerous regulatory hurdles -- "the madness," Mr. Phillips, the Foley winemaker, calls it. Well-financed concerns like Foley Estate can battle their way through the obstacles, but some smaller winemakers are opting out.
Brewer-Clifton, which makes minute quantities of pinot noir and chardonnay from purchased grapes, is moving its winemaking operation to a warehouse in the city of Lompoc, which is within the county lines but is not bound by its rules.
"Lompoc is a funny town that's screaming for business," Mr. Brewer said. "Santa Barbara County is very resistant to more wineries going in. There are all kinds of regulations, permits and delays. It's a long, arduous process."
Though the regulatory tensions are bound to continue (the latest debate was over a rare salamander that received an emergency listing as an endangered species, grinding several winery projects to a halt), one thing the wineries seem to be figuring out is to how to use the climate for the maximum advantage of each particular grape.
THE Santa Ynez Valley is blessed with long growing seasons with plenty of sunshine, offset by natural, fog-induced maritime air-conditioning, a product of the east-west valleys that are a peculiar feature of the jutting coastline below Santa Barbara. "It's a unique combination," said Mr. Lindquist of Qupe. "We're far enough south so that we don't get hit by the rains that come down from the northwest, and yet because the coastline is turned around we have this tremendous cooling effect. The soils are important, but not nearly as important as the climate."
That moderate climate, Mr. Murray of Andrew Murray Vineyards said, is what gives the Rhone varietals such potential in the central Santa Ynez. "Too warm and you might get a more insipid-style syrah," he said. "Too cool and it might be too lean. Somewhere right in the middle, you get your darkest, richest wines, full-bodied but still elegant."
Other places in California make good syrahs, too, Mr. Murray admited, but he believes that the long Santa Barbara growing season is a definite advantage. "We were picking syrah at the end of November," he said. "That's when you can really eke out not only those fruit flavors, but those flavors of earth and spices and violets, the real pretty side of syrah, which you find often in the syrahs of this area."
The California wine boom has sent the demand for grapes soaring, forcing many winemakers to seek new supplies or to grow their own. Chris Whitcraft, who has been buying grapes to make small quantities of pinot noir and chardonnay since 1985, had to get his pinot noir from Sonoma County in 1999. When the demand exceeds the supply, the small winemakers are the first to lose out, one of the reasons that Mr. Beckmen of Beckmen Vineyards feels more secure with his own supply of grapes.
"Believe me, having 80 acres of syrah, I get calls every day asking if I have syrah grapes available to sell," he said.
Some fear that the expansion can be too rapid, and that a fall will be inevitable. "Will there be a home for all these grapes, especially if the economy takes a dip?" Mr. Lindquist asked. "Both '98 and '99 were small crop years. But in '97, there were more grapes than we could handle. A lot of winemakers have short memories."
As far as the wines themselves are concerned, a Santa Barbara signature has been elusive. The future looks very good for syrahs, which can be spicy, nuanced and elegant. Some optimistic winemakers even expect that the eastern end of the Santa Ynez, the warmest part of the valley, will one day produce good Bordeaux varietals like cabernet sauvignon and merlot, grapes that have failed miserably in other parts of the valley.
But most people agree that the county's greatest successes have been its richly textured, sweet pinot noirs and its chardonnays, some of which resemble Chablis in their blend of citrus and mineral flavors.
 For some like Mr. Brewer, who can sound almost mystical discussing how Brewer-Clifton wines reflect the soil from which the vines emerge, this is a noble challenge. Others like Richard Dore, an owner of Foxen Vineyards, seem to say, slow down and catch your breath.
"We've been doing this for 30 years, and we're just figuring out where to plant stuff, let alone how to make it," Mr. Dore said. "In Burgundy they've had 3,000 years to get it right."

HEADLINE: The Euro's Value

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In your April 29 editorial "Decline of the Euro," you note the "dashed" hopes of those Europeans who, when the euro was born 16 months ago, "boasted that it would challenge the dollar for international supremacy." The problem, though, is not that the United States is growing faster than Europe, but that the single currency is gradually replacing 11 and that the European Central Bank has failed to mop up the surplus liquidity.
As old contracts in marks, francs and lire expire and are replaced by euro contracts, individuals and enterprises are running down their old currency balances. Instead of selling assets from its portfolio, the European Central Bank has been trying to stop the decline by raising interest rates. This only further reduces the need for liquidity and puts more in surplus. 
 The euro can indeed challenge the superiority of the dollar, but only by using the euro price of gold as a market signal of Europe's liquidity needs.

HEADLINE: New Flurry of Economic Data Shows Little Sign of Slowdown

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
Sales of new single-family houses soared in March to their second-fastest pace on record and an index of growth expectations rose, suggesting the record economic expansion still has legs.
Sales of new single-family homes unexpectedly rose 4.5 percent in March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 966,000 units after falling 0.6 percent in February. The sales rate was the largest since the 995,000 units reported in November 1998. 
 "Higher interest rates are doing nothing to slow consumer spending," said Joel L. Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.
The index of leading economic indicators, a gauge of economic performance for the next six months, rose 0.1 percent in March after a 0.3 percent decline in February. The gain reflected rising stock prices, low levels of unemployment claims and higher orders for consumer goods.
The reports come just two weeks before the Federal Reserve's policy-setting Open Market Committee meets again to decide interest rate policy. Although the Fed has lifted the overnight bank lending rate five times since June 30 -- from 4.75 percent to 6 percent -- the housing report in particular suggests buyers are finding ways to skirt higher borrowing costs.
Analysts had expected new-home sales to fall in March to an annual rate of 900,000 units. Home sales have averaged 940,000 units at an annual rate in the first three months of the year, the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 1998, when the rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 6.76 percent, according to Freddie Mac.
Rates on the 30-year mortgages have remained above 8 percent since February. The median price of a new home rose 3.1 percent, to $165,000 in March from $160,000 a month earlier.
The report on leading indicators by the Conference Board, an industry research group, showed five of the index components were positive contributors and five were negative.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Long-Term Treasuries Lower; 30-Year Yield Now at 6.01%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of United States Treasury securities were mixed yesterday.
Treasuries with shorter maturities were higher as investors moved money out of stocks, which were declining, for the favorable return on interest-bearing instruments. The price of longer-term Treasuries was lower, however, amid concern that the Federal Reserve would move to raise interest rates, driving bond prices down.
 By late in the day, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 10/32 , to a price of 103 11/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, increased to 6.01 percent from 5.99 percent on Monday, exceeding 6 percent for the first time in six weeks. 
 The mixed feelings about the Fed's next move have created some consternation in the bond markets. Michael P. Maurer, a fixed-income strategist at A. G. Edwards & Sons, said.
"Strong economic data forced the reassessment of conventional market wisdom last week as the consensus for the Fed funds target rate became less certain," he said.
Market participants, he added, are divided between expectations of a quarter-percentage-point increase and a rise of half a point. Until recently, it had seemed fairly certain that the central bank would continue its pattern of gradual rate increases.
Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, is among those who say that many market participants expect a half-point tightening at the May 16 meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee, as economic growth led by strong consumer spending continues.
"The Fed seems poised to move aggressively in its pre-emptive strikes against inflationary forces," he said. "Simply put, the risk of economic momentum being sharply curtailed by an aggressive move to a less accommodative posture is considerably less at this juncture than the risk of having an undesirable inflationary bulge result from a somewhat sluggish monetary policy."
Mr. Maurer of A. G. Edwards said, "There are several major announcements due this week, which could shake up the markets." The data include the Treasury's quarterly refunding on Wednesday, first-quarter productivity and cost figures on Thursday, and April employment figures on Friday. Expectations are for nonfarm payrolls to rise 350,000 and for the unemployment rate to drop to 4 percent.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Companies increasingly turn to corporate jets, thanks to the economy and airline hassles.

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey; Business Travel appears each Wednesday. Joe Sharkey's e-mail address is jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WE fly higher and faster," said Bill Wagner, a pilot. "We can get from Des Moines, Iowa, to Washington, D.C., in about two hours with no delays. And we've never lost a piece of luggage."
But hold on before inquiring where to book your next business trip on this astonishing airline. Mr. Wagner flies an executive jet for the Townsend Engineering Company of Des Moines, one of more than 11,000 American companies that own corporate aircraft. To take a business trip on Townsend's Cessna Citation X, an eight-passenger mid-size executive jet, or its six-passenger Piper Cheyenne propeller plane, you generally have to be an employee or a customer of the company, which manufactures processing machines for domestic and foreign meat packers. 
 The corporate-jet business has abandoned the defensive crouch it went into for years after the shareholder revulsion generated by the celebrated business excesses of the mid- to late 1980's, when legendary corporate Champagne Charlies like F. Ross Johnson of RJR Nabisco presided imperially over fleets of expensive jets that could be dispatched on a whim, say to fetch a pet.
The business has come back at full throttle, thanks to a booming economy, a reaction against the delays and frustrations of commercial airlines, and a pronounced change in attitudes as corporate managers justify the expense of a company plane as a business tool. It is seen as a productive way to transport not only top executives, but also the middle-management teams that are increasingly spanning out on ever-wider business trips.
Corporate jets are "very expensive -- so they'd better provide a return on that investment of significant value or you cannot realistically own one," said Ted Townsend, the president of Townsend Engineering. Some big companies, like Wal-Mart Stores, operate big fleets of aircraft for a variety of business reasons, but even smaller operations like Townsend Engineering use planes for functions besides transportation, including things like shipping spare parts to outlying areas.
Though he admits to fervently loving his jet, Mr. Townsend says that its value is strictly practical for a company like his, a machinery maker whose sales and service staffs have to be quick-footed, wide-ranging and happy on the job. "With our location in the central part of the country, we can go anyplace in the United States and still come home for dinner," he said.
The number of companies owning jets and other turbine-engine aircraft increased more than fivefold over the last 30 years, to more 11,000 by 1998, according to the National Business Aviation Association. American companies now operate about 6,200 jets, 5,100 turbo-prop planes and 5,000 helicopters.
But the climb wasn't steady. After a steep ascent through the 1970's, sales of business aircraft flattened in the late 1980's. In 1992, manufacturers delivered 348 new business jets and turbo-props, according to the General Aviation Manufacturers Association. Last year, the number was 778.
It was a long haul to change the corporate jet's image as a toy for pampered executives, industry experts say. "To a certain extent, the community brought this upon itself many years ago when they emphasized the tremendous comfort, luxury and special privilege of a company airplane," said Jack Olcott, the president of the National Business Aviation Association, a trade group that represents corporate aircraft owners. "The excesses of the '80's were really only very limited examples, but they received tremendous media attention."
Even corporations with big corporate fleets depend heavily on commercial aviation for most of their business travel, he noted. "The enlightened company uses the airlines when appropriate, and business aviation when appropriate," he said.
One of the fastest-growing areas in business aviation is in companies that operate corporate jets for charter and for use by clients who purchase fractional shares of a plane or a group of planes, allowing them to have an aircraft available when they want it. The number of companies with fractional-ownership deals doubled, to 1,125, from 1997 to 1998, according to the business aviation trade group.
Not only is the corporate jet back, but it's getting bigger. The Boeing Company is now marketing its new Boeing Business Jet, which has an 807-square-foot interior -- about twice the space of other top-line corporate jets. The plane costs about $38 million, with another $8 to $12 million for accessories and other options. So far, Boeing has orders for 56 of them.
Fred Kelley, a spokesman for the Boeing Business Jet division, described the plane as "basically a hybrid 737," with modifications, including bigger fuel tanks that give it a flying range of about 6,200 miles, similar to the Gulfstream V and twice the range of the Boeing 737 aircraft used domestically by many commercial airlines. The appeal of having a "global presence" accounts for the longer range, Mr. Kelley said. The size reflects a demand for flying more people, including management teams, and equipping them to work in flight with "all the things you would have in a normal office," he said.
Mr. Kelley and other Boeing executives recently returned from a 40-day barnstorming trip on one of the new planes through Europe and the Middle East. Negative public attitudes toward business aircraft remain especially entrenched in Europe, where "if you have a private jet, you don't talk about it," Mr. Kelley said, adding: "We're trying to convert people's thinking into seeing it as a business tool, rather than it being an excessive perquisite for the C.E.O., the royal barge kind of image."
Mr. Kelley said the trip was productive. "I flew 150 hours, 48,000 miles, in 40 days," he said. "I wouldn't want to even think about doing that on commercial flights."

Scholarships for Future Scientists
EUGENE M. LANG broke new ground in philanthropy in 1981 by offering all sixth graders at East Harlem's Public School 121 a college scholarship if they graduated from high school.
Last Friday, Mr. Lang was at it again, this time at the American Museum of Natural History, where a group of inner-city seventh graders were shouting aloud with him, "I will be a scientist." 
 He has given $1 million to make the 10 youngsters the first members of a museum science team.
The students will spend many Saturdays in the coming years in the museum's research program, working closely with curators. Those who complete the program will get a college scholarship and each year another 10 seventh graders will be added.
 
Rutgers Picks Chief of Arts School
Rutgers University has chosen GEORGE B. STAUFFER, chairman of the music department at Hunter College, to become dean of the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers in August.
Dr. Stauffer, an organist and Bach scholar, will replace MARILYN F. SOMVILLE, who is retiring as dean of the 700-student arts school. Founded in 1976, it offers graduate programs in music, theater and visual arts, and undergraduate programs in those disciplines plus dance.
Dr. Stauffer said one of his top priorities was to build up an independent, multimillion-dollar endowment for the school. Another is to attract more students from around the country; more than 90 percent are now from New Jersey.
Before arriving at Hunter, Dr. Stauffer taught at Yeshiva University and at Columbia University, where he was university organist and chapel music director for 22 years.
 
New York Schools in Need of Repair
A new study by the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' union, put New York State at the top of the list of states that need to repair their schools or modernize them with new technology.
The study, released today, said the total repair bill for the nation's schools should be $322 billion.
Of that total, $51 billion is needed in New York, $32.9 billion in California, $25.1 billion in Ohio and $22 billion in New Jersey, the study said.
The $322 billion is 10 times what states are now spending, the report said.
"We often fail to realize that where our students learn can have a dramatic impact on what they learn," said BOB CHASE, the association's president.
 
University Moves Graduate Students
After 24 years at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, Long Island University is moving its Westchester campus for graduate students to the State University at Purchase.
At Purchase, the students will have a 15,000-square-foot space with 14 classrooms wired for the Internet and two computer labs. The two institutions will remain separate, but students will be able to share library access online.
 
Economics Chair at Manhattanville
Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y., will create the first endowed professorial chair in its 159-year-old history with a $1 million contribution from SERGIO DANGUILLECOURT, a director of the board of Bacardi Ltd. The chair will be known as the Ryan-Bacardi chair of economics, after Bacardi and Prof. EDWARD W. RYAN, who has taught at Manhattanville for 42 years.
Mr. Danguillecourt, who lives in Miami, graduated from Manhattanville in 1990 with a degree in economics. MICHAEL POLLAK

HEADLINE: Win Now, or Lose Forever

BYLINE: By Neal Gabler; Neal Gabler is the author, most recently, of "Life the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality."

DATELINE: AMAGANSETT, N.Y.

 BODY:
For now the doomsday clock has stopped ticking. ABC is back on the air, at least temporarily, while Time Warner and Walt Disney, the parent company of ABC, restart talks over whether Time Warner's cable systems will carry ABC programming. Some 3.5 million cable subscribers will no longer be deprived of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," "Dharma and Greg" and "N.Y.P.D. Blue."
A national crisis has temporarily been averted. 
 Yes, it's easy to be sarcastic. On its face this is a dispute about money. In exchange for letting it carry ABC programming, Time Warner says Disney is insisting that the cable operator convert the Disney Channel from a premium service to a basic cable service and that it add two Disney-owned channels to its systems -- and that it pay what it believes is an extortionate fee for doing so. Thus the Orwellian "Disney Has Taken ABC Away from You" sign that had appeared on cable screens in the affected communities.
For its part, Disney insists that the pending AOL-Time Warner merger has changed the negotiating context and says it wants the same access to new, highly profitable interactive technologies that Time Warner's own channels feature.
But while money is certainly at issue, it is not the whole story or even the main story -- at least not the relatively small amounts being quibbled over. This is about hegemony. The brinkmanship demonstrates that media companies are no longer rivals jockeying for position, but behemoths locked in a deadly power struggle to become the lone king of a rapacious world.
Rivalry among media giants is nothing new. Back in the 1920's, for example, when the movie companies were integrating production, distribution and exhibition, Paramount, Fox, Warner Brothers and Loew's, the parent company of MGM, were all building or buying theaters -- the movie equivalent of cable -- to deliver their films to the public.
Fierce battles often ensued. Companies even instigated labor troubles at rivals' sites and promoted disinformation campaigns charging that a rival's theater was carelessly constructed and the balcony would collapse. Paramount was so enthusiastic in its efforts to subvert its competitors that the Federal Trade Commission even opened an investigation of its practices.
But once the construction dust settled, the movie companies realized that not only could they co-exist, they could make money from one another. Why fight? A Loew's first-run theater could show a Warner Brothers movie and a Warner Brothers theater could show an MGM film if the theater's location and the situation warranted it.
Before the Depression, the idea was that the movies were an ever-expanding pie with plenty for everyone. After the Depression hit, the idea was that the rivals had to find ways of dividing the pie, profiting off one another. In either case, there was a grudging collegiality.
As the dispute between Time Warner and Disney illustrates, the days of cooperation, grudging or otherwise, are long gone -- the casualty of two factors. One is the Internet, which has created unparalleled opportunity and uncertainty in equal measure. Everyone assumes that eventually hundreds of billions of dollars will be made off Internet technology, which is why America Online could acquire Time Warner in the first place, but no one knows exactly how this windfall will be reaped. Each company sees the unprecedented chance to be the Internet Almighty and thus reduce opponents to irrelevance -- the fear that Disney has expressed in the wake of the AOL-Time Warner merger.
In this situation, there is no ever-expanding pie to be divided but only one to be eaten whole by the company that gets the jump on the Internet and the billions of dollars that go with it.
That leads to the second factor that has turned media competition into hostility: a monopolist mentality.
The old movie moguls may have been megalomaniacs but they didn't think like monopolists. They thought like heated competitors trying to be the biggest and the best, but never believing that they could be the only one. They knew they couldn't.
Kept in check in part by the threat of government antitrust actions, Louis B. Mayer, the chieftain of MGM, realized that the 50 or so films his studio made each year couldn't satisfy some 80 million weekly viewers. In effect, he needed the other studios to keep slaking the movie-going habit, just as they needed him. Together they constituted a film industry that could never have been congruent with just a single company.
Today's media conglomerates, however, have an opportunity that those old movie companies didn't have. Microsoft notwithstanding, the government seems less zealous in enforcing antitrust law, and the financial system encourages vast new economies of scale and the mergers that help provide them.
 The new media companies are full-service entertainers that can provide everything an audience might want -- not only movies but television, videocassettes, CD's, books, interactive games, theater and, yes, the Internet.
When you can provide for every entertainment need an audience might have, the industry and the company can be congruent, which creates an entirely different mindset, as we can see from the Time Warner-Disney dust-up.
Competitors are no longer an unavoidable part of doing business; they have actually become an impediment to doing business.
In a sense, then, the skirmishes among Time Warner, Disney, Fox, Sony, Bertelsmann and the other pretenders to media pre-eminence have less to do with traditional economics than with dynastic politics. These companies are modern warriors that don't believe they have to live with one another. As they see it, the world may be big enough for only one of them -- one king of the media hill and a group of vassals.
Meanwhile, we still have Regis.

HEADLINE: Mr. Business-School Boom;
What Jacobs Wrought, in a Quarter-Century, at Kellogg

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill.

 BODY:
Donald P. Jacobs jumps into a swimming pool every day at 6:30 a.m. and spends 45 minutes doing laps. During rainstorms, he sometimes dashes without an umbrella between buildings on the Northwestern University campus here, even as the wind off Lake Michigan musses his hair. When he gives public speeches, he often wears a sweatshirt. And when he finds something funny, he throws his head back, crosses his arms over his chest and guffaws.
Mr. Jacobs has a rather loose style for a business school dean, especially one who passed the traditional retirement age seven years ago. But nothing is frivolous about his accomplishments: No one has had a greater effect on management education in the United States than he has, say his peers at schools around the country. 
 This spring, Mr. Jacobs is celebrating his 25th anniversary at the helm of the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern. He has held his job longer than any current major university president or other business school dean, higher education experts say. When he took over, Cal Ripken Jr. was playing high school baseball and Pope John Paul II was still Karol Wojtyla, archbishop of Cracow.
Along the way, Mr. Jacobs created the prototype of the modern business school, management experts say. Well before many of its rivals, Kellogg interviewed all its applicants, published students' evaluations of its professors' teaching skills and encouraged students to help design the curriculum.
In other words, Kellogg caters to its students as if they were customers. It unabashedly considers the teaching of skills like teamwork and social networking as central to its mission, and seeks students who agree. "If you think you are that kind of person, you fit," Mr. Jacobs recently told a group of accepted applicants. "If not, this is the time to get the hell out," he added, to much laughter.
Thanks to the changes -- many of which once seemed heretical in the world of higher education -- and to the recruitment of ambitious young professors, the school that once had little respect on its own campus steadily climbed the national rankings, securing a solid spot in the top five and forcing more prestigious schools to imitate it.
Professors say Mr. Jacobs is the symbol for the business school boom that over the last quarter-century has tripled, to 100,000, the number of M.B.A.'s awarded each year.
"No one has quite done what Don has done," said Rajat Gupta, the managing partner of McKinsey & Company, who sits on advisory boards at Kellogg, Harvard and the Universities of Chicago and Pennsylvania. "Which is to transform an average school into a top five school and keep it there for some time."
In a business world that craves speed and flexibility, Mr. Jacobs, jovial and blunt-spoken, has also become something of a model manager himself, colleagues say. Kellogg, with a relatively small administrative staff, relies on its version of factory-floor employees -- its students -- to study many of its problems and suggest solutions. Unlike many academic institutions, it acts quickly, putting in place pilot programs and deciding later whether they deserve a permanent place in the curriculum. "He pushes constant change," said Robert Duncan, a professor of leadership who has taught at the school since 1970.
Last summer, for example, reacting to student criticism that Kellogg had not devoted enough attention to the Internet, Mr. Jacobs and a few faculty members drew up plans for an e-commerce major that covers 16 courses. It is already the third-most-popular major at the school.
At the core of Mr. Jacobs's strategy has been a strengthening of the ties between the ivory tower and a business world that sometimes views intellectuals as eggheads. Over the skepticism of other Northwestern officials, he built an executive education center 20 years ago that now brings in $93 million a year and has inspired similar versions at Stanford, Pennsylvania and other schools. He was also among the first deans to encourage professors to make international trips a part of actual classes.
He continues to teach, both the full-time day students and the executives who pass through. Between 1975 and 1979, he served as the chairman of Amtrak and has also been a director for First Chicago, Commonwealth Edison and Hart Marx, the high-end clothing company. (One of his board stints, on a meat-packing company, even turned him into a vegetarian, he said, after he had learned the details of the industry's operations.)
A competitive man whose sometimes fiery temper has cooled only recently, friends say, and who needs little provocation before lobbing insults about the nearby University of Chicago, Mr. Jacobs says Kellogg makes a legitimate claim to be the nation's top business school. More removed experts call that wishful thinking, if only barely. Given the choice, most students enroll at Harvard or Stanford over Kellogg, for example. And after building a top-notch faculty, Kellogg has lost a few stars to rival schools in the last three years and has not replaced them with researchers of the same rank, professors say.
Most management experts agree, however, that few graduate schools of any kind have come as far over the last 25 years, and few institutions bear the mark of their leader as much as this one. "His personality really infuses the place," said Mike Miles, the former chairman of Philip Morris who heads the school's advisory board.
In fact, some students and professors worry that Kellogg's biggest problem is that Mr. Jacobs has not surrounded himself with strong candidates to replace him, even though he plans to retire in a few years and spend more time teaching. "There's nobody that is a natural successor to Dean Jacobs within the school right now," said James Schlesinger Jr., the former editor of the student paper, who will graduate this spring.
Mr. Jacobs grew up as the son of bakers on the far west side of Chicago, three blocks from the suburb of Oak Park that Frank Lloyd Wright was making famous. Until junior high school he suffered from what doctors would now call dyslexia and, he said, is still terrible at remembering names. He enlisted in the Navy at 17, just weeks before Japan surrendered in World War II. He returned home and attended Roosevelt University in Chicago, where an economics professor encouraged him to take up the subject. Mr. Jacobs eventually earned a doctorate in economics at Columbia. "I never, ever thought of being anything but a professor," he said.
His first job was at City College in New York. Northwestern's business school offered him a post in the 1950's, but the dean at the time, Richard Donham, son of the founding dean of Harvard Business School, asked him to promise to teach in the executive education program, a forum that many faculty members deemed intellectually weak. Dr. Donham "wouldn't have hired me if I wouldn't do it," Mr. Jacobs said.
The experience changed his view of business education and, eventually, remade Kellogg.
Over the next two decades, Mr. Jacobs taught finance and, in 1974, found himself on a search committee to find a replacement for John Barr, the former chief executive of Montgomery Ward who was then stepping down as head of Northwestern's business school. The committee offered the job to a French diplomat and to administrators at both Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania. All three said no.
"And then the search committee," said Professor Duncan, another committee member, "almost in desperation, said: 'Enough is enough. Somebody's got to be dean.' " Mr. Jacobs, as the senior faculty member on the committee, was the choice, and he set aside his academic career to accept the post. "He wasn't thrilled about it," Professor Duncan said. "I don't know that anyone was thrilled about it."
But Mr. Jacobs threw himself into the job almost immediately. On his first day, a Monday, he told the outgoing dean that he wanted the school to focus, in part, on the teaching of business people who were in their 30's and 40's and no longer interested in attending school full-time. By Friday, he was meeting with James Allen, a founder of Booz Allen & Hamilton, to pitch his idea to build a separate executive education center for weeklong and monthlong classes. The following Monday, Mr. Allen agreed to finance much of the project, and the planning began.
Mr. Jacobs's idea was hardly met with unanimous enthusiasm. "The university thought he was crazy," said Meyer Feldberg, now the dean at Columbia, who was the center's first director. More prestigious schools like Harvard already had thriving programs, and with the economy in an inflation-induced funk, companies were not rushing to make large new investments.
But when the center, named for Mr. Allen, opened in 1979, the corporate landscape was changing. Globalization of markets and acceleration of technological change had made doing business more complicated. The Allen Center had little trouble filling its seats, and Northwestern professors soon had the advantage of being in constant contact with their core audience.
"Our faculty were good theorists," Mr. Jacobs said, "but they honestly understood the problems businesses really faced. It was one of the things that made us different."
The Allen Center also became an unofficial advertisement for Kellogg, as the school became known in 1979 after a gift from relatives of the cereal company family who were largely unconnected to the business. After a few weeks of study in Evanston, executives went home more willing to consider Northwestern graduates as well as the Harvard, Pennsylvania and Chicago M.B.A.'s that they had long hired.
Robert Hamada, dean of Chicago's Graduate School of Business, offering a rare compliment for the local competition, said, "He was the first of the major deans -- and he wasn't even a major dean at the time -- to think in terms of marketing." In fact, after years of ignoring the market, Chicago itself began offering executive classes a few years ago.
Mr. Jacobs's big headache now is how to exit gracefully and allow a smooth transition. It is a problem the students in his corporate governance classes study in detail but that he says is difficult to solve at a university, where a successor is chosen by a committee rather than groomed.
"The question of succession drives me crazy," Mr. Jacobs said. "A well-run organization probably would have gotten rid of me by now."

HEADLINE: Revolt of the Business Class

 BODY:
The American political scene has always been enlivened by protests. But there are not many parallels to the recent rebellion among wealthy businesses tired of being hit up by Democrats and Republicans for campaign donations. As Don Van Natta Jr. reported in The Times this week, at least 31 corporations that have given big soft-money contributions in recent election cycles appear to be boycotting the process this year. Most are backing off quietly, but a few have stepped forward to say that swearing off soft money has not brought retaliation from the political establishment. Their disgust with the excesses of fund-raising could be another impetus to enactment of campaign finance reform this year.
Late last year Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and other foes of the McCain-Feingold bill that would ban the unlimited donations to political parties known as soft money never tired of saying that this was an issue of little interest to American voters. Then the reform cause was energized by Senator John McCain's primary campaign, and by a Democratic race in which Vice President Al Gore declared that enactment of the soft-money ban would be one of his highest priorities as president. 
 Now business support for reform is growing. Senator Mitch McConnell has contended that businesses give money in order to "participate" in the political process, with no expectation of anything in return. But business leaders from the Committee for Economic Development and the Campaign for America, led by the investor Jerome Kohlberg, have characterized the campaign finance system as a shakedown operation. Many big businesses like General Motors, Time Warner and Allied Signal have concluded that the money they were spending on political contributions is better spent elsewhere.
But of course many businesses and special interests still give to get something in return for their donations. Philip Morris and the National Rifle Association, two of the biggest givers to the Republicans, have gotten politicians to oppose efforts to regulate guns and tobacco. The question is whether the public wants big questions like a patients' bill of rights, the creation of Social Security investment accounts and policies on software, telecommunications and Internet companies to be decided by who can give the biggest donations to whom.
Unfortunately, Gov. George W. Bush has so far joined Mr. Lott as an obstacle to reform. He says he favors a ban on corporation and union contributions to parties, but he would leave open a wide loophole by allowing unlimited donations to parties from individuals. Like other opponents of reform, he calls it a free speech issue. But Congress set limits on individual donations to candidates in 1974 after the Watergate scandals, and the legislation before Congress would simply extend those limits to donations to parties, which have been used to undermine the old reforms.
Mr. McCain is to meet with the presumptive party nominee in a few days to talk about issues. He needs to press Mr. Bush to support his campaign finance legislation in the Senate, where it commands majority support, and Mr. Bush ought to sign on to real reform. Americans want it. Most in Congress want it. Now even the donors want it. Mr. Bush and Mr. Lott should not stand in their way.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE MONEY ISSUES;
Spate of Numerical Sparring Highlights the Fiscal Focus of the Presidential Race

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
Aides to Gov. George W. Bush fought back today against accusations that his fiscal proposals are risky, saying that the growth in the economy over the past six months meant that there would be enough money to accommodate comfortably the governor's spending and tax cut proposals.
Mr. Bush's advisers released a new analysis of his budget plans after days in which Vice President Al Gore has sharply criticized Mr. Bush on fiscal issues. Mr. Gore has asserted that Mr. Bush's large tax cut proposal and plan to push for a portion of Social Security payroll taxes to be put into private investment accounts would return the nation to the era of deficits. 
 Mr. Gore went on an advertising offensive on Monday against Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, through a series of interviews and television appearances, charging that Mr. Bush would continue "multitrillion-dollar debts." Campaigning today, Mr. Gore called Mr. Bush's Social Security proposal "bad for America's future and bad for America's economy."
The battle over numbers underscores how much the presidential campaign -- the first one waged in the new era of federal surpluses -- will be fought over economic policy and the related question of how to shore up Social Security. The Gore campaign considers the economic prosperity of the Clinton years one of its greatest assets.
The figures released by Bush aides today addressed a weakness in earlier calculations. With the annual spending battle stepping up on Capitol Hill, the Bush campaign stopped assuming Congress would make large reductions in domestic spending, instead assuming discretionary domestic spending would grow.
At the same time, Mr. Bush's advisers argued that the growth in the economy over the past six months means the federal surplus will be larger than previously forecast. They said that under their new calculations the estimated federal surplus across 10 years -- after $2.2 trillion is set aside for Social Security -- will amount to $1.8 trillion.
That is roughly $1 trillion more than the Gore campaign estimates and about $500 billion more than the Bush campaign's earlier projections. Mr. Gore assumes a higher rate of spending and a less robust economy.
Mr. Bush's aides said his cut would use 1.3 trillion surplus dollars, allowing $512 billion for other programs.
"The bottom line is clear," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, the Bush campaign's chief economic adviser. "Governor Bush's plan takes care of Social Security first, provides America's working families with a tax break and does it all within the context of a balanced budget."
The Bush campaign's new calculations were released less than 24 hours after Mr. Gore's aides held their own session with reporters and released an array of numbers they said showed that to accommodate his tax cut, Mr. Bush either had to make "cuts in core areas of government that are unimaginable" or risk a return to deficits.
Mr. Gore's aides were still critical of Mr. Bush today.
"Last month he claimed that his tax cut and spending increases were paid for," said Elaine Kamarck, policy adviser to Mr. Gore. "Today, after finding more money, Bush still can't pay for his promises for a huge tax cut, increased spending and privatization of Social Security."
The Gore campaign said Mr. Bush was underestimating spending, and Mr. Bush's advisers refused to disclose how much Mr. Bush's embrace of a national missile defense system and prescription drug program would cost, while saying the proposals fit in their spending plan.
The most serious dispute between the two campaigns is the true cost of Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposal. Mr. Bush's aides said the tax cut would cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years from 2001-2010. Over just five years they said it would cost $460 billion, slightly less than their original estimate of $483 billion. And they pointed to an analysis from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation backing them. The committee is controlled by Republicans.
The Gore campaign argued that it was more appropriate to examine the tax cut through 2011, since the tax cut does not go into effect until fiscal 2002. Mr. Gore's aides said that once that extra year is added in, as well as lost interest costs, the tax cut costs $2 trillion.
Another looming battle is over debt reduction and Social Security. Mr. Gore has made eliminating the public debt the centerpiece of his economic agenda. He says that Mr. Bush's proposal for putting some Social Security money into individual retirement accounts will carry a huge cost because it will require using part of the federal surplus that would otherwise go toward eliminating the national debt.
Mr. Bush's aides counter that by giving individual workers their own retirement accounts, which can be invested in financial markets, they decrease the government's long-term obligation to pay benefits out of tax revenues. This itself, they say, is a form of debt reduction.
The retirement system is projected to start paying out more in benefits than it is taking in through payroll taxes starting in 2015.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Across the Atlantic, the Microsoft Case Attracts Curiosity

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, England, May 2

 BODY:
This university town has been transformed in the last decade by the arrival of companies like Microsoft, along with a bevy of start-ups hoping to follow in its footsteps. Now it is watching intently to see whether Microsoft's path will be divided.
"For us, Microsoft is viewed as the archetypical high-tech success story," said John Cornish, director of product marketing for ARM Holdings, a designer of microchips for hand-held devices based in Cambridge that itself has become a hometown success story. "The antitrust issues are a function of antitrust laws based on U.S. history, which differs very much from the U.K. and Europe." 
 In Britain and on the Continent, the latest chapter in the Microsoft tale -- the government's proposal last week to break the company in two -- has received prominent attention in the media. The French daily newspaper Liberation has even set up a forum on its Web site for Parisian readers to weigh in with their views.
"We're a bit further removed, but I think there is as much interest here as there is in the States," said Derek McAuley, the assistant director of Microsoft's research lab in Cambridge, Microsoft Research Ltd. "When I talk to my friends at the pub, there is an understanding of the principles of antitrust, but there is some confusion as to why this litigation is being brought to bear against us."
Indeed, for many of the new-economy start-ups in Europe, Microsoft has served as the ultimate example of an entrepreneurial success story. William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, has achieved a celebrity status in Europe that rivals the Spice Girls. And while most Europeans have watched the breakup of state-owned monopolies through deregulation, most have never seen the breakup of a self-made company.
But the European Commission, the executive unit of the European Union, has kept a careful eye on Microsoft's practices, working with the Justice Department in some instances to curb the software giant's behavior. The Brussels-based commission is investigating Microsoft's integration of certain server-related software technology that has been integrated or bundled into Windows 2000. The European Commission is also examining Microsoft's agreement to acquire 29.7 percent of Telewest, the British cable TV operator, from MediaOne.
"This is not a competition between antitrust authorities," a spokeswoman for the European Commission said. "At this stage, we trust the Justice Department. Obviously, the bottom line is that we're talking about a global marketplace and whatever happens in the U.S. will have an impact everywhere."
In 1995, the European Commission and the United States Justice Department cooperated in an antitrust investigation that Microsoft settled by changing contracts with personal computer producers and eliminating some restrictions on software makers.
Today, neither party is willing to settle, and this time around the stakes are much higher. And so is the attention the company is getting across the Atlantic.
"Microsoft has used its operating system as a marketing vehicle to the disadvantage of the customers," said a column in the German business daily Handelsblat. "At a time when the trend goes toward software that is integrated into servers on the Internet, a voluntary or a forced split-up would offer the chance for a new beginning."
Readers of Liberation have been posting messages to its Web site about the Microsoft case all week. "The dismantlement of Microsoft is not a cure-all to break the monopoly of Windows, but at least it sheds light on the general contempt for Microsoft's practices," wrote a user identified as Erion.
Not many companies in Europe compete head-on with Microsoft. More often than not, the high-tech companies in Europe that have prospered have been allied with Microsoft. From computers to hand-held devices to set-top boxes for digital television, it is hard to find a European version of Sun Microsystems or Oracle, two American companies that have lobbied hard for a breakup of Microsoft.
Even British Telecommunications P.L.C., the once state-owned telephone monopoly, has several alliances with the software maker.
"On one hand it does seem strange to try to break them up because they are the ultimate start-up made good," said Peter Bonfield, chief executive of British Telecom. "But who am I to judge the Justice Department? In terms of a company, we deal with them. We don't feel threatened by them at all."

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Keep to Torrid Pace Even as Loan Costs Rise

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 2

 BODY:
Rising interest rates, a volatile stock market and higher gasoline prices were expected to be slowing the American economy by now, especially the highly cyclical auto industry. Yet the stampede into the showrooms continues across the country, with every big domestic and foreign automaker announcing today that sales last month exceeded even last year's brisk pace.
The buyers are people like Frank DiBernardino, a 52-year-old human resources consultant in Glen Mills, Pa., who bought a huge, indigo blue GMC Yukon for $42,300 last month. Interest rate increases did not affect him, he said, because he wrote a check for the entire cost of the full-sized sport utility vehicle, using the proceeds from stock he sold in February. Nor was he troubled by the high price of gasoline. 
 "There's a certain size requirement we needed for the family," he said, noting that his three grandchildren frequently visit him and his wife.
Economists and auto executives have been predicting for the last several months that sales would soon slow significantly. That has not happened. Sales did dip very slightly in April from the record-setting pace of the first quarter of this year. But after adjusting for seasonal variations, they were still up 10.5 percent from the extremely strong levels of April last year. In fact, last month was the auto industry's best April ever, according to Ward's Auto Infobank, a data service.
Other economic indicators are also showing surprising strength: the Commerce Department said today that new-home sales leaped 4.5 percent in March, while the Conference Board in New York announced today that its index of leading indicators rose a tenth of a percent in March after edging down in February.
The auto sales report is a clear sign that robust economic growth continued into the second quarter. Auto executives and economists said the biggest reason was that buyers were still feeling confident about the economy and still had plenty of money to spend.
"Real wages are really strong and it's hard to stop this train," said Diane C. Swonk, a senior vice president and chief economist at Bank One in Chicago. "You don't need any more gains from the stock market."
Another reason for the booming business at dealerships is that automakers are still piling on rebates, discounted interest rates and other incentives in a frantic struggle to increase or maintain market share. They are using their enormous profits to subsidize prices and keep monthly payments from rising for the 80 percent of their customers who obtain loans or leases instead of paying cash.
"The fly in the ointment is that the incentives for everybody are very tough," said James Holden, the president of the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler. "With interest rates escalating, trying to hold payments constant is getting expensive."
Paul Ballew, general director of global market and industry analysis at General Motors, said that his company actually hoped that sales would slow soon, because factories were struggling to keep up with demand, and the torrid sales now might hurt future sales.
"We would like and expect to see some moderation -- it's not in our interest to have an exaggerated cycle," said Mr. Ballew, who was the Federal Reserve's top expert on the auto industry in the 1980's.
There are a few signs that the sweltering pace of sales might be cooling. Frank Ursomarso, a car dealer with many franchises in Wilmington, Del., said he had noticed a slightly slower tempo lately. He has charted a pattern over the last 44 years in which his sales trends tended to precede the overall industry's increases and declines.
"The floor traffic has been trending down a little each month," he said. "At least in this market, there's beginning to be a slower pace."
DaimlerChrysler said on Friday that it was cutting production slightly of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, which faces ever-growing competition from other midsize sport utility vehicles. Mr. Holden said the company had decided that it was better to lose a little market share than to keep increasing incentives.
William Lovejoy, G.M.'s group vice president for vehicle sales, service and marketing, also complained about the discounting. "Some of the incentives really are, we believe, extreme," he said.
G.M.'s market share was 28.3 percent in April, down from 30.6 percent a year ago. But almost all of the decline came from the company's continued weakness in the unprofitable small-car market, in which it faces competition from low-cost Korean imports. G.M. has gained share in sales of profitable full-sized sport utility vehicles, as recently redesigned models like the Chevrolet Suburban and Mr. DiBernardino's Yukon have enjoyed vibrant sales.
G.M. reported the smallest sales increase among the big automakers last month: a 2.2 percent gain overall as a 7.1 percent rise in sales of sport utilities, pickup trucks and vans more than offset a 2.5 percent decline in car sales.
G.M.'s archrival, Ford Motor, reported a different pattern. Its 15.4 percent increase in car sales led the company to an overall sparkling increase of 12.1 percent, while its sales of light trucks -- sport utilities, pickups and vans -- rose 9.9 percent.
Mr. Ballew said that this might be the first full year in which light trucks inched ahead of cars. That so far has happened only for a few months during the last three winters, which invigorated the sales of four-wheel-drive vehicles.
Market share gains for light trucks have slowed sharply from the mid-1990's, and are increasingly a result of rising sales of all-wheel-drive wagons, like the Chrysler PT Cruiser, which the auto industry chooses to classify as light trucks because of preferential regulatory treatment for such vehicles.
DaimlerChrysler's sales rose 5.3 percent, led by ever-popular sport utilities, pickup trucks and Mercedes cars.
Among other automakers announcing results today, Asian companies thrived last month, with Honda's sales rising 14.7 percent from a year ago; Toyota's sales, up 15.7 percent; Nissan's, up 31.8 percent; and Mitsubishi's up 55.2 percent.
European automakers also prospered, with BMW posting a 12.1 percent increase, while Volkswagen reported a gain of 19.3 percent.
Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for sales and marketing, said that with 25 to 30 percent of customers now leasing their automobiles, sales would not drop too quickly.
"Those people are coming back to the dealership every two or three years and they don't walk home -- they drive home in a new vehicle," he said.

HEADLINE: As Charter School Closes, Debate on Innovation's Limits

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE 

DATELINE: EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP, N.J., May 2

 BODY:
When they opened a charter school in a deserted warehouse here, Michael and Sarah Rennick had a clear vision of what it could be: a place where kids who did not fit the mold -- the geeks, the dropouts -- would flourish, a place where students might start their days later to accommodate their teenage sleepiness, a place where they would call teachers by their first names, and skateboard or play paintball in lieu of gym class.
The Regional Experiential Academic Charter High School, also known as Reach, would engage these students like no other school had, giving them trust and responsibility and getting hard work and respect in return. 
 But where the Rennicks saw potential, the state of New Jersey saw chaos. Given the freedom to learn the way they wanted, students were not learning anything at all, the state found. That was presuming students actually showed up at school, and many simply did not.
The school so threatened the students' education, officials said, that they shut it down barely eight months after it opened, just more than a year after granting Reach a charter that should have allowed it to stay open for five.
The closing last month left the Rennicks and parents complaining the state stifled its own experiment. The state set up the charter school law to reward innovation, but then refused to allow it, parents say. What looked disorganized was just different, and given time, they insist, the children and the school would have blossomed.
"We saw the opportunity for true innovative reform," said Mr. Rennick, 41. "They didn't want to hear about real reform."
The closing highlights an essential tension in the charter school movement. By definition, charter schools are alternative public schools, so they are often started by and attract parents who feel the traditional public school model is not working for their children. Many are based on unconventional ideas of how children learn best.
But as the Reach case shows, one person's alternative is another person's flaky. The case raises a host of questions. At what point does the experiment stray out of bounds, as state officials said it did here? Given that taxpayers are financing these schools, how far is the state obligated to indulge parents' ideas for innovation? And who decides whether the experiment works, and when?
These questions will come up again and again in the next few years as the first round of charter schools in 32 states come up for renewal.
"The states have got to think really carefully about how to allow meaningful experimentation," said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley. His forthcoming book "Inside Charter Schools" looks at six experiments across the country.
"In the private sector," he added, "the government has tried to regulate businesses in a way that balances allowing them to be entrepreneurial and the interests of the consumers. Whether it's health care or the airlines, or schools, we're still struggling with what that balance is."
Sarah Rennick had run a small private school near this blue-collar shore town for seven years before she and her husband decided to apply for a charter under the law New Jersey approved in 1996.
They culled their ideas from reading the works of popular educators and management consultants. Taking the idea of a Harvard education professor, Howard Gardner, that students learn in a range of "multiple intelligences" -- some, say, spatially, others logically -- the Rennicks came up with a core group of courses, from performance arts to agribusiness, that would capitalize on each student's learning style. Students would learn through hands-on projects rather than textbooks or in a classroom where the time was rigidly divided among subjects like English or math.
To measure whether the school succeeded, the founders insisted that students would have to pass the state's standardized tests -- and prove fluency in Spanish and sign language, skills they felt were necessary for a new global economy.
Reach attracted 300 students in grades 9 to 11 from high schools that ranked in the bottom third statewide in standardized test scores. Most were from working-class families and spanned a range of ethnicities and races. But the school's disagreements with the state started months before any students even arrived.
The first dispute was over starting times. The Rennicks, citing recent research suggesting most teenagers are not alert in class because they need more sleep than most adults, wanted to allow students to start their mornings at 9:30 instead of 8 if they chose. Anne O'Dea, director of the Office of School Choice for the New Jersey State Department of Education, told the Rennicks that staggering start times would disrupt the busing schedule.
Parents describe a school that transformed monosyllabic, withdrawn teenagers into chatty students who looked forward to going to school.
"It wasn't that rigid, 'Here, read these three chapters, we'll be tested on this,' " said Deborah Roe, whose son Kyle was a freshman. "It was something a little more unique. But they were pulling a strength from these kids. These were the quirky kids or geeky kids. This was a place where they fit in. They were blossoming."
A student, Jennifer Unger, 15, said: "I was learning what I have never understood, because of the way the teachers taught. Instead of the teacher just standing in front of the class and talking nonsense, they actually came up to each student and talked about the assignment."
But starting the first day of school, Ms. O'Dea said she got calls from parents complaining about courses that were promised and not offered. State requirements say students have to devote a certain number of minutes to each subject, but Reach could not account for students' time, and neither could state officials who visited the school.
"We had a lot of kids who were not engaged in learning," Ms. O'Dea said. "There were periods during the day where the students were just in a multipurpose room, not engaged at all."
The school complained it was not getting its state money from the public schools to which students would have ordinarily been assigned, which by law are required to forward the charter schools 90 percent of the per-pupil costs for each student.
But Ms. O'Dea said this was another symptom of the disorganization. In drawing up its budget, the school counted students who never enrolled at the school, but no one realized this because Reach kept such sloppy attendance records. Some students, she said, were apparently absent 40 or 50 times between September and April.
Parents insist the school should have been allowed to stay open at least until the first round of statewide tests, to give it a chance to prove whose version of the school was more accurate -- the state's or the founders'.
But with the disputes with the state escalating, the school's board of trustees voted out the Rennicks in February. By late last month, about 100 students had left, too, although the Rennicks say the students left pre-emptively because the state made it clear that it intended to shut the school.
Mrs. Roe pulled her son out two weeks before the school closed. Her voice broke as she described how she had hoped to send her other son to Reach, as well.
"This was the last-chance school for a lot of these kids," she said. "I just feel like the state just really beat it up, they wanted so much conformity. They couldn't control that uniqueness of how this school wanted to educate."

HEADLINE: Floyd Flake to Take Post With Education Company

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The Rev. Floyd H. Flake, the Queens minister and former congressman who has been widely talked about as a potential candidate for mayor of New York City, plans to announce today that he is joining Edison Schools Inc., the largest for-profit school-management company in the country, education industry officials said yesterday.
Mr. Flake is to head the company's charter school division. 
 Edison has been one of the most aggressive entrepreneurs in the mushrooming field of charter schools, publicly financed schools that operate free of much of the authority of local school districts. Mr. Flake has been a supporter of the schools, as well as an advocate of giving parents vouchers to send their children to private schools.
Mr. Flake, a Democrat who has been a leading black supporter of conservative causes, particularly in education, will continue to serve as senior pastor of the Allen A.M.E. Church in Jamaica, Queens, the officials said.
H. Christopher Whittle, the founder and president of Edison, and Benno C. Schmidt Jr., the chairman, are expected to announce the appointment of Mr. Flake this morning at a news conference at Edison's headquarters in Manhattan. Neither Mr. Flake nor Edison officials would comment yesterday.
The appointment is expected to remove Mr. Flake from the list of potential candidates for the mayoral election in November 2001. Though he is a Democrat, Mr. Flake had been courted as a mayoral candidate by state Republican leaders, who saw him as someone who could attract African-American voters to the party through his support of education reform. And he has long been familiar to Republican leaders, having endorsed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki and former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato in their campaigns for public office. Mr. Flake had told friends, however, that if he ran it would be as a Democrat.
Although Mr. Flake endorsed Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination in February, he has criticized the vice president's education policy, which opposes vouchers. Last October, Mr. Flake gave a warm introduction to George W. Bush, whom he referred to as "my homeboy," at a meeting of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative advocacy group, at which Governor Bush outlined his education proposals.
One education industry executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mr. Flake's job with Edison would not be merely a ceremonial one. Although both Mr. Whittle and Mr. Schmidt are familiar figures in both business and political circles, Mr. Flake is expected to become the company's most prominent public figure, promoting Edison's management program and curriculum to school board officials and talking about the benefits of charter schools to state and federal lawmakers.
Edison operates 79 public schools with a total enrollment of 38,000 students in 16 states and 36 cities. Most are schools for which Edison has been given a management contract by a school district concerned about a history of poor student performance. But about one-third of those are charter schools, in which Edison is accountable to a community sponsor chosen to start a school free of standard district rules.
In November, Edison announced its largest contract to date, with the Dallas Independent School District, to serve 6,500 students next school year. Edison is scheduled to open its first charter school in New York State this fall, in Rochester.
Edison is one of the largest publicly traded education companies, and its revenues have been growing quickly. They totaled $132 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1999, up from $69 million the previous year. In the six months that ended Dec. 31, revenues grew to $102 million from $60 million in the same period a year earlier. But profits have been harder to come by; the company recorded net losses of $51 million last year and $21 million in the first six months of the current fiscal year.
Mr. Flake's extensive contacts on both ends of the political spectrum testify to his philosophy of using his political power with both parties to gain economic clout for his church. The Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church, which says it has 12,000 members, is one of the largest churches in New York State, occupying a cavernous $23 million cathedral, which opened in 1997, on Merrick Boulevard in southeastern Queens.
Although he runs only a small religious school, with 500 students from prekindergarten through 8th grade, Mr. Flake has vast business experience through Allen A.M.E.'s wide-ranging interests. The church has more than a dozen affiliated corporations, some of them operated for profit, with interests in housing, transportation and financial services.
In 1997, Mr. Flake retired from Congress after 11 years, saying he wanted to spend more time tending his congregation. He has since been active in political circles as well as in education, and already has an association with Edison as well as some of its rival charter school companies.
In March, he was appointed to an Edison advisory board. He also serves on a similar board for Victory Schools Inc., a small for-profit operator of charter schools in New York City. Mr. Flake is a director of the Children's Scholarship Fund, the philanthropic venture started by Ted Forstmann, the financier.
Mr. Flake had recently considered starting his own charter school company to apply for the right to open new publicly financed schools in New York. As part of those deliberations, industry executives said, Mr. Flake was approached by Mr. Whittle about working for Edison.
George Arzt, a Democratic political consultant and friend of Mr. Flake's, said that although many people in both major parties had asked Mr. Flake to explore a mayoral candidacy, he always said that if he ran it would be as a Democrat.
"But he found at the end of an exploration period, after some time thinking about it, that he just didn't want to do it," Mr. Arzt said.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Sather's Oiler Contract an Obstacle in Rangers' Path

BYLINE: By JASON DIAMOS 

 BODY:
If Glen Sather is indeed willing to listen to overtures from the Rangers about taking over control of the team, it may come after a long wait.
Sather acknowledged recently that he had a window of opportunity to leave Edmonton, where he is president and general manager. But Cal Nichols, the chairman of the Edmonton Investors Group, which owns the Oilers, said yesterday that opportunity to leave the Oilers takes place in mid-July. The window, which Sather had written into his contract, is believed to be two weeks. "There is a time limit," Nichols said, declining to elaborate. 
 Nichols also said that Sather's status with the Oilers was tied to their payroll, and how competitive that payroll was with the rest of the league. "It's tied to our player budget," Nichols said. "It has to meet a percentage of the league average."
By that he meant that the Oilers' payroll must remain within a certain percentage -- he would not say how much -- of the league average. If it does not, Sather is free to leave during the escape window. Sather had that clause written into his contract to protect his interests in case the cash-poor Oilers began slashing the payroll by trading top players.
It is no secret that the Edmonton ownership group, made up of 37 partners, is strapped for cash, and Nichols acknowledged their economic concerns. "I don't know where the league is going," Nichols said, alluding to salaries. "We know where we're going to go. And we're not going to try to keep up with the league. We will have a player budget that we can afford."
A person in hockey familiar with Sather's thinking said that because of the Oilers' current budget situation, he may be less inclined than ever to stay in Edmonton, where he has worked with the Oilers for 24 years.
If Sather is unable contractually to use the escape clause, the Rangers could presumably try to negotiate with the Oilers for his services. When asked if the Rangers would need to contact the Oilers before talking to Sather, Nichols said: "They certainly have to talk to us. Otherwise, it would be tampering. He has two years left on his current contract. We intend to fulfill our part. If he decides to leave, that will certainly be his decision."
When reached on the golf course near his Palm Springs, Calif., home on Monday, Sather had no desire to reveal the contents of the clause. "I have zero comments to make," he said.
According to Alan Adams, a hockey expert who writes for The National Post of Canada, the Oilers had a payroll this season of $25.2 million, 22nd in the 28-team league. The Rangers, who missed the playoffs for the third straight year, had a payroll of $61.2 million, tops in the league by almost $14 million.
The dilemma for the Rangers, of course, is that if they wait until mid-July to begin speaking with Sather, they will likely miss out on some of the other candidates they may be interested in, and who may be interested in the job. Without a general manager until mid-July, the hiring of a coach would have to be delayed until late summer, as well. Training camp begins in early September.
The Rangers have been without a general manager and coach since the Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts fired Neil Smith and John Muckler on March 28. The Rangers have two possible in-house candidates for the general manager's job to fall back on should they wait in vain for Sather. They are the assistant general manager Don Maloney, who is basically serving as the interim general manager; and John Davidson, the longtime television analyst. Both Maloney and Davidson played for the Rangers, as did Sather, which makes all three all the more attractive as candidates to Madison Square Garden.
The more likely scenario, then, is the Rangers' asking for permission to speak with Sather before his window of opportunity opens. If so, the Rangers would have to work out some sort of deal with the Edmonton ownership group involving any possible package that would include money, draft picks and players.
Checketts was not available for comment yesterday. When asked if the Rangers have already asked for permission to speak with Sather, Nichols said, "No, they have not."
But Nichols did not rule out the possibility that he would listen if the Rangers came calling. "It can happen," Nichols said, when asked if the Rangers could seek permission before mid-July. "But we're not inviting it."

HEADLINE: Two Men Charged in Killing Of New Jersey Rabbi's Wife

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May, 2

 BODY:
Two New Jersey men who the authorities said were paid to kill the wife of a prominent rabbi in Cherry Hill were formally charged today and ordered held in bail, officials said.
Prosecutors said that both men had confessed to their roles in the murder of Carol Neulander, 52, who was bludgeoned to death in her living room more than five years ago. 
 Until yesterday, Rabbi Fred J. Neulander, 59, was the only suspect charged in his wife's murder, a crime that has profoundly shaken his former congregation, the largest in southern New Jersey.
Investigators have said they believe the rabbi wanted his wife dead so he could continue his affair with a woman who had a radio talk show in Philadelphia. The woman, Elaine Soncini, was pressuring him to end his marriage, and prosecutors say he feared divorce proceedings would bring out allegations of infidelity, threatening his position as leader of M'Kor Shalom, the synagogue he had founded 20 years earlier.
As in the past, Rabbi Neulander's lawyers said today that Ms. Neulander, the owner of two local bakeries, was killed during a robbery, and that their client was not connected to her death.
Rabbi Neulander, who is free on $400,000 bail, had been facing trial next month on murder and conspiracy charges. With the new revelations, Dennis Wixted, one of Rabbi Neulander's lawyers, said he would ask the judge for more time.
The two men arrested yesterday, Leonard Jenoff, 54, of Collingswood, and Paul M. Daniels, 26, of Pennsauken, are being held at the Camden County Jail on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
An unsparing confession by Mr. Jenoff, a friend of Rabbi Neulander's, added a new dimension to a crime already brimming with lurid detail. An account of the confession was reported today by The Philadelphia Inquirer.
Mr. Jenoff, who worked as a private investigator, said he believed he was being paid to kill an anti-Israeli terrorist, according to prosecutors. Rabbi Neulander, Mr. Jenoff told them, had said that such a crime would be forgiven by God. In addition to a promised payment of $30,000, the rabbi, he said, offered to help find him a job with Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. Only after hearing a news account of the crime the next morning did he learn the true identity of his victim, he said.
Although both men were charged with murder, Mr. Jenoff did not actually carry out the crime as intended. At the last minute, paralyzed by fear, he offered $7,500 to Mr. Daniels, his roommate at the time, to do the deed.
Mr. Jenoff's lawyer, Francis J. Hartman, said his client had confessed because he was overwhelmed by feelings of guilt. "He knew the rabbi's trial was coming up and he was afraid he might be acquitted, which he thought would be wrong," Mr. Hartman said. "This clearly was a spontaneous thing."
As of this evening, details about Mr. Daniels's life remained unclear. At today's arraignment, he told Judge Linda Rosenzweig of State Superior Court that he was unemployed, suffering from mental illness and living on disability payments. Mr. Daniels, who did not have a lawyer at the hearing, was ordered held on $400,000 bail. Mr. Jenoff's bail was set at $200,000.

HEADLINE: Administration Steps Up Effort For Support of China Trade Bill

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
President Clinton and his top aides, acknowledging that they still lack the votes to pass a decisive China trade measure later this month, increased pressure on Congress yesterday by arguing that the decision is as much about global leadership and the fate of Chinese reformers as it is about the interests of American business.
The emphasis on national security issues reflected a growing feeling within the administration that the economic arguments in favor of elevating trade ties with China, while strong, have proven insufficient for wavering lawmakers. Labor unions have subjected those lawmakers to an intensive campaign, as have other groups opposed to granting China permanent normal trade relations. 
 "From a national security point of view, it would in my view be a very, very unwise and precarious move to say that the United States doesn't care whether they're part of the world community or not," President Clinton told a group of independent insurance agents meeting in Washington.
Just three weeks before Congress is scheduled to vote, the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, visited New York and gave a detailed examination of the security issues at stake in the trade bill, calling it the most important chance the United States has had in a generation to help shape China's future. Mr. Berger said a rejection would threaten to set off a "downward spiral" in bilateral ties that he likened, without using the exact words, to a second cold war.
"Rejecting permanent normal trade relations would be the worst possible blow to the best possible hope we have had in 30 years to encourage positive change in China," Mr. Berger said during a lengthy address at Columbia University. If the two sides start thinking of each other as adversaries, he said, "we will find ourselves confronting each other across Asia and across the world."
The warning comes as the Clinton administration begins a final push to persuade undecided members of Congress to vote in favor of granting China the new trade status, which would allow United States companies to benefit fully from a market-opening trade agreement that paves the way for China to join the World Trade Organization. Congress is being asked to sacrifice its annual review of China's trading rights and to treat Beijing as it does most other members of the world body, based in Geneva.
Administration officials and Congressional supporters estimate that they are still about 10 votes shy of the 218 votes needed for majority approval in the House. Mr. Clinton and five members of his cabinet have focused their lobbying efforts on about 30 lawmakers, most of them Democrats, who they say will make the difference between a narrow victory or defeat. Approval by the Senate appears more certain.
On Capitol Hill yesterday, opposing sides both claimed that the momentum was shifting their way after the two-week House recess. But there were signs that both sides were nervous about the final vote.
Representative Bill Archer, a Texas Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over the China trade bill, warned business leaders yesterday that the outcome remains in jeopardy.
"I'm more concerned about getting a majority of votes today than I was four weeks ago," Mr. Archer said. "Failure to pass this would create an unworkable trade environment that will slop over to the rest of the world."
Administration officials said yesterday that President Clinton has allotted a large block of his own schedule in coming weeks for lobbying members of Congress.
The president is planning a visit to a farm community to advertise how the trade agreement might benefit farmers, who potentially could export more grain and meat. White House officials are also considering inviting former presidents and cabinet secretaries to the White House to highlight the fact that a bipartisan coalition of former national leaders favors the measure.
Last night, Mr. Clinton invited a dozen members of Congress to join him at the White House residence for a discussion on China. Mr. Clinton arranged for Martin Lee, a prominent Hong Kong opposition leader who favors granting China the new trade privileges, to attend and speak to the lawmakers.
But the president has so far declined to accede to Republican demands that he arrange a prime time, nationwide television address on China, a step Republican supporters of the trade measure argue is necessary to line up enough Democratic support. Administration officials said privately that the president does not wish to commit to such a speech unless the national networks agree to put it on the air, a tough sell during "sweeps" month, when the networks compete fiercely to attract viewers.
Opposition to granting China elevated trading rights is dogged. Labor unions as well as religious, consumer and environmental groups have put heavy election-year pressure on Democrats to vote no.
Unions have argued that the trade agreement will encourage United States companies to shift production to China, where, union officials say, low wages and lax labor standards make for unfair competition. About two-thirds of House Democrats are expected to vote no.
Most Republicans, reflecting overwhelming business support, say they will vote yes. But a minority of hard-liners in the party accuse the Clinton administration of appeasing Beijing, awarding it long-sought trading rights even as they say the nation steps up repression at home and threatens to become more belligerent abroad.
China is likely to join the World Trade Organization, a regulatory body, even if Congress decides not to grant permanent normal trade relations. But United States companies would not get many of the benefits unless Congress agrees to give up its annual vote.
Administration officials argue that the trade agreement with China is a bonanza: The Chinese made all the trade concessions, while Congress just has to agree to treat it like other trading partners. But as the lobbying campaign enters the final stretch and union opposition has proven effective, the administration is increasingly relying on national security arguments to sway uncommitted lawmakers.
Mr. Berger said yesterday that the agreement is so beneficial to United States companies that want to do business in China -- and requires so many concessions by China's Communist Party-controlled bureaucracy -- that Beijing would view rejection of permanent normal trade relations as a seismic shift in United States strategy. "The Chinese government and people simply will not believe we rejected it for economic reasons," he said. "They will suspect that rejection is a strategic decision to pursue a course of confrontation, contention and containment."
Failure to pass the accord would rebound to the advantage of numerous hard-liners in Beijing who have opposed World Trade Organization concessions all along, Mr. Berger said. In such a scenario, he said, he considers it likely that China, already mired in a high-level debate about ties with the United States, would turn inward, become more repressive and adopt a more militant stance toward Taiwan.
He also said rejection would be a slap in the face to America's Asian allies, especially Japan and South Korea, both of which have urged Congress to elevate trade ties with China. He said Asian allies would view a no vote as a sign that America has become an "unreliable, unilateral" nation that has lost its capacity to lead.
In a boost for supporters of the bill, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who has opposed granting China trade privileges in the annual votes, said yesterday that he would support permanent normal trading status. Another Democrat who had been uncommitted, Lois Capps of California, also declared her support.
But over the recess, two supporters of the annual vote said they would vote against the bill. They are Representative Steve Buyer, Republican of Indiana, and Representative Bill Luther, Democrat of Minnesota.
In a sign that the administration and its Congressional supporters need more inducements to recruit fence-sitters, Mr. Archer, the House Republican, reversed his earlier position and said he would consider parallel legislation to the trade bill.
Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat in the House, has proposed creating an executive body that would have powers to monitor and report on China compliance with international labor and human rights standards, as well as its adherence to trade agreements.

Blessed Are the Weak

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
So this is the way the euro begins: not with a bang but a whimper.
Many enthusiasts for Europe's new unified currency, introduced only 16 months ago, expected the euro to quickly become a powerful rival to the dollar; they also expected the euro to be a very strong currency, largely because of its international role. This never made much sense if you thought it through; but anyway, it hasn't happened. Introduced at a value of roughly $1.17, the euro has been more or less steadily declining ever since; last week it briefly fell almost to 90 cents before staging a modest recovery. 
 As it happens, when it comes to the euro I am an ugly American. That is, I am one of those naysayers who was never convinced that a unified European currency was a particularly good idea, and always suspected that Europeans were enthusiastic about monetary union because it gave them an excuse not to think about other problems. So you might expect me to be gloating over the euro's slide.
But the truth is that the weakness of the euro is not a sign of economic malaise. European economies are actually doing somewhat better than most outsiders, myself included, expected. And the currency's decline despite that good news says more about the rationality of markets than about Europe's monetary experiment.
Europe's three fundamental problems -- the problems that monetary union gave Europeans an excuse to ignore -- are jobs, jobs and jobs. An old joke among economists is that the European definition of a boom is a year in which the unemployment rate rises less than usual. Behind this poor employment performance lies the phenomenon of "eurosclerosis": a labor market so clogged with government rules and regulations that European companies have had little incentive to create new jobs -- especially the low-wage jobs that in the United States provide the young and minority groups with a first step into the world of work. Europeans have, of course, been caustic about the American model. And this rhetoric, whose implications we ugly Americans in turn tend to ridicule as a policy of no jobs at good wages, continues unabated.
But if you look at what is actually happening in Europe, you discover that in the last couple of years quite a lot of job creation has in fact taken place -- and much of it involves the creation of precisely the kind of low-wage employment that European governments supposedly oppose. The telltale sign is what is happening to output per worker; in the countries where employment is expanding fastest, like Spain, productivity is actually declining. This is, believe it or not, a good sign, an indicator that marginal workers are finally finding jobs.
What naive Americans failed to understand, it turns out, was the talent of at least some European societies for creative hypocrisy. The government of France, for example, continues to talk the talk of horror at the brutal American model of capitalism. In reality, however, even as the French government introduces seemingly anti-market policies like a mandated reduction in the workweek, it has quietly allowed companies to exploit loopholes in the system -- using the shortened official workweek as an excuse to scrap old rules about worker scheduling, employing vast numbers of part-time workers, and so on. The result is that while unemployment in much of Europe is still extremely high by U.S. standards, and especially so among the young, it is finally starting to come down.
Does this mean that the weakness of the euro is unjustified, that markets are not giving Europe enough credit? In a word, yes. Look at the interest rates: 10-year euro bonds yield about 5.2 percent, not much less than the 6.1 percent yield on dollar bonds. So anyone who buys a dollar bond instead of a euro bond is in effect forecasting that the euro will be worth barely more 10 years from now than it is today. This is just not plausible when you bear in mind that the United States is running a huge trade deficit -- and has inflation that, while not severe, is significantly above the rate in Europe.
The weakness of the euro, then, is not a verdict on the European economy. It's just one of those things that markets do now and then; and it, too, shall pass.

HEADLINE: Ethics Inquiry Sees No Breach In Pataki Trips

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The New York State Ethics Commission has found that Gov. George E. Pataki and his aides did not violate the law in allowing a nonprofit trade group largely financed by companies lobbying his office to pay for trips he took to Hungary in 1995 and 1996.
The commission concluded that the trips did raise "ethical concerns" because the nonprofit group, the Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce U.S.A., raised money from the companies specifically for the trips. 
 The commission, which is controlled by the governor's appointees, said its inquiry had determined that the governor and his aides were not aware that the group was soliciting money from the companies, which included Philip Morris, Pepsico and two pharmaceuticals giants, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
"There is no evidence -- either from the witnesses interviewed or the documents reviewed -- that anyone in the governor's office (or elsewhere in state government) knew that H.A.C.C. was soliciting funds for the trips," the commission's executive director, Donald P. Berens Jr., wrote in a letter released yesterday in which it announced its findings.
"Accordingly," the letter said, "the commission has concluded that neither the governor nor any state officer or employee violated the state ethics law or sought to circumvent the law in connection with H.A.C.C.'s funding of the governor's trips."
In the letter, which was sent to three advocacy groups that filed a complaint about the trips, Mr. Berens noted that one of the governor's aides had asked the commission before the first trip whether the administration was required to examine the chamber's finances, and the commission had responded that it was not. Mr. Berens said that when Mr. Pataki's predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, had accepted a trip from the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the panel had not required him to request information about that group's backers.
Still, Mr. Berens added, the commission would change its rules to require that Mr. Pataki and his successors, when taking trips financed by outside groups, ask whether the groups are raising funds for the trips and from whom.
"Where such a solicitation occurs, the potential for improper influence is heightened," Mr. Berens said. "A corporation may respond to the solicitation in the hope of currying favor with the state and thereby advancing its own private interests."
During its investigation, the ethics panel learned that once Governor Pataki decided to take the first trip, his senior economic adviser, Charles A. Gargano, asked the group to pay for it. According to tax records and the commission's findings, the group had little if any money at the time.
Mr. Berens did not say whether Mr. Gargano asked the chamber if it could afford the trip. Right before the trip, the chamber received a total of $40,000 from the companies it solicited.
The chamber, Philip Morris and some of the other companies indicated in interviews last fall that the donations to the chamber were not tied to the trips. The commission said it had determined that they were but had decided not to take action against the chamber or the companies.
Under state ethics rules, companies with interests before the governor are barred from paying for his travel. In this case, the companies financed the trips, with donations of $5,000 to $20,000, by funneling the money through the chamber.
The commission had allowed the chamber to pay for the trips because the chamber did not have business in Albany.
Walter Ayres, a spokesman for the commission, said it believed that it would not be appropriate to penalize the chamber and companies because the commission had never explicitly banned such arrangements.
Philip Morris's links to the trips helped to renew scrutiny of the company's activities in Albany, where it has long been a lobbying force. But after disclosures about its efforts to court the governor and legislators, the company suffered several defeats in the state capital.
Its chief lobbyist was fined and banned for violating disclosure rules, and the state nearly doubled the cigarette tax. Last month, the Legislature completed passage of a bill over the tobacco industry's objections that would require that cigarettes be made less likely to cause fires. The bill now is before the governor.
The ethics panel opened its inquiry last fall after The New York Times published several articles about the financing of the trips, which were a combination of trade mission and family vacation in the homeland of Mr. Pataki's paternal grandparents.
At the time, Mr. Pataki said no one in the administration knew anything about the chamber's backers, and that the ethics rules had been strictly followed. He declined to disclose the cost of the trips and the amount the chamber paid.
In response to the commission's findings, Mr. Pataki's spokesman, Michael McKeon, read a statement yesterday: "As we have said all along, what we did was right and proper. The commission has now verified that we followed the advice and guidance that they provided us, which were the same practices used by the previous administration."
Blair Horner, legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, one of the three advocacy groups that filed the complaint, said that if the administration was to be believed, it was startling that no Pataki aides had scrutinized the chamber's finances.
"This shows that the administration was ethically tone deaf when this deal was first being put together," Mr. Horner said.
The commission has five members. The governor appoints the chairman and two other members, and the state comptroller and state attorney general each appoints one. The current chairman is Paul Shechtman, a former criminal justice adviser to Mr. Pataki.
When asked about the trips last fall, the chamber's president, Monika Szarka-Elling, said she did not know why Philip Morris and the other corporations contributed to the chamber, which was founded in 1992 and is based in New Jersey.
Executives at Philip Morris, the world's largest tobacco company, said at the time that its donations had nothing to do with the trips.
Ms. Szarka-Elling did not respond to two messages at her office. Peggy Roberts, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris, declined to comment.
Philip Morris said last fall that it gave $10,000 to the chamber a week before the first trip, $10,000 a few weeks before the second, and another $10,000 a year later. (In its report, the commission said the company gave $20,000 before the second trip.) A senior company executive also attended a reception in Hungary on the first trip.
Mr. Berens said the panel had determined that before both trips, Ms. Szarka-Elling sent letters to Philip Morris and the other companies asking for money; the letters "referred to H.A.C.C.'s seeking funds for the governor's proposed trip," Mr. Berens said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans Tougher Stance On Safety of Biotech Food

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN and MARC LACEY 

 BODY:
The Clinton administration plans to announce today that it is strengthening its policy on regulating the safety of genetically engineered foods, an administration official said last night.
Under the plan, biotechnology companies would be required to talk to regulators at the Food and Drug Administration about the safety of the foods before they are sold, the official said. Under the current policy, that discussion is voluntary, leading critics to say that regulators may not even know about all of the genetically engineered foods being sold. 
 The nation's largest food companies had asked the administration for the change to help calm the growing consumer fears about the safety of such foods, which are now included as ingredients in most processed foods sold in American supermarkets.
"The goal is to increase consumer confidence in the food supply," said the official, who would speak only on the condition of not being named.
But some consumer groups criticized the plan last night, saying that it did not go far enough. The groups have demanded that such foods be labeled and tested for safety before they are approved for sale.
"Talking is not testing," said Andrew Kimbrell, director of the Center for Food Safety, a nonprofit group in Washington. The center has filed a lawsuit against the F.D.A., contending that its current policy on genetically engineered foods is illegal.
The nation's largest trade group of food companies quickly praised the administration's plans.
"We believe the steps as they have been outlined to us are appropriate and responsive to the discussions that we've been having with F.D.A. officials and other government officials over the last few months," said Gene Grabowski, vice president for communications at the trade group, the Grocery Manufacturers of America.
Dr. Jane E. Henney, the food agency administrator, is expected to announce the changes at a news conference that may also include Dan Glickman, the secretary of agriculture.
The administration is also expected to ask for comments on new guidelines for food companies that want to label their products as being free of genetically engineered ingredients. Without those guidelines, regulators can easily challenge companies that try to label their foods.
The administration has repeatedly assured consumers that all genetically engineered foods now being sold are safe to eat. But officials are under pressure to do more to reassure consumers because of a growing global debate over the safety of genetically engineered plants and the foods that are harvested from them.
European countries no longer buy corn grown by America's export-dependent farmers because of the concerns. And consumer fears are now spreading to Asian countries like Japan, and more slowly to the United States.
A few American food companies, worried that consumers could boycott their products, have decided to avoid genetically engineered ingredients. Frito Lay, for instance, has asked the farmers that supply it with corn not to plant genetically engineered varieties.
Genetically engineered crops, first sold in 1995, have quickly become a success. Farmers have bought up the altered seeds, which can save them time and boost productivity.

HEADLINE: Albany Accord on Debt Plan Clears Way for Passing Budget

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 2

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki and state legislative leaders announced an agreement today to restrict the state's much-maligned borrowing practices, clearing the way for final passage of one of the timeliest state budgets in recent years.
Mr. Pataki had refused to sign off on a final budget deal until a debt reform package was agreed on. The proposal hammered out today would for the first time impose a cap on the amount of debt that the state can carry at one time. The deal on debt limits means that the Legislature will be able to begin passing budget bills in the next few days. 
 The debt issue is critically important to Mr. Pataki, a Republican, in large part because he has been facing sharp criticism from conservative groups and independent budget analysts for expanding the state's overall indebtedness, even as the state has amassed multibillion-dollar budget surpluses from year to year.
New York's debt has grown by more than 30 percent in the six years since the governor took office, bringing the total to more than $37 billion, the largest for any state in the country. The debt is one of the major reasons that the state's credit rating on Wall Street is among the poorest in the nation. It is also forcing the state to spend nearly $4 billion a year on debt service.
The budget that Mr. Pataki and the leaders agreed upon calls for spending $77.5 billion to provide hefty spending increases for education, health care, transportation, public colleges and universities and other programs. The finished product reflects the state's continued economic prosperity by relying heavily on the surging tax revenues that are largely generated by huge profits on Wall Street.
The budget also provides a bounty of new tax cuts that would save New Yorkers $1.3 billion a year when fully phased in over the next four years. The biggest part is $330 million to cut a tax on utility companies that is passed on to consumers each month. The package also establishes tax deductions for college tuition costs, provides tax credits for low-wage workers and gives new tax breaks to married couples who are paying higher income taxes than if they were single.
At a news conference today at the State Capitol, Mr. Pataki said the budget struck a balance among new spending for education, tax cuts and larger cash reserves to balance future budgets. He also said the plan to restrict the state's rapidly growing borrowing would help place the state on firm financial footing.
"This budget includes the most fundamental debt reform in the history of New York State," Mr. Pataki said.
The state budget was due on April 1, but for the 16th consecutive year, the Legislature and the governor failed to meet that deadline.
But the agreement reached today almost certainly means that the governor and the leaders will complete their work this year earlier than they have in recent memory. Last year, for example, the budget was adopted on Aug. 4 -- 126 days overdue.
To breach the gap between the deadline and this week's action, the Legislature had to pass contingency budgets that kept spending at last year's levels. While the delay does not cost the taxpayers more, it does impose hardship on localities, particularly school districts that need to know the amount of state money to expect so that they can determine their own budgets.
Mr. Pataki's aides said the state's general fund budget, which consists of revenues from state taxes and fees that are not committed to specific purposes, would rise by about 4.7 percent, or nearly $1.8 billion more than last year's $37 billion. The governor had proposed a 2.3 percent, or nearly $1 billion, increase in general fund spending.
But this year's total state spending would increase by about $4.1 billion, or 5.7 percent, to $77.5 billion, according to another calculation. That calculation includes federal money that passes through the state budget and other money that is not included in the general fund. Mr. Pataki had proposed an increase of 5.5 percent, or $3.9 billion, in total state spending.
Mr. Pataki's budget officials could not be specific about a third calculation that is used to measure the budget, known as state funds. But officials said they expected that figure -- which includes the general fund, debt service, capital projects and several special dedicated revenue funds -- to be significantly higher than the $49.8 billion that it was last year.
Mr. Pataki and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and the majority leader of the State Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, predicted today that the entire budget would be passed as early as this week by the Legislature.
The biggest spending increase in the budget goes to education. It provides a record $1.2 billion, or 8.7 percent, rise in state aid to public school districts statewide, bringing the total amount spent on education to about $13 billion. New York City is expected to receive about $400 million of the total increase.
The budget also requires the state to continue the planned expansion of its program to provide prekindergarten classes to all 4-year-olds, and to reduce class sizes in the early grades, at a cost of nearly $200 million. That program was included at the insistence of Democrats who control the Assembly.
The budget also contained initiatives sought by Republicans who control the Senate. They include expanding a program that subsidizes prescription drugs for the low-income elderly, at a cost of about $180 million.
The agreement also adds $750 million in a reserve fund to hedge against an economic downturn and to make up for revenue lost to future tax cuts that the governor and the Legislature had enacted in previous years. Mr. Pataki had insisted that the money be placed in reserve.
At Mr. Pataki's insistence, the lawmakers also agreed to pass a law that would, for the first time, impose limits on state debt, to be phased in over the next 10 years. Ultimately, it would restrict the state's outstanding debt to no more than 4 percent of New York residents' personal income.
Now, the state's $37 billion debt load is more than 6 percent of total personal income, whereas most other states have a debt load that is about 3 percent of personal income, said Colleen Woodell, the director of public finance for Standard & Poor's, the debt rating agency.
Ms. Woodell said it was encouraging that state leaders were taking action to restrain future borrowing and to reduce the state's existing debt. "It's a good thing that they are adopting this," she said. "But the question is, can they live with it?"
New York has the largest debt of any state, and analysts have urged Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders to use the state's recent series of budget surpluses to make early payments on some of that debt, thereby reducing the principal and lowering future interest payments.
But the state's debt has ballooned since Mr. Pataki took office in 1995, when the total indebtedness totaled $28.2 billion. The state now spends nearly $4 billion, or 5 percent of all state revenues, to make payments on that debt. The median among the states is 3.5 percent, according to budget experts.
 
THE HIGHLIGHTS
What the Budget Agreement Calls For
 
Gov. George E. Pataki and leaders of the Legislature have reached agreement on a state budget of $77.5 billion, a 5.6 percent increase over last year. The largest share is devoted to education and transportation. The legislators accepted some of Mr. Pataki's plan for debt reform but rejected his proposals to build a new prison and expand the lottery to include Powerball.
 
TAX CUTS -- The budget would cut $1.3 billion in taxes, with the bulk of the cuts phased in over the next four years. About $330 million would come from reducing a state tax on electric power. The state would also become the first to allow parents to deduct college tuition -- up to $10,000 per student -- from their income taxes. And the budget plan would eliminate the "marriage penalty," under which married couples often pay more in income tax than two single people.
 
EDUCATION -- State officials plan to increase school aid by $1.2 billion over last year, directing about $190 million to a program that provides prekindergarten classes to all 4-year-olds and reduces class sizes in the early grades. The Legislature also adopted Mr. Pataki's plan to recruit more teachers for public schools.
 
TRANSPORTATION -- Lawmakers agreed to spend $17.1 billion over five years on mass transit projects and an additional $17.1 billion for improvements to bridges and highways. The transit money includes money for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to plan a Second Avenue subway line that runs the full length of Manhattan.
 
HEALTH CARE -- A program that subsidizes prescription drugs for the elderly would be expanded at a cost of $180 million. The budget also contains a 5 percent increase in revenue sharing for local governments to help pay for a new program that would provide medical coverage for as many as one million uninsured New Yorkers.
 
DEBT PAYMENT -- The budget would triple, to $750 million, the size of a two-year-old fund used to repay the state's $37 billion debt, and adopt a series of fiscal measures that restricts borrowing and places a cap on future debt.

HEADLINE: Euro's Anemic Showing

 BODY:

To the Editor:
For those of us living in countries that are contemplating joining the euro, the currency's performance is ominous ("Decline of the Euro," editorial, April 29). The euro's decline is a reflection of the structural weaknesses of Continental economies (extremely high taxation, inflexible labor markets, protectionist trade policies) that will continue to inhibit euro-zone economic growth. 
 The euro is a solid currency, but it is not dynamic, for although the countries that use it are wealthy and happy, they are also expensive and inefficient compared with Britain and inert compared with the United States.

HEADLINE: Behind Korea Meeting, a Million Troops in a Standoff

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: PANMUNJOM, Korea

 BODY:
For American and South Korean soldiers stationed in the demilitarized zone that divides the two Koreas, days begin with a blast of martial music and Communist propaganda blaring from gigantic loudspeakers that North Korea has erected just across the heavily fortified border.
The monotonous diatribe, which urges "one and all to join the workers' paradise," is often broken by jarring explosions that send the soldiers scrambling to determine whether North Korean troops or wild animals are invading nearby minefields. More often than not, the intruders are mule deer. But sometimes they are North Korean infiltrators who incite deadly gun battles. 
 This is the front line of the tense demilitarized zone, a fiercely armed no man's land of barbed wire and big guns, where well over a million opposing troops are locked in a highly combustible standoff in a place that President Clinton once called the "scariest" on Earth.
As the leaders of the two Koreas prepare for their first summit meeting since their countries went to war 50 years ago, the soldiers whose sole mission is to defend against a North Korean attack say the danger of another all-out conflict remains high.
"With such a heavy concentration of manpower and weapons located in this relatively small area, there is great potential for fighting to break out at any time," said Lt. Kwon Byung Su of an elite South Korean front-line unit on border patrol.
A half-million South Korean soldiers guard the border, backed up by 36,000 American service members and some of the most advanced military hardware available. Their assignment is widely considered one of the most difficult military postings, because the hard-line North Korean government, which has amassed one million troops along the border, seems determined to reunify the peninsula by force.
The demilitarized zone, a 150-mile-long three-mile-wide stretch of rolling hills, craggy mountains and farmland, was formed by the 1953 armistice. The village of Panmunjom, which straddles the demarcation line that runs down the middle of the zone, was destroyed by tank fire in the war. But it now serves as the site of truce talks. The northern and southern borders of the zone are lined with high fences crowned with barbed wire.
Although most clashes in the zone resemble a game of a cat and mouse and are nothing more than saber rattling, they sometimes turn deadly. More than 1,000 South Koreans, 50 Americans and numerous North Koreans have died in skirmishes along the border since the armistice officially ended the fighting.
Perhaps the most notorious incident involved the ax killings of two United States soldiers by a gang of North Koreans in 1976 in a dispute over tree pruning. In a gunbattle in 1992, three North Korean soldiers were killed and two South Korean soldiers were wounded after the North Koreans had crossed into the southern part of the demilitarized zone. Last year, a naval skirmish resulted in the sinking of a North Korean boat and the deaths of at least 20 North Korean sailors.
Underscoring the threat posed by North Korea, the United States recently distributed 14,000 gas masks to dependents of American soldiers and embassy workers in South Korea. That is because military intelligence officers have determined that North Korea has thousands of tons of chemical and biological weapons that the experts predict would be used in storming the border and taking Seoul, the South Korean capital, 30 miles away.
Some soldiers said they hoped that the anniversary of the start of the Korean War, which began on June 25, 1950, would remind the world that the conflict had not been resolved.
"I think most people don't know very much about the Korean War, and they take freedom for granted, or they just don't realize the costs," said Phillip McNeal, 21, an Army specialist from Chicago.
In his two years on the line, Chung Eup, 24, a South Korean lieutenant, has never encountered a North Korean soldier. But he said that possibility was always in the back of mind.
"Yes, it's stressful, but we think it's every Korean man's duty to serve his country here," Lieutenant Chung said as he inspected fences for signs of infiltration.
Military officials said 1 of every 100 South Korean soldiers have had at least one encounter with a North Korean counterpart in his mandatory service of two years and two months. Many encounters occur on special patrols beyond the southern boundary. Soldiers told of tense, almost surreal, encounters with North Korean troops in grassy fields of the demilitarized zone late at night.
In those situations, the soldiers said the opposing troops often confronted each other face to face, arms drawn, in a stare down. Usually the soldiers back away from one another and continue on their ways. In one case fraught with symbolism, the soldiers exchanged cigarettes before moving on. Not all such encounters end so amicably, and there have been numerous casualties in late-night gunfights that were not made public.
Although North Korea has publicly sought to improve its diplomatic relations in recent months, senior United States and South Korean military officials said Pyongyang had also been busy beefing up its military, acquiring advanced weaponry and conducting rigorous exercises.
"North Korea remains the major threat to stability and security in northeast Asia and is the country most likely to involve the United States in a large-scale war," Gen. Thomas A. Schwartz, commander of the American forces in South Korea, testified to the Senate in March.
Echoing that, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry said that although his agency supported the summit meeting, scheduled for June 12 to June 14 in Pyongyang, it still considered North Korea "a very dangerous and aggressive enemy."
In the past decade, as North Korea suffered a devastating recession and severe shortages of food and fuel, its ability to attack the South with conventional armed forces was widely thought to have declined. But South Korean and American military officials now say that despite economic woes and widespread famine, North Korea has replaced much of its obsolete weaponry, and its troops are well prepared to go to battle.
In his testimony, General Schwartz said that over the last year, North Korea had done more to arrest a decline in readiness among its troops and to improve its military capability than in the last five years combined. The general said North Korea had greatly improved its ground forces, including the deployment of large numbers of long-range multiple-rocket launchers and self-propelled guns near the demilitarized zone.
General Schwartz said North Korea had installed antitank barriers; taken new combat positions along major routes between Pyongyang, its capital, and the border; strengthened its coastal defenses; procured fighter aircraft; and taken steps to increase its missile range.
There is some growing concern in the South Korean military that new draftees have a weakened sense of North Korea as an enemy.
"We have noticed that some younger troops don't have the same contempt for North Korean troops as past generations," said Lieutenant Kwon, a public affairs officer. "They know that we are enemies. But they also realize that we are same people. It's not like we are Iran and Iraq."
Kim Myong Won, 22, a recruit who had just finished basic training and was about to begin his first tour on the front line, said: "We will fight to defend ourselves. But we really don't consider them enemies. Especially with the summit talks, there is the possibility of reunification."
Lieutenant Kwon said that with a little ideological training and field experience, he expected Mr. Kim would eventually see things differently. "Nothing has changed," Lieutenant Kwon said. "We teach our soldiers to shoot to kill."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Changes in the earned-income tax credit are a success in the effort to fix welfare, but there's room for improvement.

BYLINE: By J. Bradford DeLong; This column appears here every Thursday. J. Bradford DeLong is a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley and co-editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. Four economic analysts -- Professor DeLong, Jeff Madrick, Virginia Postrel and Alan B. Krueger -- rotate as contributors.

 BODY:
THE 1990's began with a burst of intellectual and political energy in support of genuine welfare reform. By the beginning of the decade mainstream political opinion had finally coalesced around the idea that the welfare system based on Aid to Families With Dependent Children -- cash payments to nonworking single mothers -- was a failure. Welfare recipients remained very poor, the incentives the system gave them were horrible, and the lessons implicitly taught about responsibility and opportunity were destructive.
It seemed better, according to the consensus of opinion makers, to make a big push to shift people from welfare to work. The idea was to bolster the wages of low-skilled workers, to provide training programs so that long-term A.F.D.C. recipients could build enough skills to escape the system and to offer job-search assistance so that they could find employers who would pay for those skills. Such an extensive welfare overhaul would be more expensive for the government than would simple cash grants to nonworking single mothers, but to many liberals and conservatives it seemed worth the price. 
 The 1996 welfare reform of Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole and Bill Clinton, however, largely dropped the ball. Instead of making a big push on training and job searching, it basically gave each state a blank check -- roughly equal to the money the federal government had formerly spent on welfare -- to spend as it saw fit. A few states have used their money to do remarkable and innovative things. But a lot more have paid lip-service to the goal of reform, and used large chunks of the federal money for programs that the state budget used to pay for, reducing rather than increasing the total amount of money spent to help the poor.
True, the number of people on welfare has dropped significantly. But in spite of a booming economy, the incomes of the poor have not risen significantly. Very little money has been spent on building skills. Little has been devoted to providing assistance in finding jobs. No one knows but everyone fears what will happen to America's single-parent poor when the boom ends and the next recession begins.
One piece of the original welfare reform program, however, was quietly put into place in 1993, as part of President Clinton's deficit-reduction program. And unlike the 1996 law, it may prove to be the most enduring and effective antipoverty instrument the federal government has ever devised.
The instrument is the earned-income tax credit. While already in existence, in 1993 the government significantly expanded the program so that it now gives a family with two children a 40-cent payment from the Internal Revenue Service for every dollar of income earned up to $9,500. A part-time $8-an-hour job thus becomes, after taxes, an $11.20 an hour job for the working poor.
The tax credit means that a two-child family with a full-time minimum-wage worker is lifted -- just barely -- above the poverty line. Two economists at the Economic Policy Institute (epinet.org), Max Sawicky and Robert Cherry, have found that more than five of six families eligible for the tax credit actually collect it, and that the credit manages to push more families above the poverty line than any other government program.
Is the earned-income tax credit perfect? No. But, like democracy, it is better than any of the alternatives.
There are three standard criticisms of the program: It is a subsidy to low-wage employers, and low-wage employers should be discouraged; it penalizes working-class two-earner families; and it is overly bureaucratic and complicated.
The first criticism seems completely wide of the mark. If we want to raise the wages of the working poor, we want to see a lot of employers competing to hire them. To provide subsidies to employers of low-wage labor is to raise their numbers and so increase the bargaining power of low-wage workers in the labor market.
The second criticism has a point. As the income of a two-child family increases from $12,500, to $30,850, it gradually loses its $3,816 tax credit. When this reduction is combined with the 15.3 percent Social Security wage tax paid by both employee and employer and the payment of income tax at a 15 percent rate, the burden on American families earning $28,000 ends up with them paying the highest marginal federal tax rates of anyone.
An easy way to make the earned- income tax credit a better program would be to reduce the speed with which the credit is phased out as income rises. But that takes money. Politicians are almost always more excited about seeing their signature on some new initiative than about improving effective but existing programs. Moreover, the political leaders who made the credit their signature initiative -- former Senators Russell Long and Lloyd Bentsen in particular -- are mostly long gone from Washington.
And the third criticism has a point as well. The earned-income tax credit is a social insurance program administered by the Internal Revenue Service, an agency whose core mission does not involve lifting the incomes of the working poor. Moreover, the tax credit's details are unnecessarily complex: the family as defined by the earned-income tax credit is not necessarily the family as defined by the rest of the tax code, and the income concept that determines whether you qualify for the program is not necessarily the income that appears anywhere else on your tax form.
But this flaw could be overcome with relatively modest changes. Mr. Cherry and Mr. Sawicky have made a proposal to fix it by simplifying the tax credit and combining it with other child-centered tax provisions into a universal unified child credit.
Most important of all, even if nothing is done to improve the program right away, the validity of these criticisms should not blot out the tax credit's broad success: $32 billion a year channeled to 15 million working poor and lower-middle-class families to increase their real wages and make work pay.
I wonder whether the training and skill-building and job-search components of the original 1990's welfare reform dream would now be regarded as equal successes, had they been undertaken, too.

Interest Rates Move Upward As Fed Cites Wage Gains

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Interest rates shot higher yesterday after the Federal Reserve reported that wages were rising across the country and investors wondered if that news would make the central bank more aggressive in its effort to slow economic growth.
The report on economic conditions in Federal Reserve Districts around the country said that "there were more frequent reports of intensifying wage pressures as shortages of workers persisted in all districts." 
 The Fed report also said economic growth was moderate to strong across the country. That assessment was re-enforced by the report that factory orders jumped a higher-than-expected 2.2 percent in March.
The new information on inflationary pressures comes after the report of a surprisingly sharp jump in consumer prices, excluding food and energy, in March and an increase in total worker compensation in the first quarter. Together the reports have increased speculation that the Federal Reserve may decide to raise its short-term interest rate target by a half of a percentage point when policymakers meet May 16.
William C. J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, noted the rise in inflation in March in a speech yesterday and said "we have to keep especially alert now."
In the Treasury market, the investor concern was reflected in a jump in the yield on the two-year note, which is sensitive to expected policy moves by the Federal Reserve. The yield rose to 6.74 percent, from 6.68 percent Tuesday, and is the highest it has been in five years. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 5/32, to 99 9/32.
This was a sharp rise in yield given the fact that the Treasury announced yesterday that it would reduce its issuance of two-year notes as part of its program to cut government borrowing as the budget surplus grows. A cut in issuance normally encourages buying.
The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 6.39 percent, from 6.30 percent on Tuesday. The price fell 21/32, to 100 26/32. The yield on the 30-year bond climbed to 6.11 percent from 6.01 percent on Tuesday.
Until now most forecasters had said they thought the Fed would raise its interest rate target just a quarter of a point, which would be the sixth such move since June. That would bring the Federal funds rate, the overnight rate on loans between banks to 6.25 percent.
Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, said if Fed policy makers were meeting today, "knowing what they know today, they would probably go half a percentage point."
William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, did not want to predict the size of the next Fed move. But he did say that the strength of the economy and the new signs of inflationary pressure would force the Fed to push interest rates higher than he had thought.
"I don't want to stake my reputation on predicting the May move," he said. "But I want to stress that the Fed has a lot more work to do."
Yesterday he raised his forecast for how high the Fed will have to push the federal funds rate. Mr. Dudley is now predicting that it will be up to 7 percent by the end of the year, a quarter of a point higher, and at 7.5 percent in 12 months.

HEADLINE: Missile Defense, Then and Now

BYLINE: By Robert C. McFarlane; Robert C. McFarlane was national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan from 1983 to 1985.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As President Bill Clinton prepares to decide whether to deploy a ballistic missile defense system or to wait for further testing to be completed, it may be useful to recall the history that has brought us to this point.
When President Reagan came to office almost 20 years ago, the Soviet Union had a huge advantage -- 3 to 1 -- in highly accurate ballistic missiles that had developed over the previous 10 years. Our ability to deter a first-strike attack with an adequate force of survivable counterstrike weapons -- the concept of mutual assured destruction -- had become tenuous in the minds of sensible American leaders, both Republican and Democrat. 
 Mr. Reagan had considered but was unimpressed by the theory of mutual assured destruction. He believed strongly that keeping the peace through a threat to annihilate humankind was immoral, and he came to office with the hope of starting work on a defensive system. His vision was morally inspired and deeply felt.
Despite his passion for a defensive system, however, nothing was done for two years. It was reported that neither the uniformed military nor Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger initially believed Mr. Reagan's goals to be achievable.
In 1981 and 1982, we had tried and failed to maintain the viability of offense-based deterrence. Congress had rejected deployment of the MX missile, and it became clear that we had to find a new way to deal with a growing Soviet superiority in first-strike systems. If we couldn't do it offensively, with the MX, then our only alternative was to explore relying on defense.
That led me, as deputy national security adviser, to ask several leading scientists whether technology had advanced far enough to warrant another look at a defensive system. The answers from men I respected, like Dr. John Foster at TRW, were encouraging. I then took the idea to Adm. James Watkins, the chief of naval operations, since any such concept would need the support of the military to pass muster with Congress.
Admiral Watkins, a cerebral and devoutly religious man, identified with President Reagan's moral motive and was very supportive. The other chiefs of staff fell into line, seeing the president's strong devotion to the concept and the scale of potential funding involved.
In the ensuing years, neither the president nor the team of scientists who focused on strategic defense nor I believed it would be achievable during his term. But all of us came to believe that we needed to begin exploring defense to deal with the current, as well as foreseeable, threats.
I also believed that by investing in America's comparative advantage in high technology, we would be competing more sensibly than we had for the previous 40 years. Conceivably, the burden that competing with the Strategic Defense Initiative would impose on the Soviet economy -- when combined with the expense of modernizing the country's conventional forces -- might lead the Soviets to reduce their offensive systems, ultimately eliminating the need to deploy large-scale, space-based S.D.I.
It was in that context, in December 1984, that I stated in a background session with journalists that because we wouldn't be able to deploy the system in Mr. Reagan's term, it might be called "the greatest sting in history." But it wasn't a ruse at all. And my statement in no way suggested any lack of support for the program. Indeed it was my responsibility to make it succeed.
Obviously, that the Strategic Defense Initiative might lead the Soviets to make concessions was a hope without guarantee. But trying it was worth the risk, because we would begun research and development on a system that someday we would need for a different, but foreseeable threat.
That day has come. The threat is substantially different and not as large, but North Korea and soon two or three other rogue states will present a serious nuclear threat.
Seventeen years of research has allowed us to cover a lot of ground on missile defense. Still more work is needed before a decision on deployment is made. Research on both the Navy's Aegis sea-based system and its land-based counterpart should be pursued more aggressively than current financing allows.
A delay will also provide useful time in which a new government in Washington can engage with the new Russian government and reach a mutually beneficial basis for modifying the outdated ABM treaty. My recommendation would be to share our technology with them so that they could use it too -- as President Reagan intended to do. Once testing and the bilateral negotiations are completed successfully, a decision can be made.
At that point Congress should finance deployment of a robust missile-defense system. Thanks to President Reagan's vision and determination, the means of our defense are within reach.

HEADLINE: Rural School Is Now Wired to the World

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: KAYCEE, Wyo., May 2

 BODY:
The day began as it always does in Mrs. Wetherbee's third-grade class at Willow Creek Elementary School, and it proceeded routinely, from the Pledge of Allegiance through reading, writing exercises, math, science, geography and phys ed.
But the class itself was unusual in a striking way: Nine-year-old Diamond Forbes is the only pupil Kathy Wetherbee is teaching this year in the one-room school in a remote part of the nation's least populous state. 
 Nonetheless, Diamond has a powerful tool in the classroom -- an iMac computer for class work, homework and e-mail to help her keep pace with schoolmates in larger, more privileged districts here and across the country.
Unlike most states, Wyoming has not taken a big bite of America's booming economy. Faced with sluggish job growth and a steady exodus of college graduates to other states, state officials focused on Internet access in the classroom as a critical component in equalizing educational opportunities and developing job skills. As a result, Wyoming this academic year became the first state to wire all its public schools -- even those as small and remote as Willow Creek, here in central Wyoming. And there are quite a few others: Among Wyoming's 234 elementary schools, 19 have fewer than 10 students this year. The state average is about eight students for every computer.
"Every child in Wyoming now has the opportunity to develop to his or her own potential," Gov. Jim Geringer, who began the push for statewide Internet access in schools more than five years ago, said in an interview. "By finding a way to touch every school, the next great leader from business or government could come from that one place."
Given Wyoming's rugged terrain and the isolation of many schools, it has been an ambitious and expensive project, $25 million for the first five years. But in financing the connections, state leaders recognized a desperate need to keep Wyoming children competitive or watch the state's economy fade and the population continue to slip, as it has since 1996 to the current level of 479,602.
The state Legislature approved for every school not only Internet access but also a two-way interactive video system that maximizes teacher skills by allowing, for example, a Russian language instructor to address students in his own classroom as well as those at distant locations at the same time. By next month, all the state's 78 high schools will be connected to the video system. Legislation does not require installation in the middle and elementary schools.
The combination of technologies, Mr. Geringer said, also demonstrates how businesses seeking to expand or relocate in Wyoming could take advantage of a skilled but far-flung work force.
It is hard to imagine a school that would benefit from the wonders of telecommunications more than Willow Creek, a one-room, cinder-block school that sits 22 miles off the nearest interstate along a winding gravel road that cars share with cows and sheep. The antelope and llamas apparently know enough to keep their distance. The school mailing address is Kaycee, a town of 400 that is 20 miles away. The nearest city is Casper, more than 80 miles away.
In planning for the academic year, Mrs. Wetherbee expected to teach three pupils, Diamond and two younger children. But the parents of the other children decided at the last minute to send them to kindergarten in Kaycee, leaving the iMac to Diamond, who has found it immensely helpful on her two big projects this year -- one on the Basque region of Spain, the other, which is near completion, on Scotland. Today, she searched the Internet for recent sightings of the Loch Ness monster. She found nothing new, only pictures from the 1930's she had seen before. "There she is," Diamond said, assuring Mrs. Wetherbee that the monster is female. "That's why they call her 'Nessy.' "
For Diamond, whose mother, Gloria, moved to the area from Casper last year to marry a local rancher, Skip Forbes, the Internet has become an invaluable tool. The computer she uses at home is not linked to a telephone line. "I learn a lot of card games there," she said. But it is clear from her time on the iMac that she has mastered more than that, navigating the World Wide Web with speed, dexterity and confidence.
As part of each day, Mrs. Wetherbee requires her to consult The Casper Star-Tribune's Web site to chart daily weather and read at least one story. Diamond found the weather easily and was drawn to a story about the ABC television dispute with Time Warner that included a photograph of the ABC studio in Times Square. Mrs. Wetherbee told her that millions of people live in New York City, compared with fewer than a half-million in all of Wyoming.
Diamond looked puzzled. "That doesn't make sense," she said.
Mrs. Wetherbee, 54, a veteran elementary school teacher who plans to retire after this school year, said she volunteered to work at Willow Creek this year, attracted by the remote location -- she earns an extra $55 a month in what the state calls "isolation pay" -- the class size and the living conditions. Adjoining the classroom is, effectively, a one-bedroom apartment that includes a small kitchen, living room and bathroom. Grazing cows and deer sometimes wander past the huge satellite dishes that serve the computer and Mrs. Wetherbee's television to peek inside her windows.
She lives at the school through the school week and travels to Casper on weekends to stay with friends, shop and buy food for the week ahead. After school ends in June, she said, she plans to move to Modesto, Calif., to live with her sister and plan what to do next.
"To me, it has been a gift to be here, and I think it goes both ways," she said of working with Diamond. "I needed some space after the typical teaching situation. It was not as much fun anymore, teaching to test. Everything had become so structured. But this is a dream. For the first time in my life, I am not managing children's behavior. I'm truly teaching."
And Diamond, she added, has vastly improved her learning skills this year, especially in reading, which she regards as her favorite subject "after recess."
Next year, Diamond will have a new teacher at Willow Creek and, in all likelihood, classmates, a change that Mrs. Wetherbee said would enhance Diamond's social skills and improve her confidence, which is considerable already. Without classmates, she sees old friends and cousins on occasion but spends most of her free time with her horse, Smokey, and five dogs.
Guiding the cursor across the iMac screen in search of the Loch Ness monster, Diamond said she would prefer that Mrs. Wetherbee return in the fall. But even with a new teacher she will still have her old iMac, even if she has to share it.
"I know Diamond doesn't look at it this way, but with the computer, she has not just been stuck in the little world of a ranching community," Mrs. Wetherbee said. "The Internet gives her the opportunity to see a world she doesn't see at home. I think that's a real blessing."

HEADLINE: Dominican Town Fears For Its Cabdriving Sons;
New York Killings Are Too Local a Story

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE DE LAS MATAS, Dominican Republic, May 1

 BODY:
The coffins of livery-cab drivers, shipped back to this country from from New York nearly once a week during the city's recent spate of killings, have badly shaken this poor mountain town of 55,000, which for decades has sent its young men to drive the streets of New York in pursuit of a decent, if dangerous wage.
Families here have exacted promises from sons, brothers and fathers in New York not to work at night, to install required partitions or get out of the business. And those planning to leave for New York are being told to steer clear of the livery cab industry. 
 "I have two teenage sons who want to join my brother Paulo driving livery cabs," said Rosario Vargas, "but I and a lot of other mothers have put down this rule: Go if you have to, but driving livery cabs is out of the question."
San Jose de Las Matas, 120 miles north of the capital, Santo Domingo, is perched amid sharp, razor-backed peaks, floppy royal palms, arching plane trees and banana groves. Along with the surrounding villages and hamlets, it has long fueled the livery cab industry in New York. Indeed, drivers from San Jose de Las Matas have come to dominate many of the car services in Manhattan. Town officials estimate that over $100,000 a month is sent back from New York.
The work has always been dicey and killings part of the trade. But not for a decade, when a previous series of New York City shootings left many Dominicans dead, has there been such widespread apprehension in places like San Jose.
The value of plastic partitions is as widely debated over domino games as the weather. And street names and neighborhoods from the Bronx, Washington Heights and Brooklyn are discussed as if they were across town. A neighborhood in Queens is called Sabana Iglesia after the rolling hills that spread out from San Jose de Las Matas.
"The Dominicans were quick to fill the hole left in many parts of New York when the yellow cabs abandoned high crime areas around 1984," said Jaime Vargas, who for 13 years was the director of the Livery Cab Owners Coalition, now known as the Federation of Livery Cab Drivers. "We created the industry. There is great pride here about this. But it has always been risky."
The poverty in this remote region drove hundreds of Dominicans to the city in the early 1960's when all they needed was a work permit. Many stayed, and slowly relatives and neighbors followed, often packing themselves into the same apartment buildings in Washington Heights, the Bronx and Brooklyn. The exodus over the years has, in fact, left small villages in the area wiped out, as subsistence farmers gave up to work in the city.
The appeal of New York, and the dollars that driving its streets at night can yield, remain powerful, and the economic pipeline and the support networks have been solidified over the years. Over the last few decades, San Jose de Las Matas has in large part been built off the earnings of livery-cab drivers and bodega owners. Cabdriving remains one of the few ways a young man with no skills can make money. And nearly everyone has a cousin or a friend willing to let them camp out on the floor, introduce them to car service owners and feed them until they find work.
And so with regularity, lithe young men, adorned with thick gold chains, designer jeans and wads of dollar bills, return here after taking their first cracks at driving livery cabs or stocking the shelves of bodegas in New York.
They are called "the Dominican Yorks," and in their moments of returning glory, they saunter down the rutted back alleys where they grew up and, for a brief, sweet moment, are somebody. It's part of the modest payback for months of drudgery and danger.
"They flash their chains and show off their money," said Santiago Bueno, 38, who worked in a bodega in New York for many years. "It's a ritual, but people long ago figured out how they really live, what their lives are really like."
He meant that New York is often not glamorous, its perils great. And so even here, where the average income is about $70 a month, the concern is beginning to outweigh the lure. While none of those killed in New York this year are from this town -- six of the nine killed since January were from the Dominican Republic -- many expect, given the high numbers of drivers from the area, that it is a matter of time. Nearly everyone here has a friend or relative who has had a close call, or even been killed.
"My cousin Rene Rodriguez was shot dead seven years ago this March rushing to help another driver that was being held up," said Elena Estevez. "His widow lives up the street with his three children. After he died, my brother bought his car and began doing the same job. He's still driving in New York, but none of us like it. We all wait for the phone to ring."
San Jose de Las Matas is a town where poverty and underdevelopment are obvious. The last stretch of road leading here from Santiago, for instance, is dirt, much of it washed out, and cars and trucks slow to a dusty crawl.
But the evidence of New York-generated income is obvious, too. Many houses are no longer made of wood, but concrete painted blue, ochre and white and topped with red tiled roofs. Station wagons, the vehicle of choice for bodega owners, and pickup trucks, many shipped down from New York, lie parked in driveways.
Antonio Rodriguez sat in a plastic chair with Rafael Urena under the shade of a corrugated tin roof, their taxis parked on the street.
"We all ask what is happening?" said Mr. Rodriguez, whose brother drives a livery cab in New York. "Is it part of the racism against Latinos? Why is it always a Dominican or a Latino that dies?"
Mr. Urena has two brothers in New York who drive livery cabs.
"I am getting ready to go but my brothers tell me it is too dangerous," Mr. Urena said. "They tell me to try and find other work. But suppose there is no other work? What can I do? If the only way I can make some money is to drive, I will drive."
Jose Antonio Roman, who ran a car service in New York, went home and on July 4, 1994, a date he chose deliberately, opened the town's first radio dispatch service. He has 24 cars and employs his son, Fausto, whom he has dissuaded from going to New York.
"Here I am middle class," he said, after barking orders over the radio, powered by a 10-volt car battery on the porch. "What am I there? Here, we find a drunk and the police call us to take him home to his wife. In New York a couple of drunks get into your car and you do not know if you are going to get out alive or with your money."
He stopped to comfort a driver over the radio whose passengers had been picked up by a rival driver nicknamed Torpedo because of the way he barrels to locations.
"The city has a powerful pull," he said. "It hovers over us. The fact is, if you are willing to work like a dog, you can come back in a few years with enough to build something. I learned how to run a dispatch service in New York, but it was not much of a life."

HEADLINE: Ambitious Plans for Transit

 BODY:
With the first major expansion of the city's transit system since the 1930's set to go forward, this is a promising moment for public transportation in New York. The scheduled projects are a Second Avenue subway on Manhattan's Upper East Side, a Long Island Rail Road link to Grand Central Terminal and extension of a rail line to La Guardia Airport. To build these links, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is embarking on a $17 billion capital program that has been criticized as financially unsound and unduly influenced by Bear Stearns & Company as a financial adviser. The capital plan is important to the region and deserves to go forward. But Gov. George Pataki, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and legislative leaders must take steps to ensure that it does not force undue fare increases in the future, and the M.T.A. should recruit an independent adviser to review the financing scheme and the role of Bear Stearns.
Thanks to a booming economy, transit improvements and a new fare structure, commuter and transit riders have increased 40 percent in five years. The M.T.A. has made two sound choices in pushing initially for the L.I.R.R. connection to Grand Central and for the Second Avenue subway from 125th Street to 63rd Street. This page continues to be skeptical about the priority given to the La Guardia link. The M.T.A. may find that extending the No. 7 line from Times Square to Pennsylvania Station and the far West Side makes more sense. 
 But, as reported in The Times earlier this week, concerns have been raised about the M.T.A.'s financing plan because it was recommended by Bear Stearns, a financial firm that stands to make tens of millions of dollars if the plan goes through. The M.T.A. has reinforced the suspicions by the secretive way it has put the financing together. Before proceeding, the agency should hire a new financial adviser, using competitive bidding, to undertake a thorough review. Any underwriting business should also be awarded by competitive bid, rather than going automatically to Bear Stearns.
Criticisms of the financing center on the fact that it includes both the refinancing of old bonds and issuing of new bonds, which together would push debt service costs to 24 percent of the operating budget in 10 years, compared with 15 percent today. The resulting squeeze could curtail future improvements and force fare increases if alternative sources of financing are not found. The M.T.A. argues, however, that long-term debt repayments for major projects make sense because the new lines will be in use for decades.
The M.T.A. is taking a calculated risk that by putting forward an ambitious and much needed plan it will generate sufficient pressure on city and state elected leaders to ensure its financing. It was a good sign that recently the Legislature and Mr. Pataki agreed to plug a $2.4 billion hole in the M.T.A.'s budget over the next five years with $850 million in new funds. They also authorized a $3.8 billion bond issue on the ballot in November, with 40 percent of it earmarked for the M.T.A.
But more financing will be needed from other sources. With its own big surpluses, New York City may be able to increase its support of the transit system. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where the directors from the two states are in an unseemly fight over allocations, could also be a source of financing for the city's mass transit needs. Most important of all, the federal government is a possible source of increased financing for mass transit.
A healthy transit system is essential to the economic, environmental and physical well-being of the New York region, justifying considerable subsidies from taxpayers to supplement fare revenues. The M.T.A. is right to proceed with its plan and enlist government leaders on all levels to battle for full financing.

HEADLINE: New Day on the Docks: They're Hiring Brains, Not Brawn

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J., May 3

 BODY:
Like the proverbial rising tide that lifts all boats, the bustling economy that has buoyed activity in New York and New Jersey ports over the last three years has now brought an effort to hire additional longshoremen for the first time in nearly 30 years.
But those jobs will call more for brain power, like computer and technical skills, than for the brawn the work demanded decades ago. 
 "This is not Marlon Brando's waterfront anymore and never will be again," said Ira Womack, a 62-year-old docks foreman who has worked at the port for 43 years. He recalls the days depicted in the movie "On the Waterfront," when a cargo hook and a pair of gloves were standard gear for stevedoring, and their work was called the buggy-lugging of cargo bales. "They used to say that this was a place where the men were made of iron and the ships were made of wood," he said. "Now the only way most of us get exercise is by going to the health club."
The hiring of nearly 500 longshoremen will be the subject of the first of two hearings Thursday by the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, the agency created by New York and New Jersey in 1953 to root out the mob influence and corruption that plagued the ports and threatened their viability.
The two-member commission must investigate and approve all who perform the work at the docks, from the lowliest stevedore to the largest shipping companies, and so is being asked by both the industry and the union to allow and supervise the new hiring.
With the exception of a trickling of emergency hiring in the last three decades and occasional temporary hiring to meet seasonal needs, new admissions into the ranks of the unionized longshoremen have been all but cut off since 1969. That was when the International Longshoremen Association, which had 27,000 members then, signed a contract to permit labor-saving mechanization and increased container shipping in exchange for a guaranteed annual income for its members, whether they worked or not.
Today, after attrition and retirements, there remain only 2,700 active longshoremen -- too few, industry experts say, to handle the growing volume of cargo in and out of the port efficiently. The workers conduct computerized checks of inventory, direct the 10-story cargo cranes that load and unload containers, and drive the gangly straddle carriers that glide around the yards, looking like legs without torsos.
The changes have cut the time and labor it takes to unload a 900-foot-long cargo ship to 24 hours and 10 men today, from three months and 500 men in 1969. But there is still a need for more workers to run the machines.
To be sure, the new hiring plan suggests that the economy is strong, but even economic health will not bring back the bustling docks that live on in workers' memories to a waterfront where human sounds and sweat have been replaced by the roar of motors and diesel fuel.
"The camaraderie is gone and won't come back," lamented Joe Garcia, 60. "Now we're all like our own bosses, sitting in a rig or a crane or carrying a portable computer, and alone. I'm glad some things about those days are gone, but I still think about them."
John Bowers, president of the union, said the new hiring was necessary not only because of the increased activity at the port, but also because of the aging of the union's membership. In the last contract, he said, the union agreed to a two-tiered system in which any new longshoremen would receive $14 an hour for their first three years rather than the $24 an hour that longer-serving workers got.
"This wasn't a popular move with our people," Mr. Bowers said, "but it helped the port become more competitive."
Carmine Cardone, the executive director of the Waterfront Commission, said that in the past the industry had to wait until there was a labor shortage on the docks and then petition the commission for the authority to hire a few emergency or temporary workers. That was the only method for new hiring allowed by the law creating the commission.
But both New York and New Jersey adopted laws in September allowing workers to be hired for projected needs, not just current shortages, and by the shipping companies rather than the unions, so that workers could be selected for the specialized skills needed.
The Waterfront Commission will still have to investigate any hired workers to see if they have criminal records or organized crime links before they can start working.
Lillian Borrone, the director of port commerce for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, noted earlier this year that cargo activity had increased 7.3 percent from 1998 to 1999.
But there are still places on the docks where brawn and numbers count for more than mechanization. At the Red Hook Terminal in Brooklyn, Sal Catucci is the owner of American Stevedoring, which moves the bales of cocoa, streaming in daily, that have made New York the largest handler of cocoa in the world in the last two years.
Mr. Catucci said the new hiring of longshoremen was "long overdue," because he had often gone days without enough workers to unload ships.
"My work force's average age is 62 years old, the oldest in the port," he said. "I'm losing men each month, and I have customers screaming because I don't have the labor to handle their ships."

HEADLINE: To Aid Trade Bill, Democrat Creates Plan for Rights Panel

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
With supporters of a China trade bill scrambling for every vote, a Michigan Democrat in the House is planning to introduce legislation this week that he predicts will rescue the Clinton administration's top remaining foreign policy goal from potential defeat.
The legislator, Sander M. Levin, said today that he is putting the final touches on a proposal to establish a commission with powers to review human rights, labor policies and development of the rule of law in China. After weeks of test-marketing in Congress, Mr. Levin said his proposal for parallel legislation to the trade bill could recruit enough fence-sitting Democrats to tip the balance in favor of the administration. 
 The bill would set up a commission consisting of nine members of each house of Congress, five presidential appointees and a full-time staff. The body would study China issues and advise both Congress and the White House on legislation or administrative steps, including United States policy on lending by the World Bank. That would keep pressure on Beijing to comply with its trade commitments and improve human rights, Mr. Levin said.
Opponents of extending permanent normal trade relations have dismissed Mr. Levin's proposal as a fig leaf, saying the commission would have no real powers of enforcement. Both the Clinton administration and the Republican Congressional leadership had kept their distance.
But Democrats, Republicans and administration officials are now saying that the Levin proposal attracts more votes for elevating China trade relations than it loses, especially among uncommitted Democrats. House vote counters said the Levin commission had helped recruit at least 15 Democratic yes votes, badly needed ones if the administration is to reach the minimum 70 Democratic supporters it claims it must have.
Republican leaders say they can produce 140 to 150 votes for the trade bill, but will rely on Democrats to push the total over the 218 necessary to pass the House. The House vote is scheduled for late May. Approval in the Senate is seen as certain.
"I think the Levin proposal will be responsible for 15 votes and maybe more," said Robert T. Matsui, the California Democrat who is leading the effort to round up Democratic votes in the House. "It gives me what I need."
Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, who is leading the administration's lobbying effort on the bill, today called Mr. Levin's proposal "an extremely good plan." Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the Ways and Means Committee, also spoke favorably about the idea at hearings on China trade.
The China trade measure also got a lift today when House and Senate negotiators agreed on details of a bill to give African and Caribbean countries wide-ranging trade benefits aimed at helping their ailing economies. The House could vote on the compromise as early as Thursday.
As many as half a dozen House Democrats have suggested that they would not vote for the China measure until the House first passed the Africa trade bill.
Meanwhile, the Clinton administration announced plans to beef up the team the government employs to police compliance with trade accords, with special emphasis on china. Mr. Daley said the administration would ask for $22 million in extra spending for trade enforcement and export promotion. Some of that money would pay for new personnel who would focus specifically on whether China meets its market-opening obligations after it enters the World Trade Organization.
Mr. Levin designed his proposal to resemble the Helsinki Commission, a joint commission of Congress and the White House set up in 1976 to monitor human rights in the Soviet bloc. The idea is to give members of Congress sway over China policy even if it agrees to sacrifice its annual review of that nation's trading rights, a step that's necessary if American companies are to benefit fully from concessions China made in its bid to join the W.T.O.
"This is something that should be an important part of our trade policy - a way to shape globalization," Mr. Levin said.
House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt had his own plan for setting up an investigation and enforcement body for trade with China with the authority to mandate sanctions if China failed to live up to its trade obligations or to international labor standards. But the Clinton administration firmly rejected any proposal that would have the power to mandate sanctions, calling that inconsistent with America's obligations under W.T.O. rules. Mr. Gephardt has said he will vote against the China trade bill.
Critics say Mr. Levin's proposal is a watered down version of Mr. Gephardt's and does not deserve broad support.
But it has elicited enthusiasm among some Republicans. Representative Doug Bereuter, a Nebraska Republican who has been working closely with Mr. Levin, said he planned to present it to the House Republican leadership for their blessing. He said the commission could sway several undecided Republicans to vote for the China bill.

HEADLINE: Two Reports Show Strength In Economy

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
New orders to American factories rose 2.2 percent in March, a much sharper rise than expected, led by the largest jump in demand for electronic equipment in more than two years, the Commerce Department said today.
In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said today that its latest review of the economy showed "moderate to strong" business activity in most areas around the country in March and part of April. 
 "Factories were running near capacity in some areas as overall manufacturing activity was strong," the Fed said in its report, known as the beige book. Retailing and commercial construction were also brisk, adding to the economy's growth.
The Fed survey, compiled from reports from its 12 regional banks, also said "there were more frequent reports of intensifying wage pressures as shortages of workers persisted in all districts."
But even against this backdrop, consumer prices remained relatively well behaved, the Fed said.
Though surging energy prices meant fuel surcharges or higher costs for certain materials for some companies, in few instances were the increased costs passed along to consumers as higher product prices.
The survey, based on information collected before April 24, will be used when Fed policy makers meet on May 16 to review the central bank's stance on interest rates.
In its report, the Commerce Department said manufacturers' orders rose to a seasonally adjusted $383.2 billion after showing no change in February and declining in January.
The 2.2 percent increase in factory orders in March was the best showing since a 3.8 percent gain in December and was stronger than the 1.7 percent rise that many analysts had anticipated.
Orders for electronic and electrical equipment, including household appliances and communications equipment, posted the largest gain in March, rising 10.2 percent, to $45.2 billion. That was the biggest jump since August 1997 and the eighth increase in the last 10 months. These orders rose 9.9 percent in February.
Also contributing to the strength in total factory orders in March was a 4.1 percent increase in orders for transportation equipment, which rose to $48.5 billion. In February, such orders fell 9.4 percent.
Excluding the volatile transportation category, factory orders grew 1.9 percent in March after rising 1.5 percent the month before.

HEADLINE: College Education Seen as Essential

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
In a shift that experts attribute to the changing economy, higher education is increasingly seen as the ticket to the middle class, with 87 percent of Americans saying "a college education has become as important as a high school diploma used to be," a new study has found.
Seven years ago, a majority of Americans believed that too many people were going to college rather than directly into technical trades like plumbing or computer repair; now, 3 out of 4 think the country could never have too many college graduates. The study shows that 77 percent of Americans believe college is more important now than a decade ago. 
 "The market demands it," a woman from Old Bridge, N.J., said in one of several focus-group discussions held around the country as part of the study. "Before, you could get a good job with a high school graduation. Now, you need a college degree, a master's or even a Ph.D."
More than 60 percent of parents of high school students see a college education as "absolutely necessary" for their children. Even more noteworthy are the views of minorities, whose enrollment in higher education lags behind that of whites. When asked to choose the single factor that most determines success, 67 percent of Hispanic parents and 45 percent of African-American parents picked a college education, compared with 35 percent of parents over all.
"There has been this coalescing of opinion in this country around the notion that college is critical to opportunity," said Patrick M. Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, a research group in San Jose, Calif. "It isn't just a piece of paper. It's a necessary factor for middle-class life."
The $315,000 project on attitudes about education was financed by three groups that study education policy, and conducted by Public Agenda, an organization in New York that conducts in-depth research on various issues. It began with telephone interviews of 1,015 adults -- particularly parents -- in December, and included in-depth discussions with groups in six cities.
The strong support for higher education among minority parents, experts said, belies the oft-stated view that one barrier to black and Hispanic enrollment is the low priority those ethnic groups placed on college. Only 20 percent of Hispanics ages 18 to 24 are enrolled in college, compared with 37 percent of non-Hispanic whites, yet more than twice as many Hispanic parents (65 percent) as white ones (32 percent) believe a college education is necessary to be successful in today's working world, according to the new poll.
"This is a pattern that we've been waiting to see emerge," said Robert Zemsky, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Institute for Research on Higher Education. "It now follows other groups that have seen higher education as a means of transformation. The Jewish community, the Italian community, the Asian community -- now we're seeing it in the African-American and the Hispanic community."
When asked what students should gain from attending college, those surveyed emphasized job-related skills rather than the traditional tenets of the liberal arts. Sixty percent said computer proficiency and specific expertise in a chosen career were "absolutely essential" outcomes, while just 32 percent gave that level of importance to "exposure to great writers and thinkers" in literature and history. At the top of the list were basic skills in living, including a sense of maturity and an ability to get along with diverse people.
"All of us in the academic world like to think that the purpose of higher education is to master the great philosophies and read the great books," said Stanley O. Ikenberry, president of the American Council on Education, which represents 3,500 colleges and universities. "But the public, throughout this past century, has really seen education in very instrumental, very practical terms."
While 71 percent of those polled think paying for college is more difficult than it was a decade ago -- and 4 out of 5 say students have to borrow too much money to pay tuition -- an overwhelming 93 percent of parents are confident that they will find a way to work out the cost of higher education. Still, 69 percent of parents worry about meeting college expenses and 61 percent say they "should have done more" to prepare financially.
Asked about various forms of financial aid, more of those polled favored tax credits and work-study programs than loans or direct grants to students. Fewer people (47 percent) believe there are many qualified applicants who lack the opportunity to attend college now than who believed so in 1993 (60 percent).
"If the desire is there, you make a way for your children," a Philadelphia parent said in a focus group.

HEADLINE: Federal Regulators Give Approval to Viacom's Buyout of CBS

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
Federal officials today approved the largest broadcast merger in history -- Viacom's $30 billion acquisition of CBS -- just a day after two other media giants resolved a dispute that was, in large part, a byproduct of consolidation in the broadcasting and cable industry.
The decision by the Federal Communications Commission to approve a merger that will give Viacom control of 35 percent of the broadcasting market represents the high-water mark of a Clinton administration policy of promoting consolidation in a number of industries as a way of encouraging competition. It was immediately hailed by top executives of the company. 
 Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman and chief executive of Viacom, said that the acquisition would be completed on Thursday morning and that CBS's ticker symbol would never again be trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
"This has really worked perfectly," an ebullient Mr. Redstone said in an interview this afternoon. "We basically got everything we had wanted."
The administration's policy of permitting consolidation in the telecommunications industry will be on display again later this month, when the F.C.C. is expected to approve a staff recommendation to permit AT&T to complete its acquisition of MediaOne, giving it control of more than a third of the cable industry. Many experts expect that the Justice Department, which is reviewing that deal for antitrust issues, will also approve it.
The policy is rooted in the notion that a few corporate behemoths battling over control of the market can be both more efficient and more competitive than any regulation and control from bureaucrats in Washington.
"We don't think big is per se bad," said Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division. "We analyze mergers in terms of relevant markets."
But such mergers do not always come without a price. The policy helped both the Walt Disney Company, ABC's parent company, and Time Warner grow into formidable broadcasting and distribution companies in recent years. But this week, some 3.5 million customers of Time Warner cable television lost their ABC signal for almost two days as the two companies wrangled over retransmission agreements.
The consolidation has created bottlenecks that have made it easier for one company to block the access of another. Moreover, government officials and industry analysts say negotiations between Time Warner and ABC had grown more strained after Time Warner's announcement that it intended to merge with America Online.
Moments after approving the merger of Viacom and CBS, the F.C.C. ruled that Time Warner had violated a regulation that prohibits a company from removing a network's signal during the sweeps rating month and said it would consider what penalty to impose. The fine will be symbolic, as the agency can only penalize the company $7,500 for each violation each day.
But consumer groups say the larger lesson from this week's events is that further consolidation of the cable and broadcast industries will lead to similar disputes and blackouts, as the survivors struggle to control both the content and distribution of what appears on television and the Internet.
As the number of dominant players in telecommunications and other industries dwindles, some regulators are also beginning to question how much further the government should go in approving large pending deals.
"Quite often the best consumer competition comes from big companies fiercely competing against each other," said Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. "But in some sectors of the economy, we are running out of big companies."
Mr. Pitofsky declined to discuss his agency's review of the proposed merger of America Online with Time Warner. But other government officials said today that Time Warner's decision to remove ABC this week from its cable systems had undermined the companies' repeated pronouncements when the merger was announced that they would never try to shut out others from using their enormous Internet and cable backbone.
In approving Viacom's acquisition of CBS, the regulators gave the companies a year to come into compliance with a rule that prohibits a television network from having an ownership interest in a second network. Viacom holds an interest in the fledgling UPN, and some experts predict that the agency may relax the dual network rule over the next 12 months.
Viacom will also have a year to meet the national television ownership cap, which prohibits a company from controlling more than 35 percent of the broadcast market. The combined reach of CBS and Viacom is now more than 41 percent. As part of the regulatory order, the companies will have six months to sell some radio and television stations in the Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore, Dallas-Fort Worth and Sacramento, Calif., areas.
But those divestitures are relatively small pieces of the deal, which involves the transfer of 38 television stations and more than 160 radio stations.
With a few exceptions, regulators during the Clinton years have signed off on big mergers, many of which would have been unimaginable a generation ago.
"In merger law, the Clinton administration has a great deal in common with the Reagan and Bush years," said John Shepard Wiley Jr., a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. "The analysis has become bipartisan."
By contrast, in the 1960's, the Justice Department successfully blocked one deal that would have resulted in a grocery store merger that would have resulted in a company controlling 7.5 percent of the industry.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE INFIGHTING;
Jabs Fly in Presidential Ring Over Social Security's Future

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO with FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
In a sharp exchange that gave the presidential campaign the intensity of a day in late October, Vice President Al Gore accused Gov. George W. Bush today of devising a "secret plan" that could bankrupt the Social Security system. Hours later, Mr. Bush tartly questioned the vice president's honesty and predicted that Mr. Gore's attacking style would soon backfire.
Echoing a theme he has repeated often in recent days, Mr. Gore used a speech to union officials in New Jersey to assert that Mr. Bush, the likely Republican nominee, was quietly developing a "risky" plan to allow individual investment accounts in Social Security that would jeopardize millions of taxpayers' savings. 
 "How does the Bush plan propose to deal with the bankruptcy of Social Security that his privatization scheme would cause?" Mr. Gore told a gathering of A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials in Atlantic City. "He doesn't even bother to provide an answer. He just smiles and goes on with the smug assumption that there's no need to share with you the details of what he wants to do."
Responding to Mr. Gore's cascade of attacks, Mr. Bush spent much of a plane flight this afternoon from Austin, Tex., to Palm Springs, Calif., telling reporters that the vice president had flatly misrepresented his record on a host of issues, ranging from the Texas budget to his positions on China and Russia to his crime-fighting policies.
"Someone running for the highest office of the land should stick to the facts," Mr. Bush said. "I think it is a pattern to say things, to stretch the truth. He's the man who said he invented the Internet."
Asked whether Mr. Gore's aggressive campaigning might work as well against him as it did against former Senator Bill Bradley during the Democratic primaries, Mr. Bush said he planned to respond faster and more forcefully than Mr. Bradley.
"It's not going to work here," he said.
In fact, rather than being aggrieved by his opponent's attacks, Mr. Bush seemed somewhat amused by the constant salvos from the vice president, suggesting that Mr. Gore's strategy was self-defeating. "Pretty soon, it's going to have a corrosive effect on his campaign if he's not telling the truth," Mr. Bush said of Mr. Gore during the 78-minute airborne news conference. "The fact that he relies on facts -- says things that are not factual -- are going to undermine his campaign."
He added: "The more outrageous he gets, the more outrageous allegations he makes against me, the more skeptical people will become."
Mr. Gore's aides clearly disagree. Privately, they contend that the slashing strategy they employed during the primaries will work again in the general election, provided they avoid the appearance of attacking Mr. Bush personally.
They have done that, they argue, by focusing on issues like Social Security, tax cuts, health care and gun control.
"The primaries showed that voters believe that vigorously debating your opponent on issues is considered fair play," said one adviser to Mr. Gore.
Mr. Gore also used his Atlantic City speech to discuss his own proposal for keeping the Social Security system solvent.
Under that plan, he would use the system's surplus to pay down the national debt, which in turn would reduce the federal government's interest payments. Those savings would then be put back into the Social Security trust fund, keeping the system solvent for an additional 13 years or more.
"I will devote all interest from debt reduction to shore up Social Security," Mr. Gore said. "I think it is wrong to cut benefits, raise the retirement age or risk your retirement savings in a game of stock market roulette."
But that description amounted to one brief passage in a 35-minute speech that was devoted mainly to attacking Mr. Bush on a variety of fronts, particularly Social Security.
Under the proposal floated by Mr. Bush's aides in recent days, taxpayers would be allowed to invest a small part of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock or bond markets.
Mr. Bush's aides argue that such a plan would help taxpayers take advantage of the stock market's historic growth.
But Mr. Gore asserted today that the plan would make the system vulnerable to huge market fluctuations that could hurt millions of retirees. And as he has repeatedly done in recent days, he suggested that Mr. Bush was charting a course that was "reckless" and "irresponsible."
"To me, Social Security is more than a government program," he said. "It is a solemn compact between the generations." Governor Bush, he added, "seems to believe differently."
Mr. Gore asserted that Mr. Bush had "left the door wide open" to raising the retirement age for Social Security as a means of bolstering the system.
That approach, he argued, would be harmful to people who do strenuous manual labor and physically cannot postpone retirement. And he accused Mr. Bush of wanting to cut Social Security spending to pay for a tax cut that Mr. Gore argues would favor the rich.
"What about the waitress who's carrying a heavy tray, what about the longshoreman, what about the steelworker and the auto workers?" he asked. "When they get to the current retirement age, they don't want to be told that in order to finance some risky tax scheme for the wealthy, they are going to have to keep on working until they are 70 years old."
Mr. Bush's aides acknowledge that he has not ruled out raising the retirement age. But they note that he has not formulated a detailed plan yet, only the general principles for one. Those include not increasing Social Security taxes, not cutting benefits and setting aside the Social Security surplus in a "lockbox" to make sure it is used only on Social Security.
It was Mr. Bush's lack of a detailed plan that caused Mr. Gore to accuse the Texas governor of devising a "secret plan" today.
"He wants to spring it on you after the election," Mr. Gore said. "Well, I think he may be underestimating the capacity of the American people to figure out for ourselves what the details of his secret plan would mean for each and every American."
But if Mr. Gore's barbs were meant to rattle Mr. Bush, they failed. Indeed, what was extraordinary about today's exchange was the almost delighted mood that Mr. Bush brought to his end of it.
Mr. Bush was on his way to California for several days of campaigning, including a fund-raiser in Palm Springs tonight for the Republican Party that was expected to bring in about $1 million.
On the flight, Mr. Bush revealed a few more glimmers than usual of his obvious distaste for what he seems to see as Mr. Gore's desperation to be president.
Usually, Mr. Bush does a more thorough job of pulling his punches when he is asked what he thinks about Mr. Gore as a person.
After a reporter told Mr. Bush that Mr. Gore, whose first grandchild was born on the Fourth of July, sometimes says to Hispanic audiences that he hopes his second grandchild will be born on Cinco de Mayo, Mr. Bush muttered, "Totally pathetic."
At another point, talking about his own desire for the presidency, Mr. Bush said: "I'm willing to work for it. What I'm not willing to do is sell my soul to become the president."
Asked if Mr. Gore would do that, Mr. Bush arched an eyebrow and said, "That's for you all to figure out."
Mr. Bush did not use the word "lied," and when reporters did, he corrected them, coyly repeating again and again that he was simply setting the record straight and expressing his "disappointment" in Mr. Gore's behavior.
But he did use the words disappointment or disappointed at least half a dozen times.
"The vice president said I've never submitted a budget as governor of Texas" said Mr. Bush, reciting the comments by Mr. Gore that he deemed untruthful. "He talked about recidivism rates that were totally inaccurate numbers."
"He said I called China and Russia enemies," Mr. Bush added. "Have I ever referred to China and Russia as enemies?"
Mr. Bush shook his head and veered toward what he clearly intended to be a kind of emotional and moral high ground.
"I just am disappointed and I think Americans will be disappointed when they find out the truth," he said.
 
In Their Own Words
 
VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE
 
Remarks at a convention of the New Jersey State A.F.L.-C.I.O. held yesterday in Atlantic City, N.J.:
"Now we face a basic choice. Will we use our prosperity to lift up our working families and meet our responsibilities to our parents and to our children and make sure that no one is left behind? Or will we go back to where we were eight years ago?
Will we roll the dice in the same casino economics that devastated our economy and hurt working families? Does anyone in this room think we should go back to the union-busting, job-destroying, budget-busting policies of the Bush-Quayle years. I don't think so. . . .
There are deep and profound differences between Governor Bush and me. Not personal differences, but real differences on the issues. I believe America has to put its fundamental responsibilities first. We have to pay down our debt, we have to save Social Security, we have to lift up working families.
George W. Bush believes instead that our top priority should be a reckless $2 trillion tax giveaway lavishing more on those who already have the most. . . .
His tax plan is bigger than anything Newt Gingrich ever dreamed of proposing. That may be why Governor Bush does not set aside a single penny for Medicare. And I believe his approach to Social Security is even more irresponsible."
 
GEORGE W. BUSH
 
Speaking yesterday aboard his campaign plane en route to California:
"The vice president said I've never submitted a budget as governor of Texas. He talked about recidivism rates that were totally inaccurate numbers. . . .
The more outrageous he gets, the more outrageous allegations he makes against me, the more skeptical people will become. I will respond. But I'm going to respond in a way that doesn't allow him to drag the process down. One of our jobs in this campaign is to make clear what the facts are."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: FUND-RAISING;
At $500,000, Democrats Gala Ticket Tops Record

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
For its annual gala here on May 24, the Democratic Party is offering tickets ranging from an affordable $50 to a platinum price of $500,000, the highest amount either party has charged for admission to a fund-raising gala.
The donors and fund-raisers who give or collect $500,000 will be given a package of perks that includes an invitation to a private dinner with President Clinton at a Washington restaurant on the eve of the gala and front-row seats, in the so-called "platinum section" of the MCI Center, for the gala's entertainment. The comedian Robin Williams leads the list, along with the musicians Stevie Wonder and Lenny Kravitz. 
 The gala is a tribute to Mr. Clinton, led by his close friend Terry McAuliffe, who offered last year to put up $1.35 million of his own money for the Clintons' house in Chappaqua, N.Y. The event features the widest gulf in donor levels ever seen at a political fund-raiser here.
Prolific fund-raisers and generous donors will also be invited to attend a private reception with Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore before the gala.
S. Daniel Abraham, the chairman of Slim-Fast Foods of West Palm Beach, Fla., recently wrote a check for $500,000, which the national committee deposited on May 1, party officials said today.
At its black-tie gala last month, the Republicans raised a record-shattering $21.3 million, a sum composed mostly of large, unregulated checks of $100,000 or more. Nearly 50 Republican fund-raisers gave $250,000 each. And the Republicans have a big-money club of donors, known as the Regents, who each pay $250,000. The Democrats have their own big-money club: members of Leadership 2000 each give or collect $350,000.
The sharp escalation of campaign contributions, or "donation inflation," as some fund-raisers call it, has alarmed many who advocate changes in the campaign finance system, and they reacted with outrage today at the $500,000 fund-raising level established by the Democrats.
"The spiraling obscenity of craven campaign finance efforts will not stop unless either the public's outrage starts being felt or corporations and special interests become sickened themselves and balk at paying these absurd amounts of money," said Peter Eisner, managing director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit public watchdog group.
Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a public policy group that advocates campaign finance reform, said, "This is crazy greed, and it would be shameful if there was any shame left in this city."
Democratic Party officials objected to the portrayal of the gala as a soft-money event.
"This is a different kind of event meant to bring people from all walks of life to rally around the Democratic Party and the issues we stand for," said Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. "It's very disappointing for these reformers, who know better, to try and put a pox on both of our houses, when it is very clear that the Democratic Party is the party that wants to reform the campaign finance system."
Mr. McAuliffe says he is trying to open the gala to thousands of young Democrats, who he says will pay $50 or $100 for tickets. The Democrats want to sell 14,000 arena tickets at prices from $50 to $1,000. And they have contrasted their event, which they say will encourage guests to wear blue jeans and cowboy boots, with the Republicans' black-tie affair last month in tribute to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the party's presumptive presidential nominee.
But both have one thing in common: many checks of soft money, the large, unregulated contributions.
The Republicans received large checks and fund-raising assistance from Phillip Morris and Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association.
In recent months the Democrats have received $350,000 from SBC Communications, the telecommunications giant, and $250,000 checks from both Marc Andreessen, the founder of Netscape, and Mark B. Nathanson, a cable television mogul.
"The money for this event is unbelievable," said one Democratic fund-raiser. "It's all because of Terry. He could raise $25 million, or even $30 million, in one night. It will be the most successful Democratic event, by a factor of three."

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Pass Budget and Adjourn

BYLINE: By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 3

 BODY:
Connecticut lawmakers put the finishing touches on a $12.3 billion state budget today, ending this year's legislativesession on an unusual note of bipartisan amity.
Before the clocks struck midnight, ending this year's 12-week session, the General Assembly had unanimously passed the state budget for the 2001 fiscal year and allocated this year's approximately $250 million surplus to several projects, including a bailout of the state's largest hospital and giving $34 million extra to cities and towns. 
 All 187 lawmakers voted for the budget, which includes a 7-cent-a-gallon cut in the state gasoline tax and an exemption on sales tax for up to $300 in back-to-school clothes, as it sailed through Connecticut's House of Representatives and Senate Tuesday evening.
"I cannot remember a unanimous budget in both chambers," said Kevin B. Sullivan, the State Senate president pro tempore, who has been in office since 1986. "This is the most clear demonstration of consenus that I have ever seen, ever."
Indeed, with their big bills out of the way and a near-perfect spring day beckoning from outside, lawmakers seemed usually giddy today, like college kids in their final class before spring break. Several times, House and Senate leaders had to stop and scold their colleagues for chattering and not paying attention to the matter at hand.
"I'm going to ask once again to please keep the noise level down," Lieutenant Governor Jodi Rell, the Senate president, told Connecticut's 36 state Senators, sounding more like a lunchroom monitor than the state's second-ranking executive. After they quieted down, she warned, "If I have to ask you again, I may have to ask you to leave the chamber."
Their exuberance was perhaps understandable. On Tuesday, after three days of squabbling that nearly sank a $771 million construction and redevelopment package for downtown Hartford, the Democratic-led House and Senate passed the bill and Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, quickly signed it.
Leaders of both parties hailed the project, the state's largest urban construction project in nearly 40 years, as the advent of a new era in a city with persistent economic problems.
The bill allocates $529 million in public funds -- most of it from state bonds -- to build a hotel and convention center, college football stadium and luxury apartment tower along Hartford's long-ignored riverfront. Last Friday, disagreements between labor unions and the project developer, the Waterford Group, threatened to scuttle the 33-acre project, known as Adriaen's Landing.
Last-minute negotiations Monday saved the deal, which includes about $230 million in private investments. The deal assured that Hartford and East Hartford, its impoverished neighbor across the Connecticut River, where the new University of Connecticut football stadium will be built, will be clogged with construction cranes for at least two years, starting next spring.
"Adriaen's is the toughest thing I've ever had to deal with," Mr. Sullivan said. "It will never make Hartford into what Baltimore is," he added, contradicting some of the more lofty predictions heard at the Capitol lately, "but it might make Hartford into what Providence has become."
Tony Caruso, the executive director of the Hartford Downtown Council, a business group, said Adriaen's Landing was "a great start for the next millennium."
The budget agreement includes Governor Rowland's top fiscal priority: a 7-cent reduction in the state's 32-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, the highest in the nation, beginning July 1.
The new budget also includes much of the Democrats' wish list. It increases the price of clothing exempt from the state's sales tax from $50 to $75 per item and creates another tax exemption for up to $300 worth of clothing and shoes bought at any one time in August, before school resumes.
Other major items this session included a bill that authorized a referendum in November, on whether to abolish the state's sheriff's system. One sheriff faces charges of carrying an assault rifle into a courthouse; a sheriff's deputy faces charges of firing a gun at motorists after a traffic dispute.
Governor Rowland signed a bill that tightens the rules limiting who may collect a finder's fee for arranging investments of state money.
The measure was prompted by the case of a former state treasurer, Paul Silvester, who pleaded guilty in September to charges of racketeering and money laundering. He admitted accepting kickbacks from finder's fees paid by companies with which he invested state pension money.

HEADLINE: 2 Stock Exchanges in Europe To Merge, With Nasdaq Link

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 3

 BODY:
The London and Frankfurt stock exchanges announced plans today for a merger as well as an alliance with the technology-heavy Nasdaq stock market of the United States. London and Frankfurt hope to build a pan-European trading heavyweight and a 24-hour global market in new-economy stocks -- both unthinkable prospects only a few years ago.
The British-German exchange would be Europe's biggest by far and the world's fourth largest. 
 The announcement offered the most significant evidence to date of a sea change in European markets. The shift has been driven by a clamor among investors for less expensive trading systems, a challenge from Internet-based and electronic trading systems, and a perception that Europe has become a single investment arena since the introduction of a unified currency -- the euro.
The development also showed how far Frankfurt has progressed in its challenge to London as Europe's prime financial center. Page C1.
Just six weeks after the exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels announced a rival European combination called Euronext, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Borse, which operates the Frankfurt exchange, said their merged company -- called the iX, for International Exchanges -- would have its administrative headquarters in London and would carve the European market into two parts. Blue-chip stocks would be listed in London, while a market in high-growth technology stocks linked to the Nasdaq would be run from Frankfurt.
And Eurex, the Deutsche Borse's market for derivatives -- complex financial contracts whose values are derived from underlying assets like stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies -- would continue to be run from Germany as part of the combined exchange. The role of Eurex, the world's biggest derivatives market, in the pan-European exchange could effectively isolate the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, a chief rival.
Participants said the Frankfurt-London merger would be completed by the fall, but the replacement of London's trading system with Germany's advanced technology is not expected until at least some time in the first half of 2001.
Frank Zarb, the chief executive of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq market, told a news conference today that the opening of a Nasdaq subsidiary in Tokyo next month would enable investors to connect with both European and American markets, offering "a 24-hour clock for the high-growth companies."
"The markets," he said, "will follow the sun for the biggest companies."
The alliance with the Nasdaq will bring together London's techMARK and Germany's Neuer Markt, technology-heavy exchanges that list newer stocks, as the core of a new high-technology exchange. Nasdaq and iX are to be equal shareholders in that venture, which will be incorporated in London and operated from Frankfurt. Mr. Zarb indicated that the deal had pre-empted the Nasdaq's plans to set up a separate European trading system.
The negotiations on the Frankfurt-London tie-up had been going on almost two years.
While the rival Paris-dominated Euronext market will trade stocks valued at some $2.2 trillion, the iX will group equities with a combined value of $4.29 trillion. By way of contrast, the New York Stock Exchange trades shares valued at $11.24 trillion, while the Nasdaq's equities are valued at $6.23 trillion, and Tokyo's are about $4.46 trillion, according to the International Federation of Stock Exchanges.
In Europe, the iX would clearly dominate, the partners said today, particularly because smaller markets in Milan and Madrid also want to join it.
Without Milan and Madrid, the iX said it would still control 53 percent of European equity trading, 81 percent of the market in high-growth stocks and 56 percent of the European derivatives market.
"This is the first step to an integrated pan-European market," said Don Cruickshank, the newly appointed chairman of the London Stock Exchange, who will be chairman of the iX. He is expected to hold talks with both the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange and Euronext on expanding the Frankfurt-London combination.
Caroline Denton, a spokeswoman for London International Financial, said the exchange would not reject an approach from the iX out of hand but also felt it could survive on its own.
And Euronext shrugged off the new combination, saying it proved "we took the right decision," according to Olivier Lefebvre, president of Brussels exchange.
The new company will be owned 50-50 by the London and Frankfurt exchanges and will eventually use Xetra, Germany's advanced technology for carrying out transactions.
Werner Seifert, the chief executive of Deutsche Borse, will be chief executive of the iX.
"What belongs together finally comes together," he said. "London is the largest cash market in Europe, and we bring in the largest derivatives market worldwide."
The management lineup reflects both the national sensitivities underlying the merger and the increasing weight of Frankfurt at the heart of the 11-nation euro-zone; Britain is not one of the 11.
With the biggest of Europe's stock markets and a reputation as Europe's financial capital, London would once have automatically regarded itself as the senior partner in any European business combination. But Frankfurt's fast-growing and technologically advanced exchange earns more as a business than does the London Stock Exchange, bolstering its ambitions to displace London as Europe's financial hub.
"Is this transaction a blow to the ambitions of finance center Germany? The answer is no," said Rolf Breuer, the chairman of the Deutsche Borse, who is also chief executive of Deutsche Bank. Indeed, some British bankers said the merger represented a German takeover because of the use of German technology and the appointment of Mr. Seifert as chief executive.
One investment banker said it was noteworthy that high-growth and new companies would be listed in Frankfurt, in effect making it the new-economy center of Europe.
The banker, who insisted on anonymity, added that the differing ownership structures of the London and Frankfurt exchanges meant that shareholdings in the merged company would be heavily weighted toward the big German banks that dominate the Deutsche Borse. Ownership of the London Stock Exchange is shared by over 290 members who voted earlier this year to make the exchange a publicly owned company, while ownership of the Deutsche Borse is much more restricted.
Mr Seifert said the iX's long-term goal was to go public with an initial public offering.
Others said the move was inevitable considering the changing profile of the marketplace.
Michael Marks, executive chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe, Middle East and Africa, called the merger and tie-in with the Nasdaq exchange "a significant step forward in the creation of a broader, deeper, more liquid marketplace."
"The investors have moved on, and they want one stock market to reflect that," he said.
Both the German and British governments welcomed the deal, and the European Union said the merger was unlikely to encounter regulatory hurdles.
The participants made their announcement today with more emphasis on grand visions than on detail. It remains unclear, for instance, precisely when and at what cost Germany's Xetra technology will be rolled out for British investors, or what savings may benefit investors.
Mr. Seifert said conversion to Xetra should be possible some time in the first six months of 2001. London traders work on the SETS system and "people are going to face conversion costs that have not been spelled out," one trader said.
Similarly, the number of possible layoffs is unclear.
Britain's position outside the euro-zone also means that London-listed blue chips, including giants like BP Amoco, will be quoted in both euros and pounds. Some bankers expressed concerns about the costs of clearing and settlement in the merged market.
The Deutsche Borse owns 50 percent of the Luxembourg-based Clearstream settlement system, which is not included in the merger. Clearstream said today that it was in talks with CrestCo Ltd. of Britain. Both companies will provide settlement services to the merged exchange, but a Clearstream spokesman said a merger between them was "quite a long way down the line."
Much of the impetus for the deal came from the rapid pace of events beyond the control of traditional exchanges, notably the proliferation of smaller and more nimble electronic trading systems like Tradepoint in Britain, which allow investors to bypass traditional brokers. Tradepoint, which is supported by big American and European banks, plans to start a pan-European trading system in July and says it will offer investors lower costs.
The challenge presented by such organizations emerged anew today when Mr. Breuer, the Deutsche Bank chief executive, was asked whether his organization would withdraw from Tradepoint in favor of the iX. His answer was less than a ringing endorsement for the merged exchanges. "Both systems have still to show whether they'll perform," he said. "So let's wait and see."

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
The King Of the Mile

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: RABAT, Morocco

 BODY:
The photograph is wedged into a corner above the fireplace. It is unlike the other framed items in Hicham el-Guerrouj's room, the autographs of 16 other men who have held the world record in the mile, the magazine cover proclaiming him the mile's new king, the fist-pumping joy at winning his second world championship in the metric mile. These are all tokens of victory. What el-Guerrouj keeps on equally prominent display is a reminder of forlorn defeat.
Entering the final lap of the 1,500-meter race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, he collided with the eventual winner and fell to the track. He got to his feet and continued to run, but he finished 12th, dead last in a race that he believed he would have won. He began to cry and a photographer caught his agony, producing the picture that el-Guerrouj keeps in his room at the Moroccan track and field institute: his left hand to his face, eyes closed, lower lip drooped in a disconsolate sob. 
 "I thought it was the end of my career," said el-Guerrouj, who was 21 at the time. "This photo gives me the power to work very hard, to break the world record, to win the gold medal."
Ten minutes after the race, King Hassan II of Morocco reached him by cellular phone at the Olympic Stadium. "You are the best," said the king, who died in 1999. "For us, you are the winner."
The Moroccan news media treated el-Guerrouj's fall in the same understanding manner, and Nike, his sponsor, even paid the $50,000 bonus it had promised for a gold medal, he said.
"The king is responsible for all Moroccans, and for him to say that I was still the best gave me a lot of confidence," he said. At that moment of the phone call, he said, "it was as if another el-Guerrouj was born."
A month later, el-Guerrouj defeated the Olympic champion, Noureddine Morceli of Algeria, and in the following years he took Morceli's world records, running the 1,500 in 3 minutes 26 seconds and the slightly longer mile in 3:43.13. He has lost only one race since Atlanta, and he will be a clear favorite to win the metric mile at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. He will turn 26 on Sept. 14, a day before the Olympics begin. He looks younger, with his boyish haircut and long thin face. God willing, he said, kissing his hands and putting them to his face, a gold medal would be a remarkable birthday present.
El-Guerrouj is the most accomplished athlete in this north African constitutional monarchy, which has long challenged Kenya and Ethiopia for distance-running supremacy on the continent. He is also a symbol of possibility for the young in a nation where 70 percent of the 30 million residents are under 30, where half the population lives on less than $50 a month and the illiteracy rate is 50 percent. He is considered the most visible ambassador of Morocco, which is using sport -- including a revived national tennis program -- in hopes of increasing its international prominence and is seeking to be host to the 2006 World Cup of soccer as a means of reviving its sluggish economy.
For decades, Morocco has had trouble with its international profile in sports. When Nawal el-Moutawakel became the first Arab woman to win a gold medal by taking the 400-meter hurdles at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and the great Said Aouita followed with a victory at 5,000 meters, many people confused Morocco with Monaco, said Aziz Daouda, the technical director for the Moroccan track and field federation and the business manager for its top runners. With the accomplishments of el-Guerrouj, he added, one kingdom is no longer mistaken for the other.
"We are a country of Lilliputians," said Brahim Boulami, who finished seventh in the 3,000-meter steeplechase at the Atlanta Olympics. "We are not big and famous. Hicham for us is like NASA and Boeing are for the United States. It is good to be first in the world at something."
 
The Stringent Life Of a Runner
 Rabat was unseasonably hot in mid-March, the temperature reaching 97 degrees, so el-Guerrouj decided to spend a few more days training in the mountain resort of Ifrane, above the heat and humidity and pollution of the oceanside capital. This was el-Guerrouj's 40th consecutive day in Ifrane, living with other runners in a converted hotel, training on a local track and in the cedar forests outside of town.
In a year, he will spend four months at altitude, for the quiet and the increased benefits in oxygen-carrying capacity. The rest of his training is done at sea level in Rabat. He is one of 92 athletes, men and women, in Morocco's elite training program, which provides for the athletes with 17 coaches, 3 doctors and 5 physical therapists. Nutritionists take care of the meals, the federation serves as his business manager and the training centers in Rabat and Ifrane both contain small mosques where el-Guerrouj, a devout Muslim, prays five times a day.
"He's one of the few people in the world blessed with unbelievable talent, he works incredibly hard, he's got a good support system and excellent coaching," said Steve Holman, America's top miler. "They take care of everything. He doesn't have to worry about anything but training as hard as possible, and clearly he does."
If it is an athletically pampered life, it is also one of austere isolation. El-Guerrouj dates a university student. They plan to marry after the Sydney Games, but they see each other only once every month or two, according to his coach. He owns a villa and a spacious apartment in Rabat, but he prefers to live in one well-appointed room at the national track and field center, a curtain separating the bedroom from the living room. He makes $2 million a year, according to Moroccan officials, but prefers to drive a tiny Honda sports utility vehicle, rather than the Mercedes that some of the other top athletes drive.
Mostly he lives the stringent life of a runner, training twice a day and sleeping and watching tapes of his races on television. He takes only three weeks off from training a year, although he took more time before this season after undergoing surgery for hemorrhoids that bothered him last summer.
"In my mind, if I don't do the same things as before, if I don't stay in my environment, I won't be as good," el-Guerrouj said. "I want to be close to the people, to live a simple life. In my country, there are many poor people. You can't be bigger than the others."
He trains with a small group that includes his coach, Abdelkader Kada; his brother Fethi, who is 20; Mohammed Amyn, one of the world's top 1,500-meter runners; and Hocine Benzriguinat, Morocco's military cross-country champion. The others are there to challenge el-Guerrouj with their legs but not with their egos. El-Guerrouj is the undisputed leader and it is their job to pull him along, to make sure that his needs are met.
He and his entourage are inseparable. The others train with him, cheer him at the track, eat their meals with him, go to the movies with him, travel around Rabat with him, bring him coffee and tea, help him with his tie, answer his phone. Kada, too, serves as a buffer between el-Guerrouj and the stream of Moroccans who approach him daily for a handshake, an autograph, a plea for financial aid. Privately, his coach and training partners say, el-Guerrouj is generous with them, giving them money or assisting with a new car.
"He is Mr. Peace, always so easy," Benzriguinat said.
Morocco has been winning Olympic medals in distance running for 40 years, ever since Rhadi Ben Abdesselem finished second to Abebe Bikila of Ethiopia in the marathon at the 1960 Rome Olympics. After el-Moutawakel and Aouita earned gold in Los Angeles in 1984, Moulay Brahim Boutaib won the 10,000 meters at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea. Khalid Skah followed with a victory at 10,000 meters at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.
"With his records and great performances, Aouita made us dream for decades," said el-Moutawakel, who is now a member of the International Olympic Committee. "He was like Muhammad Ali. He would say something and do it the next day. El-Guerrouj makes us dream, too. On every corner of the street, they know his records, his split times. He is breaking barriers, making our dreams come true, making us so happy that you lose your mind."
This day in Ifrane would be el-Guerrouj's last before he returned to Rabat for several weeks. After a morning jog, his evening workout began near dusk, under a gunmetal sky and a fingernail moon in the cedar forests. At this mile-high altitude, he would run 20 times 350 meters in 53 or 54 seconds, up a grade of 12 to 15 degrees to build strength and endurance. Amyn paced him through the first 300 meters, then stopped as el-Guerrouj kept running up the hill, carried by the elegant explosiveness in his legs, which begin with narrow ankles and build to a grapefruit bulge in his calves and a long wedge of muscle in his thighs.
Kada, his coach, did not bother counting each of the runs up the trail. He knew that el-Guerrouj would do what he had been instructed to do. "He needs a coach to tell him he is doing too much, not too little," Kada said.
After 15 repeats, the sky was dark and the lights of el-Guerrouj's Honda were turned on so the top of the trail would be visible. They kept running, invisible at the start now, their presence announced by the scuff of shoes on dirt and the exertion of their breathing. Finally, they became silhouettes as they neared the lights of the Honda, then Amyn stopped at 300 meters, doubled over, gasping for air, as el-Guerrouj kept running up the trail, briefly visible in his shirt and tights as he passed through the beams of headlights.
"He is a very serious professional runner," said Salah Hissou, the 1999 world champion at 5,000 meters and an occasional training partner of el-Guerrouj's. "He doesn't want to be a normal athlete. He wants to be a great athlete. He could do 20 competitions a year, but he only does 7 to 10, so they will always be high level."
 
'In the Hearts Of All Arabic People'
Such is the pervasive suspicion about performance-enhancing drugs in track and field that any great performance brings immediate skepticism. There are rumors, never proved, that el-Guerrouj uses EPO, a drug that increases oxygen-carrying capacity. He vehemently denies this. There is no way to know the truth, because there is no approved test for EPO. The International Olympic Committee has fallen so far behind in drug research and testing that the innocent cannot prove their innocence.
"It is work, not doping," el-Guerrouj said. "People who say that are not big athletes. I don't think they are training 11 months a year, or running in the dark with the headlights on. I train very hard, until I am sick. Sometimes I train like a foolish man who has no mind."
After the night training run, el-Guerrouj returned to the athletes' hostel, where he was greeted by two men who wanted a photograph taken with him. Earlier in the day, two women had approached the hostel, wanting money to buy a sheep for an important Arab festival.
"He is in the hearts of all Arabic people, a symbol for our young," said Abdulkarim Titi, the president of a soccer club in the city of Tiflet and one of the men waiting for a photograph. "He is a simple person. He runs for his country, his people, his flag."
El-Guerrouj sent word that he would pose for a photograph in the morning. He had to attend a dinner at the nearby apartment of Abdelkader Mouaziz, the winner of the 1999 London Marathon. Mouaziz's new condominium was decorated with traditional Moroccan rugs, and Arabic music played on a stereo, but Mouaziz is a runner, after all, and a Nike swoosh had been welded into the door of his wood-burning stove in the living room.
A group of a dozen runners gathered around the dinner table, and el-Guerrouj proclaimed, "Real Moroccan food!" as Mouaziz brought in a huge salad and a platter of tagine, a dish of beef and beans whose sauce is sopped up with spongy bread.
Among the runners at the table was Patrick Ndayisenga, the national record-holder in the marathon from the central African nation of Burundi, who had come to Ifrane to train with the Moroccans. He said he had been amazed to see el-Guerrouj, a miler, training like a marathoner, running 13 to 15 miles in an hour and a half. El-Guerrouj also trains like a sprinter, running sometimes with a weighted jacket, dragging a tire, and he does bounding drills to increase the propulsion in his ankles. The mile has come to resemble the brutal pace of the 800 meters and el-Guerrouj better than anyone has perfected the grueling training for speed and endurance.
"When he presents himself at the start, the other athletes in their minds are running for second place," Ndayisenga said.
After dinner, el-Guerrouj sat with his coach, Kada, who served as translator, and he spoke of his upbringing in Berkane, a citrus-growing region in northeast Morocco, near the closed border with Algeria, where his father ran a small restaurant. He had been a soccer goalkeeper as a boy, but he came home dirty every day and, with seven children, his mother struggled to keep his clothes clean.
"She told me not to play anymore," el-Guerrouj said.
When he was 14, he entered a cross-country race and finished second. A year later, he won his age group at the national cross-country championships, left school and went to the national training center in Rabat. His mother, Fatna, disapproved. "I told her I was able to be Aouita, or better," el-Guerrouj said.
Six years later, at 21, he was preparing to take the lead in the Olympic 1,500-meter race when he fell. As he stumbled to the ground, he felt as if he were in a dream, and he could hear the crowd groaning as he hit the track. The collision with Morceli was an accident, nothing more, el-Guerrouj said. Four years later, he is prepared to run again, and this time he believes he will win.
"He needs this medal," said Daouda, the technical director of the Moroccan track federation. "He is the world record-holder. He can't miss this. If he does, it will be a big problem. Psychologically, it will be the end of his career."
Back at sea level in Rabat, el-Guerrouj ate lunch in the national training center, where there is a six-foot-high photograph of him in the lobby. There is a metal globe in the middle of the cafeteria, atop a fish pond, the globe symbolizing that the runners who eat here are the best in the world.
He told a story from his youth. When the family was out of bread, they sent him to his father's restaurant. It was a mile away, he said, and the family would tell him, "Run fast, Hicham; you have seven minutes until the bread is cold." When he returned home, he said with a laugh, his brothers and sisters would clap as if he had just crossed the finish line of a race.
 
Following His Faith By Helping the Needy
 El-Guerrouj dressed in a suit for a meeting of Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, and for three hours he sat and watched slides and listened to a discussion about the plight of Morocco's children. The infant mortality rate is way down, but children as young as 6 are in the work force, and 50 percent of the girls still do not go to school in rural areas.
El-Guerrouj is president of an association in Berkane that sends doctors into the countryside and provides scholarships for children. He recently purchased 130 wheelchairs for disabled youth and, during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, he and another man paid for his father to cook for 400 people each evening in his hometown. Helping the needy is one of the five pillars of the faith of the Koran. El-Guerrouj, along with el-Moutawakel, is one of four goodwill ambassadors to Unicef in Morocco.
"There is so much fatalism in the villages; people say, 'I'm poor, I will stay poor forever,' " said Olivier Theo Degreef, the Unicef representative in Rabat. "But he is an example of, 'If I fight, this is what I can become.' "
Sitting still had made him stiff and tired, but el-Guerrouj insisted on his evening track workout. He would run 10 times 1,000 meters, or two and a half laps, in 2:32 or 2:33, with two minutes' rest between. Benzriguinat, the military cross-country champion, would pace him through the first 600 meters, and el-Guerrouj's brother Fethi and Amyn, his other training partner, would follow at their own comfortable speeds. It was dark now, and pale illumination came from street lamps around the track. In the backstretch, el-Guerrouj was hardly visible, except for the flash of his spikes. He is taller than his listed height of 5 feet 9 1/2 inches, 6 feet at least, and there is the grace and power of incessant stalking in his long strides.
Four, five, six times, he repeated 1,000 meters, and the others could not keep up, doubled over, agony in their breathing. Another pacemaker was brought in, but none of the other runners could finish all 10 repeats. They were reduced to cheering for the world champion, yelling at him in French and Arabic, "Come on, Hicham, go, go," and he sailed through his 10th repeat in 2:29 with a satisfied sweat on his neck. Benzriguinat kissed him on the head.
"That's why he is the champion," Benzriguinat said. "You see how he has killed us in the training. Three people, we are all finished, and he is still strong."
The closer Sydney gets, the farther away Atlanta seems. But of course, he can never forget. Every time he breaks a record or wins an important race, the television shows him falling in Atlanta and the newspaper articles refer to his disappointment in 1996. "I think it is a part of me," el-Guerrouj said. But he has made a promise to himself. If he wins in Sydney, he will remove the crying picture from above his fireplace.
"I will put up a photo of Sydney," he said.
A photo of victory.

HEADLINE: DEATH OF A CARDINAL;
CARDINAL O'CONNOR, 80, DIES; FORCEFUL VOICE FOR VATICAN

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS 

 BODY:
Cardinal John O'Connor, the archbishop of the New York archdiocese's 2.37 million Catholics and the Vatican's most forceful spokesman in the United States, died last night at his residence around the corner from St. Patrick's Cathedral. He was 80 years old.
Cardinal O'Connor died of cardiopulmonary arrest at 8:05 p.m., said his spokesman, Joseph Zwilling. But Mr. Zwilling said the death was "the result of the tumor and the cancer that he was suffering from." 
 Cardinal O'Connor came to New York in 1984 in a glare of publicity and a flurry of controversy, a relatively unknown Roman Catholic bishop from Pennsylvania who was suddenly catapulted into the church's most visible post in the United States.
But after 16 years as archbishop of the sprawling 10-county Archdiocese of New York, he had become a familiar and towering presence, a leader whose views and personality were forcefully injected into the great civic debates of his time, a man who considered himself a conciliator, but who never hesitated to be a combatant.
The cardinal's failing health in recent months diminished his public appearances and his position as a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church, but it did not diminish his stature as one of its most powerful symbols on moral and political issues. When Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, seeking the Republican nomination for president, expressed regret on Feb. 27 for not speaking out against racial and anti-Catholic intolerance during a campaign visit to Bob Jones University in South Carolina, he did so in the form of a letter to Cardinal O'Connor.
The cardinal was passionately outspoken in his opposition to abortion, the issue that shaped his tenure from the very start. He was unconditional in upholding official Catholic teachings on topics like homosexuality and the ordination of women. And he was unwavering in his loyalty to Pope John Paul II, who had named him archbishop of New York as part of an effort to restore greater doctrinal and organizational discipline in a church still feeling the reverberations of reforms undertaken by the Second Vatican Council 20 years earlier. It was frequently repeated, but never confirmed, that the pope had said, "I want a man like me in New York."
All this gave the cardinal the profile of a zealous conservative in a city where cultural questions of sex and sexuality had eclipsed old-fashioned economic divisions and in a church in which, despite Vatican efforts to quell dissent, papal popularity no longer automatically translated into papal authority.
But Cardinal O'Connor was also a passionate defender of organized labor, an advocate for the poor and the homeless, a vocal assailant of racism and anti-Semitism, and an opponent of capital punishment. And although he had spent 27 years as a Navy chaplain and retired with the rank of rear admiral, in the 1980's he condemned American support of counterrevolutionary guerrilla forces in Central America, questioned the need for spending on new weapons systems, and, to the end, remained a cautionary voice about American military actions overseas.
These were positions that were rooted in Catholic doctrine and that reflected the stance of Pope John Paul. But they sometimes disconcerted the cardinal's conservative allies, while his liberal critics often ignored them altogether or welcomed them without really believing that they gave a true measure of the man.
 
Projecting the Church Into Public Debates
His image as a leader was undoubtedly affected by memories of the two cardinals who had preceded him. Cardinal Terence Cooke, who led the New York Archdiocese from 1968 to 1983, kept a low profile and preferred to work through the parishes and the archdiocesan agencies.
By contrast, Cardinal O'Connor's willingness to joust with public officials and project the church into public debates recalled the years from 1939 to 1967, when the archdiocesan headquarters of Cardinal Francis Spellman was known as the Powerhouse for the leverage the church wielded in city affairs.
But the comparison was deceptive, because New York City and the church had changed. The migration to the suburbs had thinned the church's solid constituency, especially among the Irish, and neither the new Hispanic immigrants nor the grandchildren of the older Irish and Italian ones were as likely to defer to the hierarchy's judgments.
Much of what Cardinal O'Connor tried to do by public pronouncements, Cardinal Spellman would have accomplished behind the scenes. And if Cardinal O'Connor could sometimes still affect city policies with a few phone calls to some politicians, in Cardinal Spellman's day, or so it was widely believed, the calls would have been initiated by the politicians themselves, who were careful to check their plans with the Powerhouse.
Cardinal O'Connor himself rejected the comparison. "I abhor the concept of Powerhouse," he told more than one reporter. "My job is not to acquire or wield political power." But the comparison was inevitable, given the publicity and turmoil that filled his first years in New York.
Even before arriving, he had upset many Jews in New York by declaring that widespread abortion in the United States was "precisely the same" as the Nazis' murder of six million Jews.
At a televised news conference a few months later, he said, "I do not see how a Catholic in good conscience" could vote for a political candidate favoring abortion, and, then, when asked whether he might excommunicate Gov. Mario M. Cuomo for his support of abortion rights, the new archbishop refused to rule it out, setting off an intermittent feud with the governor that the press helped to reignite at every opportunity.
In his first year as archbishop, Geraldine A. Ferraro, a Catholic who supported abortion rights, was nominated by the Democrats to run for vice president on a ticket headed by Walter F. Mondale. When she was a member of the House of Representatives from Queens, Ms. Ferraro, along with several other Catholic public officials, had signed a letter saying that there was "a diversity of Catholic opinion" about abortion.
After the letter was released during the presidential campaign, Archbishop O'Connor assailed the candidate, saying, "Geraldine Ferraro has misrepresented Catholic teaching on abortion." He went on to say that there was no diversity of Catholic opinion, only the opinion of the church that abortion was wrong under all circumstances.
 
At Odds With City Over Gay Rights
This set off countercharges that Archbishop O'Connor was signaling church support for the 1984 re-election of President Reagan, whom he had praised earlier as "a friend of the unborn."
Locally, the archbishop tangled with the city government over access to contraceptive information and abortion in the church's child care agencies. He also challenged Mayor Edward I. Koch's executive order barring discrimination against gays by any employer, including the church, that had contracts with the city. When a court struck down the mayor's executive order, the archbishop was equally opposed to a similar bill in the City Council on gay rights, which passed, even though it contained an exemption for religious institutions.
Conservative Catholics were delighted to have such a fresh champion in town, but many others, inside and outside the church, were similarly fascinated. For the cardinal's proclivity for confrontation seemed part of a larger spontaneity and directness that seemed right at home in New York City.
At his installation in St. Patrick's Cathedral on March 18, 1984, the new archbishop put on a New York Mets cap, placed his own bishop's miter on the head of a 10-year-old altar boy from the Bronx who was also named John J. O'Connor, and then mimicked Mayor Koch's regular query, "How'm I doing?"
He may have been the only major religious leader to hold a regular press conference every Sunday, after he had celebrated 10:15 Mass at the cathedral. And in his early years, he was usually ready with a curbside quip.
Reporters monitored his Sunday sermons and his weekly columns in the archdiocesan newspaper, and pumped him at his press conferences, hoping for a tabloid headline for Monday. The prelate's words were sometimes blatantly misrepresented or ripped out of context, as in a headline in The New York Post on June 17, 1991, supposedly quoting him saying, "God Is a Man." But for a long time this was a price he appeared willing to pay to keep his lines open to the news media.
Eventually, he expressed misgivings about the manner of his debut in New York and his high visibility. "Time after time I have to ask myself if the church would be better off -- certainly, I would be better off -- if when I came here I had just become a silent servant of the people," he said in 1993 in an interview with The New York Times. He wondered whether he might have thrust himself too much into politics, or whether Cardinal Cooke's quieter style had not been better.
But then again, he mused, "If you're false to your own temperament, you're not going to be an effective leader."
At times the Cardinal did try to be more conciliatory. He eventually dropped the Holocaust analogy in his preaching against abortion, and some Jewish leaders came to see him as an opponent of anti-Semitism. The relationship survived tensions in 1987 over his endorsement of Palestinian hopes for a homeland and a subsequent trip to Israel marked by a series of diplomatic contretemps.
Despite emotional evocations of the Holocaust, first before an Arab audience and then at Yad Vashem, he provoked a protest from the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations when he acquiesced in a Vatican request to downgrade his meetings with Israeli officials and repeated his pleas for Palestinian refugees. The public rebuke deeply stung the cardinal, but the conflict was patched over and they later honored him as a facilitator of the Vatican's recognition of Israel in 1993.
Before Rosh Hashana last year, the cardinal issued a characteristic expression of sorrow for wrongs that he and fellow Catholics had done to the Jewish people, a statement widely publicized and welcomed by Jewish leaders.
 
Breaking Bread With 'Hizzoner'
Cardinal O'Connor also became close friends with Mayor Koch, and the two of them collaborated on a book, "His Eminence and Hizzoner" (William Morrow & Company, 1989), regularly dined together and gave each other moral support during their illnesses.
Beyond that, the cardinal seemed to mellow in recent years. The cessation of his weekly press conferences in 1990 may have symbolized his evolution. Attention more easily shifted to his pastoral activities and day-to-day supervision of the country's fourth-largest archdiocese, with its 413 parishes, 55 high schools, 238 elementary schools, 882 priests, 3,707 sisters and 17 hospitals that, along with social service and child-care agencies, serve almost three million people annually.
The archdiocese embraces Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island as well as Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Sullivan, Ulster and Dutchess Counties. Brooklyn and Queens constitute a separate diocese. The cardinal's office does not publish a consolidated budget, but the archdiocese's annual expenditures are known to be more than $370 million. Its real estate holdings are vast and would bring far more than $1 billion if sold.
But these holdings are often in the form of aging churches and schools that generate more costs than income. Cardinal O'Connor strove mightily, and largely successfully, not to close or merge parishes or schools, as had been done in other large archdioceses in the United States like Chicago, Detroit and Philadelphia.
His leadership in national church affairs had also been much more muted in recent years. He and Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston were both named archbishops by the pope in the same year, and were elevated a year later to the rank of cardinal. They were sometimes called Law and Order for their roles as channels of Vatican policy that tightened the reins on the American church.
In 1987, for example, Cardinal O'Connor publicly repudiated a policy paper from the 50-bishop administrative board of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops that called for the support of AIDS education programs even when they included information about condoms. The Vatican subsequently demanded that the bishops modify their stance.
The cardinal's statements made him the target of gay groups and advocacy groups for AIDS victims, including Act Up, which advertised a demonstration at St. Patrick's Cathedral in December 1989 with pictures of a bull's-eye superimposed on the cardinal's face. During the demonstration, Act Up members shouted, lay in the aisles and chained themselves to pews during a Sunday Mass.
Cardinal O'Connor never ceased to serve on Vatican commissions, sometimes traveling almost monthly to Rome. Nor did he cease to encourage the sometimes fractious elements of the anti-abortion movement. But after 1990, when the bishops appointed Helen Alvare, a lawyer, as the leading representative of their Pro-Life Activities Committee, his role became less public, and other cardinals, especially Cardinal Law, appeared to take the lead in pressing Vatican priorities.
It was in the summer of last year that the cardinal became ill. In August, a tumor was removed from the surface of his brain by doctors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. After his surgery and extensive radiation treatments, the cardinal returned to his duties, but his recuperation was marred by setbacks.
He was hospitalized for fatigue in October, and recurring weakness caused him to miss his customary celebration of Sunday morning Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral with increasing frequency. For the first time since becoming archbishop, he was unable to celebrate Mass on Easter Sunday at St. Patrick's this year.
But his illness did not prevent him from paying a farewell visit in February to a frail Pope John Paul II in Rome.
In a letter to New York's bishops, the cardinal said he expected the pope to name his successor as archbishop of New York in March. Various candidates are under consideration.
 
Working-Class Roots In Philadelphia
John Joseph O'Connor was born in Philadelphia on Jan. 20, 1920, the fourth of five children of Thomas and Dorothy O'Connor. His father was a skilled interior painter, a specialist in applying gold leaf to the ornamental ceilings of auditoriums and churches. His mother suffered blindness for a year and attributed her recovery of sight in one eye to the intervention of St. Rita of Cascia.
In many interviews and columns he wrote for Catholic New York, the archdiocesan weekly newspaper, Cardinal O'Connor often recalled his early upbringing: the warmth and seriousness of family prayers and religious observances; the forceful views of his father, "a union man," on the rights of labor; the need for frugality during the hard Depression years.
His working-class roots, he said, left him always a bit uncomfortable in the formal surroundings of the archbishop's residence at East 50th Street and Madison Avenue, behind St. Patrick's Cathedral.
 He attended both public and Catholic grade schools in Philadelphia before entering West Catholic High School for Boys, which was run by the order of Christian Brothers, who encouraged him to pursue a calling to the priesthood.
In recent years, his descriptions of the rigors of his life at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Philadelphia sometimes made it sound like Marine boot camp designed by Charles Dickens. He stressed that it was always the goal of ordination to the priesthood, which he achieved on Dec. 15, 1945, a month before his 26th birthday, that made him persevere.
For seven years, he was an assistant pastor in a Philadelphia parish. He taught in Catholic high schools as well as a night school for adults, conducted two weekly radio programs on local stations, worked in hospital psychiatric wards and developed special programs to instruct retarded children. His work with retarded children remained a lifelong passion. As a young priest, he thought it might be his chief occupation until, urged by Cardinal John O'Hara of Philadelphia, he answered the plea of Cardinal Spellman for chaplains to serve in the armed forces during the Korean War. 
A two-year stint turned into a 27-year career, during which he traveled the world celebrating Mass in foxholes and on aircraft carriers. He served under fire with the Marines in Vietnam, became senior chaplain at the Naval Academy at Annapolis, and, in 1975, was appointed chief of Navy chaplains with the rank of rear admiral. During his military career, he also found time to earn a master's degree in clinical psychology at the Catholic University of America and a doctorate in political science at Georgetown University.
Expecting to retire to parish life in 1979, he instead was made an auxiliary bishop assigned to the military vicariate, the church unit serving the armed forces. The vicariate was administered by the archbishop of New York until 1985, when it became independent. Bishop O'Connor was still supervising chaplains, although now from a post in the Catholic hierarchy rather than from one in the Navy.
 
Foxhole Chaplain In Vietnam
Military matters were fated to play a central role in Cardinal O'Connor's life. In 1968 he published "A Chaplain Looks at Vietnam" (World Publishing Company), a book that argued that the American intervention there was morally and legally justified.
"I am convinced," he wrote, "that the administration has opted to accept the tragedy of war as the only available road to meaningful peace."
His ministry in Vietnam, he continued, involved him in "the unglamorous, dirty business of survival, in digging a hole in a sun-baked hill in the boiling dust of 120-degree heat, in slogging through knee-high mud, in fighting insects, tripping over jungle growth, sleeping night after night with one eye open, alert to the whisper of every breeze, the snapping of every twig.
"No priest can watch the blood pouring from the wounds of the dying, be they American or Vietnamese of the north or south, without anguish and a sense of desperate frustration and futility," he continued. "The clergy back home, the academicians in their universities, the protesters on their marches are not the only ones who cry out, 'Why?' "
"That's a bad book, you know," he later told Nat Hentoff, who was interviewing him for a profile in The New Yorker that was later expanded into the 1988 biography "John Cardinal O'Connor" (Scribners).
"It was a very limited view of what was going on. I regret having published it."
But as a man who knew the military and combat firsthand, who had published a moral analysis of a war and who had a Ph.D. in political science, he was primed for an assignment that many say changed the course of his career. He was chosen by Archbishop Joseph Bernardin of Cincinnati, later the archbishop and cardinal of Chicago, to serve on a five-member committee of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops that was charged with writing a pastoral letter on peace and nuclear weapons.
Archbishop Bernardin, a master at forging consensus, knew the importance of including a full range of views on the committee. From the start, and through all three publicly debated drafts of the letter, Bishop O'Connor was regarded as the conservative, promilitary voice, the counterweight to another auxiliary bishop on the committee, the pacifist Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of Detroit.
"I was billed as the Genghis Khan of the committee," Cardinal O'Connor later told Mr. Hentoff. Certainly, he was a conduit to the Reagan administration and the Pentagon, consulting with them privately, although with the committee's knowledge, and bringing their views back to the committee. He fought vigorously for wording in the pastoral letter that would keep the bishops from condemning nuclear deterrence altogether, or being identified with advocates of a nuclear freeze, who were opposed to the placement of new medium-range missiles in Europe.
In one instance, when other committee members urged a "halt" to new nuclear weapons, he argued for the word "curb."
On several points, including "curb," he lost, but in the end, the former Navy chaplain voted with his colleagues for approval of a document that rejected almost all possible uses of nuclear weapons and that condoned possession of them as a deterrent only if linked to serious steps toward disarmament.
The Vatican was intensely interested in the American letter, indeed wary of it, and so were the Catholic hierarchies of France and West Germany. On one trip to Rome, Auxiliary Bishop O'Connor had discussed the project with Pope John Paul II and Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the Vatican secretary of state. The impression he made probably explains why, almost simultaneously with the completion of the letter, he was named bishop of Scranton by the pope.
Church watchers wondered whether his appointment to a relatively minor diocese was a form of ecclesiastical exile or the first step to bigger things. The question was answered with surprising rapidity. On Jan. 31, 1984, after only eight months in Scranton and four months after Cardinal Cooke's death, he was named the eighth archbishop of New York. His name had not even been mentioned in the speculation about who would fill the post.
As is the practice, recommendations from other American bishops had been submitted to the pope by the papal representative in the United States, at that time Archbishop Pio Laghi. Cardinal O'Connor, who had energetically thrown himself into the Scranton job, was taken aback by his selection.
"When I went to Scranton, I hoped I would die there," he said soon afterward, pausing for effect and then adding, "I came to New York knowing I would die here."
 
A Priest, Yes, But Not a Simple One
Because his predecessor, Cardinal Cooke, had typically described himself as a simple parish priest, a New York reporter asked the newly arrived archbishop, "Are you a simple parish priest?"
"I'm a priest," came the reply. "How simple I don't know."
He was not simple at all, although the complexity of his personality was often reduced by the news media to two Cardinal O'Connors. There was the smiling, quipping Cardinal O'Connor, a dignitary with the touch of the common man, waving and shaking hands and reviewing parades from the steps of the cathedral. And there was the stern Cardinal O'Connor, asserting old or unpopular doctrines from the pulpit and warning those who disagreed that they were in for a fight.
Facets of his personality that did not fit into these stereotypes were often overlooked or played down. He was usually soft-spoken, not at all a pulpit thunderer. He had many of the reflective traits of an intellectual who could, in his slow, ruminating answers to questions, do equal justice to the contending sides of a dispute.
"He is surely one of the two or three smartest graduate students I ever had," said Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former ambassador to the United Nations, who taught him when he was a Navy chaplain studying for a Ph.D. at Georgetown.
Yet for the cardinal, mulling over the many sides of a question was not incompatible with making spontaneous comments and on-the-spot decisions, so that it sometimes appeared as though a fine balance could be tipped by the latest opinion, a chance encounter or a sudden inspiration.
Priests of the archdiocese were divided about how much thought went into some of his statements and appointments. Many joked that their leader's motto was, "Ready, Fire, Aim!" But they were also deeply appreciative of his willingness to give them time and attention to supply his counsel or discuss their futures.
For Cardinal O'Connor, doubt and misgivings stopped short when it came to defending basic Catholic teachings, the decisions of the pope or what he considered the survival and integrity of church agencies. The combativeness with which he delivered these expressions of duty made him one of the most fiercely denounced public figures in New York, if not the country.
Gloria Steinem once paired him with AIDS as the two worst things about New York. Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, an organization that supports legalized abortion, called him "the kind of man who, if the church still had the power to burn people at the stake, would be right there lighting a fire."
Cardinal O'Connor did not respond to his critics, and his own readiness to confess personal shortcomings and errors offered a disarming contrast, although his critics saw that, too, as calculating. The cardinal's teasing, bantering style of humor could occasionally have a sharp, even mordant, edge, even if the barbs were directed toward himself.
Both his confessions of failure and his self-deprecating humor were part of his way of framing issues in personal terms, a trait that also marked his writing and preaching. Once, when he spoke to New York priests about the archdiocese's financial problems, he dwelt on his own sleepless nights worrying about how the church could meet its responsibilities and pay its bills. Some priests left the meeting reassured to learn that he was worrying over the problems. But others reported frustration at not being given specific facts and figures.
"I regularly go down to the crypt under St. Patrick's Cathedral, and I look at the tombs of my predecessors," the cardinal wrote in one of his typically personal meditations in his weekly column. "Right in the center is the next marble block with no inscription. That's reserved for me. And all that's important when I move into that crypt is that I have served New York as a good priest."

The Euro Falls Below 90 cents, Baffling Central Bankers and Traders

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 3

 BODY:
The euro fell to new lows against the dollar and other major currencies today, settling below 90 cents for the first time.
The plight of the euro has become a source of embarrassment to European political leaders and of bewilderment to currency traders. At today's late price in New York of 89.61 cents, compared with 90.73 cents on Tuesday, it is more than 23 percent below its value at its introduction in January 1999. And after alternating periods of market softness, followed by interim stability, the euro has declined anew in recent weeks, falling at an accelerated pace over the last several days. 
 The reasons for the common currency's decline remain murky. The most obvious source of pressure continues to be the strength of the United States economy, which is growing faster than those in Europe and has been a magnet for capital. Moreover, the dollar's value has been pushed up by expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates -- a step that ordinarily increases the exchange rate of a currency.
But analysts note that the euro has also been losing ground to other currencies. It has fallen further against the Japanese yen than against the dollar, and declined as well against the British pound and the Swiss franc.
"I don't think the strength of the dollar explains everything that is going on," said Joachim Scheide, an economist at the Institute of World Economics in Kiel, Germany. "This is a problem of euro weakness."
By most measures, economic growth and optimism in the 11-nation euro zone are stronger than they have been in years. Growth is expected to exceed 3 percent in 2000, price rises are more modest than in the United States, exports are booming, and even unemployment -- in the last few years Europe's intractable problem -- is declining markedly.
Despite all that, currency traders have begun talking about "panic sales" of euros in recent days. One reason is that international fund managers had been betting on a strong increase in the euro. When the currency defied their expectations and declined further, many institutions were caught with low-value euros that they are now selling every time the rate creeps up a bit.
It probably did not help the single currency that the European Commission and European Central Bank recommended that Greece, rejected for entry into the monetary union two years ago, should now be allowed to join. But analysts said that the decision on Greece probably had little real effect, as most considered it a foregone conclusion.
In recent days, some specialists have begun to blame the central bank and European political leaders for making the problem worse. When the euro was introduced, central bank officials indicated that they had little interest in the day-to-day movements of exchange rates, but were concerned about signs of inflation.
In recent weeks, central bankers have changed their position and made it clear that they are now worried that the euro's weakness could ignite inflation by pushing up the prices of imported goods.
That was the main reason that the European Central Bank gave last week when it raised its benchmark short-term interest rate to 3.75 percent from 3.5 percent -- a move that did not stop the euro from sinking immediately afterward.
Christian Noyer, the bank's vice president, said in a speech today that the euro's slide "puts pressure on price stability," and most analysts expect more rate increases in the near future.
But most of Europe's central bankers remain convinced that intervening in markets to prop up the euro would be fruitless.
"It's very doubtful whether intervention can be successful against the market trend," said Ernst Welteke, president of Germany's central bank, in remarks carried by Bloomberg News. "If one looks, for example, at current U.S. interests," Mr. Welteke added, "it's unlikely that concerted intervention is even possible."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Spring Fireworks for an Old Hub

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
MAYBE credit should go to the reviving art market, the arrival of spring or some kind of harmonic convergence, but Madison Avenue from 69th to 79th Street is rife with art. It's hard to recall a time in the last 20 years when so many galleries on or just off the avenue offered such a diverse range of high-quality viewing opportunities. One resident art dealer cheerfully described the neighborhood as "the Chelsea you can get to."
In the 1960's and 70's Madison Avenue was a major art world hub. Leo Castelli had his gallery on East 77th Street. Sotheby Parke-Bernet, as it was then called, occupied much of the office building at 980 Madison. But by the late 1970's Castelli and other dealers refocused their energies in SoHo, and Sotheby's moved to York Avenue, leaving 980 with a ghost town feeling that it still hasn't shaken. Galleries never completely left the area, but the center of action shifted decisively. 
 It would be an exaggeration to say it has shifted back, but some reconcentration is definitely going on. Over the last few seasons several new galleries have opened, and even more have moved here from sites around Manhattan or beyond. There has been a flurry of renovation as town house spaces and whole town houses have been readied for showing art.
Even Castelli's old gallery has been spiffed up and occupied by Michael Werner, the German art dealer who has relocated his New York headquarters from East 67th Street and reopened with a spectacular late Picabia show. Given that the new owners of the Fuller Building, one of the main anchors of the 57th Street gallery neighborhood, plan to make it a residential condominium, this trend will probably continue.
But pure serendipity may also be a big factor. At the moment there are outstanding shows in galleries that don't have regular public exhibitions, like the imposing display of Lucian Freud's new paintings at Acquavella. There are shows that are special occasions, like the engaging survey of the 19th-century American painter Frederic Edwin Church at Berry-Hill, and shows that observe them, like Knoedler's "Collector as Patron in the 20th Century," intended to mark the end of the century. And there are new signs of activity in galleries that have been unusually quiet lately, like "Willem de Kooning: Mostly Women" at Gagosian and the mesmerizing selection of Andy Warhol's paintings of Marilyn, Liz and Jackie at C&M.
If many of the shows are historical, much of the information feels fresh. And while blue-chip painting and big names dominate, shows of photographic works by relatively young artists contribute to the fray. And even when a theme sounds traditional -- the confluence of shows with images of women, for example -- the evidence on the walls is otherwise.
PICABIA: If anything can evoke Madison Avenue's glory days, it's a visit to the second floor of 4 East 77th Street, where Leo Castelli showed his historic roster of artists for more than 30 years. Castelli's simple bronze plaque is still in place to the left of the entrance; Mr. Werner's equally simple new one has been installed respectfully below it. The heavy oak doors are still knobless and still open with a vigorous push; the hallway walls are still dark red, as are the thickly carpeted stairs, which still guarantee a suitably hushed, reverential ascent. The gallery space, discreetly reconfigured by the architect Annabelle Selldorf, looks wonderful, and the Picabia show, full of images of women, gets the main theme of these shows off to a dazzling start.
Francis Picabia (1879-1953), the hyperactive bad boy of French modernism, liked fast cars and glamorous women and changed artistic styles the way most people change socks. He was anointed a postmodernist precursor in the 1980's, when his stylistic profligacy and the layered images of his transparency paintings were hailed as a precedent for artists like Sigmar Polke and David Salle.
This show of more than 40 paintings and gouaches from the early 1920's to the late 40's reiterates Picabia's prescience but emphasizes physical experimentation over polymorphous naughtiness, and a free-ranging curiosity over ironic posturing. It takes passion to maintain such constant motion.
In this show Picabia moves from abstraction to semiabstraction, from single to layered representations. He conjures commercial graphics, thrift-shop painting, Renaissance Madonnas or tourist art, as in the textured starfish in "Etoile." Sometimes, in "Visages," for example, fashion illustration teams up with abstraction, mostly through a love of line, with results that seem simultaneously sweet, seductive and rigorous. And with so many different, often ersatz images of women in play, the effect is often richly ambiguous.
The tangled imagery of "Ridens," one of the best transparencies here, may be suavely random, but it also suggests a portrait of Eve: the overlapping outlines of two Botticelli faces are combined with suggestions of a garden, a serpent, a ram's head, an animalistic face and, at the canvas's left edge, a long double helix that suggests a DNA strand.
 
De Kooning
While Picabia's habit of using existing images of women ties him to Warhol, it also brings him closer to de Kooning than you might expect. The show at Gagosian has a marvelously intimate, overheated feeling, like a visit to de Kooning's East Hampton studio on an August afternoon. The paintings and drawings on view come from one source, the well-known collector John Powers, who died last year, and his wife, Kimiko; the works often bear affectionate inscriptions by the artist.
Dating mostly from the mid-1960's, they are closely related. Adding to the vivid sense of work in progress, they are executed on a remarkable whatever's-handy range of materials: newspaper, kraft paper, paper towels, Masonite and, in one case, a hollow-core door.
If Picabia's images of women can have a surprising sincerity and intensity, de Kooning's manifest an impassioned ribaldry. His paintings seem emotionally and perceptually specific, as if they were painted in direct response to seeing a certain woman in a certain situation and light.
But as Robert Rosenblum reiterates in his catalog essay, they also tap into existing sources, from the ferocious power of prehistoric idols and the monumentality of Rubens's nudes to the luxe sensuality of American movie goddesses like Marilyn Monroe. Her red lips and blue eyes are frequently glimpsed among the slathered pink tones of de Kooning's famously wobbly, blurry, frowzy, implicitly carnal brushwork, and sometimes the famous white sundress, caught in the updraft, seems to be there, too.
 
Warhol
Unlike Picabia and certainly de Kooning, Warhol's paintings of Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis have nothing to do with the flesh. They are images first and last, through and through, disembodied ghosts, really, redolent of newspapers, publicity photographs and film.
Warhol's means centered on a simple silk-screen enlargement of the photograph, a flat, thin black-and-white image animated by a modicum of color. (In his catalog essay, Robert Pincus-Witten notes Warhol's childhood attachment to coloring books.)
Most of the images of Monroe and Ms. Taylor involve blobs and patches of off-register pinks, reds, blues and yellows signaling flesh, lipstick and eyeshadow. The images of Ms. Taylor as Cleopatra and all the paintings of Onassis, which show her during the week of President John F. Kennedy's assassination and funeral, are basically monochromes, printed on canvas painted with a single tone of blue or brown.
To look at these works is, on one level, to appreciate the economy and obviousness of Warhol's magic: variations, both deliberate and accidental, enhance the effect, including imperfections in printing, shifts in color tone and the occasional reversal of negatives.
Yet Warhol also had history on his side. For weight, he relied on the connection between his paintings and actual events, counting on the ways his subjects already existed in the public imagination and assuming, correctly, that his own work would embed them even more deeply. Few artists have got more out of less.
 
Cindy Sherman
In Cindy Sherman's "Fairy Tale" pictures at Skarstedt, a woman takes the depiction of women into her own hands, and it's not a pretty sight. In these very large color photographs from 1985, Ms. Sherman broached the grotesque for the first time. She began adding prosthetic body parts -- from false noses and masks to breasts and buttocks -- to her disguises. The resulting images suggest cautionary fairy tales intended to induce proper behavior, but in adults rather than children.
These dark, gritty, claustrophobic close-ups show women, or hybrid femalelike creatures, in extreme states, as outcasts or aliens. Sometimes they lie stunned on the ground like victims after a battle or attack; sometimes they are harridans bent on revenge. In one image the addition of little more than a large red tongue creates a devouring giant, while a scattering of tiny toy figures looks very much like her lunch.
These images have lost little of their harsh, enigmatic force. It is especially telling to see so many of them in proximity to the Warhols, with which they share a similar economy of means and obvious yet effective magic.
 
Vik Muniz
At Ubu, Vik Muniz, the peripatetic photographic trickster, unveils two amusing bodies of new work, one in which he shows his hand (like Warhol and Ms. Sherman) and another in which he hides it. The artist's " 'Photographs' " (the quotation marks are part of the title) are facsimiles of snapshots, or so they appear from a distance. Up close they are visibly hand-made: crude, worried-over approximations of the most instantaneous and haphazard of all photographic images.
The rest of the gallery is devoted to Mr. Muniz's "Personal Articles" series, a large group of individually framed clippings from, it would appear, familiar newspapers from the United States and Britain. "Disney Corporation Buys Venice," reads one headline, while others announce "Advertising on Cows and Sheep Forbidden in U.K." and "Oil Spill Shaped Like Virgin."
Not a bit of it is true, at least not yet. Everything that meets the eye -- the headlines, typefaces, layout, texts and newspaper nameplates -- has been created by Mr. Muniz working with a small newspaper printing company in Lower Manhattan. And yet it is more by reading than by looking that the visual lie is apprehended. The frustrations of this experience, undoubtedly intended, are eased by reading the articles, some of which make you laugh out loud.
 
Thomas Ruff
A more traditional approach to photography is evident in a small survey of mostly large works by the 42-year-old German photographer Thomas Ruff at Zwirner & Wirth, one of the neighborhood's recent arrivals. The gallery, which opened in February, is the joint effort of David Zwirner, who has a seven-year-old gallery in SoHo, and Iwan Wirth, a partner in Hauser & Wirth, a longtime gallery in Zurich. (The new space, the ground floor of a town house, is another Annabelle Selldorf design and might almost be in Zurich, it feels so trim and understated.)
The exhibition, meanwhile, confirms that Mr. Ruff, like other younger photographers, is determined to explore his medium from as many angles as possible. It includes small color close-ups of the living spaces in homes of the artist's German relatives that are rich anthropological documents from the early 1980's; two recent examples of the colossal portrait photographs for which he is perhaps best known; an eerily green image of a house made using the infrared night-vision technology used by the military during the Persian Gulf war; and two enormous black-and-white images of dark, star-studded skies that are big enough to feel engulfing and that were made from negatives bought from the European Southern Observatory.
Also on view are examples of Mr. Ruff's latest work, large photographs based on pornographic images taken from the Internet and digitally manipulated. The blurry results are beautiful, mysterious and reminiscent of Gerhard Richter's early paintings. Additional works from this series form a show at Mr. Zwirner's gallery in SoHo.
 
'Collector as Patron'
"The Collector as Patron in the 20th Century" is a two-tiered celebration of Knoedler's long involvement with the cultural life of the United States through its dealings with clients who have given works to museums or, in the case of J. P. Morgan and Henry Frick, founded their own. Upstairs are 22 postwar American works, owned by several contemporary collectors, organized by the art historian and critic Irving Sandler; it includes especially impressive works by Romare Bearden, David Park, de Kooning (an exceptional drawing of two women from 1949) and Roy Lichtenstein.
Lining the downstairs gallery, and more unusual, is an archival section that profiles 28 collectors, beginning with Catharine Lorillard Wolfe and including the Havemeyers, the Lewisohns, the Potter Palmers, Albert C. Barnes and Lillie P. Bliss, as well as Frick and Morgan.
Organized by DeCourcy E. McIntosh, executive director of the Frick Art and History Center in Pittsburgh, this display draws heavily but not entirely on the Knoedler archive. It includes short biographies, correspondence, photographs and color reproductions of artworks as well as a few Knoedler ledgers, including one noting Frick's purchase of Vermeer's "Soldier and Laughing Girl" in 1911. The show would make a good book, and Mr. McIntosh, who has already written one on art patronage in Pittsburgh at the turn of the century, may be just the person to do it.
 
Church, Among Others
The Berry-Hill survey of the art of Frederic Edwin Church, accompanied by a detailed catalog by Gerald L. Carr, is a museum-quality show peppered with loans from institutions both famous and obscure. Yet its 50 works on canvas and paper gain immeasurably from an intimate gallery setting.
Ranging from early paintings from the late 1840's and 50's up to the mid-1880's and including a hefty selection of oil sketches, the show creates a vivid picture of Church's innate talent and his dazzling maturation; his affinity for the American landscape; and the interest in exotic vistas and historic sites that took him nearly around the world.
The centerpiece is the grandiose "Cotopaxi" of 1862, from the Detroit Institute of Art, replete with plunging waterfall, shimmering lake, flaming sunset and active volcano, which some consider Church's greatest work. Perhaps one won't be considered chauvinistic for preferring work that originates closer to home, including restrained and meticulous early paintings like "View of Pittsford, Vt." (1848) and views of the Hudson Valley from Church's beloved home Olana, especially one blanketed in snow, from the Heckscher Museum of Art in Huntington.
Nearby, the Gerald Peters Gallery is having a retrospective survey of the painter Max Weber (1881-1961), whose estate it now represents. Weber is remembered primarily as the first American Cubist and an artist who went into a long decline after 1920. This show makes a convincing case for Weber as a restless stylistic vagabond, who (not unlike Picabia) was largely indifferent to the idea of chronology and circled through different ideas for most of his career.
Other shows are worth visiting on one side or the other of those reviewed here. Between Madison Avenue and the Warhols at C&M, Winston Wachter Mayer is showing American paintings from the 1980's.
In the same building as the Sherman show at Skarstedt, one can also visit the Leon Kossoff works at Mitchell-Inness & Nash and a show of Sam Francis's elegantly spare "Edge" paintings from the mid-1960's at Richard Gray.
Across the street from 980 Madison, at the Carlyle Hotel, Ursus Rare Books has organized a show of 40 illustrated books by Picasso, supplemented by a dozen or so etchings from the Vollard Suite.
And among the shows with openings this week are a survey of Louisa Matthiasdottir's paintings at Salander-O'Reilly (now on view) and a new installation of works by Fred Sandback (opening tomorrow) that will inaugurate the Lawrence Markey Gallery, newly arrived from SoHo.

HEADLINE: Police Abuses Abroad

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Post-dictatorship Argentina inherited a legacy similar to the one you cite for South Africa (editorial, May 1). Where an oppressive police apparatus remains in power, that apparatus continues to beget crime, even though police violence is no longer initiated by the government. 
 The police abuses in Argentina, including torture, planting weapons and shooting "fleeing" suspects, were common in the United States until disadvantaged groups were able to exercise such power that coerced confession began to be thrown out of court. Such progress is difficult in places lacking the economic well-being that might allow average citizens collectively to assert their rights.
Prosperity also affects police forces. When the salary of Colombia's police was raised significantly along with educational requirements for recruits, their public image changed sharply for the better.

HEADLINE: DuPont Executive Ends Brief Tenure

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., May 4

 BODY:
E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company said on Tuesday that Kurt Landgraf, chairman and chief executive of its pharmaceutical unit for four months, had resigned after failing to find a major alliance to expand the business.
Mr. Landgraf, 53, was executive vice president and chief operating officer of DuPont, the world's largest chemical company, until he was tapped to run the Dupont Pharmaceuticals Company in January. The unit's president, Nicholas Teti, 47, was named its chief executive. He will retain the title of president. 
 Since early last year DuPont, the maker of the AIDS drug Sustiva, has been seeking ways to bolster its drug business, which is considered relatively small in the consolidating pharmaceutical industry. In a letter to the unit's employees, Mr. Landgraf took responsibility for the failure to form a partnership.
"It was my responsibility to conclude an economically meaningful alliance to move our company to its next step in our progressive growth strategy through a significant alliance," Mr. Landgraf said in the letter. "I believe I have worked on a larger alliance without a positive outcome."
The company announced in March last year that it planned to expand the unit by teaming up with big drug companies. DuPont said when it appointed Mr. Landgraf to head the unit that it had rejected several large pharmaceutical joint ventures after it could not agree on financial terms.

HEADLINE: Time Warner's Power Play

 BODY:
Time Warner lost more than a skirmish over money with ABC this week when it backed down from kicking the network's programs off its cable service. Its blunt use of monopoly power was an instant public-relations disaster, and in the long run could enter the annals of business history as a famous strategic blunder. For by overriding the information and entertainment needs of millions of customers, Time Warner virtually compelled federal regulators to take a more searching look at Time Warner's proposed merger with AOL.
After all, if Time Warner behaves this way now in response to Disney, the parent of ABC and a media giant itself, how will it behave after it joins forces with AOL? More to the point, will the merged company use its control of cable television's vital electronic pipeline to favor its own programs and deny competing programs fair access to millions of consumers along that pipeline? 
 Now that federal authorities have been forewarned about Time Warner's muscular, proprietary attitude, they cannot consider approval of the Time Warner-AOL merger a foregone conclusion. If it is approved, the Federal Communications Commission or Federal Trade Commission should impose stiff conditions that would make it impossible for Time Warner to behave in the future as the company behaved this week.
It must be remembered that the F.C.C. has a mandate to protect the public interest in the communications and information industries. Its responsibilities go beyond the narrow questions of anti-competitive business practices examined by the antitrust authorities in the Justice Department or, in this case, the Federal Trade Commission. The F.C.C. must protect the broader public interest in the free flow of information and in open access to electronic commerce.
The fundamental problem for the F.C.C. is that cable companies like AT&T and Time Warner own not only the cable wire that runs into everyone's home, but also some of the programs that are delivered over that wire. That puts them in position to discriminate in favor of the program channels they own, and therefore to filter the information and commercial opportunities presented to cable subscribers. Monopoly is bad enough in the orange juice or suspenders markets. It is downright dangerous when it compromises the public's right to diversified sources of news and entertainment.
What divides Disney and Time Warner is not so much the current financial arrangement as it is the emerging issue of parity of services and future income opportunities along the information highway. Soon cable systems will offer a panoply of digital services -- giving viewers the option, for example, of purchasing a biography from a local bookstore about a historical figure in the movie they are watching.
Disney fears that Time Warner will provide better services for its own channels, like HBO or CNN, than it will for Disney's channels. To protect itself, Disney wants federal regulators to require parity, or non-discrimination. Time Warner would be required to provide equivalent services to all channels. Time Warner rejects the idea, asserting that the principle of non-discrimination sounds nice but cannot be defined or regulated before the digital services exist. Besides, it says, the services will be profitable and thus should be a matter of private negotiation, not rule-making from Washington.
Time Warner has a right to make this turf-guarding argument, but the F.C.C. cannot be paralyzed by it. This battle is not just over cable broadcasts of quiz shows. Cable operators like Time-Warner already provide high-speed access to the Internet. But cable customers can use only the Internet services chosen by the cable company. This has to be an open environment, where customers have as full a choice among Internet companies as technology allows. While this page supported the Federal Communications Commission's decision last year to wait before regulating access to the Internet, this week's events remind us of the pace of change and the need for ongoing vigilance. There is now ample reason for the F.C.C. to act.
The point is not that we are siding with Disney, but that federal regulators, as they study the merger, should be guided by the same principle in regard to Internet access and digital television services: non-discrimination. Time Warner says there is no need for federal regulations because it does not in fact discriminate against programs it does not own and has promised to provide open access to the Internet. But the public need not rely on voluntary compliance.
Federal regulators balked last year because they did not know how to enforce non-discrimination. But that need not bring oversight to a halt. They can declare the principle of non-discrimination without issuing a bevy of rules. The mere announcement puts cable companies on notice that, as soon as technology allows, they will be required to treat all Internet companies and cable programmers the same. If they decide to design their systems otherwise, they will be held accountable.
Such a policy would probably serve the long-term financial interests of this newspaper and many other media companies. But the decision, in the end, must be shaped by the public interest. Democracy requires an open communication environment. Monopoly control over cable access threatens the flow of ideas and opinion that feeds the democratic process, not to mention the emerging electronic economy. For now, perhaps, only the principle of non-discrimination can be declared, with the rule book to be written as conditions require. But the Time Warner-ABC conflict proves that it is time to start declaring principles and working on instituting them.

HEADLINE: Sprechen Sie Technology?;
Europeans Try to Relax Borders for Skilled Workers

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 4

 BODY:
Eric Perbos-Brinck gave up a promising management career last year at Promodes, the big French retailer, to start an Internet company called Bravonestor.com. He began in November with just 2 people, but already has 10 employees, with plans to hire 5 more in the next few weeks. To fill the jobs, Mr. Perbos-Brinck, 31, casts his net wide. One of his programmers is Moroccan. The designer of search engines is Senegalese. Both were studying in France as exchange students when Mr. Perbos-Brinck found them in a desperate search.
"It's difficult and it's an issue," he said. "One of my American investors said, 'This is war, so get anyone you can, anywhere.' " 
 Mr. Perbos-Brinck's polyglot staff would not draw a second glance in the United States, where the technology industry's ravenous demand for skilled workers has created a multinational, multicultural work force that includes many foreigners. But in Europe, his effort to find qualified help has collided with one of Europe's most divisive issues: immigration.
The historic European antipathy toward immigrants has only sharpened in recent years. But with the European economy on the rebound, unemployment dropping from the extremely high levels of the mid-1990's and leaders clamoring to catch up with the United States in high technology, business faces a serious problem.
Although job creation is gradually reducing overall unemployment rates, Europe finds itself in the curious situation of facing much higher unemployment than in the United States yet simultaneously suffering a critical shortage of skilled high-technology workers that is expected to worsen.
The shortfall is particularly acute in Internet and Web-related businesses because European countries have not trained enough workers of their own with high-technology skills, a problem they are just beginning to address.
As a result, even as overall opposition to immigration remains deeply entrenched, European governments are under pressure to find ways around these obstacles for at least some high-technology workers.
In Britain, Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, proposed in March to relax rules on hiring skilled foreigners.
In Germany, the chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, set off a stormy debate with a proposal to lift visa restrictions so that software experts from India and elsewhere could work in Germany. Even though the plan has not been approved, it has already attracted about 1,800 applications or requests for information.
Pre-empting a final decision, cities like Frankfurt have begun to make exceptions to the rule that keeps foreign computer experts out.
For Ernesto Schmitt, such openings in Europe's immigration net cannot come too soon. Mr. Schmitt, 28, set up Peoplesound.com, a London company that sells music over the Internet, and he uses all the tricks common to start-ups in the United States to find and keep talent, including the use of aggressive international headhunters and the promise of equity stakes in his company. Yet recently, when he discovered talented potential employees in South Africa, he decided he could not hire them. "We did not want the pain of waiting six months for them to get visas," he said.
The new economy is not waiting for governments to act on the shortage, which is leading to brawls for talented people. At big corporations, once the safe domain of career-oriented young Europeans, the best talent is being lured away by headhunters; other gifted young executives are leaving of their own accord, willingly forfeiting the security of the old economy for the rough-and-tumble risk of the new.
Mr. Schmitt, who grew up in Belgium, the son of a Uruguayan mother and German father, is perhaps typical of the new brand of European Web business leader. A self-styled frustrated disc jockey, he took the idea for his company from American models like MP3.com but rejiggered it for the European market. After attracting investors including Bernard Arnault, the wealthy chairman of the LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury goods group, he gave up the comfort of a secure job at the Boston Consulting Group to plunge into the new economy.
Olivier Gravelle, 29, operating in sparsely furnished offices in Paris, recently set up the French unit of Wideyes.com, an online job search company much like Monster.com in the United States. Wideyes, founded in Sweden about a year ago, now employs 70 people there and in Britain, France and Spain. By the end of the year, after moving into Germany and Italy, it expects to have about 230 employees.
"There is a war for talent," said Mr. Gravelle, who is French. Aggravating a basic shortage of skilled workers, upstart companies are acquiring established businesses -- he cites the successful hostile bid by the British wireless company Vodafone AirTouch for the German phone giant Mannesmann -- and needing new-style managers who are suited to the speed and complexity of electronic business.
"People who come to us looking for jobs want mobility; they want to change jobs and to change geographically," Mr. Gravelle said. Young Europeans, he added, "understand their duty to manage their skills and their careers."
Mr. Gravelle himself left a secure job at the consultants Booz Allen & Hamilton in November to join Wideyes. He had met the Swedish founders of Wideyes earlier, while working in Scandinavia for the French bank Credit Lyonnais, before joining Booz Allen.
Five years ago, that kind of mobility was the preserve of a small elite. Today it is so common that European companies are having to learn how to hold on to talented people, often employing means, like stock options, that not long ago were considered symptoms of very un-European greediness. Last month, for example, when Societe Generale in France announced the sale of shares in its online banking unit, Fimatex, it did so not least to enable it to retain talent by offering stock options, after the executive who started Fimatex was lured by stock options to a competitor.
Consulting companies are among the main beneficiaries of the growth, as demand soars from corporations that are in need of skilled help.
Marc A. Enjolras, a partner at Andersen Consulting in Paris, says Andersen will hire 250 people in France this year, increasing its staff to 2,750.
To avoid losing people to Internet start-ups, Andersen France is introducing a number of retention measures already in use in the United States. Starting this year, Andersen's French employees will receive "e-units," or shares in a $1 billion venture capital fund that the firm established in December. In France, as elsewhere, Andersen is also shortening the path to full partner by eliminating the rank of associate partner.
Hugues Bertrand, director of the Center for the Study of Employment and Qualification in Marseille, a port city plagued by high unemployment and urban decay, said that in large measure "companies that are successful are those that are creative and active in finding people." Much European job growth is coming not in technical professions, he added, but in traditional fields like education, career training and health and fitness services. "Preparation need not be so much technical as social -- dealing with people, running an organization," he said.
Many business leaders argue that the shortage of technology workers is real and that failure to address it will stunt Europe's revived growth.
Bernard Vergnes, the 54-year-old chairman of Microsoft Europe, points to a study commissioned by Microsoft and published in March by the International Data Corporation that suggests that European demand for skilled professionals in telecommunications and computers will outstrip supply by as much as 13 percent over the next three years.
Microsoft recently joined a group of Europe-based technology companies, including British Telecommunications, Nokia of Finland and Siemens of Germany, as well as IBM Europe, to urge greater cooperation between industry and governments in training skilled technology workers.
Hardest hit by the shortages, according to the International Data study, will be Germany, which has the largest European economy and is the heart of European Internet business. Demand for talent in Germany is expected to exceed supply by as much as 15 percent, or more than 400,000 jobs.
Touring a computer fair in March, Mr. Schroder, the German chancellor, responded to industry's demands for help by taking a chapter from United States policy and promising to offer temporary work permits -- a kind of German green card -- to as many as 20,000 skilled foreigners, notably from India and Eastern Europe. In return, German industry leaders promised to step up the training of domestic computer experts.
The plan quickly drew fire from labor unions and opposition parties, who cited Germany's 4 million unemployed and 7.3 million foreigners, the highest number of immigrants in any European country. It also faced criticism from Mr. Schroder's own labor ministry. Gerd Andres, the ministry's No. 2 official, said the plan would only "bring cheap labor into the country."
German cities have jumped the gun on this issue. In Frankfurt, the German financial capital and a major computer center, the local investment promotion agency, with the approval of local immigration officials, has persuaded six software companies from India to establish affiliates in the city.
The agency's director, Hartmut Schwesinger, said recently that six more Indian companies were about to follow and that he was in discussions with 30 more.
Still, given the Continent's distaste for foreigners, not everyone is convinced that foreign workers will come even if the German proposal is repeated across Europe.
Andrew Milroy, who oversaw the shortages study for International Data, recalled talking with Sri Lankan and Indian software experts who said they would not be inclined to accept a European invitation.
Mr. Milroy recalled their saying, "Europe is just not a welcoming place to live."

HEADLINE: After Rising Steadily, Productivity Slowsin First Quarter

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
After rising spectacularly for six months, the productivity of American workers climbed more slowly in the first quarter, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday. Once again, most of the improvement came in the manufacture of computers, machinery, autos, appliances and other durable goods -- particularly computers and the chips that go into them.
Labor productivity rose at a 2.4 percent annual rate. That was less than half the improvement in the two previous quarters and, indeed, one of the poorer quarterly performances in the last two years. But over the last four quarters, productivity is still rising at a very strong 3.7 percent, unchanged from December. 
 "Underlying productivity is still very strong," said James Glassman, senior domestic economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
The labor productivity growth rate published by the bureau is the chief measure of the efficiency of the average American worker. When the growth rate rises at a 2.4 percent annual rate, that means in effect that a steelworker, for example, has improved his efficiency sufficiently to produce $102.40 worth of steel each hour, up from $100. Or an auto mechanic, given better tools, or simply working faster, has increased the garage's revenue from repairing cars by a similar amount.
Higher productivity means that companies collect more revenue without employing more labor. The additional money can then go into raising profits or raising wages, or both, without having to raise prices. "There is not a lot of inflation pressure coming from labor costs yet," said Ken Matheny, senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis, "but that situation could quickly reverse."
Unit labor costs, the outlay in wages and benefits to labor for making a fixed amount of steel or repairing a car, did rise at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter, after having fallen in the two previous quarters. But over the last 12 months, from April 1999 through March of this year, unit labor costs were up only 0.7 percent.
The strong productivity growth -- averaging 2.8 percent annually since the end of 1995, up from 1.8 percent in the first half of the decade and even slower rates in most of the 1980's and 1970's -- helps to explain why inflation has remained mild.
Another measure of labor costs, however, is not as promising. Hourly compensation -- covering every outlay for labor, including bonuses and stock options, when they are cashed in -- rose at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, up from 3.8 percent in the fourth, the bureau reported yesterday. Although 4.2 percent represents one of the smallest quarterly increases in the last two years, many economists on Wall Street nevertheless expressed the worry that inflationary pressures were developing.
They note that the rise in compensation is now clearly outstripping the rise in productivity, a trend not as clear in the third and fourth quarters of 1999, when productivity grew at annual rates of 5 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively.
If productivity growth is slowing, and it may be, Mr. Matheny said, that would create inflationary wage pressures.
For many economists, the most interesting issue is whether the surge in productivity since 1995 reflects rising productivity throughout the economy or is narrowly focused. And the answer appears to be narrowly focused, on durable manufactured goods: machinery, steel, appliances, vehicles, computers, semiconductors, communications equipment and the like.
Those goods account for 12 percent of the nation's nonfarm business output, and if they are subtracted, then the productivity growth rate for the remaining 88 percent is only 1.8 percent, said Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist.
Other experts gave similar credit to the efficiencies achieved in manufacturing durable goods, particularly computers, semiconductors and communications equipment. Part of the strong productivity growth in computers represents improvement in quality. Workers, in effect, get credit for manufacturing ever more powerful and more valuable computers.
A drag on productivity in the first quarter came in the service sector, in such things as legal and educational services and auto repair. The number of hours worked rose more quickly in the first quarter than output, contributing to the slower productivity growth rate.
The Defense Department also contributed -- by making payments in the fourth quarter for goods and services produced in the first. The payments were added to fourth-quarter output, but the hours worked to produce the prepaid goods and services were registered in the first.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: SOCIAL SECURITY;
2 Democrats Propose Panel To Overhaul Social Security

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
Two Democratic senators today criticized Vice President Al Gore's approach to Social Security, saying his plan would make the retirement system dependent on general tax revenue.
The senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, spoke as they joined with Senator John McCain of Arizona, the recent Republican presidential candidate, to propose a bipartisan Congressional commission to plan a comprehensive overhaul of the Social Security system. 
 The Democrats' remarks were not surprising. Both Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Kerrey supported former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey in the Democratic primaries. And both have long differed with their party and favored an effort to overhaul the retirement system that includes individual investment accounts.
Mr. Kerrey recently met to discuss Social Security with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the expected Republican presidential nomineee.
But the trio's push for a commission showed how the heated Social Security debate in the presidential race is reaching Capitol Hill and highlighting existing splits in the Democratic Party.
Right after the three senators spoke, two other Democratic senators, Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota and Charles E. Schumer of New York, held their own news conference to criticize Mr. Bush's interest in including individual investment accounts as an element of overhauling Social Security.
"To take a portion of the Social Security system and move it into private accounts, and subject it to substantial risk, I think is moving in exactly the wrong direction," Mr. Dorgan said.
Social Security has long collected more in payroll taxes than it has paid out in benefits. But that is projected to start changing in 2015, when the baby boomers begin to retire.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush advocate sharply different approaches to Social Security.
Mr. Gore has put paying down the $3.5 trillion national debt at the center of his economic agenda. That would reduce the federal government's interest payments. He proposes to keep Social Security solvent through 2050 by allocating the interest savings to the retirement system.
Mr. Bush is to speak next week on Social Security and include a call for putting some portion of payroll taxes into private accounts. Under this approach, part of the retirement benefit would be guaranteed and part would fluctuate with individual investment decisions.
Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Kerrey were drawn into spelling out their differences with their party's presumptive presidential nominee by reporters. Mr. Moynihan branded the word "privatization" a "scare word," and he and Mr. Kerrey said Mr. Gore's approach would in essence change the very nature of the retirement program.
"The American people have to decide," Senator Kerrey said, "do you want to convert Social Security from a program that's been funded by the payroll tax into a program that's going to be funded increasingly with income taxes?"
Asked about the commission today, Mr. Gore dismissed the idea, saying: "These commissions are in the eye of the beholder. I disagree with them, and agree instead with the great majority of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and the House who are not for privatization of Social Security."
Mr. Bush, campaigning in California, praised the three senators. "I appreciate so very much the tone of their press conference," he said. "This shouldn't be a partisan issue."
The commission proposed by the senators would report in time for a vote in Congress next year. By then, Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Moynihan will have retired from the Senate.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Bush Pressing Republicans on China Vote, Gently

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: MISSION VIEJO, Calif., May 4

 BODY:
Three weeks before a closely watched vote in Congress on trade relations with China, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and his advisers are making sure to remind Capitol Hill Republicans of his support for the bill and have not ruled out his calling undecided House Republicans.
Aides said Mr. Bush was planning to give a speech the week before the House vote, which is expected between May 22 and Memorial Day, to explain anew why he feels so strongly about facilitating trade between the United States and China. 
 Those remarks will probably be delivered in Seattle or some other city on the West Coast, a region that pins many economic hopes on commerce with Asian nations.
"I'll speak out about it," Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said aboard his campaign plane Wednesday afternoon, referring to the vote.
Asked if he would phone individual Republicans who were undecided, Mr. Bush first said he doubted it, then added, "I shouldn't say categorically no."
Several aides to Mr. Bush said the possibility of such calls had been discussed by Republican officials on Capitol Hill and some of the governor's advisers in Austin, Tex., but that nothing had been decided.
Congress is being asked to establish permanent normalized trade relations with China -- in effect, sacrificing its annual review of China's trading rights -- and to treat Beijing as it does most other members of the World Trade Organization.
But one aide to Mr. Bush said the governor was wary of doing anything, on any issue, that resembled outright lobbying, because such actions might appear inappropriate.
"Unless and until you are elected, it is best to have a healthy respect for the office of the presidency and the legislative branch," the aide said.
About two-thirds of House Republicans support the measure and about one-third oppose it, Congressional Republicans say, but 20 to 30 House Republicans are undecided.
It could work to Mr. Bush's advantage to sway them, because it would demonstrate that his calls for more open trade with China have not fallen on deaf ears in his own party. Moreover, it would show he can exert leadership over Republicans and promote cohesiveness among them.
But Mr. Bush has almost equal reason not to push too hard. Should the measure fail, its loss would owe more to Democratic opposition than Republican and would give Mr. Bush another issue with which to beat Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, who also supports it.
Mr. Bush could argue that the Clinton administration -- and by extension Mr. Gore -- could not win enough Congressional cooperation to pass any meaningful legislation, political analysts said.
Indeed, discussing the vote aboard his campaign jet, Mr. Bush tried to shift the topic from his plans to those of Mr. Gore. Referring to telephoning members of Congress, Mr. Bush said: "The interesting question is, Will Vice President Gore? Because it's his administration that's trying to get the bill through."
Several House Republican aides said that Mr. Bush would probably not be asked to approach individual Republicans, because House Republicans already knew where the governor stood on the issue and would have factored that into their deliberations.
"Not one member has said, 'Is Governor Bush with us? I could use a call' " one House aide said. "But if a member says it would be really helpful to get a call from Governor Bush, we'd ask him, and we're confident he'd say yes."
Several House Republican aides said that Mr. Bush would probably not be asked to approach individual Republicans, because House Republicans already knew where the governor stood on the issue.
For months along the campaign trail, Mr. Bush has declared his support for permanent normalized trade relations with China.
He has said American farms and businesses would benefit from freer access to China's markets, even as the causes of human rights and democracy in China would be served by more exposure to American products and ideas.
Last week, Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, discussed the issue with House and Senate Republicans, but she said today that she did not meet specifically with undecided Republicans or argue Mr. Bush's position.
"I was more asking them questions about where it all stood than pressing an agenda," Ms. Rice said. "They have no questions about where he stands. He's made it very clear."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Harlem to Add 8 Rental Buildings in City Program

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Eight vacant or partly occupied city-owned lots in Harlem are to be filled over the next two and half years with 726 mixed-income rental apartments under a new city program.
The studio to three-bedroom units will be in 4- to 11-story buildings at cross streets along Frederick Douglass Boulevard, Fifth, First and Bradhurst Avenues. Spread among the buildings will also be 104,000 square feet of space for professional offices, stores and community uses, including an annex for a charter school. While the plans for these buildings still must undergo review and could be modified, construction is expected to start in the summer of 2001, city housing officials said. 
 Most of the apartments are to be rented with income limits to tenants who may make up to $140,500 a year, depending on family size. Some units are to be leased at market rents.
The projects are part of the Cornerstone Program, started by New York City's Department of Housing Preservation and Development last October to spur mixed-income housing in areas where the city has made substantial investments and private market forces have taken hold. Initially, the program will focus on Harlem, "where the strength of the private market is most evident," said Richard T. Roberts, the commissioner of the housing department.
"The program is intended to send a clear signal that we want to focus on housing that relies more on private financing and less on public subsidies," he said. Of the $145 million being invested in the initial projects, $11.7 million is in direct public subsidy, he said.
The city is selling the first eight sites for $1 each to developers, whose proposals were selected last month from 44 others. In turn, the developers "dictated what was viable to develop on the sites" and chose from several existing public financing sources, Mr. Roberts said.
While many civic and political leaders in Harlem have welcomed the new housing, there are concerns. One is the lack of opportunities for home ownership; another is that few Harlem-based development groups were selected to build the projects.
The developers were chosen on the strength of their proposals, development records and access to "the equity to successfully develop the projects," Mr. Roberts said.
Five of the initial eight projects are to receive financing from the New York City Housing Development Corporation's New Housing Opportunities Program. It provides developers with bond financing as well as a subsidy in the form of a second loan at an interest rate of 1 percent for up to $40,000 per unit.
Depending on family size, the tenant's annual income may not exceed seven or eight times the monthly rents, or 250 percent of the median city income, or $140,500, whichever is less. Tenants are expected typically to earn $40,000 to $90,000 a year. Maximum monthly rents are to range from $850 for a studio to $1,750 for a three-bedroom unit.
Among the projects is a 64-unit, 6-story apartment building at the southwest corner of Frederick Douglass Boulevard and West 117th Street. The $15 million project will include a 31,500-square-foot annex for the John A. Reisenbach Charter School as well as 5,300 square feet of stores. It will be developed using $1.9 million in bond financing from the city's Housing Development Corporation and $1 million from the borough president's office. The developer is a joint venture of TNS Development Group of Mount Vernon and Lemle & Wolff of the Bronx.
"Harlem is an active market where rents are rising," said Steven M. Judelson, vice president of TNS. "But today, the rental income is still not enough to cover the cost of developing and owning the project."
He said the partners would invest $2.2 million of their own money into the project and secure the rest from private sources. Rents for the one- to three-bedroom apartments are expected to be $850 to $1,250 a month.
The partners, using $1.2 million in private financing, will also redevelop a smaller site, about 200 feet east of their corner site, into three four-story three-family homes.
The other middle-income projects are a 145-apartment building on the west side of Fifth Avenue between 138th and 139th Streets; a 144-unit structure on the west side of First Avenue between 102nd and 103rd Streets; a 98-unit building on the northeast corner of Douglass Boulevard and West 117th Street; and a 41-unit on the south side of 117th Street between Douglass Boulevard and St. Nicholas Avenue.
The final two developments, both on Bradhurst Avenue, are proposed as so-called 80-20 projects. With such projects, the state or the city issues tax-exempt bonds to provide financing to builders, who in return keep 20 percent of the rentals affordable to low-income tenants. The remaining units are leased at market rents.
Those projects -- one with 153 apartments in an 11-story, $35 million building, the other with 60 units in a 5-story $16 million structure -- are to rise on the northeast corner and southwest corner respectively of Bradhurst Avenue and West 145th Street. The developer is a partnership between the Richman Group, based in Elmsford, N.Y., and the Gotham Organization of Manhattan.
Plans call for each of the buildings to have one- to three-bedroom apartments, with 608 to 1,200 square feet. The affordable units will be for tenants with annual incomes of up to $32,600, depending on family size. Monthly rents for the market-rate apartments are expected to be $1,200 to $2,700 a month, said Pam King, assistant vice president of the Richman Group.

Rogue Software Program Wreaks Havoc Worldwide
A rogue software program, borne by an e-mail message proclaiming "I love you," wreaked havoc around the world, jamming and crashing e-mail systems and destroying data on hundreds of thousands of computers.
To defend themselves, thousands of corporations unhooked their computer systems from the Internet and began the slow process of purging the program internally. The program also hit government agencies, including the White House, the Pentagon, Congress and the British House of Commons. Page A1.

HEADLINE: New York Threatens to Hand Over Its Airports to British Company

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
New York City officials escalated their fight against the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey yesterday, announcing that they would hire the operator of London's airports to monitor the agency's management of Kennedy and La Guardia Airports, and possibly to take them over.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said in a statement released yesterday that the city had chosen BAA USA Inc. as its management consultant and likely future operator of the city's airports when the Port Authority lease expires in 2015. 
 BAA is a publicly held company based in London that got its start as the government agency running Heathrow Airport. In the last 15 years, it has gone private and led the privatization of airport operations and the transformation of airports, from Rome to Melbourne, into retail hubs.
"New Yorkers and visitors to the city are not getting the kind of service they deserve and that a great city deserves from our airports," said Mr. Giuliani, echoing a long-held complaint by his administration that the Port Authority has favored development and growth at Newark Airport over the New York City airports and has diverted $150 million annually from city airport revenues.
"The Port Authority has proven itself unable or unwilling to maintain J.F.K. and La Guardia as first class airports," he said.
John Dyson, chairman of the Mayor's Council of Economic Advisers, who helped evaluate the four bids that the city received in its quest for a new operator, said that he hoped the port agency would "see the handwriting on the wall" and negotiate a quicker exit to the lease.
A spokesman for the Port Authority said that the agency would have no comment on the city announcement. But some within the agency and on its board of commissioners said privately that they did not believe the city was seriously committed to such a takeover. They also questioned the legality of efforts by the current mayor to dictate a management agreement for whoever is mayor 15 years from now.
And the plan drew immediate criticism from community leaders in the Queens communities adjacent to the airports.
Elizabeth Braton, chairwoman of Community Board 10, which covers the area adjacent to Kennedy, said the community had not been consulted about a process that, she said, could turn the airports over to companies that value profits over the wishes of local residents.
David C. Soumi, the vice president of BAA's United States subsidiary, based in Sterling, Va., said he was pleased with the confidence the city had shown in the company. In the past, Mr. Soumi had said that the New York area airports were so important in international travel and so potentially lucrative "that it is inconceivable that we would not take a look at getting involved."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Yellow Brick Geopolitics

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Al Gore delivered a provocative foreign policy speech Sunday that raised an important question: Does George W. Bush have the experience, the gravitas and, by implication, the brains to run U.S. foreign policy?
If not, said Mr. Gore, one can only assume that "the gaps in Governor Bush's foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership." 
 Now this is a legitimate question. Mr. Bush has no experience in foreign policy, the well-displayed gaps in his knowledge suggest he may not have even read the newspaper much, and this could make him easy prey for the foreign policy ideologues in his party.
But in raising this question Mr. Gore, inadvertently, raises a question about himself -- a question that many people who respect him have been asking. If you talk to Al Gore about geopolitics, the Internet or the global economy, you leave feeling he really does get it. But what good are brains if you don't always act on them? Mr. Bush may not have the brains to always do the right thing, but does Mr. Gore have the spine?
Most of Mr. Gore's speech was a serious appeal for an activist, internationalist U.S. foreign policy -- something that, in fairness, Mr. Bush would also pursue. So what was legitimate in Mr. Gore's critique of Mr. Bush? It's the charge that the internationalism Mr. Bush offers often sounds like a we-will-do-whatever-we-want-because-we're-the-only-superpower-and-I-am-not-a-wimp-like-Clinton set of policies, which, if adopted at once, could be destabilizing and would have virtually no allied support. The best thing you can say is that Mr. Bush doesn't really mean some of this stuff. But what if he does?
What if he really is ready to unilaterally "withdraw" from the ABM treaty, if the Russians won't change it, and destroy the whole fabric of arms control? What if he really is ready to plunk down billions to build a dubious missile defense system against a dubious threat? What if he really is ready to launch a war to "take out" Saddam Hussein? What if he really is ready to expand NATO to the Russian border?
If it were his father, the former president, you know that he would do the prudent thing. But we don't know that with George W., and when you look at his own party's willingness to be led around by the fringe views of Jesse Helms, well, Mr. Gore is right to ask: Is George W. his father's son or his advisers' captive?
But as for Mr. Gore, in his speech he called for a foreign policy of "forward engagement" -- addressing problems early before they become a crisis and doing so "as close to the source of the problem as possible." Well, I can think of no problem more in need of such forward engagement than the U.S. embargo of Fidel Castro's Cuba, which has failed for 40 years to oust the Cuban dictator and, if continued, is only going to ensure that when Castro dies the Cuban economy collapses, civil war breaks out and thousands of Cubans sail for Miami. Fixing that policy means engaging the hard-line Miami Cubans, who want no change in policy, but as Mr. Gore showed in the Elian case, that sort of tough love is not his thing.
Elian was not a one-day story. It was one of those moments when you get to see everyone's character: Attorney General Janet Reno stood her ground. Mr. Bush said what his advisers told him to say. And Mr. Gore tried to both exploit the Elian saga for political advantage and hide from it.
In his speech, Mr. Gore decried "protectionism and isolationism," but when union-led demonstrators were disrupting the World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle in the name of more protectionism, Mr. Gore was silent. What good is it to be for things in principle if you won't take them on in practice? I know Mr. Gore has cast tough votes before. I know he has to get elected. But the growing trend in the Clinton years was that the campaign never ends. This administration has not given a Sister Souljah speech to anyone in a long, long time.
That's why the best you can say today about Governor Bush on foreign policy is that he doesn't really mean it, and won't do the wrong thing. He'll wise up. And the best you can say about Al Gore is that he really does mean it and will do the right thing. He'll stand up. But both still have something to prove.

HEADLINE: Surviving, or Not, on Calamity;
For Allegany Store, No Bad News Is Not Good News

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

DATELINE: ALLEGANY, N.Y., April 30

 BODY:
The gas masks are gone. The camouflage outfits and combat knives, the first-aid kits and how-to manuals for building underground shelters. All gone.
For better or worse, that Y2K disaster thing never happened. So Dave Boser and Bill Baxter, owners of the Survival Preparedness Center on Main Street here, had no choice but to shut it down a couple of weeks ago. Now the dedicated campers and those lock-and-load militia boys from the surrounding hills of western New York will have to go elsewhere for their dehydrated fruit mix. 
 "Before Y2K, there were so many people in the store that we couldn't take care of them," Mr. Baxter said Saturday, his voice echoing in the nearly empty store. The ensuing silence spoke to the dramatic drop in business after New Year's Day -- when a feared computer problem did not cast the world into darkness and the dawn of the year 2000 did not bring nuclear winter.
In the corner sat size 10 cans of "Provident Pantry" dehydrated food -- elbow macaroni, blueberry muffins, egg whites -- that will keep for a decade. Nearby was half a case of 100-hour paraffin candles. Still taped to the wall, just above the now-empty knife case, were the business cards of recruiters for the Navy and the Marines.
But the preparedness entrepreneurs have not abandoned their business. They plan to put together a catalog of their merchandise, and have hopes of selling some of the leftover inventory at cost. A Mormon church in the area has already expressed interest in their 429 cans of dehydrated food.
And who knows when fear of a looming disaster might drum up some more interest? Mr. Baxter mentioned in passing the possibility of a cataclysmic event on May 5, when -- according to a futurist he respects -- an alignment of the sun and several planets will disturb the earth's axis and cause all kinds of havoc. He sounded more matter-of-fact than frightened.
At the very least, the two men now have the kind of customer service experience not to be found at the Wal-Mart store just two miles down the road. They have loaded up the cars of two women known as the "Y2K queens," witnessed firsthand the economic impact of prophecies, and rung up sales for skinheads from Altoona, Pa.
"There's a lot of smart people out there," Mr. Boser said, peering from under his "Vietnam Veteran & Proud of It" hat. "And a lot of dumb people."
Allegany is a small town of 8,500 people along New York's Southern Tier, about 60 miles south of Buffalo. It is a place where the Allegheny River beckons and the foothills lend crispness to the air, a place where students from nearby Saint Bonaventure University come to live for a while, then leave. But the farmers and the shop owners, the Dave Bosers and Bill Baxters, stay; it is their home.
Mr. Boser, 49, is a machinist now, but the year he spent soldiering in Vietnam shaped his worldview; his key chain features the POW/MIA logo. Mr. Baxter, 47, works at the water treatment plant in Olean, a few miles away. They both smoke, drink beer, stay rail-thin somehow, and share an interest in the accouterments of survival preparedness.
"I've always saved stuff for whatever happened," Mr. Boser explained. "Storms, tornadoes, my daughter's car breaking down. And it's not just meals. It's first-aid kits, radios, packs of water, camping supplies."
By the fall of 1998, word spread among the campers, hunters and survivalists in the area that Mr. Boser and Mr. Baxter were buying supplies at various outlets, partly in anticipation of the year 2000. The two men soon found themselves putting in orders for other people. Then it struck them: they should open their own shop.
Soon, a new presence had established itself among the bars, restaurants and shops of downtown Allegany. Now a visitor could conveniently pick up a St. Bonaventure mug at the Fabulous Shirtheads Co. Store, buy a tuna sandwich at the Allegany Sub Shop, and select an outfit designed for chemical warfare before leaving town.
Mr. Baxter spoke with pride of the wares their store once offered. The camouflage outfits in "United Nations, European and, of course, American" styles were popular with local militia types, as well as with people who liked to play paintball. The combat knives sold fairly well, as did the manuals on map reading.
Most of the goods were geared for everyone from casual campers to those with an abiding distrust of government. The hand-cranked radios, for example, were big sellers around Christmas. Another big hit was the dehydrated pudding, in chocolate, vanilla and banana.
For more discerning consumers, specialized items were also available: your Israeli gas masks, your samurai swords. Mr. Baxter said that a doctor from Jamestown once came in to buy a bulletproof vest and a helmet; they later learned that he performed abortions.
The store sold no guns or firearms accessories. "And we never carried books that were offensive," Mr. Boser said. "I mean, we'd get requests for bomb-making manuals."
Some of the area churches proved to be regular customers, particularly those concerned with prophecies of impending doom. According to Mr. Baxter, a man claiming to be a minister from Bradford, Pa., drove up in a Cadillac one day, popped the car's trunk and issued the order to "fill 'er up" with supplies.
There were other customers claiming to belong to this militia group or that militia group. Mr. Baxter said the largest in the area hailed from rural McKean County, just over the border in Pennsylvania. Another militia is based right here in Cattaraugus County, he said. In fact, the head of the group was nice enough to drop off his business card one day.
Mark Potok, the spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization in Birmingham, Ala., that monitors hate groups, said that a group called the Bucktail Militia used to operate out of McKean County, but that it had not been heard from since 1995. Still, he said, "There is heavy movement activity in western Pennsylvania -- both militias and hate groups."
And Timothy McVeigh -- the man awaiting execution for the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 that killed 168 people -- often used property he owned in Humphrey, just three miles north of here, as a shooting range. Mr. Baxter said that he met Mr. McVeigh once through a friend of a friend. "We were more or less into the same thing," he said.
When pushed further about his own political philosophy, Mr. Baxter said that most of the country's wealth seemed to be in the hands of a few people, and that "Mein Kampf" "made a lot of sense." Then he added, "My partner doesn't believe in 'Mein Kampf.' "
He was right. When asked later about Mr. Baxter's views, Mr. Boser gave an exasperated, there-goes-Bill-again kind of expression. "Hitler was a moron," he said. "He was the Antichrist."
Mr. Boser went on to say that while militia types, "hillbillies" and people posing as Vietnam veterans -- which personally disgusts him, he said -- frequented the store, there were plenty of customers interested in nothing more than having "just in case" supplies on hand.
As for his own philosophy, he said that " 'We the people' has become 'We the government.' " Over all, he said, he believes only half of what he sees and half of what he hears, and he belongs to no organization whatsoever -- "not even the V.F.W."
The Survival Preparedness Center did a fairly brisk business in the days before the year 2000. But by late January, after the millennial rush, sales had dropped through the linoleum-tiled floor, and the partners decided that it did not pay to keep the store open.
According to Mr. Potok, many survival-preparedness stores were inundated with complaints and refund requests in the weeks after New Year's Day. He cited a recent letter written by a disgruntled survivalist to Media Bypass, a magazine that he said was popular among people involved in militias. The letter said, in part: "Thanks a lot. I hope I'm not the only one who feels foolish and let down."
Judging by the advertisements of some preparedness outlets, the year 2000 craze was little more than a misunderstanding. The Web site for Captain Dave's Survival Center, in Cranberry Township, Pa., promotes a drastic markdown on gun clips and dehydrated food with the following come-on:
"Now that Y2K is over, what should you be preparing for . . . A nuclear attack or accident? A hurricane or tornado? Biological warfare? Long-term power outages this summer? Terrorism? Inflation and depression? Earthquake? Fire? Unemployment or disability? Identity theft? An oppressive government?"
For his part, Mr. Baxter has not given up on the prospect of future disaster generating future business. "According to the prophecies, New York City is going to be hit with a giant tsunami," he said, a vanilla-flavored cigar clenched in his teeth.
But his partner, Mr. Boser, seemed to be considering more practical possibilities, such as moving the store to where most of the traffic is -- namely, near the Wal-Mart. As for the prediction of calamity on May 5, he said that while he knew some former customers were preparing for disaster, he expected it to be like any other day in Allegany.
"I've got to work that day," he said, "so it don't matter to me."

HEADLINE: Strategic Wheeling and Dealing Over Future Casino in the Catskills

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A year ago, Arthur M. Goldberg, the most successful casino operator in Atlantic City, was warning shareholders that Indian gambling in the Catskills would seriously hurt his company's casinos in New Jersey.
Today, Mr. Goldberg is declaring victory in a brutal, lightning-fast power play in which his supporters say he has vanquished his major New York rival, reinforced his reputation on Wall Street as a brilliant strategist and struck a deal with the St. Regis Mohawk tribe to develop the first casino in the Catskills. 
 Many details of how the deal unfolded are laid out in a lawsuit that a Long Island businessman filed against Mr. Goldberg last month in State Supreme Court in Mineola, N.Y. At issue is whether the agreement was a result of smart politics and shrewd calculation or double-dealing and fraud.
What is clear, however, is the pivotal role played by former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, as well as the labyrinthine way in which the deal developed. What began as an attempt by the Long Island businessman to use Mr. Goldberg's expertise to rescue a foundering Mohawk casino turned into a bitter split and a startling coup for Mr. Goldberg.
Last summer, with the prospect of Indian gambling imminent at a site in the Catskills only 90 miles northwest of Manhattan, Mr. Goldberg wanted a quick entree to the New York market and an Indian tribe. He turned to a trusted adviser, Mr. D'Amato, who had a friend on Long Island, Ivan Kaufman, who ran the St. Regis Mohawks' money-losing casino at the Akwesasne reservation on the Canadian border.
Mr. D'Amato brought the two men together, telling Mr. Kaufman that Mr. Goldberg could solve his financial problems.
But after lengthy negotiations, Mr. Goldberg wound up with everything and Mr. Kaufman was thrown off the reservation. In his lawsuit, which is on hold while the two sides conduct settlement talks, Mr. Kaufman claims that Mr. Goldberg double-crossed him, poisoning his relationship with the tribe and reneging on a $30 million deal to buy out his interest in the Akwesasne casino. Mr. Goldberg's true intention, the lawsuit says, was to curry favor with the Mohawks to gain exclusive gambling rights in the Catskills.
On Monday, Mr. Goldberg announced that his company, Park Place Entertainment, and the Mohawks would seek federal approval to build a casino-resort at Kutsher's County Club, near Monticello, that would rival Foxwoods in Connecticut, the largest casino in the world. Mr. Goldberg's agreement with the tribe grants him exclusive rights to develop and manage Mohawk casinos throughout New York.
The deal got a warm reception on Wall Street, but it bewildered federal officials and infuriated local legislators who have supported a separate application by the Mohawks and their original partners, Catskill Development, for a $500 million casino at the Monticello Raceway. That application was approved just last month by the Interior Department after a four-year review. But Mr. Goldberg's deal with the Mohawks threatens Catskill Development's relationship with the tribe, which has refused to comment on either proposal.
Despite the optimistic declarations from Park Place, it remains unclear whether Mr. Goldberg will, or even can, build a casino. The Bureau of Indian Affairs said that Mr. Goldberg must file a new application, a process that could take two to four years.
That potential delay has dissident Mohawks charging that their chiefs have been duped by Mr. Goldberg, who they say is more interested in protecting his Atlantic City casinos than in assisting the impoverished tribe. And local officials are angry about the sudden alliance between the tribe and Mr. Goldberg.
"The only proposal before us is the Monticello Raceway," said Anthony P. Cellini, a town official, "and we're supporting that site."
In response to accusations that he is simply out to block competition for his New Jersey casinos, Mr. Goldberg said yesterday that he fully intended to build a "destination resort" in the Catskills, and that he would give the Mohawks $100 million if he failed to do so after receiving government approvals.
"We have the cash and the expertise to build and operate a casino tomorrow," he said. "Otherwise, the Native Americans wouldn't have us up there trying to save 500 jobs."
As for the lawsuit against him, Mr. Goldberg did not rebut the claims in detail, but said: "There's really no case. We can't help it if there's problems with a business transaction."
Mr. Kaufman said the whole debacle began last summer in a conversation with Mr. D'Amato, whom he did not criticize or name in his suit.
"D'Amato's been a friend of ours for quite some time and he's always been helpful," said Mr. Kaufman, who is the president of President R.C.-St. Regis Management Company, which ran the Akwesasne casino, in Hogansburg. "He knew we were having trouble up there. He made the introduction to Mr. Goldberg."
Mr. D'Amato has not returned numerous phone calls over the last four months seeking comment on his role in the casino negotiations. But Wayne Berman, his partner in the Park Strategies consulting firm, confirmed that Mr. D'Amato had introduced the two men. "He was working as a consultant for Park Place," Mr. Berman said. "We're matchmakers. Once the introduction is made, whether they decide to date, break up or get married is up to them."
On the Mohawk reservation, where unemployment ranges between 35 and 40 percent, Mr. D'Amato was a familiar figure. "We've dealt with Mr. D'Amato many times, in and out of office," Gus McDonald, executive director of the St. Regis Mohawks, said in an interview this year. "He's an old friend of ours."
Mr. McDonald would not say whether Mr. D'Amato played a role in the tribe's negotiations with Park Place, although a tribal adviser said that he was active in the talks.
Mr. Berman said that Mr. D'Amato stopped working for Park Place on April 14, the same day Mr. Goldberg signed a secret agreement with the six St. Regis Mohawk chiefs that granted him unusually broad casino development rights. In signing the agreement, the chiefs did not consult any of the three Washington law firms they had hired to work on gambling issues.
According to the lawsuit, Mr. Kaufman first met with Mr. Goldberg last August to discuss new financing or a buyout of his stake in the Akwesasne casino, which was $10 million over budget and losing $300,000 a month. It was supposed to attract 5,000 people a day, but barely 2,000 showed up. Bills went unpaid.
At a meeting in New York City last October, the suit says, Mr. Goldberg made it clear to Mr. Kaufman that his true goal was "obtaining management rights to the tribe's casino gambling in the Catskills." Desperate to keep his casino afloat, Mr. Kaufman agreed to introduce Mr. Goldberg to the Mohawk chiefs only if Park Place bought his interest in the casino and gave him a stake in any future Catskill project.
Around the same time, the lawsuit says, Mr. Goldberg began negotiating with Mark Kutsher to buy an option on Kutsher's County Club, one of the oldest resorts in the Catkills.
Park Place's foray into the Catskills sought to supplant a deal the Mohawks had already struck with Catskill Development, a partnership that included Robert A. Berman (no relation to Wayne Berman), Joseph Bernstein and Alpha Hospitality, a casino operator. That application for 30 acres at Monticello Raceway for a casino was wending its way through the Interior Department.
The proposed casino was expected to be a huge success because of its proximity to northern New Jersey and New York City. Many gambling analysts said it would compete with Atlantic City, where New Yorkers make up 40 percent of the gamblers.
Meanwhile, Mr. Goldberg forged ahead with plans to buy Mr. Kaufman's interest in the Akwesasne casino, and by late November they had agreed to the terms of a deal worth about $30 million to Mr. Kaufman, according to the lawsuit. On Nov. 24, Mr. Goldberg made a big impression on the Mohawks when he flew into tiny Messina, N.Y., aboard his company's Gulfstream jet to meet with the tribe's six chiefs for the first time.
But by February, the lawsuit says, Mr. Kaufman was having trouble keeping the Akwesasne casino open, as Mr. Goldberg slowed the negotiations and eventually whittled his $30 million offer to zero. According to the suit, Mr. Goldberg made negative comments about Mr. Kaufman to the chiefs and advised the Mohawks to break their contract with Alpha Hospitality and Catskill Development.
The Interior Department approved Catskill Development's proposed casino at the Monticello Raceway on April 6, and Gov. George E. Pataki appeared ready to do the same, if settlement negotiations over the Mohawk's land claims went well. A week later, the chiefs told Thomas Aro, a vice president of Alpha Hospitality, that Park Place was interested in the raceway project.
According to an executive at Alpha who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Mr. D'Amato then called his friend Mr. Tollman, the chairman of Alpha, to set up a meeting with Mr. Goldberg. Although the meeting never took place, Mr. Goldberg was moving quickly.
He completed a consulting agreement with the tribe for the Akwesasne casino, and on April 14 signed the development agreement. Three days later, the tribe expelled Mr. Kaufman from the casino and revoked his gambling license, saying he had failed to comply with the tribe's gambling regulations.
Catskill Development is exploring a deal with another tribe, although the Mohawks have not notified the company or the federal government that the raceway project is dead. Mr. Goldberg said neither he nor the tribe had ruled out building a temporary casino on the raceway site.
But several analysts said that Mr. Goldberg has won -- whether he builds a Catskills casino that he estimates will generate more than $1 billion a year and discourage rivals from building new casinos in Atlantic City, or whether the project is delayed, perhaps forever.

HEADLINE: HOUSE TRADE BILL FOR THE CARIBBEAN AND AFRICA PASSES

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
The House today decisively approved legislation that grants more than 70 African and Caribbean countries broad new trading privileges by expanding duty-free access to American markets.
In an unusually strong bipartisan vote, 309 to 110, lawmakers backed a compromise bill that House and Senate negotiators worked out over the last several months, with aides toiling into the early hours this morning to finish the fine print. 
 Supporters hailed passage of the bill as a boost for the flagging economies of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean because it would reduce or eliminate tariffs and quotas on a range of goods made in those regions. Opponents, largely from textile-producing states, warned of devastating job losses in the American apparel industry.
President Clinton strongly supports the measure, which now goes to the Senate for a vote and likely passage as early as next week. The legislation would be the first substantial trade measure enacted in the United States since approval of the Uruguay Round in 1994, which established the World Trade Organization.
"This important measure will strengthen our economic partnership with these nations, lower trade barriers and help developing nations to lift their people out of poverty," Mr. Clinton said today.
Passage of the bill may enhance the prospects for an even larger China trade bill that the House will vote on this month. About five wavering House Democrats have conditioned their support for the China measure in part on passage of the African and Caribbean bill, including some members of the Congressional Black Caucus.
"It certainly does provide momentum, and it's an encouraging development for trade votes in general," Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, told reporters in a conference call.
But some lawmakers may use their vote in favor of today's bill to give them political cover to vote against the China measure.
In Congress today, foes and supporters of the China measure held dueling news conferences. Proponents announced the names of 10 new supporters -- 6 Democrats and 4 Republicans -- but acknowledged that they did not change the mathematics of the coming vote because they had already included the lawmakers in their head counts.
Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the measure's chief Democrat opponent, announced a new web site for the opposition (http:// No2PermanentMFN.house.gov). A wavering Democrat, David Phelps of Illinois, said he was now leaning against the measure.
The African and Caribbean measure's bipartisan support -- unusual for trade bills these days -- saw 126 Democrats joining 183 Republicans in favor. Voting against were 78 Democrats, including Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader; 30 Republicans, and 2 independents.
"By promoting expanded trade, the United States will be minimizing the need for foreign aid and disaster relief," Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said.
Supporters helped grease the vote by tucking in several provisions with little or no relation to Africa or the Caribbean. For instance, the measure offers breaks for Israeli nylon woven into Caribbean-made garments and men's suits made with Canadian wool.
Another provision directs the trade representative to change the method of punishing countries whose trade practices are deemed unfair to the United States. The office would be told to rotate its punishments among different product groups, to spread the pain and to make the retaliation less predictable. This was, in part, a favor to Carl H. Lindner, an Ohio executive and political fund-raiser, whose Chiquita Brands International is in a trade war with Europe over bananas.
Last year, the House and Senate approved different versions of the measure. Since then, negotiators sought a compromise. But it took the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and Mr. Hastert of the House to break the logjam three weeks ago.
Under the compromise, the House agreed to grant many of the same duty-free benefits to 24 Caribbean and Central American countries that 48 African nations will get.
The House had not included the Caribbean in its legislation because of objections from lawmakers in textile states who fear that a flood of imports from the region could imperil American jobs.
The Senate dropped its insistence that duty-free imports from Africa be made with fabric, yarn or thread from the United States.
In a concession to textile-makers, the agreement initially caps the volume of duty-free goods at 1.5 percent of all textile imports. That cap grows to 3.5 percent over eight years.
As a result, the value of textile imports from Africa is expected to rise to $4.2 billion in 2008 from $250 million last year.
The poorest African countries -- all but six of sub-Saharan nations -- would be eligible for duty-free status with no restrictions for four years.
"This means investment and investment means capital, which will enable these countries to clear the land, build the factories, train the workers, produce something, and know there's a market for it," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York.
The compromise includes tougher provisions against Asian imports that are passed off as African-made apparel. But lawmakers from textile-producing states predicted disaster.
"This bill would imperil the livelihood of thousands of textile workers," said Representative Robin Hayes, a North Carolina Republican. But the Textile Manufacturers Institute, a trade group, said it would not oppose the measure.
The compromise dropped a provision in the Senate bill aimed at helping make AIDS drugs more affordable in Africa. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, urged the White House to carry out the provision by executive order.

HEADLINE: Berry Pickers Choose Union and Its Rival

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WATSONVILLE, Calif., May 4

 BODY:
The United Farm Workers gained its first major stake in California's strawberry industry today in a tradeoff that left the union and a rival sharing representation of pickers at the nation's largest strawberry grower.
Both the United Farm Workers and the Coastal Berry of California Farm Workers Committee claimed victory as each was certified by the state labor board today to bargain on behalf of workers at the grower, the Coastal Berry Company. 
 The U.F.W. won the right to bargain on behalf of 700 Coastal Berry pickers in Ventura County, and the Coastal Berry of California Farm Workers Committee more than 800 pickers in Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties. The U.F.W. began trying to organize pickers of the state's $600 million strawberry industry in 1995.

O'CONNOR, JOHN CARDINAL

 BODY:
O'CONNOR-John Cardinal, His Eminence. The Board of Trustees and members institutions of the Catholic Health Care system of the Archdiocese of New York mourn the loss of the beloved Shepherd of the Archdiocese who has gone to his eternal rest to be with Our Lord. A defender and champion of the poor, the sick, vulnerable and all those who are marginalized. His Eminence brought Christ's healing presence to those most in need. In the way he lived his life and the grace with which he faced his death, His Eminence was an inspiration to all of those dedicated to fulfilling the Church's healing ministry through the hospitals and nursing homes of the Archdiocese's Catholic Health Care System. His commitment to life-from his staunch advocacy for the unborn to his support of the tiniest of infants who began life at Our Lady of Mercy's neonatal unit; from the AIDS patients, whom he visited in nightly unannounced visits at St. Clare's Hospital to those who suffered with Huntington's Disease and were cared for at Terence Cooke Health Care Center; from those who were ravaged with the end stages of cancer and found compassion at Calvary Hospital and the sick who were treated at St. Agnes Hospital to the elderly cared for at Carmel Richmond, Ferncliff, Kateri, Mary Manning Walsh, St. Vincent dePaul, Terence Cardinal Cooke and St. Teresa's nursing homes, -whether through his actions or his prayers, touched us all. His faith in Our Lord was unwavering. His will to serve was inspiring. As Archbishop, his reach extended beyond Archdiocesean borders. Though truly a world leader, His Eminence was first and foremost a priest who followed his calling. As concerned with those who did not have adequate health care in Africa, the Caribbean, Central and South America and around the world as he was with those in New York, his legacy will perhaps best be measured by the care received by those whom he did not know and who in turn may not have even known his name. Despite his extraordinarily demanding schedule he always had time for a quiet moment of counsel, praise and gratitude to those who so willingly served under him. It was an honor and a privilege to do so, and for that we are eternally grateful. Our prayers go out to the Cardinal's immediate family and his extended family of New York. As beloved as he was in life so too will he be missed in death. As we pray for his soul, we also pray that his light may continue to shine upon us all. May the Lord grant him eternal peace. Donations to support the Archdiocese's health care ministry may be made in the Cardinal's name to: Providence Health Services Foundation, 155 E. 56 St, 2 Floor, New York, NY 10022 Mary Healey-Sedutto, Ph.D President & CEO Edwin S. Mruk, Chairman
O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. The Board of Trustees and staff of Our Lady of Mercy Healthcare System, Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center and Saint Agnes Hospital and Children's Rehabilitation Center acknowledge with a deep sense of personal loss the passing of His Eminence, John Cardinal O'Connor. His Eminence made extraordinary personal contributions to health care and education and tireless efforts to reestablish and revitalize the essential Catholic mission, that of providing the highest quality health care for everyone. We at Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center were very honored that His Eminence allowed us to name our Medical Center Campus at East 233rd Street in the Bronx in his honor. His Eminence had a particular fondness for our program at Rosalie Hall, our 28bed residence and shelter program for single mothers. He was very grateful that our medical center had a strong interest in the elderly, as well as our fragile newborns. He always emphasized the importance of taking care of the needs of those just entereing the world and those at the end of life. The lives that he touched will never be the same. We will miss him. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family, the auxiliary bishops and the priests, religious and laity of the Archdiocese of New York. Edwin S.

O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. The Board of Trustees of the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York wishes to express profound sorrow and a deep sense of personal loss at the death of His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop of New York and President of this charitable Federation. Throughout a lifetime characterized by extraordinary accomplishments and service, Cardinal O'Connor was foremost and preeminently a dedicated priest, imbued with love of God and love for all God's people. His leadership and many initiatives on behalf of the poor and disadvantaged of the Archdiocese have been a source of untold strength to this Board and a special blessing from Almighty God. With loving concern, our Good Shepherd recognized the demands of our changing times and encouraged tirelessly the development of many new programs for the benefit of children and youth, recent immigrants and refugees, the aged, the homeless, handicapped and the sick. As the Shepherd of God's people, his concerns were universal as he devoted himself with apostolic charity and zeal to the welfare and the best interest of all, not only in New York but throughout the United States, the Americas and the Third World. We thank Almighty God for sharing with us the faith and wisdom, the strength and the talents of his devoted servant, John Cardinal O'Connor. His memory and example will remain with us as a lasting legacy and inspiration. The Board of Trustees of The Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York Most Rev. Patrick J. Sheraton Vice President Rev. Msgr. James J. Murray Secretary
O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. The American Jewish Committee deeply mourns the death of His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor, and we extend our profound sympathy to his family and the Archdiocese of New York. His remarkable leadership building human bridges of solidarity between Catholics and Jews is indelible. The Cardinal was at the forefront in the struggle to free Soviet Jews, to eradicate every vestige of antiSemitism, to commemorate the Holocaust, and to establish diplomatic relations between the Vatican and the State of Israel. In 1990 the AJC proudly presented Cardinal O'Connor with the Isaiah Interreligious Award, and during his distinguished tenure as New York's Archbishop, the Cardinal worked closely with us on a host of issues including healing the wounds of war in the Balkans and strengthening human rights throughout the world. Most of all we will always remember the Cardinal's warm smile, his exquisite sense of grace and humor, his constant wise counsel, and his esteem for Judaism and the Jewish people. We will sorely miss him. May the memory of this extraordinary man of faith forever be a blessing. Bruce M. Ramer, President Dottie Bennett, Chair Interreligious Commission David A. Harris, Exec. Director Rabbi A. James Rudin Director, Interreligious Affairs

His was a sensitive leadership that gave us the confidence and the will to persevere in our ministry on behalf of the countless in need.

O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. The leadership and staff of our 200,000 member health care workers union mourn deeply the death May 3rd. of our friend, ally and teacher, His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor. Cardinal O'Connor supported working people with every fiber of his being, earning him the title "Patron Saint of Working People" among our members. He learned respect for labor's rights from his father, a dedicated union member. The Cardinal championed workers' rights to organize, to bargain for a decent living, and to strike. He did so in deed as well as word. Cardinal O'Connor's humanitarian ideals made him a passionate advocate for those in need. He was a giant who rose above denominational differences, who spoke for the best that is in every one of us. When a group of labor leaders visited him in March, he told us, "Without the unions, working people would have nothing." He urged us to continue our efforts on behalf of working people.

O'CONNOR-John, Cardinal. The Anti-Defamation League mourns the passing of John Cardinal O'Connor, a man devoted to God and his Catholic community and to promoting harmony among the diverse religious groups of New York. A great friend of the Jewish people, Cardinal O'Connor was a stalwart supporter of the State of Israel. He denounced anti-Semitism, preached about the horrors of the Holocaust and in this Jubilee year called for repentence for "the pain inflicted on the Jewish people by many of our members over the last millennium." For his moral, spiritual and practical leadership in promoting intergroup relations, Cardinal O'Connor received ADL's America's Democratic Legacy Award. We will miss his wisdom, compassion and wonderful sense of humor. We take comfort in his legacy. We express our deepest condolences to his family, the Archdiocese and Catholics everywhere. Howard P.

O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. New York Labor mourns the passing of this man of hope, compassion and love-a man of deep faith and conviction.

He has a history of defending workers' rights in the struggles of hospital workers, restaurant workers, newspaper workers, education and where ever disputes arose. It was through his joint efforts that our Council's Commission on the Dignity of Immigrants was developed. His was one of the first voices to be heard in support of the Haitian boat people seeking asylum and the American dream. His personal compassion and care for victims of Aids is renowned. All New Yorkers, regardless of their faith, will miss his warm smile, good humor, compassionate wisdom and temperate leadership. NYC Central Labor Council Brian M. McLaughlin, President Ted H. Jacobsen, Secretary Ida Ines Torres, Treasurer

HEADLINE: Lonely Bowlers, Unite: Mend the Social Fabric;
A Political Scientist Renews His Alarm At the Erosion of Community Ties

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Robert D. Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard University, is a big, red-faced, enthusiastic man with the Amish whiskers and explosive gestures of a 19th-century fundamentalist preacher -- useful characteristics for the "hell will get us if we don't mend our ways" thesis that has taken over his life in the last five years.
His message, familiar to millions of Americans, is that the civic engagement -- the neighborhood friendships, the dinner parties, the group discussions, the club memberships, the church committees, the political participation; all the involvements, even the street protests, that make a democracy work -- has declined over the last 30 years. Trust and reciprocity, which Mr. Putnam calls social capital, have been damaged, he says, and the nation has grown cantankerous and less efficient. 
 Being a spiritual man, deeply committed to his own findings, he proselytizes. Tapping foundations for funds, Mr. Putnam organizes seminars, surveys "social connectedness" in numerous cities (the hope being that local groups will then fix the shortcomings), speaks tirelessly, and generally tries to recreate a modern version of the community bonds that flourished at the turn of the 20th century and again after World War II.
"I don't want to say that I am a Jane Addams or a John Dewey, but I aspire to that role," Mr. Putnam said, naming two turn-of-the-century social reformers who were both scholars and doers. "In academia now it has become a less prestigious activity to be concerned about social reforms."
The first time Mr. Putnam put forth his message, in an academic article published five years ago, he caught lots of attention, as much for the title, "Bowling Alone," as for the findings. People bowled more frequently than before, he had learned, but they bowled with their children or with a few friends: basically alone. What had declined were the organized leagues and the lively conversations and social interaction over beer and pizza that the leagues had fostered.
"Bowling Alone" touched a public nerve and became a metaphor for a much larger national malaise. Mr. Putnam suddenly found himself profiled in People magazine. He appeared on talk shows, and President Clinton invited him to Camp David. Most recently both Al Gore and George W. Bush have tapped him for advice, or their aides have.
"They know perfectly well, these politicians, that Americans are worried about their communities," Mr. Putnam said over lunch recently, putting down his fork to emphasize his point forcefully with both hands. "They know that if they could come up with some coherent response, there is a market for that politically."
Despite the political appeal, that first paper drew plenty of criticism. His evidence was faulty and too sparse, some said. He failed to appreciate the new forms of civic participation that had emerged in the late 20th century, others argued. There was concern that the decline in church activity, for example, once a big source of civic engagement, might only mean that organized religion no longer spoke to people's needs as did, say, self-help groups like Gamblers Anonymous or Weight Watchers. (These have proliferated.)
But now Mr. Putnam, after five more years of research, has reaffirmed his original conclusions and supported them with greatly expanded data, all presented in a new book, "Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community" (Simon & Schuster), sent to stores this week. The criticism has not gone away, but critics of Mr. Putnam's concepts who have read galley proofs of the book said that it would almost certainly become the framework for a revived debate about civic engagement.
"He is definitely right that a lot of our connections with one another are more tenuous than they used to be, and he is right, in his final chapter, to call us to task," said Robert Wuthnow, a Princeton University sociologist. "But he has a single-minded thesis that fails to paint the complex picture that actually exists."
He ignores, for example, the proliferation of nonprofit groups, "from soup kitchens to private schools to foundations to think tanks to social welfare organizations," Mr. Wuthnow said. "These are mostly small, and they function like the civic groups that Putnam says are declining."
Some nonprofits do function that way, but others are created in wills to avoid estate taxes, Mr. Putnam replies. At 59, he has sampled the post-World War II stages of civic engagement, from its heyday in the late 1940's and 50's, when he was growing up in Port Clinton, Ohio, a rural town on Lake Erie, to its decline, which he has experienced mostly as a resident of Lexington, Mass., a Boston suburb. As a teenager he bowled on Saturdays in a league. A photo of his five-member team, recently found among his mother's belongings, decorates the jacket of his new book. Two of the boys are black. (Mr. Putnam is white.)
"The fact of the matter is that bowling leagues, even in the 1950's, did bring people together, across class lines; it is the least class-specific sport in America," he said. "You need this sort of bridging social capital for civic engagement to really work."
Whatever the virtues of bowling, Mr. Putnam was not particularly good at it, with scores averaging less than 150 a game. As an adult he has rarely bowled, apart from occasional outings when his two children, now married, were still young: family bowling, not league bowling. Lately, however, in recognition of the publicity his research has brought to the sport, his students celebrate the end of a semester with a bowling party or by giving him bowling knickknacks.
Others have given him knickknacks, too. He ticks them off: bowling salt and pepper shakers, bowling towels and shoes, books about bowling, jokes about bowling, a tie decorated with a bowling lane. Tchotchkes, he calls them, invoking a Yiddish word, and a reminder that religion has played a big role in civic engagement and his life. Raised a Methodist, he converted to Judaism, his wife's religion, when they married 37 years ago. "We agreed it was important that we have one religion," Rosemary Putnam said.
Now Mrs. Putnam, 59, a public school special-education teacher, is the one who is civically engaged: playing French horn in the Lexington band, active in her temple's sisterhood, member of a book group, volunteer tutor of immigrants in English, active in a teachers association. Her husband sang in the town chorus for a year or two; but absorbed in his teaching, research and writing, he withdrew, becoming an example of the disengagement he now chronicles.
The Putnam thesis dwells on the precipitous decline since 1970 of community groups: the Elks, the Rotary, the Masons, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, the American Legion, parent-teacher associations, local chapters of political parties, religious institutions, softball teams, art groups, union locals, town bands and scores of others. Apart from not joining, people vote less, give fewer dinner parties, and are more likely to have unlisted phone numbers, to sue and to rely on security guards. Trust has in effect declined, and trust is a big element of social capital fostered by civic connectedness, Mr. Putnam argues.
"Connectedness really matters," he said at a White House conference last month. "Wonderful studies, controlling for your blood chemistry and how old you are and your gender and whether you jog and whether you smoke and so on, show that your chances of dying over the next year are cut in half by joining one group. Cut in a quarter by joining two groups."
Much of Mr. Putnam's evidence for the decline in civic engagement came from a huge mass of previously untapped lifestyle surveys compiled over the years by Roper and DDB Needham. Polls designed for marketing and then stored away became in Mr. Putnam's hands historical data on civic engagement. "If the client was Hallmark, it wanted to know about churchgoing, and food companies wanted to know about family dinner trends," Mr. Putnam said.
Other community activities have grown, of course. Volunteering is one. And children play soccer more than ever, on teams organized by parents, although Mr. Putnam found that "if every single soccer mom and dad in America went to every single soccer game, that would not be as large a number as the number of people who stopped bowling in leagues."
Theda Skocpol, a Harvard sociologist, says that beyond the community, advocacy groups -- organizations like the Sierra Club, the Children's Defense Fund, the American Association of Retired Persons -- have become a new form of social connectedness. They are an outgrowth of the civil rights movement, the anti-Vietnam War protests, women's liberation: issues that the old civic engagement failed to address.
But she adds that rather than fostering give-and-take conversation, the advocacy groups are run by "elite people more than ever," while the millions of members mail in their dues and contributions. It is a system that "contributes to the sense of most Americans that everything is going on above their heads," Ms. Skocpol said, causing them to pull back from public life.
Whether Internet communication can reverse this trend, recreating the old conversation in a new format, Mr. Putnam says he does not know. He guesses that the Internet will complement rather than replace face-to-face communications. But he is not sure. "I am worried," he said, "that I will end up in the long sweep of history having written a book about disconnection at the very moment that technology was changing the equation."
Although Mr. Putnam acknowledges that the rise of the two-earner family cuts into time available for civic engagement, economics plays a relatively small role in his scheme. Electronic entertainment, mostly television, gets 25 percent of the blame.
Just as they bowl alone, people increasingly watch television alone. It isolates. So does suburban sprawl and the additional commuting time, alone in a car, that sprawl requires. People increasingly live in one suburb, work in another and shop at malls in a third location, Mr. Putnam finds.
The biggest culprit, however, is generational change, he concluded. The Depression and World War II produced a generation of civic-minded Americans. As that generation has aged, giving way to less trustful more isolated Americans, civic engagement and social capital have declined. Still, Mr. Putnam is optimistic. Just as the mass immigration in the late 19th century and the shift from farms to cities resulted in the creation of the community groups and ties now in decline, the new circumstances should create new institutions.
That leap of faith is greeted with skepticism by Ms. Skocpol and other social scientists. But Mr. Putnam, in his enthusiasm, sees his own efforts and those of a few others engaged in community organization as the beginning of a revival of the old connectedness in new ways not yet evident. Or as he puts it in the last sentences of his book: "Henry Ward Beecher's advice a century ago to 'multiply picnics' is not entirely ridiculous today. We should do this, ironically, not because it will be good for America -- though it will be -- but because it will be good for us."

How Fleeting Is Infamy

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
There haven't been raves like this since "Saving Private Ryan."
"One of the best events that I've ever seen!" -- Regis Philbin 
 "It doesn't get any better!" -- Sam Donaldson
"Give that guy another term!" -- Entertainment Weekly
The show that earned these cheers was Bill Clinton's stand-up comedy routine at the White House correspondents' dinner last Saturday. If it had been rerun any more often, it might have turned C-Span into E! The president easily bested Jay Leno, the other act on the bill.
As if to ratify Mr. Clinton's triumph, The Washington Post ran a front-page headline on Monday: " 'Clinton Fatigue' Yields to Nostalgia." The Post cited polls showing that not only would Democrats vastly prefer Mr. Clinton to Al Gore as a candidate this year but that in a recent match-up the president pulled even with George W. Bush nationwide. Granted, this country has a short memory, but isn't Bill Clinton the same guy who was impeached and tried only 15 months ago? It's almost an insult to call him the comeback kid. He's had more comebacks than Elizabeth Taylor, Liza Minnelli and Richard Nixon combined.
Or were they really comebacks? Writing in The New Republic two months ago, Sean Wilentz declared "Clinton fatigue" to be "an utter hoax" and "the latest sign of the growing gap between what the public actually thinks and what the pundits claim the public thinks." He pointed out that the president's job-approval ratings -- the numbers most predictive of election results -- have been higher than those at equivalent dates in Ronald Reagan's lame-duck term, even during (or especially during) impeachment. The American historian Alan Brinkley notes that "if you take away the first two years" of the first Clinton term, "he'd have the highest ratings in the postwar era" of any president. "It really is remarkable," Mr. Brinkley adds. "For someone who has a hostile Republican Congress to deal with, he seems to exercise more power over Congress than most presidents have had over Congresses of their own party."
Nowhere was this more evident than in the Elian Gonzalez denouement. Immediately after Janet Reno's Miami raid, the now-familiar political arsenal of the anti-Clintonistas was rolled into place. Tom DeLay denounced federal agents as "jackbooted thugs" -- bizarrely reviving the N.R.A.'s incendiary pre-Oklahoma City rhetoric for the fifth anniversary of the bombing. The Wall Street Journal editorial page floated conspiracy theories in line with its tortuous efforts to link Mr. Clinton to drug-running at an obscure Arkansas airport; this time it speculated that the president might have been blackmailed by Fidel Castro and that Elian might have been drugged "while in U.S. government custody." Enter the auxiliary troops, Matt Drudge and Lucianne Goldberg, whose Web sites offered painstaking exegeses of how the government doctored the photos of Elian and Dad.
"You bet there'll be Congressional hearings," stormed Mr. DeLay on "Meet the Press," echoing cries by Trent Lott and Orrin Hatch. And they'd be run by Henry Hyde, no less! The only missing element from this picture of Clinton hatred in full cry was the corpse of Vincent Foster.
But where, pray tell, are those hearings? Apparently Clinton nostalgia trumps whatever remains of his opponents' testosterone. Reflecting the president's clout, polls showed that 60 percent approved of the raid and 68 percent didn't want any hearings -- numbers consistent with those balking at impeachment hearings and the Congressional release of the Starr report two years ago. No sooner did the Elian inquisition flame out than Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Congressman, also decided not "to pursue any more hearings" on Hillary Clinton's government-paid transportation for her Senate campaign. Such is Mr. Clinton's political potency that James Rogan, a House impeachment prosecutor now battling for re-election in California, popped up with the impeached president in a White House rally for gun control. Surely it's only days before William Bennett concedes to Larry King that, all in all, the Clintons' marriage is more credible than that of the other aspiring senatorial couple, the Giulianis, who can't even fake a truce for the sake of their kids after a cancer diagnosis.
My first sighting of conspicuous Republican nostalgia for Mr. Clinton was in March, when Ben Stein, the former Nixon speechwriter and host of TV's "Win Ben Stein's Money," praised the president in USA Today for showing "a lot of heart" by sending top administration officials to the funeral of his father, the G.O.P. economist Herbert Stein. Ben Stein dislikes Mr. Clinton, writes for the Clinton-bashing journal American Spectator and is solidly behind Mr. Bush. And yet he had this to say over the phone this week: "I will miss Clinton's humanity like I miss Nixon's humanity. You know a person is a person by his failings, and Clinton has a lot of failings. Without that human touch, you lose an important ability to connect with the body politic. Two machines are running to replace him -- the Gore machine, in which everything is calculated and calibrated, and the Bush machine, which is even more so. I don't like the idea of being governed by a machine. I like being governed by someone who has as many failings as I do."
Darrell Hammond, the Clinton impersonator on "Saturday Night Live," has a not dissimilar take on Clinton nostalgia: "I never met anyone who touches people as much as he does. . . . Here was a man caught lying on camera by an entire planet and got away with it and talked his way out of it. He's a scalawag, but darn, he does a good job! Crime's down, jobs are up, the budget's balanced. Who wouldn't miss him? When he gets that little crinkle in his voice, he's selling it to you and you're going to buy."
Mr. Hammond is ready to go with his impersonation of Al Gore -- possibly tonight -- but is mindful of the vast difference between the two men. "Clinton only shows you what he wants you to see," he says. "Gore shows you what he wants to show you and everything else. You see the puppet and the puppetmaster. You see the ventriloquist's mouth move. The poor guy is trying too hard. So much preparation, so earnest, so much fumbling and stumbling. He should go out and say I can't act, I can't dance -- or nothing -- but I really want to be president."
This shortfall makes it unlikely that Clinton nostalgia will automatically benefit Mr. Gore come fall. If anything, the closest heir to Mr. Clinton so far is Mr. Bush. The president indicated as much in his stand-up routine, when he joked that the Texas governor had hijacked his old Dick Morris campaign strategy of "moving toward the political center, distancing himself from his own party and stealing ideas from the other party." The parallels don't end there, or with the unsubstantiated drug rumors that have stalked both men without ever denting their political fortunes.
In the '92 campaign, Mr. Clinton said that "the most important thing" he had accomplished as governor of Arkansas was improving education -- a claim no more borne out by Arkansas's dismal rankings in students' test scores than are Mr. Bush's hyperbolic claims for Texas. Mr. Bush's "compassionate conservatism" -- in which the federal government plays bite-sized roles in helping to feel and soothe Americans' pain -- lifts specific ideas from Mr. Clinton's New Democrat policies. Both men also have in common the repellent trait of advertising their toughness on crime by savage brandishing of the death penalty as governors: Mr. Clinton refused clemency to the brain-damaged Rickey Ray Rector; Mr. Bush denied clemency to Karla Faye Tucker and then mocked her in a Talk magazine interview with Tucker Carlson.
This isn't to say that Mr. Bush is remotely in the Clinton league as entertainer in chief; no one is. Reading up for his game show on presidents who "were grossly overweight, got drunk and went to all-night parties," Ben Stein ruefully observed, "Clinton will be the last of the rollicking over-the-top characters for the foreseeable future."
If we hadn't gotten off the phone soon after, I fear we both would have been in tears.

HEADLINE: Mississippi Forms Commission To Design a New State Flag

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 5

 BODY:
A day after Mississippi learned that its bitterly contested state flag had not been an official symbol for 94 years, Gov. Ronnie Musgrove today formed an advisory commission to design a new flag, guaranteeing a year of debate about whether the flag should bear a Confederate symbol.
On Thursday, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that because of a legal technicality, the state had not had an official flag since 1906, when the Legislature forgot to include the flag in a codification of state laws. 
 The Confederate cross in the flag's left corner has been the object of criticism from many black residents over the years, but the court said the flag had no legal status unless the government chose to make it or another design the official symbol.
At a news conference in Jackson, Mr. Musgrove, a Democrat, said he wanted the commission to "take positive action," but he voiced no opinion on whether the new flag should carry a Confederate symbol.
"Symbols mean a lot," he said, standing in front of a pole bearing the current flag. "They mean a lot to all of us. We want a good, open, honest discussion."
He promised that the 17-member commission would be a diverse group, containing members of both parties and black and white residents. The commission will include 3 members of the State Senate, 3 members of the House and 11 members appointed by the governor from a variety of fields.
The commission is to recommend a design by May 4 of next year, according to the governor's executive order, which also mandates that the current flag be kept in use until the Legislature acts. The Legislature, however, is not required to approve the panel's recommendation.
Several white members of the Legislature have already made it clear that they want the current flag to be made official and are not interested in a new design. But many black legislators, who had already vowed to make the flag a major issue in the coming year, have welcomed the opportunity for a new design.
Opposition to the official use of Confederate symbols has been growing in the South this year, spurred by the movement to lower the Confederate battle flag from atop the South Carolina Capitol.
That issue may be settled next week when the South Carolina House votes on a plan to remove the flag and place a smaller version in front of the Capitol, but five other states, most notably Georgia and Mississippi, incorporate Confederate designs into their state flags.
Several Georgia legislators have promised to begin a movement to change the state's flag later this year, and civil rights groups have threatened an economic boycott of the state if it is not changed.
Up to now, opponents to the flag in Mississippi faced an uphill battle in getting it changed, but the court's ruling has created a much easier opportunity to secure a new flag.

HEADLINE: Law Barring Insurers' Tips On Car Shops Is Tossed Out

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
In a decision that could affect all drivers in New York State, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled this week that state regulators could not prevent two insurance companies from recommending specific auto repair shops to their policyholders.
The ruling, filed yesterday in United States District Court, involves a state law prohibiting insurance companies from providing lists of repair shops unless customers specifically ask for a recommendation. In his decision, issued Thursday, Judge Richard C. Casey found that the law violated the companies' constitutional right to free speech. 
 Although Judge Casey's decision was written to apply to the two companies that had sued the state, Allstate and Geico, an industry trade group said the decision would probably apply to all insurers that write policies in New York State.
"The decision should be interpreted broadly, not just for Allstate and Geico," said Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, the industry group.
Mr. Hartwig said insurers' repair policies were basically the same. He said the companies wanted to be able to recommend repair shops that provided cheap and reliable service to minimize their costs.
The lawyer who represented the State Insurance Department in the case said he had not had time to review the judge's ruling and could not say whether the state would appeal, or whether the ruling would affect other insurance companies.
The law prohibiting referrals, enacted in 1974, was intended to protect consumers' ability to choose their own repair shop. It was amended in 1983 to allow insurance companies to recommend auto glass repair shops, although the change was not extended to general repairs. The judge said the Insurance Department approved the 1983 amendment in expectation that it would result in lower claim costs and premiums.
The state law also prohibits insurance companies from requiring policyholders to use certain shops. Geico and Allstate did not challenge that part of the law.
Allstate writes the most auto insurance policies in New York State, insuring 1.6 million cars, or 20 percent of the market, according to the Insurance Department. Geico insures about 7 percent of the market, or 560,000 cars.
The conflict began in 1992, after state regulators threatened to fine Allstate for posting a sign at offices informing customers: "If you have no shop preference, your adjuster is prepared to recommend several conveniently located repair shops."
Regulators said the sign, erected as part of a company program to evaluate approved repair shops, violated the prohibition on recommending shops to policyholders.
But Judge Casey found that policyholders were not denied the ability to select their own repair shops. He also said the state law deprived customers of important information by barring insurance companies from telling their customers which shops had a proven track record.
"Although the state does have a legitimate interest in protecting consumers," he wrote, "the court does not accept the notion that consumers' lack of intelligence requires the state to deprive them of options or limit their choices to those which the state thinks are acceptable. The court finds that the programs offered to Allstate's and Geico's insureds afford them additional opportunities, protection and truthful information. The speech at issue is not deceptive, misleading or illegal."
Bruce E. Clark, a lawyer for Allstate, said the company was "gratified" by the decision, but he declined to comment further until he had reviewed the ruling.

U.S. Unemployment Rate Declines to a 30-Year Low
The Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate fell below 4 percent in April for the first time in 30 years, as employers hired tens of thousands of census takers, restaurant employees and temporary workers and the robust economy showed no signs of letting up.
There was little evidence in the numbers -- a total of 340,000 new jobs last month and a 3.9 percent unemployment rate -- that the record nine-year-old expansion might be weakening in response to the Federal Reserve's attempt to slow the economy by raising interest rates five times since last June. Page A1. 

Stock Gauges Rise in Light Trading
Stocks rose on the lowest trading volumes of the year as investors seemed to ignore the decline in the nation's unemployment rate. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 165.37 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,577.86. The Nasdaq composite index finished up 96.58 points, or 2.6 percent, to 3,816.82, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.06 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,432.63. C3.
 
Concerns Guilty in Price-Fixing Case
Four drug companies agreed to plead guilty and pay $33 million in fines for taking part in an international conspiracy to fix vitamin prices. The companies -- two American and two German -- are the latest to plead guilty in the Justice Department's investigation of the vitamin industry. C2.
 
BMW Raises Doubts in Rover Deal
BMW of Germany raised new doubts about the likelihood of a deal with the Phoenix Consortium of Britain, which is supported by labor unions and the British government, to rescue BMW's ailing Rover Cars operations at one of the biggest auto plants in Britain. C2.
 
Phone Companies End Merger Talks
Talks about a merger between two leading European telecommunication companies -- Royal KPN of the Netherlands and Telefonica of Spain -- broke down. The companies said that a majority of the Telefonica board backed the deal but that opposition "by an important minority group within the board" undermined KPN's confidence in the chance for success of the new company. C2.
 
Cisco In Stock Deal for ArrowPoint
Cisco Systems agreed to buy ArrowPoint Communications in a stock swap valued at $5.7 billion. The deal will give Cisco, the maker of network equipment, the technology it needs to compete in the fast-growing market for devices that can distribute Internet content intelligently. C2.
 
Oil Is Found in a Big Caspian Field
A consortium of nine foreign energy companies has found oil in a huge Caspian Sea field and has resumed drilling to determine just how much exists. It will be at least another month before the drilling establishes if Kashagan has commercial volumes of oil. C2.
 
ADC to Buy Fiber Optic Makers
ADC Telecommunications, a provider of technology that speeds the transmission of voice, data and video signals, said it would buy two European fiber optic component makers. ADC, based in Minnetonka, Minn., will pay $872 million in stock for the Swedish laser maker Altitun and will pay roughly $80 million in cash for Ibsen Micro Structures of Denmark. C3.

HEADLINE: Board Bars Member's Bid for Chancellor

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
Irving S. Hamer Jr., the Manhattan member of the Board of Education, was barred yesterday by his colleagues on the board from his last-minute pursuit of the chancellorship of the New York City schools.
But in response, Dr. Hamer told associates that he would continue to withhold his support from the current front-runner, Harold O. Levy, the interim chancellor, effectively paralyzing Mr. Levy's candidacy. 
 The day of fast moving and often shifting events began as William C. Thompson Jr., the board president, told Dr. Hamer that he would not be allowed to join a list of six candidates selected by the board on Wednesday morning, because he had missed the deadline. Mr. Thompson said the board decided not to rethink its deadline because there was no consensus around Dr. Hamer's candidacy.
Mr. Thompson turned down Dr. Hamer's bid after consulting with board members and finding that they were split, 3 to 3, on whether to reopen the nominating process, short of the 4 votes needed for an affirmative decision. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's two appointees and the delegate from Staten Island favored allowing Dr. Hamer to be nominated, while Mr. Thompson and the delegates from Queens and the Bronx did not.
"It wasn't me making a decision on my own," Mr. Thompson said yesterday. "I was one of the other board members who expressed an opinion."
The chain of events put Mr. Thompson in the uncomfortable position of blocking the ambitions of a colleague he had worked harmoniously with for the last two years, while Mr. Giuliani's appointees -- who are philosophically opposed to Mr. Hamer on many issues -- were advocating his candidacy.
But in a sign that the behind-the-scenes politicking was more byzantine than it might appear, Mr. Giuliani jumped into the fray for the first time yesterday, hinting that while he had had some differences with Mr. Levy, he did not rule out supporting him as permanent chancellor.
The mayor said he had been disappointed by Mr. Levy's reluctance to push for individual merit pay for teachers, but suggested that now that the permanent job was no longer his for the asking, Mr. Levy might be more open to compromise.
"I have an open mind," Mr. Giuliani said of Mr. Levy's candidacy. "I haven't closed, closed my mind at all to Harold. And I don't know enough about Irving Hamer."
Asked if he would consider any other candidate for chancellor, Mr. Giuliani indicated that he would rather not. "I can just focus on the two of them," the mayor said. "I have an open mind with regard to the two of them."
The possibility that Mr. Levy might be open to compromise on merit pay clearly discomfited Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, who aggressively pushed his selection as interim chancellor, over the opposition of Mr. Giuliani.
"He is independent from the mayor, he's independent from us, he's a very independent man," Ms. Weingarten said. "He's not going to go and take their position."
Meanwhile, the mystery of why Dr. Hamer asked to be added to the list of candidates at the 11th hour, after headhunters had spent weeks compiling resumes, deepened yesterday. Confidants said Dr. Hamer, who had provided one of the four votes for Mr. Levy's selection as interim chancellor, was now dissatisfied with Mr. Levy's leadership, but they could not explain why. And for the second day in a row, Dr. Hamer avoided the media -- refusing to return telephone calls from reporters and turning down an invitation from the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, to appear with her at a news conference on the latest developments in the chancellor search.
Allies of Mr. Levy said he had agreed to seek the permanent chancellorship in mid-April only after four members of the board -- including Dr. Hamer -- assured him that he could count on their votes.
But at her news conference yesterday, Ms. Fields said that the board president had been warned two or three weeks ago that Dr. Hamer's support for Mr. Levy was not a sure thing. She said she had spoken to Dr. Hamer yesterday, and he was still "not prepared to vote for Harold Levy."
Asked if Dr. Hamer was maneuvering to become the next president of the board of education, Ms. Fields did not answer yes or no, saying, "You can't believe all the things that have come up in the last 48 hours."
Mr. Levy's allies at the board were dismayed at the confusion Dr. Hamer's would-be candidacy had caused. "The mayor is happy as hell," one board official said.
Indeed, Mr. Giuliani seemed both baffled and tickled by the turn of events. "I think it's good that there's a debate," Mr. Giuliani said, referring to Dr. Hamer's bid. "I don't know where I come out on it."
One possible outcome, education officials said, is that Mr. Levy could remain indefinitely as interim chancellor. Another is that Dr. Hamer will capitulate, throwing his vote behind Mr. Levy. "In the end, there's no place else for him to go," one education official said.
Meanwhile, the board released its list of six candidates for chancellor. Apart from Mr. Levy, all of them are notable mainly for their obscurity, and for the fact that they all come from outside New York City.
The others are: Jerome Clark, chief of staff and vice president for institutional advancement at Bowie State University in Bowie, Md.; James P. Gallagher, president of Philadelphia University in Philadelphia, Pa.; Joan P. Kowal, former superintendent of schools for Palm Beach County, Fla.; Richard T. LaPointe, president and publisher of Laubach Literacy and New Readers Press in Syracuse, N.Y.; and Anthony J. Trujillo, director of district and school services and head of the America's Choice Program at the National Center on Education and the Economy.

HEADLINE: THE JOBLESS RATE DECLINES TO 3.9%; LOWEST SINCE 1970

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate fell below 4 percent in April for the first time in 30 years, the Labor Department announced yesterday, as employers hired, among others, tens of thousands of census takers, restaurant employees and temporary workers in a boom that showed no signs of letting up.
Indeed, there was little evidence in the employment numbers -- a total of 340,000 new jobs last month and a jobless rate of 3.9 percent -- that the nine-year-old expansion, the longest period of uninterrupted growth in America's history, might be weakening in response to the Federal Reserve's attempt to slow the economy by raising interest rates. 
 "Everywhere you look, you see the supply of people available for work continuing to shrink pretty rapidly," said John Youngdahl, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. "Although there is not much pressure yet on companies to raise prices, the inflation rate has begun to creep up and the Fed must think about where we will be a year from now."
The economy may be in its best shape since the 1960's, but the Fed's great fear, often expressed by its chairman, Alan Greenspan, is that job shortages will eventually give workers enough bargaining power to push up labor costs ahead of productivity gains. While wage gains remained relatively modest and many of the latest jobs -- including those created by the Census Bureau -- are temporary, employers may still respond to the tight labor market by raising prices to cover the higher costs -- or simply because the strong economy allows them to.
Wall Street reacted as if the Fed would be successful in containing any inflationary threat, even if that meant it would have to be more aggressive in raising interest rates. Stock prices shot up, instead of plunging, as they often do in reaction to a strong employment report. The Dow Jones industrial average gained more than 165 points to close at 10,577.86, the Nasdaq rose 2.6 percent and bond yields edged up modestly. Page C3.
Just a week ago, the consensus among analysts and brokers was that the Fed's policy makers would probably raise the short-term interest rates they control by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 6.25, at their May 16 meeting. That would be the sixth such increase since last June. The new consensus apparent in polls taken after yesterday's job numbers were released is for an increase of half a percentage point in rates this month. Wall Street's exuberance seemed to reflect a view that half a percentage point in midmonth should be sufficient to make a dent in the robust economy.
"God only knows why the markets are doing what they are doing," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's DRI. "All I can figure is that they figure the Fed is going to do a half-point, and that will be it. Get the tightening over, and they can go back to business as usual."
Still, Mr. Wyss and other economists noted that a booming stock market complicates the Fed's task by encouraging the all-out consumer spending that has kept the economy booming. "The stock market certainly did not help the Fed out," Mr. Youngdahl said.
April's employment report was striking for the evidence it offered that the pool of people still available for hire is shrinking. That pool fell by 426,000 men and women, falling below 9.9 million last month, the lowest level since the Labor Department began to track it in 1994. Mr. Greenspan pays particular attention to this statistic because with fewer people available, existing workers, in theory at least, are in a better position to demand and receive strong wage increases.
With the unemployment rate falling from 4.1 percent to 3.9 percent -- the lowest since January 1970 -- the pool now consists of 5.5 million people labeled as officially unemployed because they are actively looking for jobs, and 4.4 million others who tell Labor Department surveyors that they want to work, but are not currently looking.
"There is clearly some evidence of accelerating wages and prices," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute, noting that labor costs, by several measures, are growing at an annual rate of at least 3.6 percent, and inflation is rising at a similar pace.
But he wondered whether wages were pushing prices, or the other way around. "If you track this month to month," he said, "it looks more like tight labor markets are allowing workers to press for wage gains to keep up with prices that reflect the rising cost of oil."
Whatever the cause and effect, the average hourly wage of production workers rose 6 cents last month, to $13.64, up 3.6 percent over the last 12 months. That is roughly in line with the gains recorded month after month for more than a year. But broader measures, covering benefits as well as wages, show a recent jump in company payments for health insurance.
Reflecting the administration's concern that an overly aggressive Fed could damage the economy in an election year, Alexis M. Herman, the secretary of labor, argued that labor productivity was rising quickly enough to offset rising wages. "In the midst of this debate over interest rates," she said, "we must keep the focus on the nation's strong productivity to absorb any pressure on wages."
President Clinton, pointing to the social benefits of a strong economy, called attention to "the lowest unemployment rate for blacks and Hispanics ever recorded." For Hispanics, unemployment dropped to 5.4 percent from 6.3 percent in March, and for blacks the rate edged down to 7.2 percent from 7.3 percent.
While spread broadly across business and government, job creation was particularly strong at the Census Bureau, which added 73,000 part-time census takers last month on top of the 115,000 added in March. But that hiring should taper off quickly. To count the population, the bureau has hired 500,000 workers this year, and now is up to full strength, a spokesman for the bureau said.
Over all, the employment gains of 340,000, while strong, were down from an even stronger 458,000 advance in March. But job creation in the private sector remains robust, averaging 222,000 a month since January, up from 198,000 a month last year. Total employment rose to 131.1 million in April.
Restaurants made the biggest contribution, adding 80,000 jobs, while temporary-help agencies added 46,000 jobs. "Companies cannot find people, so they turn to the temp agencies, which are luring the elderly back into the work force, kids into part-time work and housewives into work," Mr. Wyss said.
The percentage of the population now holding jobs edged up last month to a record 64.9 percent, from 64.7 percent in March. Only one major industry lost ground: construction jobs fell by 55,000 after having risen by 90,000 the month before.
Manufacturers also increased their rolls, but by only 11,000 jobs, although the workweek in manufacturing rose by nearly half an hour, and overtime pay also increased.

HEADLINE: U.S. Giving a Lift to Salmon, But Future of Aid Is in Doubt

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: LOWER GRANITE DAM, Wash.

 BODY:
For roughly half of the millions of salmon born on the Snake River that set out each spring for the Pacific Ocean, the journey past four federal dams is an arduous and often lethal one. They can be whacked to death by giant blades of the dam turbines, knocked out from collisions with concrete spillways, or succumb to a fatal condition not unlike the bends.
The other half of the salmon have a much simpler trip: They get to take the boat. 
 But this annual free ride, by which the United States Army Corps of Engineers loads the young fish on barges and totes them around the dams, is coming under scrutiny like never before. And for scientists, lawmakers, farmers, fishermen, American Indians, barge shippers, environmentalists and a breathtaking array of other interested parties, the assessment is most likely the key to a momentous decision that will ultimately fall to the Congress: whether to take down the Snake River dams altogether.
The job of protecting the baby salmon, so they can mature and breed, is a remarkable feat of engineering and an expensive -- critics say outlandish -- accommodation to man's demands for electricity.
Thousands of fish a day are diverted to a channel leading to a pipe that runs into troughs downstream of this dam, the first of the four, which is near the Idaho border. Standing by the troughs, a busy assembly line of seasonal workers briefly anesthetizes the salmon and then injects a computer chip the size of a rice grain into their bellies so they can be tracked over the years. They are barged for a 36-hour, 300-mile trip, bypassing the dams on the Snake and four more on the Columbia River. More salmon are collected at two other dams on the Snake and one on the Columbia.
It is all part of the government's bid to keep both salmon and dams -- "to find a way to have our cake and eat it, too," said Jim Anderson, a fisheries professor at the University of Washington.
But with the river's coho salmon already declared extinct, and every other species of Snake River salmon and steelhead now listed under the Endangered Species Act, the once-unthinkable idea of breaching the dams has emerged in several federal studies as the action with the best chance of restoring healthy salmon runs. The Corps of Engineers is to recommend by the end of the year whether to propose such a step.
Breaching the dams is bitterly opposed by many people as an assault on the area's agricultural economy, and the proposal has already emerged as a hot-button issue in the Northwest in this year's presidential race. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas vowed in the primary campaign here never to allow the dams to be breached, while Vice President Al Gore, part of an administration that is intensely debating the issue, has taken no public position.
Breaching the dams would mean removing the earthen parts and restoring a 140-mile section of the Snake to its wild, free-flowing condition, thus making salmon barging both impossible and unnecessary. It would also mean that the 4 percent of the electricity the dams provide in the Northwest would have to be supplied by other sources.
The cost of the 20-year-old barging program for juvenile salmon, known as smolts, is just part of more than $3 billion the government has spent over that period trying to save salmon on the Snake and Columbia Rivers.
The barging program is derided by critics as a "techno-fix" that harms fish, interfering with their natural migration rhythms, causing them to die early, and perhaps interfering with their fabled and mysterious ability to find their way back home to spawn in their native river after spending years and traveling thousands of miles in the Pacific Ocean, as far north as Alaska.
Supporters of barging defend it as a kind of magic solution that could allow the salmon and the dams to coexist. And the National Marine Fisheries Service, one of several federal agencies that must weigh in on the fate of the dams, recently said that a decision on breaching could be put off for 5 to 10 years if barging was continued and other aggressive conservation measures undertaken.
So far, however, the results are hardly encouraging. While a corps brochure boasts that the barging system is "custom-made to make the trip as safe and comfortable as possible," and while 98.5 percent of smolts survive the trip, the salmon themselves remain in decline.
In most recent years, just 0.5 percent to 1 percent of all Snake River salmon have made it out to the ocean and all the way back, jumping through a ladder system that bypasses the dams, to their original spawning grounds. That is much less than the roughly 4 percent that scientists say the salmon stocks would need to recover fully.
Researchers are unsure what percentages of barged and nonbarged fish are making it back, a question that the microchips implanted in recent years are supposed to help answer. (Some fish implanted with the chips are caught years later by fishermen, and ultimately served in restaurants; corps biologist said the chips are implanted in a part of the fish that is not consumed by humans.) But for many environmentalists, the numbers suggest that the barging efforts are not enough.
"In a way, this issue about the difference in survival of transported fish versus fish that migrate through the river is a red herring," said Rob Masonis, regional director of hydropower programs for American Rivers, a conservation group. "The fundamental question is whether either of those classes of fish are making it back to the Snake River at levels that would lead to survival or recovery. And the answer is clearly no."
Still, there is no scientific consensus on how large a culprit the dams are in the salmon's decline. Other factors are cyclical ocean conditions, commercial fishing and erosion of habitat all along the rivers where the salmon spawn, which is caused by construction, run-off from farms and other factors.
At this point, the dams on the Columbia are not candidates for breaching.
And early counts indicate that the Snake River may this year see some of the highest numbers in recent years of returning adult chinook salmon, a result that would not take them off the endangered listing, but might lead supporters of barging to argue for more time to see if the program can work.
Moreover, no scientist can guarantee that taking the dams down would revive the salmon runs the explorer William Clark found in the Snake River two centuries ago, when he wrote in his diary that the river was "crouded with salmon."
At that time, biologists estimate, about two million adult salmon a year completed the epic journey back to their spawning grounds; in most recent years, that number has been measured in the thousands or only the hundreds for some types of salmon.
There is no question that, compared with those fish that have to navigate through the dams, a much higher percentage of salmon survive the barge trip, which drops them off just downstream of the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River, the last man-made impediment before the fish can reach the Pacific.
But as the tugboat Umatilla made its way down the Snake the other day, pushing a barge loaded, by the government's count, with 254,317 smolts, corps biologists said they were still gathering data on whether barging contributed to a much higher rate of what they termed "delayed mortality" among salmon transported that way.
"With one big caveat, if I were a fish, I'd rather be here than there," said Doug Arndt, chief of the regional fish management division for the corps, standing aboard the barge and pointing to the dam on the river.
"And that caveat is disease transmission," Mr. Arndt said. "Is this program enhancing disease in these fish? We just don't know enough about it."
Jim Baker, the Northwest salmon campaign coordinator for the Sierra Club, said there were many ways in which barging could be harmful to fish, despite the fact that such high percentages survive the short trip itself.
"For one thing, these barges are running on a human schedule, rather than the fishes' schedule," Mr. Baker said. "There's a great deal of evidence that these fish are released too soon below the Bonneville Dam, so that they enter a salt water estuary too early in their development."
Professor Anderson of the University of Washington says that there is not enough research to show if barged fish die in much greater numbers than others.
"There are a lot of hypotheses and no real ways to measure the mechanisms that might be producing this extramortality," Mr. Anderson said. "So people are really making arguments on things for which we don't have enough information yet."
The fish transportation program started on an experimental basis in 1968 with trucks, and has been in full operation with barges since 1981.
While the fisheries service is expected to recommend waiting for several years before a decision is made, the federal Environmental Protection Agency told the corps recently that the four dams harmed the river's water quality, endangered the salmon and might have to be breached to comply with the federal Clean Water Act. (Under the 1972 act, the E.P.A. has the power to enforce water-quality standards.)
Opinions remain impassioned on both sides. The Columbia River Alliance, representing other commercial users of the river, said the breaching proposal was "an economic dark cloud hanging over these communities that depend on dams."
But at a hearing on dam breaching in Seattle this winter, one fisherman said he did not want delays or stop-gap measures or "Army Corps of Engineers Rube Goldberg barges." The solution, he said, was to "let the Snake River flow."

HEADLINE: Paying for a Trip, Ethically

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki got a mostly favorable ruling this week from the New York State Ethics Commission on the controversial financing of his two trips to Hungary in 1995 and 1996. The commission found no violation of the state's ethics law in allowing the Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce, a nonprofit trade group largely financed by companies lobbying the governor's office, to pay for his trips, which were combined trade missions and family vacations. The panel said its "extensive inquiry" supported the governor's claim that neither he nor anyone else in his administration knew that the chamber was soliciting funds for the trips from companies with significant business pending in Albany. These included Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette maker, Pepsico and two pharmaceutical giants, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Still, the commission's finding does not exonerate the governor for his poor judgment in having his senior economic adviser, Charles Gargano, contact the Hungarian-American Chamber and request that it pay for the travel. The chamber had few resources of its own and thus had to go out and raise the money. 
 Even a five-member ethics panel with three gubernatorial appointees felt compelled to express "ethical concerns" about the indirect financing of the trips by four companies disqualified under state law from directly providing such benefits. Citing the potential for companies' gaining improper influence in such cases, the commission announced that in the future, state officials would be required to ask proposed sponsors if they would be soliciting money to pay for the trip, and if so, from whom.
That is progress, but it would be even better if state law simply barred officials from accepting free travel from any individual or group. Meanwhile the commission's verdict still leaves Mr. Pataki with some unfinished business. Now that he can no longer claim ignorance about the unsavory role of the lobbying companies in underwriting his Hungarian excursions, the only honorable course is to return the chamber's money. That portion allocable to state business can be paid by the government. The rest should be paid from his own pocket.

HEADLINE: The E-Mail Virus Is Telling Us Things

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "A Disruptive Virus Invades Computers Around the World" (front page, May 5):
The latest virus invasion, particularly through the Microsoft Outlook program, illustrates yet another aspect of the problems of monopoly. In effect, the Windows monopoly is a computer monoculture with all the same problems of other monocultures. 
 In agriculture, one of the worries of the widespread planting of monoculture crops is higher susceptibility to insects and disease, since specialized bugs can rapidly increase their numbers. We might well want to encourage diversity in our computer software not just for economic reasons but to avoid future outbreaks of disease and bug infestation.

HEADLINE: Pataki Calls Timeout on a Catskill Casino

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Pataki administration has called a timeout in the battle to build a major Indian casino in the Catskills, where the St. Regis Mohawk tribe has signed separate deals with two competing developers.
Last month the federal Interior Department approved a long-standing plan by a company, Catskill Development, to build a $500 million casino with the Mohawks at the Monticello Raceway. Supporters hope a casino will revive the depressed resort area. But since the approval was granted, the Mohawks have turned their backs on their original partners and signed a new deal with Park Place Entertainment, the largest gambling company in the world. 
 This week, the Pataki administration, whose approval is needed for any casino project, wrote to the Interior Department saying that it was "not possible to consider taking further action until this situation is clarified," given the confusion surrounding the relationships and roles of the various parties.
Gov. George E. Pataki has advocated development of Indian casinos in former resort areas like the Catskills, and he was in the midst of reviewing the raceway proposal. He was expected to give his approval to the raceway casino if the tribe settled its land claims with the state, said tribal advisers and state officials. But the emergence of a second deal with the Mohawks has muddled the situation.
"We don't think it's appropriate to move forward until we get clarification as to what's happening," said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Governor Pataki. "We've got all kinds of lawsuits, all kinds of questions being raised. The feedback from Washington is that the governor's tack is the right way to go."
A spokeswoman for the Interior Department said officials there were just as confused by the casino battle. "We still haven't heard anything from the tribe," said the spokeswoman, Stephanie Hanna. "But the governor has apparently chosen to stop the clock for now."
The sudden turnabout by the Mohawks, whose reservation is 350 miles north of the Catskills on the Canadian border, has mystified the tribe's supporters in Washington, angered elected officials in the Catskills and spawned several lawsuits, including one by dissident Mohawks who charge that their chiefs were duped by Park Place. The company, they say, intends to protect its three casinos in Atlantic City rather than help the impoverished tribe.
Because the Catskills are only 90 minutes from New York City, a casino there is expected to generate more than $1 billion a year.
The Mohawk chiefs have not returned telephone calls requesting comment. The Bureau of Indian Affairs and the National Indian Gaming Commission, which oversees management contracts between casino operators and tribes, said they had not been notified that the chiefs had abandoned their original agreement with Catskill Development at the Monticello Raceway.
But Arthur M. Goldberg, chief executive of Park Place, announced plans this week to build a gambling resort at Kutsher's Country Club, which is about five miles north of the raceway. County legislators, who had been working on the raceway project for the last four years, criticized Mr. Goldberg's newly announced project, saying it would take years to win the necessary government approvals.
Robert A. Berman, a partner in Catskill Development, said that his rival, Mr. Goldberg, had achieved his true goal: delaying, perhaps forever, construction of a gambling hall in the Catskills that might compete with its own casinos in Atlantic City.
"Right now, Atlantic City is probably having a champagne toast in celebration of their robbing New York State of this important economic development," he said. "In the final analysis, we believe that Governor Pataki will not be muscled in his own state by New Jersey interests."
Catskill Development, which owns the only site that already has federal approval for an Indian casino, recently began talking to other tribes about the possibility of a casino deal.
Mr. Goldberg responded Thursday to accusations that he was trying to block a casino in the Catskills with a promise. "We'll pay the tribe $100 million cash if we don't build as soon as we get approval," he said.
He and the six St. Regis Mohawk chiefs signed a secret agreement on April 14 granting Park Place exclusive rights to build and manage Mohawk casinos in New York and renouncing the original contract at the raceway. But Mr. Goldberg said this week that neither he nor the tribe had ruled out building a "temporary casino" at the raceway while his plan went through the licensing process. That prompted some gambling analysts to suggest that Mr. Goldberg might be trying to force Catskill Development into selling the raceway for a bargain price.
Federal officials said that Mr. Goldberg would have to file a new application to build an Indian casino at Kutsher's, a process that could take two to four years.
As for Governor Pataki's decision to stop reviewing the project until the smoke clears, a spokesman for Park Place said he was unfazed.
But Park Place may find it hard to win approvals from Monticello officials who wrote a letter this week asking the state attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, to look into the deal with the Mohawks.
In a different letter to the tribe, Rusty Pomeroy, chairman of the Sullivan County Legislature, said that the Mohawks had placed the entire project in jeopardy and that they should not assume that the county would support a new application.

HEADLINE: U.N. Reports Rebels Now Hold 300 of Its Troops in Sierra Leone

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ and CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
Rebels have taken more than 300 United Nations troops hostage in Sierra Leone, United Nations and Clinton administration officials said yesterday, and some peacekeeping units have lost contact with their command posts.
The 8,300-member United Nations force, composed mainly of African and Indian troops, was rapidly losing confidence as a result of the assault, a Western diplomat reached by telephone in Freetown said. He added that after the latest captures, on Thursday, the entire mission, meant to secure the peace after eight years of civil war, was in jeopardy. 
 He described the chances of an effective continuation of the mission, one the most ambitious peacekeeping efforts by the United Nations, as only "50-50."
Talks were under way in Freetown, the capital, between several commanders of the insurgent Revolutionary United Front and Western diplomats to try to stop the fighting, the diplomat said. But it was unclear what if any progress had been made.
Among the hostages was a contingent of about 200 Zambian soldiers who were taken hostage, a United Nations spokesman said. Their weapons were taken and they were stripped of their clothes, the spokesman, Fred Eckhart, said.
About a dozen armored vehicles belonging to the Zambians were also confiscated and were being driven by the rebels, according to reports from the field. Another contingent of more than 100 Nigerian peacekeepers was stripped of weapons and then released, Mr. Eckhart said.
Further undermining the morale of the United Nations effort, parliamentarians in Kenya yesterday called for the withdrawal of the Kenyan contingent of the peace force after reports that four of their soldiers were missing and presumed dead.
Under a peace accord signed last July, the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, whose forces have terrorized the country with a campaign of chopping off hands, feet and arms, was brought into a new national government.
At the time, some American officials questioned the wisdom of bringing under the government umbrella such a violent leader, who has become rich from plundering Sierra Leone's diamond mines. It was becoming obvious, some officials said, that Mr. Sankoh was using his new government position as a temporary breather before making more war.
The timing of the assault by the rebels, who began their operation on Tuesday, seemed very precise, several Clinton administration officials said.
Mr. Sankoh's troops -- assumed by the administration to number about 6,000, many of them unemployed teenagers -- chose a window of opportunity just after many Nigerian troops had withdrawn from Sierra Leone and before the United Nations force was up to full strength.
The rebels also took advantage of a United Nations force that appeared to be ill-trained, easily intimidated and equipped with only light infantry armor, administration officials said. Some troops were not following elementary military rules such as securing the perimeters of their bases, barracks and offices, one official said yesterday.
Reports from the field in the last few days showed that some United Nations troops were so frightened by the reputation of the rebels that they abandoned their vehicles as soon as they were stopped at a roadblock by the rebels.
As the situation in Sierra Leone continued to deteriorate, senior Clinton administration officials met at the White House to assess options.
Afterward, a senior State Department official said a team of British military experts would arrive in Sierra Leone today to review the United Nations operation from "top to bottom."
"What we are continuing to do is look very carefully at whether the forces there and the reinforcements that can be brought in can have a useful effect," the official said.
The administration has said it is considering a request from the United Nations to provide transport planes to ferry some of the 3,000 Jordanian, Bangladeshi and Indian troops still scheduled to go to Sierra Leone.
There was absolutely no consideration of sending American soldiers, officials said. In similar situations in the past, though, the use of American transport planes has required United States troops to help secure the airport to insure that the aircraft and military personnel involved do not come under attack.
On the diplomatic front, Washington was asking regional leaders, including the president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, to put pressure on Mr. Sankoh to stand by the peace agreement of last July, officials said. The State Department also asked the Rev. Jesse Jackson to ask President Charles Taylor of Liberia to call for cooperation from the rebel leader, who is a colleague.
United Nations peacekeepers were also taken hostage by the hundreds during the Bosnian war. In May 1995, Bosnian Serbs held more than 350 peacekeepers, some for several weeks, as insurance against air strikes by NATO.
At the United Nations, diplomats described how the Zambian convoy of 208 soldiers, who had arrived in Sierra Leone only two days earlier, was overwhelmed, and lost its 13 armored vehicles.
The troops were dispatched Thursday from Lungi, a port north of Freetown, to reinforce beleaguered peacekeeping troops at Makeni in the northern hinterland. But they lost radio contact with the United Nations headquarters in the capital. The Zambians passed through two rebel checkpoints and then at a third found themselves boxed in by a force of heavily armed guerrillas. The convoy's commander, faced with a battle that he felt he was sure to lose, negotiated a surrender.
In addition to the 208 Zambian soldiers, an estimated 110 other United Nations peacekeepers, military observers and civilian workers are being held by the rebels.
Under the mandate authorized by the Security Council for Sierra Leone, the peacekeepers may defend themselves but are not equipped for conventional combat.
A former United States Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, Henry J. Cohen, said yesterday that the peacekeepers should have been more robustly equipped, including with artillery, to be able to give a "show of strength." Mr. Cohen said the peacekeeping force now faced two options: "appease and lose face" or use strong force against the rebels, including helicopter gunships.
Mr. Cohen added that if the United Nations force pulled out as it had in Somalia in 1993 and several years later in Rwanda, then Mr. Sankoh's forces would "sweep into power."
In the coming days, the immediate task, according to the Western diplomat in Freetown, was to see what "you can do for the battalions that are not affected."
"The key," he said, "is to get the rebels to turn it off and to resolve some of the United Nations problems of organization and communication."
The Kenyans, who were the first target of the rebels, appeared to have encountered rebels who were "more numerous, more committed," the diplomat said. But why the Kenyan unit unraveled so quickly was not clear, he added.
Four United Nations helicopter gunships were supposed to have arrived last month, the diplomat said, but as of several days ago had still not shown up. Whether the gunships would have been useful in the clash between the Kenyans and the rebels or the Zambians and the rebels was an open question, the diplomat said.
"They are rather indiscriminate," the diplomat said of the helicopters. "As long as U.N. troops are with rebels I'd be more cautious than sending up gunships to do their thing."
One of the options being discussed at the State Department in the last several days has been charging Mr. Sankoh with war crimes and trying to remove him from the scene, several officials said. But that seemed an unlikely outcome, especially while Mr. Sankoh's forces controlled United Nations troops.
Other officials said they were concerned that if Mr. Sankoh was removed, the rebel group would become even less manageable because it would fall into the hands of a number of disparate commanders.
As part of the peace accords of last summer, Mr. Sankoh was given a position as head of a commission intended to control the flow of illegal diamond exports from Sierra Leone. The United States contributed $1 million to setting up the commission, an Administration official said.
A Western diplomat said the peacekeepers were surrounded in unfamiliar terrain by armed adversaries. "They're authorized to defend themselves but they're not required to fight to the last man," he said.
Some embassies in Freetown began evacuating dependents and nonessential people. More than 100 workers for nongovernment relief organizations were also reportedly been evacuated by United Nations helicopters.
Mr. Annan expressed concern in Paris on Thursday that the deteriorating situation in Sierra Leone might have a ripple effect in making member countries hesitate to contribute troops to a more complex peacekeeping operation being assembled for Congo.
"The efforts right now are political in nature: to get anybody who has influence on Foday Sankoh to convince him to come back into compliance with the peace agreement," Mr. Eckhard said yesterday. "If that fails, I don't want to speculate what could happen next."
The rebel leader, who remains at his residence in Freetown, continued to deny yesterday that his fighters have taken any peacekeepers hostage, asserting that they must have gotten lost.
"What happened here was that there are people missing in the area because they are not familiar with the terrain, so I ordered my commanders to try to search for them," Mr. Sankoh said, according to Reuters.

HEADLINE: New Life for Old Railroads;
What Better Place to Lay Miles of Fiber Optic Cable

BYLINE: By JANE TANNER 

DATELINE: ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla.

 BODY:
Henry Flagler came to Florida in 1883 to build grand hotels in what was sparsely populated coastal scrub. Using wealth amassed as one of the Standard Oil Company's founders, he began cobbling together a railroad down the length of the state. He opened up Florida as he went, erecting posh resorts like the Palm Beach Inn, later called the Breakers, that would serve as starting points for future cities. By 1896, he had built 350 miles of track from Jacksonville to Miami.
Now Florida East Coast Industries, the holding company controlling the Flagler railroad, is using the right of way to establish itself in the new economy. Since last May, the company's subsidiary, Epik Communications, has been selling capacity to move digital information through fiber optic cables that run alongside chugging train cars piled high with crushed stone, building materials and vehicles. 
 Like most railroads, Florida East Coast Railroad had been collecting rent from giant telecommunications companies that had buried cable beside its tracks. But two years ago the company decided to jump directly into the market for bandwidth capacity. Just shy of one year into its venture selling transmission capacity to telephone companies, wireless services and Internet service providers, Epik's network covers 80 percent of Florida's population and extends west to Texas and north to Atlanta. The revenue backlog is $60 million.
"What makes it a great railroad franchise is what makes it a terrific telecom franchise," says Robert Anestis, the chairman, president and chief operating officer of Florida East Coast Industries, who came on board in January 1999 to exploit the telecommunications potential. "We're in the center of growth."
The story of how the little railroad leveraged the dirt along its tracks to leap into fiber optic communications provides a glimpse into some of the swaps and barters used to create a glass network for the streams of digital bits and bytes cycling around the globe. It also suggests how some old-economy transportation and power companies may find prosperity in a cyberage.
Railroad tracks make good paths for telecommunications cable because they offer cleared, linear routes. In fact, special railroad cars run along tracks plowing cable underground as they move. The cost of assembling such paths for conduits from scratch would be astronomical.
In the same way, energy and utility rights of way are used for fiber optics. For instance, the Williams Companies created a whole new venture by putting cables along its natural gas pipelines. Consolidated Edison's infrastructure is being used for fiber optic lines into 2,000 buildings in New York.
Southern Pacific Railroad is the textbook example of a railroad creating telecommunications companies, having spawned both Sprint and Qwest Communications International.
In this latest sweep of new entries along with FLorida East Coast are the Norfolk Southern Corporation and the CSX Corporation. "The pickings have been so good, a lot of people have been getting into this industry," says Tim Caffrey, who follows telecommunications for Standard & Poor's.
While Florida East Coast is small, it is beginning to attract attention. Since January 1999, its stock has gone from $27 a share to over $46; its market capitalization has risen from $800 million to just under $1.8 billion. In mid-April an investment group including the Texas billionaire Robert Bass acquired a 5 percent stake in the holding company, based in St. Augustine, Fla., with its railroad, trucking, real estate and now telecommunications businesses.
"It's in the nascent stages, but the company is beginning to make a major play in the telecom industry," says Andrew Hamerling, an analyst at BancAmerica Securities.
Florida East Coast was a fairly inert company until Mr. Anestis began to kick-start the assets that Mr. Flagler had put into place 100 years earlier. The company and the St. Joe Company, which held a 54 percent stake in Florida East Coast until recently, had lagged under the control of the conservative Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust.
But in the early 1990's, investors pressed St. Joe to start exploiting its assets for better shareholder returns. It shed operations like a paper mill, telephone company and bank to focus on its one million acres of real estate in the Florida Panhandle for resort development.
When St. Joe took a look at its 53.8 percent stake, it decided that it should put the company up for sale. But Mr. Anestis, then a consultant to Peter S. Rummel, St. Joe's chairman, convinced him that there was better way to capture the value of the telecommunications potential.
"I told him it's much better to jump into this thing proactively," Mr. Anestis recalls.
Mr. Anestis had had an eye on the company's telecommunications rights of way for some time. In the early 1980's AT&T, MCI, WorldCom and other big players installed fiber optic cables along Florida East Coast Railroad lines to reach the state's growing cities. These leases were a no-cost stream of passive revenue. The next big cable construction wave followed the 1996 telecommunications act. During this second buildup, Florida East Coast decided to get a piece of the digital action.
Mr. Anestis started as a mergers and acquisitions lawyer in Pittsburgh, then headed a railroad holding company, Guilford Transportation Industries, that a client had created. In 1984, AT&T leased right of way from Guilford on an unused line in the White Mountains to add capacity to its Boston-to-Montreal fiber link. The old line, with small trees growing in the tracks, showed Mr. Anestis how valuable such linear paths could be. Mr. Anestis left Guilford and started an investment advisory firm, still consulting with railroads and negotiating right of way leases with telecommunications companies.
In 1997, when Qwest wanted to bury cable on Florida East Coast Railroad routes, Mr. Anestis negotiated on behalf of the railroad and got Qwest to build three conduits for Florida East Coast as part of the bargain.
The next year when Williams was anxious to add Florida capacity along the railroad's right of way, Mr. Anestis brokered a deal for 36 strands of dark fiber from Williams. Dark fiber is unactivated cable.
Instead of being just a passive landlord, Florida East Coast now had telecommunication assets, but it did not know how to deploy them. "We were pretty good horse traders, but we really didn't know what to do with this," Mr. Anestis said. Soon after these deals, he was made head of Florida East Coast Industries.
Mr. Anestis hired strategic consultants at the Cambridge-based Monitor Company to determine whether 3 empty conduits and 36 strands were enough to jump-start a new telecommunications company. Each 1.25-inch conduit can hold 216 fiber optic strands. Two strands of activated cable can transmit 129,000 simultaneous telephone calls. New technology is expected to increase that number a hundredfold.
John McClellan, Monitor's head of telecommunications, concluded that the venture could work. Florida's economy was expected to grow 37 percent faster than the rest of the country over the next 10 years. The company's rights of way, conduits and fiber amounted to a base to reach the majority of the state's population.
Florida East Coast also had enough capital to invest nearly $100 million in cash to get the initial parts of the business up and running.
At the end of the consultation, Mr. McClellan decided to leave his 16-year career at Monitor to head the new Florida East Coast venture.
Now, Mr. McClellan splits his time between his home in Groton, Mass., and Epik's headquarters in Orlando. He took a two-thirds pay cut, spurred by the prospect of stock options. Mr. Anestis said Epik could go public in as few as six months, but acknowledged that market volatility could extend that timetable.
"I entered into this knowing we're in this a while trying to build a business," Mr. McClellan said.
Under Mr. McClellan, Epik has extended its reach beyond Florida in fiber and conduit swaps with Enron Broadband Services and Broadwing Communications.
"We're becoming experts in swaps and barter," Mr. Anestis said. Trade-outs allow quick geographic links without time-consuming installation. Fiber optic companies build excess capacity so they can use it as capital in future trades.
Florida East Coast and Epik officials, meanwhile, are huddling over aerial photos of the 18,000 Florida acres that Mr. Flagler accumulated and that remain under company control.
Gran Central, a real estate subsidiary, has built a portfolio of high-end office complexes and industrial buildings. Now, the company is considering the land for Telecom Hotels, high-rises intended to house equipment needed to keep data flowing smoothly. The company is also considering constructing office buildings prewired for the latest technology.
Many railroad industry executives are looking for new opportunities. Last year, Norfolk Southern created a subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, or T-Cubed. The railroad plans to lay conduit and use its microwave towers to sell bandwidth capacity to carriers.
In March, CSX signed an agreement with Pathnet Inc., a wholesaler of bandwidth based in Reston, Va., to provide railroad right of way in exchange for equity in Pathnet. Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Colonial Pipeline also signed "right of way for equity" deals with Pathnet.
With all these new players, Mr. Caffrey at Standard & Poor's and other industry watchers say a glut of fiber capacity may be on the horizon. Mr. Anestis is not flustered by the prospect. "We assumed that this supply would cause prices to fall," he said. "Even so, with the slope of growth there's a great business here."

HEADLINE: Morality;
The Good Lie

BYLINE: By Jane Smiley; Jane Smiley is the author, most recently, of "Horse Heaven," a novel.

 BODY:
After reading the results of this poll, you'd have to say that lying to protect someone's feelings is as American as enriching your life by having children, almost as American as not ever having done yoga, and more American than thinking you are too fat or feeling guilty about a thing or two you did when you were younger. On the other hand, lying to protect someone's feelings is not nearly as American as thinking that being American is a big part of who you are.
Myself, I would have to say that lying is not nearly as big a part of who I am as writing fiction, and in fact, I almost never lie, even to avoid hurting someone's feelings. What I do to avoid hurting someone's feelings is just keep my opinion to myself. Even so, my occasional forays into lying have made me something of a theorist of lying. (Here are the lies I told: 1. I sold a car knowing it needed new valve rings, but I really did not know that it needed a new transmission until the buyer told me about it five days after the sale. 2. I told one of my husbands that I still loved him even though I didn't know whether I did or not.) 
 There are several forms of what you might call lying. One is misrepresenting the truth. Another is keeping a secret. A third is presenting as true what you wish were true, or perhaps hope is true, but don't know for sure is true. A fourth form of lying is shorthand -- the truth is changing so quickly that to detail every shift would in fact present something as true that could very quickly become false. A fifth is being mistaken, which sometimes looks like a lie.
Let's begin with being mistaken. Everyone is mistaken almost all the time, and so almost everything that everyone says will eventually be proved wrong, and so almost everything that everyone says is untrue. The best answer to any question is, "I don't know," even to so simple a question as "How do you like these shoes I bought?" "I don't know" is a real commitment to the larger truth, because it recognizes that the passage of time makes every judgment provisional. However, people who always say "I don't know" find themselves in a double bind -- either they are considered too bland to have opinions or, if they explain why they don't know, they are told that they think too much, and thinking too much is not very American at all. So, logically, there is no truth telling, but people persuade themselves that they more or less tell the truth anyway.
A recognition of complexity makes truth telling that much more difficult. Government officials or unfaithful spouses involved in some quickly developing crisis, for example, are often subsequently accused of either withholding information or misrepresenting the partial information already available. But the supposition that the truth is known almost always leads to action, and most actions, of course, turn out to be unreasoned, wrongheaded ones. Best to put off action as long as possible, and lying to achieve this goal is a perfectly wise decision.
If the truth is almost always misrepresented, then the real moral distinctions with regard to lying have to do with motive. Most of those polled seem to feel that lying to save someone else pain is moral. I suspect, though, that they would have had a different response to the statement "Lying is sometimes necessary to protect oneself." Let us say that 60 percent might have disagreed with this statement, and yet we all know that lying is sometimes necessary to protect oneself, even when we choose not to, and fail to protect ourselves. In fact, one of the main tasks of raising children is to convince them that telling a lie does not protect them; that it in fact endangers them even more than the misbehavior that gave rise to the lie. Children understand that to tell the truth is sometimes counterintuitive, which is why teaching them to tell the truth depends very much on how much power they think Mom and Dad really possess. In my experience, oldest children hardly ever lie, but second children, well aware of the disparity between what parents think is going on and what is really going on, lie rather easily.
What constitutes self-protection? I wish the pollsters had asked a final question: "Although this is an anonymous questionnaire, I have misrepresented the truth, exaggerated things and held information back on one or more questions. Do you agree or disagree?" (See question No. 8, "Have you ever cheated just a little on your taxes or an office expense account, or haven't you?") Obviously, of the 84 percent who say they have never exaggerated their business mileage, never failed to report even a penny of cash income, never filled in the wrong amount on a blank taxi receipt, at least some are protecting their own opinion of themselves.
And how about if the pollsters had asked the question, "Lying is sometimes necessary for personal gain"? How American would it be to agree with that one? In what area of our booming economy do the sellers of goods advertise them truthfully? In what area do the buyers expect them to? In what political arena do the candidates come clean? In what political arena do the voters expect them to, or even want them to? I remember when President Carter's attempt to rescue the hostages in Iran failed. He spoke to the American people of his sense that the hostage taking posed something of a dilemma, not easily solved. As a result of his honesty and understanding of complexity, he was widely perceived as weak and summarily replaced in office by a simple man who seems never to have found himself in a dilemma.
Is it more American to keep a secret or to tell it? The person doing the choosing often has to consider the motives of the person seeking the information. Almost all Americans, for example, would have considered it extremely un-American for those hiding Jews during World War II to divulge their whereabouts. In fact, many Americans would consider it highly American for those living under tyrannical regimes in faraway places to keep and bear arms, even unlawful, secret arms.
My own feeling is that even in America, there are some to whom it is obligatory to lie. When you are going through a serious crisis, and a casual acquaintance or your mother asks how you are, it is a very bad idea to actually tell them. "Fine" is fine. It is also O.K. to lie to unsolicited telephone callers, guys who make passes and friends who like to retail gossip or offer unasked-for advice. In this category I would have to include the press too: there is never any moral opprobrium to be suffered by those who lie to the press. Reporters are in the business of selling secrets for money. They do not, therefore, have your best interests at heart. I have always admired the efforts of every single celebrity or politician who lied to the press. Just as the role of the press is to be a watchdog upon the government, the role of celebrities and politicians is to frustrate the all-seeing eye of the press and remind everyone that there are questions that should never be asked if a civil society is to be maintained.

HEADLINE: What Do We Talk About When We Are Paying Someone to Listen

BYLINE: By Ariel Kaminer; Ariel Kaminer is an editor at The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
Are there facets of the inner life that emerge only within the framework of psychotherapy? How do patients' concerns reflect larger cultural dynamics? To discuss the secrets of the 50-minute world, we set up a conversation among six experts with a variety of professional perspectives. Our panel included:
Ethel Person, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University who practices in New York and is the author, most recently, of "The Sexual Century." 
 Peter D. Kramer, author of "Listening to Prozac" and "Should You Leave?" who teaches psychiatry at Brown University and practices in Providence, R.I.
Martin S. Bergmann, a psychoanalyst who teaches psychiatry at New York University; he is the author of numerous works, including "The Anatomy of Loving."
Amy Bloom, author of "Love Invents Us," a novel, and the forthcoming collection "A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You," who has a private practice in psychotherapy in Connecticut.
Jonathan Lear, who is a member of the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago; his next book is "Happiness, Death and the Remainder of Life."
John A. Talbott, a professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, who has written extensively on chronic mental illness and publicly financed treatment.
Question: If I can start the ball rolling, what are the issues that people today talk about only in the context of psychotherapy? Are there any privileged realms?
Ethel Person: I think there is one realm. I think that people do not discuss their fantasies in public as much as they do in therapy because those really tap a deeper part -- and a very idiosyncratic part. I mean, typical fantasies like I want to get rich or I want a new job, that kind of thing people will talk about, but some of the kinkier sexual fantasies don't get discussed in public. Or the fantasies about which one is embarrassed.
Q: Does the list of things that people are willing to talk about only in psychotherapy change over time?
Person: Yes. Therapy is still where people talk about their most painful feelings. But they talk about much more personal things in public now than they did 20 or 30 years ago.
Peter D. Kramer: I think it's a problem for therapy. I think that the power of therapy depends on novelty and surprise. And the enormous openness about sexuality, jealousy, violent thoughts and so on impoverishes therapy to some extent. I think therapy was probably easier to do when it was more surprising to speculate, as Freud did, that the patient may have sexual feelings of which he or she is unaware. That wouldn't shock anyone -- it wouldn't be transformative anymore.
Q: So as opposed to opening up other possibilities, you feel that having gotten those kind of basic surprises out of the way lessens the possibilities for what can be discussed in therapy?
Kramer: I think that one of the great jobs of psychotherapy is to create a place where very shameful aspects of the self can safely be revealed. So I think it lessens the force of revelation that so much is already revealed.
Martin S. Bergmann: Cultural changes do in some way affect what patients talk about. To give an example, I have had experience with patients who develop cancer or other disabling diseases and then look upon themselves as "damaged goods." Now, to me, "damaged goods" is a very typical American way to look at oneself, in commercial terms. For example, "My child is a high-maintenance kid." That is also along the same lines.
Kramer: I think it's obvious at this moment that therapy also needs to be a refuge from the commercial society. There's something about the ubiquity of value. The woman in her 50's who has just been divorced and has a sense of having no social worth -- that is the sort of thing that I think is very much at the core of a carriage-trade psychotherapeutic practice nowadays. It's discussed everywhere, but the level of pain associated with the depth of the hopelessness, I think, probably emerges in the psychotherapeutic space.
Q: And this is a recent development?
Kramer: I don't know, I think there's always a temptation to believe it's a recent development. But the role of the therapeutic space as a refuge from this tendency to value very exactly every person and activity in the culture seems very much in sharp focus at the moment.
Amy Bloom: But I think the stain of the commercial actually works both ways. I have walked into colleagues' offices in the last five years and found people with drug-company clipboards or newsletters. I'm sure they were in some people's offices before, but certainly nobody I wanted to go and have a cup of coffee with.
Jonathan Lear: There's a shift in popular culture in its relation to psychotherapy. Last decade, three popular shows on television were "Seinfeld," "Friends" and "Ally McBeal." They all shared this underlying assumption that human intimacy of the standard one-heterosexual-married-couple isn't possible. And that what there really is in the world is a conversation among one's friends or business partners or flatmates about why this more traditional idea of intimacy is just not going to work. And so it's a basically ironic stance. And then there's a shift, I think, last year, to "The Sopranos." You know, this guy is a gangster, and he has his women on the side and whatever, but he's trying to make his marriage work. He's trying to deal with the responsibilities of the office. And trying to come to terms with, in terms of what Ethel was saying, very primitive fantasies that are under the surface and got him where he is. There's a kind of earnestness. It seems to me like the nature of the refuge shifted, like irony as a defense against the kinds of anxieties that have been discussed is collapsing.
Bloom: Tony Soprano has a terribly earnest therapist as well. I mean, she seems utterly unable to marshal any sort of useful defenses.
Person: If I were to say that there was a shift, it's that people's sense of being not in control in their lives is much more paramount than it was previously. And I would tie it to this major dislocation in terms of the way success and money are regarded. I'm not sure that the therapist's office is always a refuge. It's often a place that people come in order to figure out how to be in control -- which too often means being in control financially.
Q: Can you tell me some of the ways that these economic displacements manifest themselves in the therapeutic context?
Bloom: Because most of the people I work with don't actually have a lot of money, it has seemed to me over the last 20 years that there was a significant number of people who, although they would go on having unresolved issues in their lives, most of their dramatic crises that led to really terrible outcomes in their lives would have been resolved if they had had $50,000. Now, that's not to say that they couldn't also have been avoided if they had been more resourceful and less conflicted about their ability to get help. But it does often seem to me that that point at which you find yourself out of your apartment and without a car and unable to move your furniture -- some of those things could probably be avoided.
Kramer: This may be half a step back, but I think some of the same issues that we've been talking about could be put in this different way, which is, I think the culture has become hard for melancholics. If you're in a culture where there's a great deal of social disruption, where people are expected to be extremely autonomous, where the divorce rate is high, where the form the families take is very diverse, it is hard to have those underlying personality traits that we talk about as melancholic -- that is, being deliberate, attaching very strongly, being loyal, being somewhat prone to depression, having low energy, even if you tend to use it well. And I do think a lot of what we see in our offices is related to a particular sort of social disruption. People might be helped by having greater resources, but they'd also be helped by having a more reliable standing and a more reliable set of connections in the culture.
John A. Talbott: I can affiliate myself with Peter's remarks because I think that the people I treat, who are cognitively impaired, are also clueless to some extent about what cultural changes are going on. I think there's a sense of wanting to be part of the mainstream, but the mainstream has shifted so much.
Bloom: Peter, you're saying that as the culture has shifted, it has become less accepting of certain kinds of personalities with certain sort of clusters of traits, even if the person functions reasonably well. I think that that is true. I mean, you get a great deal more leeway as a tearing narcissist in this culture than you do as someone who tends to be a little broody and little thin-skinned and maybe a little slow to speak and, you know, given to pondering. I don't think that gets you a lot of room culturally right now.
Bergmann: It occurs to me that the changing roles of women, the changing expectations of women as they affect the point of view of the man, have created new kinds of marital tensions. I think that is a very important part of our culture. Also the whole question of to what extent libidinal satisfactions are obtained outside of personal realms.
Lear: What do you mean by that?
Bergmann: Well, let's say a professional whose satisfaction is entirely in terms of her relationship to her clients. That is her personal value system. Whatever operates there is the equivalent to what one used to call love life. There is less separation between personal and professional, and for many people the professional has become the personal. So I see it in two ways: I see it in terms of the professional invading the personal to an enormous extent, and I see it also in terms of new problems created within the couple as a result of the changing position of the woman in the marriage and the inability of the man to live up to these expectations or to be able to do justice to it.
Person: You're not saying she's more consumed than male professionals, are you?
Bergmann: No. In the lives of many males, the professional was always really the dominant place where most of their ambitions, most of their love needs and most of their hostilities were expressed, so that by the time you came home at 7:00 to your family in Westchester, you know, you read The New York Times and you went to sleep. It is now also much more characteristic of women. I don't mean that it's getting better or worse.
Lear: There's a theme I hear emerging. I think the issues that are being raised in the social sphere, issues about ambition, striving, competition, both in the workplace and at home, have been undertheorized by therapists and analysts. Something strikes me -- you know, Aristotle says that philosophy begins in leisure. It's only when people are freed up from just struggling for survival that they can think about the meaning of life. And I think something's very similar in psychotherapy. This is a very wealthy society. And -- a similar point -- when people get freed up via drug therapy from the acute crisis of mental illness, they're freed up to worry about the meaning of their lives. I mean, to worry, "Am I capable of a deep, intimate relationship?" is to some extent a luxury. So it's possible that there's going to be a freeing up to be worried about the kinds of issues that psychotherapy addresses.
Bloom: Well, there'll be a freeing up, but I guess one of the questions that that raised here is, given the direction of the culture, will people worry about the nature of their intimate relationships? Or will they feel that that's the last thing in the world they would want to spend time on -- that though they have terrible relationships, they should go out and buy something?
Lear: I don't think that'll last. That's a defense that won't -
Bloom: No, I agree that it's a defense that leaks all over the place, which is why you see people with money in treatment.
Q: A number of you have started doing couples therapy, as opposed to classic one-on-one analysis. Is that part of a general profession-wide outreach? Or does it reflect some other trend?
Kramer: I think it's not a coincidence. I turned to couples therapy as a more important part of my practice partly because of the notion that there are some people who really do have different and more complete selves in a relationship than they have in isolation. I think the issue of the fragility of the couple has become extremely important and shows itself in all sorts of areas even when divorce is not an issue. In terms of the balance of power within marriage, in terms of aspirations of young women, it just seems to me that some constant awareness of the fragility of marriage permeates all sorts of aspects of therapy.
Bloom: Actually, two changes that I have observed are that I certainly see far more same-sex couples than I used to whose concerns are not either cultural homophobia or internalized homophobia. And those people tend to be, I have to say, highly committed. I think the other change is, people are more expressive more quickly of their loneliness within the marriage. It's not that they are more lonely, but they no longer feel that it's quite as much of an individual failure to admit that they are lonely within the marriage, now.
Bergmann: There is a much stronger agenda of each partner than I think there used to be. They are trying to negotiate it between the two, but the agendas are much more definite. And I would say to your same-gender couples -- of which I have had only two examples over the years, but they're important -- I think part of their determination to make it is also ideological: to prove that homosexuality is not a disease, that it can be linked to a permanent relationship. And that, of course, can add to the stability.
Bloom: That may be what drives the heterosexual couples as well.
Bergmann: But they don't have so much to prove it, you see.
Bloom: That's not clear to me anymore.
Q: I have a question that's far off topic: How and to what extent do religious issues or concerns arise in the therapeutic context?
Person: They come up in terms of the degree of someone's faith and the degree to which that faith may conflict with their wish to change their lives in any way. And it's harder for people who belong to certain faiths to enter into therapy for fear of violating some tenet of that faith.
Talbott: The Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry asked the readers of Dear Abby: If you have suffered from schizophrenia, what was the most important factor in your recovery? We got hundreds of responses. To us, the single most striking factor was the role of their own religion and spirituality. They felt, rightly or wrongly, that a spiritual connection, the ability to believe that they were going to be better through a higher power, was the most important thing. And it was really astounding to the scientists who were looking at this, because we had expected answers like medication or psychotherapy.
Bergmann: It doesn't surprise me. The ability to believe is a kind of a human capacity to create within yourself the image of somebody caring for you. And that image then does something for you. So that it's really a kind of a miraculous capacity to imagine a love object and then the love object, which has been imagined, is actually helpful.
Bloom: I have certainly had more people talk about their spiritual advisers and their spiritual counselors than I did when I first started practicing. People seem to take for granted that their religious leader is also available to offer some sort of counseling service.
Lear: There's again a general theme in which this fits, which is the possibility of living with certain kinds of intimacy. It's not just intimacy about people; it's an intimacy with certain kinds of ideals. Again, I think the ironic relationship to ideals is collapsing, and I think religious ideals are one example of that phenomenon. It's part of the wider phenomenon.
Q: So it's now possible to talk about spiritual issues and financial issues in a psychotherapeutic context. To what extent do disappointed expectations come up in the kinds of concerns that patients discuss in therapy? Is that a theme?
Person: Yes, there are disappointed expectations in their lives. I think one of the common ones now is that people who are very ambitious and make lots of money are very disappointed in the quality of their lives. It has cost them too much in other areas. They come into treatment because of the emptiness that they feel.
Bergmann: I agree. I think, Who comes to us? Always people for whom something expected did not happen. It's almost by definition prerequisite for coming to us. I think the whole enormous increase in psychotherapy after World War II was to a certain extent based on the question: After the refrigerator, after car, after washing machine, what's next? Because these things were endowed with magic that they could not deliver.

HEADLINE: Satisfactions;
Everything Changes Money

BYLINE: By Orlando Patterson; Orlando Patterson, professor of sociology at Harvard, is the author of "Rituals of Blood," the second volume of a trilogy on race relations.

 BODY:
Of the many contradictions that make American life so endlessly fascinating, few are more curious than those pertaining to money and success. The zeal to make money drives America's globally dominant economy. It has long been observed that in the absence of an aristocracy and the other insidious obfuscations of too much history, money has been the chief maker and marker of status and power. And if my profession is certain of one thing, it is the fact that a family's income matters greatly for the welfare and development of its children.
It is odd, then, that so many Americans have always held money in suspicion. The Puritans were certain that it was the root of all evil, even as they flagellated themselves for making more and more of it. Leaders from Benjamin Franklin to Martin Luther King Jr. have warned of the dangers of materialism. 
 Today, a substantial majority of Americans insist that they do not overvalue money as a measure of their success. What's more, they also deny the influence of money in the way they or their children turn out. The puzzle deepens when we observe that even African-Americans, as well as poorer and older people, are among those most inclined to deny such influences.
What's going on? Are these people simply in denial? Or are they just misinformed?
Perhaps it's a little of both. But I think something more complex is at play, having to do with the need to reconcile our deeply held beliefs about equality with the realities of inequality in America.
America justified its declaration of independence with the startling principle that all people are self-evidently equal. Nonetheless, in the more than two centuries since this declaration, income inequality has grown, except for the period that began with the mid-1930's and ended with the late 1960's. This growth in inequality has been accompanied by an extension of democracy far beyond what prevailed in Jefferson's day. And yet, contrary to the fears of postrevolutionary leaders that a tyrannous majority would inevitably soak the rich, for most periods of American history, including our own, political power has rarely been used to reduce inequality. Why is that?
There is little support for the cynical view that Americans don't really take their egalitarian ideal seriously. They do, and what's more, nearly half consider present economic inequalities morally wrong. As someone who has known or lived with the invidious injuries of the British class system, the ostentatious iniquities of Caribbean color-class hierarchies with their "one people" cant, not to mention Brazilian apartheid with its Orwellian double-speak of "racial democracy," I'll take the dilemmas of American egalitarianism any day, racist warts and all.
Nonetheless, while most Americans genuinely endorse equality in principle, they seem unable to embrace the political means necessary to achieve it. Jennifer Hochschild, a political scientist, thinks that Americans are highly egalitarian in the domains of home, school and community, but that they reject egalitarianism in the workplace. They are uncomfortable using politics to redistribute wealth because they feel it mixes up domains.
I doubt it. Working people do not use politics to repair income inequality because they believe that the democratic process has been corrupted and that politicians are beholden to vested interests. Working- and middle-class Americans certainly desire more money. But having long given up on politicians to do anything about inequality, they have by necessity developed attitudes toward money that enable them to live with it.
Religion is one buttress. In this most religious of industrialized nations, it is religious Americans, among whom African-Americans are disproportionately numbered, who are among the most inclined to deny money's impact or its role as a measure of success.
But a majority of the less devout among us also disclaim the influence of money. They imagine that anyone can make it if they really want to. Becoming rich is a matter of choice, and if there is any virtue left, it lies in the road not taken. Many still share Emerson's view that "money often costs too much," added to which are recent developments indicating that it buys less and less status.
One effect of the vast growth of wealth in contemporary America is that the rich are no longer exalted: too many millionaires have socially degraded wealth. This is all the more true in the strange roller-coaster world of the new economy, where millionaires are daily made from market ether and traditional economic value are upended. The rich can no longer claim to earn their status the old-fashioned way. Like lottery winners, it could happen to anyone.
It may be, too, that people invest money with different symbolic meanings. Viviana Zelizer, a sociologist, has argued that money has cultural significance beyond its wholly instrumental uses. People earmark and valorize money differently, depending on how it is acquired. The same person who scrupulously saves a portion of her income for the down payment on a home will blow $1,000 won from the lottery on a fancy dress or a party. In this cultural recoinage, money ceases to be fungible. There is earned money and welfare money; clean, laundered and dirty money; breadwinner's money and pin money. And, one surmises, there is the funny money of the rich and the real, honest money of working people.
In fact, I would contend that the willingness of many Americans to accept the widening income gap, despite their moral reservations about it, grows out of a deep and abiding national conviction: whatever differences fortune may have dictated between people, where it really matters all of us are of truly equal worth.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/1411 Broadway, Between 39th and 40th Street;
In Changing Garment District, a Fashion Holdout

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE changes that have taken place in the Garment Center in recent years have been so broad and so swift -- a recent survey found that less than half the space is now occupied by apparel concerns -- that, with a nod to the revitalized neighborhood to the north, some real estate executives have begun referring to the area from 35th Street to 41st Street to the west of the Avenue of the Americas as Times Square South.
But the managers of the building at 1411 Broadway, between 39th and 40th Street, say they are intent on maintaining it as a center for the clothing trade. Indeed, they say that as more buildings in the area are being converted to general office use, the value of having a concentration of showrooms in one building is allowing them to charge premium rents to tenants who want to be near the heart of the action. 
 "Clearly, the manufacturing part of the industry has left New York," said Douglas Winshall, senior vice president for the northeast region for TrizecHahn, a Toronto-based company that purchased the property in 1997. "But the showrooms and marketing department and other front-office functions still need to be here."
Mr. Winshall said that consolidation in the apparel industry, with larger companies driving smaller competitors out of business or absorbing them, had increased the value of buildings considered to be at the heart of the district. "This is an industry building," he said. "There is a value to both the landlord and tenants to operating it as a dedicated garment-industry building."
He said that the principal advantage is that when buyers for retail chains arrive in New York for seasonal purchasing sessions, they have to go to only a few locations to see a full line of wares.
"It is imperative that we be located here," said Bobby Reiss, chief executive officer of Worldwide Apparel Resources, a designer of clothing sold under private labels and a tenant at 1411 Broadway. "When retailers come to town they want to go to one general location. If you are in a different part of town you could be eliminated from the schedule."
Mr. Reiss said the principal Garment District buildings are known worldwide in the apparel business. "If you are in Hong Kong or Shanghai and you mention 1411 Broadway or 1407 Broadway," he said, "people know what you are talking about."
Joe Harary, who rents 40,000 square feet at 1411 Broadway for his company, Jacques Moret, a producer of women's sportswear and underwear, said: "This is the heart of the Garment District today. This is a location we have aspired to be in and where I hope we can stay."
Mr. Harary said that Jacques Moret uses most of its space for showrooms and offices, with only a small amount devoted to sewing samples for display to buyers.
The influx of general office-space users such as advertising agencies, law firms and Internet-related businesses has only increased the importance of the major buildings identified with the apparel business, said Neil Weiss, the chairman of KSK International, another garment-industry tenant at 1411 Broadway.
"Places like this are more important than ever to the remaining high-end apparel companies," he said. "Buyers have told me they like the idea of going into a few buildings and seeing all the vendors."
David Winokur, executive vice president of Winokur Realty, a broker specializing in the Garment District, said that the addition of new types of tenants was pushing rent levels higher. He said that rents in the area were typically in the mid-$30's per square foot annually, "and going up from there."
HE said he felt that TrizecHahn's decision to market 1411 Broadway as an apparel center, despite the industry's overall decline, made sense. "I've always thought that the movement of other tenants into the area would make the premier garment buildings even stronger," he said.
Barbara Randall, executive director of the Fashion Center Business Improvement District, said that a recent survey confirmed that apparel tenants had fallen below 50 percent of the space occupied in the district.
"There has been a huge change in just the last two years," she said. "The change in Times Square has made the real estate community willing to look here as a place to locate their clients."
As a result, she said, apparel companies are consolidating in specific buildings, naming 525, 530 and 550 Seventh Avenue as core garment buildings in addition to 1411 and 1407 Broadway. And, she said, some design companies are moving their showrooms to side-street locations that were once populated by suppliers.
"The building at 205 West 39th Street is all showroom now," she said.
Mr. Winshall said TrizecHahn is not concentrating on luring apparel-industry tenants to much of its 8.5 million square feet of property in the New York metropolitan area, including buildings in Stamford, Conn., and Jersey City. He said the location of 1411 Broadway and the characteristics of the 1.145 million-square-foot structure made it suitable for such an approach.
"This building is 30 years old, but it is the newest in the area by 20 years," he said. "Unlike most Garment Center buildings it has rectangular floor plates, with 40,000-square-foot floors in the base and 14,000 square feet in the tower."
He said that a 200,000-square-foot TrizecHahn building at 1460 Broadway, at 41st Street, that had been largely occupied by textile tenants was being converted to office use because of its proximity to Times Square.
"We went out and found Skadden, Arps which is going to use it as a back office for 4 Times Square," he said, referring to the law firm that is one of the principal tenants of a new building at the intersection of 42nd Street and Broadway. Mr. Winshall said he had been able to empty out 100,000 square feet of the building by July 1998, with the firm scheduled to take over the rest of the building as leases expire over the succeeding seven years.
Another building in the TrizecHahn portfolio, the 600,000-square-foot structure at 111 West 40th Street, is similarly being converted from largely textile-industry use to general office space, to take advantage of its location across the Avenue of the Americas from Bryant Park. It has been renumbered as 1065 Avenue of the Americas to emphasize its location and it has attracted tenants such as Yahoo, the big Internet referral service, which has rented 50,000 square feet for its New York headquarters.
"We still have some textile/apparel tenants in the building, but it's about 60-40 office to apparel now," Mr. Winshall said. "And we're moving that toward 80-20."
Tenants at 1411 Broadway run the gamut from Jones Apparel Group, which occupies 200,000 square feet, to small producers that have a 1,000-square-foot showroom, said Bruce J. Crawford, TrizecHahn's vice president for leasing in the northeast region.
The building has more than 200 tenants who are constantly expanding, shrinking, coming and going, which makes for a lot of work, Mr. Crawford said. He said a tenant with a 1,000-square-foot showroom might suddenly need to double that space if it develops a hot line of clothing.
"If we have a 1,000-square-foot tenant who needs 2,000 square feet, we try to move him to where we have space," he said. "Most want to expand showrooms, which does not involve a lot of capital cost."
He said there are typically 40 new lease transactions a year involving about 175,000 square feet of space. "It's not like you are locking things up forever," he said.

HEADLINE: On TV, a Loss of Independents

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
FOR more than two decades, Robert Greenwald, a prolific television producer, has owned the films he made, which gave him the leverage to do such Emmy Award-winning shows as "The Burning Bed" and "A Woman of Independent Means." But now Mr. Greenwald, and every other producer of films and series, is under powerful pressure to yield to the networks and allow them to own more and more of their shows.
"It's not about the money," Mr. Greenwald said. "We all get paid well. It's about the fact that a show you own is your viewpoint, your vision. All that is dissipated when you're a hired hand. You can have the most brilliant people in the world running networks, but it's almost a scientific impossibility for bureaucracies to be inventive and edgy. They cannot. It's their nature." 
 Until five years ago, federal regulations prevented broadcast networks from creating and owning shows, which left the job to independent production companies and studios like Warner Brothers, Fox, Sony and Universal. The thinking was that the networks were so powerful they could lock out projects by independent producers. But in 1995 the Federal Communications Commission lifted the 20-year-old restriction, freeing the networks to aggressively seek financial stakes in and ownership of films, dramatic series and sitcoms.
The question is, what does this mean to viewers? Is the television landscape, already littered with derivative shows, even more compromised if independent producers are unable to get provocative programs on the air? Or are the complaints just a Hollywood shell game -- one group of rich people getting richer at the expense of another group of rich people? Put another way, was television better 10 years ago than it is today?
The clearest proof of where the television networks are heading will be evident in New York during the week of May 15. That is when the networks, in their lavish annual presentations to advertisers, will announce their fall schedules. Most of the new comedy and dramatic series will be owned entirely by the networks, or made in partnership with producers. Inevitably -- and despite the denials of network executives -- some shows will be selected simply because they are home-grown. Cynics may recall that in recent years NBC green-lighted such in-house shows as "Union Square," "Conrad Bloom" and "The Mike O'Malley Show." Each of them died without a trace, and one can only wonder what shows failed to make it to the air because of the decision to put on those three.
The decline of independent producers is a reflection not only of increased network ownership of shows but, far more important, of the ascendancy of conglomerates like Disney and Viacom, General Electric and News Corporation, who own the networks. The result is that network executives have also lost considerable independence, further hampering creative programming.
Two or more decades ago, television was presided over by figures like Grant Tinker, Fred Silverman and Brandon Tartikoff, who held top jobs at NBC, and Barry Diller, a one-time ABC programming executive and the former chairman of Fox. Whatever their flaws, these men were more independent than their counterparts today. At Disney-owned ABC, for example, Lloyd Braun and Stuart Bloomberg, the two talented executives who run the entertainment division, work under the formidable shadow of Michael Eisner, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company and a former ABC executive himself. The fact that Mr. Eisner weighs in on program decisions is an open secret -- and doing so is his prerogative. (Not long ago, he went so far as to personally call Peter Berg, the creator of "Wonderland," to give him script advice. The show failed anyway.) Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of News Corporation, and executives at General Electric and Time Warner are less intrusive than Mr. Eisner, but their voices are heard at Fox and NBC and WB.
As corporate owners study the bottom line, the mood is bleak. The days are over when a show is allowed to struggle and find an audience, as NBC did with "Seinfeld" in 1990. This month, ABC canceled "Wonderland," a drama set in a mental hospital, after only two shows, and NBC dropped the DreamWorks police comedy, "Battery Park," after just four outings.
"There's no free lunch anymore," said Tom Werner, who with his partners, Marcy Carsey and Caryn Mandabach, created "The Cosby Show," "Roseanne" and other gold mines. The four pilots his company is now producing are being done in partnership with networks, partly out of necessity, he said. Making 22 episodes of a series can lead to a deficit as high as $15 million before the show is sold to syndication. Partners are needed to defray the costs.
Currently, CBS and NBC have their own in-house production units and seek out (or demand) partnerships with producers as well. Fox and ABC rely heavily -- although not exclusively -- on shows produced by 20th Century Fox and Disney. Is there any question that networks favor their own shows? It is a subtle issue.
"Without a doubt, it's a factor that gets in the way," said Amy Lippman, the co-creator of Fox's "Party of Five." "When networks have material that comes from a studio they own, it can't help but weigh in the decision about what gets on the air."
Ms. Lippman said that "Party of Five," admittedly in its sixth year, was shifted out of its choice Wednesday night time slot to make room for a Fox-produced comedy, "Get Real." "Party" is produced by Columbia-TriStar. " 'Party of Five' suffered," said Ms. Lippman, whose show went off the air this season.
Steve Levitan, the creator of NBC's "Just Shoot Me," told a similiar story about "Will and Grace," which is produced in part by NBC Studios. "NBC smelled a hit in 'Will and Grace,' " he said, "and poured all their resources and advertising into that show, giving it a great time period, the 'Just Shoot Me' time period," meaning Tuesday night at 9. "It's just that they're favoring their own show. It's not like they're doing something wrong. It's not like, 'How dare they do that?' " (The fact that "Shoot Me" is in its fifth year surely figured in the decision.)
Another writer-producer, Marshall Herskovitz, said that he and his partner, Edward Zwick, the creators of "Thirtysomething," went out of their way to make a deal with Disney knowing it would give them a leg up with their series "Once and Again."
"We made a deal with Disney knowing they would be the main supplier of ABC," Mr. Herskovitz said. "What we felt was, at best, there was a statistical advantage in being with an in-house production company. By that I mean that, at some odd moment, when a decision is to be made about a show, and all the factors are equal, it would be of some benefit for a network to favor its own show." (ABC recently renewed "Once and Again" for another season.)
How this affects creative quality is difficult to assess. Network executives are hardly hacks. Aware that audiences are shrinking in favor of cable and the Internet, they are plainly struggling to come up with shows that are intelligent (NBC's "West Wing"), funny (Fox's "Malcolm in the Middle"), adult (ABC's "Once and Again") and even a bit risky (NBC's "Will and Grace"). And they insist that the demise of the independent producer -- and the rise of producing partnerships -- has not altered the creative landscape.
T HE fact that a producer is affiliated with a studio or a network doesn't mean that half of their brain died," said Mr. Braun of ABC. "Producers are better served by being with a network or a studio because the business is so economically challenging."
Mr. Braun denied that ABC goes out of its way to select Disney properties. "Certainly we'll be as aggressive as possible in building up our studios," he said. "But our mantra is to develop and put the best possible shows on the air, regardless of the source."
Similarly, Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, dismissed the notion that series and films have been diminished. "You think the creative aesthetic of David Kelley has changed one iota because he's under the Fox banner? Of course not."
An unfair example, perhaps. Hugely successful creator-producers like Mr. Kelley ("The Practice," "Ally McBeal") and Steven Bochco ("N.Y.P.D. Blue"), whose companies are now aligned with studios, are given creative carte blanche. Most independent producers are under seige.
Television was once dominated by powerhouse producers like Norman Lear, Aaron Spelling, Witt-Thomas-Harris, Carsey-Werner, Lorimar and others. By all accounts, some of the shows they made -- "Soap," "All in the Family," "Benson," "Maude," "Golden Girls" -- would probably not pass muster today. The lead characters would not fit snugly into the prized youth market: they are too old, too ethnic, too female. "Try doing a show today like 'Golden Girls,' about three older women," said one top network executive. "Good luck!"
Some of those producers, like Carsey-Werner-Mandabach and Mr. Spelling, still work in television, but their number has dwindled. When this reporter called Michael Jaffe, a well-known producer, and said he was doing an article about independent television producers, Mr. Jaffe replied, with some hyperbole: "You're doing a short story. There are only two of us left." Mr. Jaffe said there were probably only 10 producers making films for television, in contrast to 30 or 40 in the 80's.
But a handful of powerful producers has entered the field -- Basic Entertainment (formerly Brillstein-Grey), Regency Television and the Robert Greenblatt-David Janollari studio, among them. Artists Television Group, a newcomer, has made 12 pilots for the new season. All of which suggests that, despite changes wrought by the F.C.C. decision, there is work to go around.
Increasingly, producers are turning to the flourishing cable networks, where, as Variety reported last week, wealthy corporate parents like Time Warner and Viacom are willing to pay the costs of series and films. (A one-hour series on basic cable can cost about $1.3 million an episode, only slightly less than the $1.5 million price of a broadcast show; a two-hour cable film can cost $7 million to $10 million.)
"We embraced the new world," said Mr. Jaffe, whose company made more than a half-dozen films for cable last year. "The partnerships are somewhat complicated because it's all new business. We're paving the landscape as we go."
Ultimately, said Gail Berman, president of Regency Television, the producer of Fox's successful sitcom "Malcolm in the Middle," whether or not studios own series and films is not the issue. "The audience doesn't know, doesn't care about vertical integration," Ms. Berman said. The issue, she said, is a straightforward one. Without better programming, the viewers won't be there.

HEADLINE: A Cultural Jewel Is Gaining a New Setting

BYLINE: By E. KYLE MINOR 

 BODY:
THE intimate Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam has long been considered one of the state's brightest cultural jewels. It will soon need a new appraisal. The Tony Award-winning theater is on the verge of a $30 million expansion that will turn the quaint little town into a virtual musical-theater theme park.
"We've outgrown our current facilities," said Michael Price, Goodspeed's executive director since 1967. "This expansion will not only help us meet our growing needs but draw even more people to this part of the state than before." 
 A feasibility study is being conducted now, Mr. Price said, after which the project will be put out to bid. The expansion is expected to be completed by 2004 or 2005.
Goodspeed Opera House is known as the charming, Victorian theater where the Broadway hits "Man of La Mancha," "Annie" and "Shenandoah" were born. That original 398-seat theater will be surrounded by a new 650-seat theater and 30,000-square-foot production center.
The expansion will spill over to Main Street when nine local buildings owned by Goodspeed will be developed into retail stores, restaurants and residences for actors, designers and company members. Goodspeed will continue to own and operate the 200-seat Norma Terris Theater in nearby Chester, where new musicals are developed.
In granting Goodspeed its first installment of $2 million, the state proved its commitment to "polishing up one of our true gems," Gov. John G. Rowland recently said. "This helps create excitement in this part of the state."
Goodspeed, which sits on the Connecticut River, puts an estimated $25 million into the local economy. Once the expansion is completed in 2005, that figure could balloon to more than $60 million.
Mr. Price said that the first $2 million grant from the state will be used for buying a site for the new theater, conducting a traffic study, and commissioning a design for the venue. The money was released last month once Goodspeed raised $2 million to match the grant.
Mr. Rowland said that though there was no "magical formula," the state would add $10 million to the $20 million that Goodspeed would have to raise.
"It's been my experience that people want to be part of a success story," Mr. Rowland said. "They see project like this going up around them and they want to get involved. Tourism is up 40 percent now and the time is good to invest in the state's culture."
Mr. Rowland pointed out that the first thing he did in his administration was double spending for the arts. Other performing arts sites like the Warner in Torrington, the Palace in Waterbury, the Stamford Center for the Performing Arts and Polka Dot Playhouse in Bridgeport have benefited from the state's largesse.
"It's part of our overall plan," Mr. Rowland said, adding that he had also bolstered the schools' arts programs. "One of our calling cards is culture, so it makes sense to invest in it."
Selecting Goodspeed for expansion also has its political benefits since the demise of the Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company in Haddam Neck has cost the community.
"Financially, that did hurt some of the communities," Mr. Rowland said. "But that wasn't a factor in the plan to expand Goodspeed. It was Goodspeed's time.
"You look at this as investment," he said. "You're building morale. How do you value people going from Greenwich to Polka Dot Theater in Bridgeport? Everybody benefits."
The plan will allow Goodspeed to expand its production schedule. The new 650-seat theater will present four shows a season, simultaneously with the existing theater. Goodspeed presently offers three musicals in both of its theaters from April to December.
"We'll now be able to transfer shows to New York without having to redesign and build them," Mr. Price said. "The original opera house is much smaller than Broadway theaters and it is very expensive to move shows. We'll also be able to build shows for touring, which is something we've never done before."
Mr. Price said that the idea for the expansion came from a slightly wilder idea he had a few years ago. "I told the board of directors that I wanted to put a showboat in the river," he said. "The board liked the idea. Governor Rowland liked it. Then, the board thought about it and said, 'You want a showboat? Fine! We need a real theater first.' "
Mr. Price had no problem dry-docking his floating theater idea because he knew as well as anyone that the existing Goodspeed had outgrown itself.
"When I first came here it was me and a press agent. Now there's over 100 full-time employees," he said.
Many businesses undergoing expansion often lose their family feel. Mr. Price is confident that Goodspeed won't lose any of its charm.
"Theaters are by nature a mom and pop business," he said.
"They can't be run like corporations. I'm always around, keeping involved in all aspects of the business. Even though we're growing, we're still a family. We're just getting a larger house to live in."

HEADLINE: Another Threat to Nassau Residents' Taxes

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
Homeowners in much of Nassau County have already begun to dread Jan. 1, 2003, the deadline by which the county has agreed to reassess all residential property and revise tax rolls that are currently based on 1930's values. The agreement, reached in March, ended a high-profile lawsuit charging that the system discriminated against minorities.
But if near-term impact is what counts, there's another, less-publicized case that homeowners should be worrying about: a lawsuit by 38 Nassau County commercial property owners who allege they are being assessed more than their fair share of taxes. 
 If their suit is upheld -- and last month it survived a state and county effort to dismiss it -- more county taxes will have to be paid by all residential owners, steepening the 2003 tax increase in well-off neighborhoods and reducing or eliminating the post-assessment tax break expected in low-income areas.
"If Nassau County wants to reach a final resolution to its financial problems, it's going to have to resolve our case also," said one of the plaintiffs, Bennett L. Rechler, a principal of the We're Group in Jericho. "If we succeed in court, the county will lose a lot of revenue."
No court date has been set, but last month's ruling has the plaintiffs talking up an out-of-court settlement that could hit taxpayers a lot sooner than the 2003 revaluation.
Roger Tilles, co-director of the Tilles Investment Company in Woodbury and another plaintiff in the case, said one of the reasons for filing the suit was that county officials, fearing the political repercussions of revamping residential property taxes, would try to shift even more of the burden onto commercial property owners. "It's politically easier to raise the taxes on businesses that can't vote," he said.
In his decision last month rejecting the state and county challenges to the commercial owners' lawsuit, state Supreme Court Justice John DiNoto in Mineola pointed out that Nassau applied 1938 construction costs and 1964 land values to determine value when assessing residential property, but applied values derived from a 1986 revaluation when assessing commercial property. And he noted that though the county had imposed caps on annual residential property assessment increases, there were no such caps on commercial property.
"The result is that Nassau commercial property owners allegedly pay the highest effective tax rate in the state, namely $38.94 per thousand dollars of market value of property, as compared with the median for all counties, which is $25.82," he wrote. "Although commercial property represents only 16 percent of the market value of all property in Nassau County, commercial property owners purportedly pay 27.5 percent of the tax burden."
Justice DiNoto ruled that the "evidence was sufficient to raise a substantial issue as to whether the stated reason for singling out Nassau and New York City for Article 18 treatment was, and continues to be, rational."
Article 18, a state law passed in 1981 that applies only to New York City and Nassau County, allows commercial property to be taxed differently from commercial property. Delores Fredrich, special counsel for Nassau County, said that in seeking dismissal of the suit, the county argued that all it was doing was levying taxes in a manner prescribed by state law.
"The plaintiffs are not complaining that the law has been applied incorrectly," Ms. Fredrich said. "Their remedy is to change the law. If they do, we will abide by the change."
The attorney for the plaintiffs, former state Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell, said the judge had "sustained our principal contentions."
"We claim that there is no rational basis for creating a separate system and no reason to discriminate against Nassau commercial ratepayers, and the judge said we have a good claim," Mr. Koppell said. "The county and state are likely to appeal. But we think the county should consider settling with us. This is an opportune time because it has to complete its reassessment by 2003. So let's solve the whole problem and deal with the disparities of the commercial sector."
Mr. Rechler said there were various ways to correct the disparities, which he said had grown appreciably. He said commercial property owners would still end up with a greater tax burden than residential property owners, but "it would be less than what we are paying now."
A recent study by the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University found that effective real property tax rates increased in Nassau by 13.06 percent from 1997 to 1998, but declined during that period by 11.2 percent in Suffolk. Nassau's increase was the largest of the eight downstate counties.
"The residential effective tax rate in Nassau County was $18.40 per $1,000 of full value in 1998," said Thomas Conoscenti, a coauthor of the study. "That same year, the commercial effective tax rate was $44.03 per $1,000 of full value. In 1997, the residential rate was $17.45 and the commercial was $38.94. The difference between them that year was $21.20; a year later, it had increased to $26.63."
By contrast, the disparity in Suffolk was considerably less and actually declined in 1998, Mr. Conoscenti found.
Mr. Conoscenti said he believed there was merit to the assertion of Nassau's commercial property owners that they were bearing a disproportionately greater share of the tax burden in the county. He said his study found that the median effective real property tax rates for residential property owners in 1998 was $23.70 statewide, $20.17 in Suffolk and only $18.40 in Nassau.
At the same time, the median rates for commercial property owners were $27.67 in the eight downstate counties, $22.84 in Suffolk and $44.03 in Nassau.
"When you make those comparisons, you really see the striking differences," he said.
Bernard Hyman, a real estate evaluation specialist, said the tax burden on Nassau's commercial property owners had become "so onerous that it has made Nassau County a less desirable place for commercial owners to do business. The tremendous increase in the tax rate in recent years is because we have had very little new development to add to the tax base."
Mr. Tilles, whose company is one of the biggest developers in the region, said he had just put up a building in Woodbury where the taxes were about $6 per foot, fully assessed. But "just three miles down the road in Melville, I'm going to build a comparable building where the taxes will be under $3 a foot. And with the rent about $30 in both places, those in Woodbury will be paying 10 percent more. That's a huge disadvantage."
He said that because of a severe shortage in rental office space on Long Island, the higher rent had not made it more difficult to find tenants for the Woodbury property. But, he warned, "as soon as we go back to normal conditions, it will make a difference."
Mr. Hyman, managing partner of the powerful Certilman Balin Adler & Hyman law firm in East Meadow, said his firm represented nearly every major developer on Long Island and that they were all expanding in Suffolk because that county was "more amenable to development than Nassau. They are also providing all kinds of incentives. Nassau County is impossible."
But Carolyn Fahey, a business development specialist in the Suffolk County Department of Economic Development, said Suffolk was not trying to take advantage of the disparity by offering incentives different from Nassau's.
"We have a nonwritten verbal agreement that we are not going to do a direct hit on Nassau County," she said. "We're not going to raid each other's businesses. A company in eastern Nassau is as profitable to us with jobs and its whole economic impact as if it were in Melville."
And Lee E. Koppelman, executive director or the Long Island Regional Planning Board, questioned Mr. Hyman's assertions, saying that "every site that is available in Nassau County is at some stage of being developed. Fortunoff just completed The Source, Roosevelt Field is in the process of expanding, and there are proposals for new growth at the Roosevelt Raceway site. I haven't heard from any major developer who has said he is not building in Nassau because of the taxes."
He said it was natural for rents in Nassau to be more expensive than those in Suffolk because of Nassau's proximity to New York City. "With commercial development, location is everything," Dr. Koppelman said. And he added that there was more building going on in Suffolk because there was more available land there.
But he conceded that the "assessment situation in Nassau County is so anachronistic that it makes Nassau vulnerable to these suits. And the litigants have some legitimacy to their argument because the whole assessment system is out of whack. So the angels aren't just on one side of the argument."

HEADLINE: House Wine Gets Its Own Room;
And What a Room! From Big-Screen TV's to Tuscan Hardware, Cellars Are Getting Grander

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM 

 BODY:
FRED TREGASKIS, who builds wine cellars for a living, said he remembered when city restaurants were the sum total of his clientele. That was in the early 1990's. Now the West Cornwall contractor is more likely to find work at private homes in lower Fairfield and Westchester Counties.
Mr. Tregaskis, owner of New England Wine Cellars, said he built about 40 cellars last year, his biggest year ever. Design Build Consultants, a Greenwich builder of wine cellars, also said last year was its biggest. "Cellars have become the rage in new construction," Mr. Tregaskis said. "I've built several cellars in nice homes where the client wasn't an avid wine collector, but felt their home wasn't complete unless it had a wine cellar." 
 Or had a wine cellar with a wide-screen television or a spiral staircase, as some do. These cellars can also come with mood lighting, secret paneled entrances and antique decorative knickknacks.
"They want hand-forged hardware on their door and old-fashioned lighting," Mr. Tregaskis said. They also often want a medieval Italian look: "Tuscany. I hear that word all the time."
As both the cost of and demand for fine wine rise to unprecedented levels in the United States, with a record $18.1 billion of wine sold in 1999, having a place at home to store it safely has become a high priority for some.
Adam Strum, chairman of the Wine Enthusiast, a wine-accessory catalog company in Hawthorne, N.Y., said sales of its custom built cellars rose from 234 in 1998 to 397 last year. In the first quarter of this year, he said demand was more than double what it was at this time last year. Christine Hawley of Manhattan, who has designed cellars in Greenwich and the Hamptons, said the strong economy had a lot to do with it.
"The economy has been so good, people already have as many cars as they can drive, as many homes as they can go to," Ms. Hawley said. "One thing people haven't experienced is the newest pleasure left, which is wine cellars."
Once, not long ago, a wine cellar was thought of as a rack under the basement stairs. But today the trend is more in line with Tony Sanfilippo's home cellar in Westport, a 10-by-12-foot space with a tasting table, a tumbled-marble floor and a chandelier with colored glass cut to resemble a grapevine.
"It's somewhat in the eye of the beholder, but it does give me pleasure," Mr. Sanfilippo said. The cellar, which can hold close to 2,000 bottles, cost about $50,000 to build.
Matt Kramer, a columnist for Wine Spectator magazine and author of the "Making Sense" series of wine books, said the increase in cellars correlated with the rise in interest in drinking wine.
"The more people get involved with wine, the more they realize that storage matters," he said.
Paul Wyatt, a designer who runs the Fine Wine Rack and Cellar Company in San Carlos, Calif., which provides supplies for cellars around the country, said the greater New York area was one of six regions of the United States where the cellar market was strongest.
"Volume is going up every year," he said. "Periodically, I get so busy I can't see straight, so I raise my prices and volume goes up again."
Evan Goldenberg of Design Build Consultants attributed the strong demand to the rise in the stock market. Mr. Sanfilippo is executive vice president of the brokerage firm Knight/ Trimark Group of Jersey City, N.J., and among Mr. Goldenberg's other clients are many with similar connections to the world of finance.
Driving through the Round Hill section of Greenwich with Mr. Goldenberg can become monotonous as he points out various streets and calculates how many cellars he has built along each. Lawrence Calcano, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, hired Mr. Goldenberg to build a cellar with a 5,000-bottle capacity at his Greenwich home. He declined to say how much it cost, but said it provided "flexibility" in choosing wines for the right occasion.
"To me it's not that complicated," he said. "It's a real fun thing, a real social thing. It's great to be able to share your passion with family and friends."
William Driscoll, a forest-products industry executive in Riverside, a section of Greenwich, has a cellar with a 1,700-bottle capacity. Unostentatious, with a hunk of ledge rock coming out of the floor that Mr. Driscoll prizes for the added humidity, the cellar is "a great comfort," he said.
"Many times at the end of a busy day I just go in and close myself in," he said. "It's like going back to the womb."
The cellar also means that Mr. Driscoll doesn't have to rush to drink his finest bottles. "In the late 80's and early 90's, you were forced to drink California Cabernets too early because you didn't have the space to store them," he said.
Some higher-end clients want elaborate cabinets instead of racks for their bottles, creating what Mr. Goldenberg calls "a library for wine."
He said his projects tended to be expensive, largely because he works with sophisticated refrigeration equipment with temperature-sensitive alarm systems and low-voltage electronic controls.
"Things really started to pick up in 1996," he said. "Projects had been in the $25,000 to $35,000 range. Then they quickly graduated to the $45,000 to $55,000 range. I'd have clients call me to say they moved and needed a new wine cellar. I'd have other clients tell me they ran out of space and needed another wine cellar."
Perhaps the most unusual wine cellar in Connecticut is the commercial one Jed and Amie Benedict have created in Stafford. It is a former bomb shelter built during the cold war for record-keeping by Hartford banks and insurance companies. It comes with a 12-ton steel safe door, diesel generator, 3,000-gallon fuel tank, and rear escape hatch.
The Benedicts are marketing themselves to restaurants, liquor stores and private collectors willing to rent space for wine storage in the 100,000-square-foot cellar, now called Horse Ridge Cellars. Because the cellar is 15 feet underground, naturally cool and vibration-free, the Benedicts see wine storage as a natural fit. In addition, when it comes to long-term commercial wine storage, Ms. Benedict said, "there is nothing else in New England at all."
Mr. Benedict added: "This was built in 1962 for $330,000. Now if you wanted to do all this, the cost would be $2 million to $3 million. The walls, ceiling and floor are all two-foot thick steel-reinforced concrete."
So far, restaurants haven't signed up, but Horse Ridge has landed private collectors from Greenwich, Glastonbury and Avon.
While cellars can certainly be a conduit to exploring a personal passion, for others, they're a smart investment.
"They're a very hot item now," said David Ogilvy, who owns a real estate firm in Greenwich. "What sells houses are things like condition and master bedrooms, but a wine cellar is a really nice piece of cake."
Wine cellars can pay off in other ways. David Koch, executive vice president of Koch Industries, a company in Wichita, Kan., whose South Hampton, N.Y., cellar was designed by Ms. Hawley, noted that many of the wines he had stored had gone up in value three or four times since he purchased them 10 years ago. "I may get enough off these bottles to justify the original cost of the cellar," he said.
Michael Davis, head of the North American wine department at Sotheby's International, said: "A lot of people are keeping wine as an investment, and they are doing quite well. What I see is the ideal cycle of wine collecting. As wines mature, people prune their cellar. A cellar can become self-funding that way, by selecting things as they reach their level of maturity and reinvesting in young wines."
Private collectors said the economics make sense.
"All you have to do is look at the auction world," said David Pedowitz, an investment adviser from Bedford, N.Y., with a 5,000-bottle cellar Mr. Goldenberg built for $75,000. "The finest wines are now outrageously expensive because of the supply and demand curves. You have to search for the supply, and supply is only going to come from people storing wines."
Ms. Hawley said she believed that wine collecting was about more than drinking or investing. It can provide entree into a world where one becomes a "connoisseur of life."
"When you start building a cellar, a lot of things change in your life," she said. "You think about going to wine countries for vacations. You start going to wine auctions. Your friends change, because you're more focused on people who love wine. Your diet changes, because you want food that goes with your wine. It's like having a baby. I see people get so energized and focused."

A Rental Apartment Tower Is Rising in Fort Lee

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: FORT LEE

 BODY:
FOR years a derelict garage was all that stood on the 4.8 acre-site along the Palisades cliffs here, a symbol of a stalled condominium development from the late 1980's.
"It basically had become an eyesore," said Fort Lee's mayor, Jack Alter. The site is one of the last large developable parcels in Fort Lee. 
 But new owners bought the site 18 months ago, with plans to turn it into a $100 million rental complex called the Palisades. It will have 438 apartments in a 29-story L-shaped building, 80 apartments in a separate 12-story building that also houses a garage, with 20 town houses on its roof. Nearly all of the one- to three-bedroom units will have views of the George Washington Bridge, a quarter of a mile to the north, as well as of the river and the Manhattan skyline beyond.
The garage will accommodate 1,000 cars, and it will be crowned by a 1.4-acre landscaped plaza. The site is bounded by River Road, Parker Avenue, Old Palisades Road and Massa Lane.
The Palisades is being developed by the Applied Development Company of Hoboken, with Vornado Realty Trust of Saddle Brook as its financial partner. In addition to the partners' own equity, financing is coming from a consortium of five banks.
Allen F. Goldman, a senior vice president of Applied, said his company was undeterred by the site's development history.
"There is no doubt about the strength of the housing market in Bergen County in general and in Fort Lee in particular," Mr. Goldman said. "Every major condo and co-op building in the borough is filled, and there is an equally strong demand for rentals."
The project, which is expected to be completed in 18 months, will be the second large new rental complex in Fort Lee. The 351-unit Avalon Crest opened in late 1998. Its seven four-story buildings are fully occupied, said Gary Steinfield, the vice president for development at the Princeton office of AvalonBay, the developer.
Together, Avalon Crest and the Palisades are the first new rental developments to rise in the 2.5-square-mile borough of Fort Lee in 25 years.
Beginning in the late 80's, the site of the Palisades was involved in a tangle of litigation, which ended last year. Applied bought the site in July 1998 from a developer that never proceeded with its its plan to build condominiums.
That developer, Haseko (New York Inc.), owned by the Haseko Corporation of Tokyo, and the borough hammered out an agreement in 1994 after seven years of litigation over the number of units to be built on the site and where. To avoid blocking other buildings' views, the new tower, designed by Costas Kondylis, the Manhattan architect, will rise on the northern corner of the site. Mr. Kondylis had also designed the unrealized condo project but has revised the interior to create larger apartments for the Palisades.
Applied is to follow the terms of the agreement, which was the result of a lawsuit filed by Haseko against Fort Lee in 1987. Haseko contended that the borough's zoning violated the State Supreme Court's Mount Laurel doctrines, which require municipal zoning to include sites for housing for people of all incomes. By the time Applied entered the scene, that agreement had been the subject of two subsequent lawsuits.
The first suit went all the way to State Supreme Court, and it was decided in favor of the development. A similar suit in Superior Court, contending that the challenge to the rezoning of the site to permit a residential tower had been improperly dismissed, ended in an out-of-court settlement last year, said Mr. Goldman of Applied. The project received final site plan approval from the borough in January.
AS part of the 1994 agreement, Applied contributed $800,000 to the borough and will also build 60 rental apartments in a separate building for tenants with low and moderate incomes, up to $69,504 a year. Construction of that five-story building on Kaufer Lane, about three blocks north of the Palisades project, must meet a timetable set out in the agreement or Applied will be subject to fines.
Looking back, Mayor Alter said: "This project is something we agreed to and will not affect the neighboring buildings, preserving their views and presumably their values."
Of its impact on schools and traffic, he said, "You can't legislate against school-age children."
Peggy Thomas, the borough's administrator, said, "Only time will tell the ultimate impact."
Certainly, the development will bring more cars. But Mayor Alter said that traffic in the borough, which he called the state's most heavily traveled community, is a persistent problem because of the bridge.
The Palisades is indicative of the renewed interest in building rental apartments in the state, where such construction has inched upward since 1995. Of the 36,600 housing permits issued in the state last year, 5,915 were for rental units, according to preliminary state figures. In 1995 there were 28,895 permits issued, of which 3,483 were for rentals.
Evidence of that increase is the spate of rental towers that are, or soon will be, sprouting along New Jersey's 18 miles of Hudson River shoreline, anchored in the north by Fort Lee.
"Despite the new construction, the rental market has tightened up big time," said Nathan Slovin, the executive vice president of the New Jersey Apartment Association, in East Brunswick. The statewide vacancy rate is under 5 percent, he said.
With New Jersey's economy strong and new businesses, and employees, coming into the state, he estimates there is a shortfall of about 10,000 rental units. The most acute shortage is rentals "for regular working people," Mr. Slovin said, noting that the scarcity and high cost of properly zoned land, as well as increasing construction costs, are pushing rents for new apartments into the luxury category.
Also spurring the demand for rentals is the ripple effect from Manhattan, where soaring rents are prompting some tenants to turn to close-in and less expensive New Jersey locations, like Fort Lee and other riverfront towns.
Mr. Goldman of Applied, an active riverfront developer, offered another reason. Some people are looking for "more flexibility in their lives and have no desire to commit to purchasing housing," he said. All those reasons and the fact "that there is virtually no rental housing in Fort Lee," he said, convinced him to proceed with the Palisades project.
The borough's rental supply is puny: of its 15,000 housing units, only about 2,300 are rentals. In the conversion frenzy of the late 70's and early 80's, 41 rental apartment buildings were converted to co-ops or condos.
Charles Oppler, a partner in Oppler-Ketive Realtors in Fort Lee, said that a high-rise luxury rental, with views, services and amenities, "could fill a niche" in the market.
At the Palisades the apartments will have 900 to 1,900 square feet of space and such features as marble-tile baths, washers and dryers and large windows to take advantage of the views, Mr. Goldman said. The tower will have a facade of red, orange and beige brick, and along with the garage and landscaped plaza, other amenities will include a children's playroom, a health club and a library.
Monthly rents have not been set, but Mr. Goldman said that if the building were completed today, apartments would rent for $30 a square foot on average. That would come to $2,250 a month for a 900-square-foot one-bedroom and $4,750 for a 1,900-square-foot three-bedroom.
Mr. Oppler said those rents would be 10 percent higher than those for existing rental apartments in the area. "What the developers are counting on," he said, "is that their project is the only game in town."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
For Affordable New Houses, Go East, Young Buyers

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: YAPHANK

 BODY:
IN this still-rural enclave of Suffolk County where woods and fields have not yet given way to surburban sprawl, Uri Hason and his partner, Avi Sharabani, are carving a 76-house subdivision out of the scrub oak forest. Starting prices of $184,900 for a three-bedroom ranch and a top price of $237,900 for 2,000-square-foot, four-bedroom colonial are giving young couples buying their first homes a chance to get into the housing market.
Pinewood Manor, as the 102-acre Yaphank project is called, and similarly priced developments springing up in eastern Suffolk belie the general belief that Long Island is no longer a place where first-time buyers can afford to buy new housing. 
 These projects, which are pushing as far east as Riverhead, are reminiscent of residential developments of the 1960's when Levitt & Sons and other pioneering builders ventured out to what were then untapped areas like Hauppauge and bought inexpensive land to build housing for young families just starting out.
Over the 40 years since then, prices have increased tenfold, and young couples now usually need hefty down payments and two incomes to meet mortgage costs. And now the new frontiers are Yaphank, Middle Island, Manorville and Moriches, but the appeal is the same: three- and four-bedroom moderately priced houses in new developments.
At Pinewood Manor there is a choice of six different styles. The $184,900 ranch has 1,300 square feet of living area and a one-car garage. The largest house, a $234,900 colonial, has four bedrooms, 2,350 square feet and a two-car garage. Basements are included in the price. Also available is a three-bedroom, 1,350-square-foot high ranch priced at $189,900; its 1,100-square-foot windowed lower level can be finished at a future time.
Contracts have been signed for 45 houses since sales began less than four months ago, and of these, 40 percent are being purchased by first-time buyers, said Mr. Hason, whose company, Pinewood Development, is in Hicksville.
Marilyn Larsen, the owner of Lane Realty in Great Neck, which is handling sales at Pinewood Manor, said, "These developments are still catering to the affordable level." With a 5 percent down payment of $9,200 and taxes of $6,000 a year, a buyer purchasing the $184,900 ranch could carry the $1,880 monthly mortgage cost with an annual family income of $68,000.
Among the people buying homes at Pinewood Manor are Brian Curry, 27, a sales representative for a health insurance company, and his fiancee, Kelly O'Brien, also 27, a conductor on the Long Island Rail Road. They selected a $221,000, four-bedroom, 2,350-square-foot Victorian that will give them room for a home office and enough bedrooms for the family they want to raise.
"We both have good jobs, and we have been living in our parents' homes so we were able to build up some savings," Mr. Curry said. With a 20 percent down payment, they estimate that their monthly mortgage payments, including taxes, will be about $1,925.
"People in our situation not only can find a better deal out east, but I also love it out there," Mr. Curry said. Although his office is in Uniondale, a laptop computer, fax machine and modem will allow him to work out of his new home most days of the week.
The Beechwood Organization of Jericho, whose two principals are Michael Dubb and Leslie A. Lerner, is building 307 houses in a development called Country Pointe at Manorville. Mr. Dubb said that although Manorville may seem far out, it takes only 30 minutes to drive from there to the Melville office corridor and even less time to travel to large employers like Computer Associates International in Islandia and Symbol Technologies in Holtsville.
Two of the 10 different house styles being offered at Country Pointe, a 1,900-square-foot four-bedroom colonial costing $229,900 and a 2,100-square-foot four-bedroom colonial costing $239,900, were specifically designed for young couples starting out, Mr. Dubb said. A 1,500-square-foot three-bedroom ranch that was expected to appeal mostly to older couples with grown children is also attracting first-time buyers because of its $199,900 price. In the first month of sales, 25 contracts have been signed, and of those deals, 60 percent were by first-time buyers, he said.
Jennifer and Richard Peck, both 30, who are buying the $229,900 colonial, both work in eastern Suffolk, Mrs. Peck as a vice president of an insurance company in Holtsville and Mr. Peck as a service representative for an industrial equipment and supplies company in Bohemia. Until now, they have been renting a one-bedroom apartment in Centereach for $700 a month.
Taking on a house that will cost them close to $2,000 a month is "a bit scary," Mrs. Peck said, "but we felt it was time to move on to something that we own, and we definitely want to stay on Long Island, where we both grew up and where we have our family and friends."
Builders say that they can continue to build houses in the $190,000-to-$230,000 price range only as long as land prices in these outlying areas don't increase sharply, as they have farther west.
Prices, although still relatively modest, have gone up at last 20 percent in the last two years, said Jack and Frank Campo of Port Jefferson, two land developers who assemble approved subdivisions for sale to builders. Subdivision lots in Yaphank that sold for $50,000 in 1998 now cost as much as $65,000, Jack Campo said, "and by next year I expect prices to go to $70,000."
BUT that is still considerably below land prices to the west. For example, Lennard Axinn, a partner in Island Estates in Ronkonkoma, said he is planning to sell houses in a 45-lot subdivision called Island Estates at Historic Yaphank at starting prices of $279,000 for 2,000 square feet and four bedrooms. A similar house would have cost $100,000 more in Melville, he said, because of higher land costs.
Other developers have had similar experiences. At a subdivision called Windemere Pointe at Moriches, the Windemere Development Corporation of Hauppauge is building 90 houses priced from $219,000 for a 1,600-square-foot ranch to $259,000 for a 2,600-square-foot colonial. The lots are one acre in size. "I've sold similar houses in the Huntington area for almost twice that because land costs are so much higher there," said Eric Friedlander, Windemere's president.
The Park Ridge Organization of Ronkonkoma is building 109 houses in Middle Island at a development called the Preserve. Prices there start at $181,000 for a 1,400-square-foot three-bedroom ranch and go to $260,000 for a 2,750-square-foot colonial. One-car garages are included, but basements are optional and add $10,000 to the cost of a house. "You can no longer go to communities like Huntington, Smithtown and Commack and buy land that allows you to build at these prices," said Charles B. Mancini, vice president of the company. Eighty houses have been placed under contract or sold since sales began a year ago, Mr. Mancini said, and about 75 percent involve first-time buyers.
Developers say that they would build many more houses geared to this market if they could find land at a low enough price or if they could increase the number of houses per acre.
"That's one of the best markets to be in because it's always viable even in bad economic times," said Mr. Dubb of the Beechwood Organization.
And moderate prices bring buyers out in force. Since sales began in February at a development of attached houses in Oakdale, 50 of the 67 houses have been placed under contract, all purchased from plans and computer images.
The development called Willow Wood at Greenwood at Oakdale is being built by the Klar Organization of East Meadow on 22 acres that the company bought in 1988 when land costs were much lower. "When we bring out a development, we look at our costs and ask what can we bring it in at to make it affordable," said Steven A. Klar, the company's president.
The starting price at Willow Wood is $189,990 for a 1,800-square-foot two-bedroom town house. The most expensive is a three-bedroom town house with 2,160 square feet, selling for $229,990.
After two years of searching for a home, Kristina and Charles Poakeart found it at Willow Wood. They are buying a three-bedroom town house for $205,000. With a 20 percent down payment, their monthly costs including taxes will be around $1,850. They are currently living in a 400-square-foot one-bedroom apartment in Bethpage, "which we outgrew five minutes after we moved in," said Ms. Poakeart, 29, a network analyst for a book publisher in New York. Mr. Poakeart, 30, is the manager of a travel agency in Commack.
Because of the housing costs on Long Island, they were tempted at one time to move to Arizona, an area they had explored while on vacation. Housing costs there are so much lower -- $140,000 for a nice house and much lower taxes, Ms. Poakeart said.
But staying on Long Island won out. "I got a new job," she said, "and my husband got a promotion."

HEADLINE: Road Rage, A New Jersey State of Mind

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
CALL it chutzpah -- if you want to keep it clean. When you think about it, most of the people who put down New Jersey drivers are New Yorkers.
Take New York cabbies, who can always be counted on to yell, "#@%&x*# JERSEY DRIVER!" That is, when they speak in English.
Not only do New Jersey's 5.8 million licensed drivers get no respect, they're made to feel guilty about using their 6.4 million vehicles. Environmentalists tell them they're depleting the ozone layer and demand that they take public transit -- something in New Jersey that doesn't always get you there from here -- and planners tell them their dream of more highway elbow room doesn't ease congestion but only contributes to sprawl. 
 Rather than being reviled, perhaps the New Jersey driver should be pitied, comforted and -- yes -- even admired for the way he or she faces a staggering number of obstacles and dangers every day, not the least of which are those fellow New Jersey drivers.
"I love living in New Jersey, where you see the state bird whenever you cut someone off on the highway," says Peggy Boyce, a stand-up comic. "There's so much road rage in New Jersey I had a bumper sticker made that says 'Tony Soprano on Board.' "
And why not? The New Jersey driver still pays the among the highest insurance rates, coughs up the most money for tolls after New York state and has to get up earlier and earlier to make the Hudson River crossings on the morning commute to Manhattan.
Other gripes: Toll increases on the New Jersey Turnpike. The 134,000 trucks that drive on the state's highways every day. Confusing and unreadable signs.
Not to mention the glacial implementation of E-ZPass. It's coming. It's not coming. It will be operational on the whole Garden State Parkway by June -- in time for the annual migration to the shore. Um, make that in time for the change of autumn foliage. (Get out a lawn chair and find yourself a spot on the median; it's going to be a long wait at the toll booths this summer.)
Congestion has become so bad -- in part because of the economic boom -- that James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, quips, "If your greatest ambition in life is to be stuck in traffic gridlock, this is a great time to be a New Jerseyan."
But perhaps the problem that most infuriated drivers was the implementation last December of a new privatized auto emissions inspection system that broke down because of equipment failures and staff shortages and left drivers fuming in inspection lines for as long as five hours.
What's a driver to do? Well, bask in the reflected glory, since New Jersey can take credit for the cloverleaf interchange, the drive-in theater and the Jersey barrier (the concrete center barrier, first erected on Route 22 in Plainfield in the late 1940's and now used all over the world, according to John Dourgarian, a spokesman for the State Department of Transportation).
These days, Mr. Dourgarian noted, those cloverleafs are connecting many of the 34,000 miles of highway on which 60 billion vehicle miles travel every year. That, according to the New Jersey Almanac, is close to four times the national average.
On top of that, three reports made public in the last two months show that New Jerseyans drive more often -- and earlier in the day -- than most motorists. And, of course, they spend a lot of the time just sitting.
James P. Dolan, Jr. a stockbroker from Mahwah, in upper Bergen County, who began driving into Manhattan about 30 years ago, said there wasn't much to do when he got tied up in traffic at the George Washington Bridge. "I sat and listened to the radio," he said.
That is, listened to the radio and made plans. "The only solution was to buy a place in Manhattan or continue to move my schedule up an hour," he added. So last year, he bought an apartment on the East Side, where he often stays during the week.
A survey released last month by the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, which oversees federal transportation spending in the state's 13 northern counties, and the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, showed that people in the metropolitan area -- including four suburban New York counties and Fairfield and New Haven in Connecticut, used their cars for 85 percent of their trips over an 18-month period.
People in Hunterdon County, for instance, used their vehicles for 90 percent of their trips; 89 percent in Morris County; 87 in Passaic, and 86 in Bergen and Union. At least 70 percent of all trips were made within a driver's home county. Bergen, the state's most populous county, led the state in the number of car trips, 3.1 million a day or 3.7 rides per person.
So it's a kind of "which came first" question. Maybe the New Jersey driver loves his car, or maybe he doesn't have a choice. Whatever the answer, transportation officials say the results highlight a severe need for expanded and affordable mass transit.
Last month, a report made public by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said traffic backups at bridge and tunnel crossings into Manhattan from New Jersey have started even earlier in the mornings and gotten worse in recent years, in part because of the booming economy, flexible hours, and a desire to get a jump on the day. From 1996 to 1999, traffic between 5 and 6 a.m. increased 32 percent at the Holland Tunnel, 39 percent at the Lincoln Tunnel and 42 percent at the the George Washington Bridge.
"Progressively, over the last five years, it's gotten to where there's as much traffic at 6:15 a.m. as there used to be at 7 a.m.," said Mr. Dolan, who now has to leave his home at 5:30 a.m. when he's not staying in the city. "Now when I drive in I try to be at the toll plaza no later than 6 a.m. Everybody's time frame has moved up an hour just to get to the same place."
He cautioned, "If you get there at 7 now, you're going to add another 45 minutes to your commute."
A study from the New Jersey Institute of Technology in March showed that New Jersey drivers spend an average of 34 hours a year stalled in traffic at a cost of $4.9 billion -- or $880 per driver in terms of man-hours away from their jobs. A total of 72 gallons of gas per driver a year is wasted.
The average driver in Somerset County -- recently labeled a part of Wealth Belt, where many of the expensive new homes have a BMW and a Land Rover in the driveway -- spent the most time staring out the window and breathing fumes, 74 hours each year, while his Bergen County counterpart sat fuming 62 hours. So much for a nice trip in the country.
In the life of New Jersey drivers, each one of these car trips can be transformed from the routine to the ridiculous -- from chickens crossing Morris Avenue to dogs wandering onto the Garden State Parkway in Kenilworth during morning the rush hour, knotting up traffic -- and some fenders -- for miles.
Such accidents -- 265,000 were reported in 1998 -- can play havoc with the Sunday driver or the semi operator. That was the case a few months ago when a tractor-trailer went out of control in Teaneck, overturning and blocking a busy ramp onto Interstate 95 that feeds northbound traffic onto Route 80 West. Traffic was stalled for three hours.
The largest traffic jam to occur on the parkway took place in April 1995 when a fast-moving brush fire in the Pine Barrens burned on both sides of the road near the Barnegat Toll Plaza, said Dennis Ingoglia, a spokesman for the parkway. It backed up traffic for nine miles and took about two hours for traffic to just start moving again.
"It's a nightmare," said Morgan Borin, a pharmaceutical saleswoman from Ramsey, in Bergen County. "I see an accident at least once a week on the Parkway."
Mrs. Borin, who estimates she travels 200 miles a day throughout Essex and Union, said, "I think people are driving more aggressively, and it seems there's always construction on the main roads, and that makes it worse."
But at least there is the landscaping. Sort of. Workers on the parkway say they have have found everything from beach balls to furniture, including a piano, decorating the shoulder.
And if isn't the flotsam and jetsam, it's the smell.
Mrs. Borin's husband, Frank, said he especially dislikes traveling on the stretch of turnpike around Newark and Elizabeth -- "a very difficult roadway" -- because of the unpleasant stew of cars and belching trucks going to Port Elizabeth, the airport and landfills in the area. Getting in and out of the airport is another "nightmare," he said, in part because of confusing signs and lack of parking.
"Once you pay your parking fee and you're leaving the airport, you have to know exactly where you're going, because it's confusing getting on the turnpike or 78," Mr. Borin said. "There's a lot of construction; the roads get very narrow; and it's not well lit. And it seems it's gotten progressively worse." Ms. Boyce, the comic,, says she goes out of her way to avoid the turnpike. "I had a gig at Rutgers a couple years ago, was coming home late and sort of got sandwiched in between two, huge speeding trucks and couldn't get out," Ms. Boyce said. "It's just very intimidating."
Though truck traffic is heavy on major thoroughfares like the turnpike, it has become a little less intimidating on secondary roads since New Jersey last year restricted large trucks from using many local roads unless they're making pick-ups or deliveries.
Increased truck shipments are just one result of the extraordinary economic growth, which has also contributed to 465,000 jobs in the state since 1992, Mr. Hughes said. "It has put a strain on the infrastructure that has only had minimum improvements," he said.
Oh, not that New Jersey has not tried its hand at improving the snarls and sneers and shouting and slowdowns. For one thing, officials say tie-ups at toll plazas are expected to ease when E-ZPass is in full operation -- although a sluggish start and logistical proglems have left New Jersey as the monkey in the middle of the Northeast megalopolis. It has been implemented in stages on the Parkway as far south as the Raritan toll plaza and is in operation on the Atlantic City Expressway.
How convenient it will be is one thing, but John McElligott, an engineer from Ridgewood, says he may buy an E-ZPass just for self-preservation.
"I've come out of toll booths on the Parkway after stopping to pay a toll and almost been hit by someone coming through the E-ZPass lane at 30 miles an hour," Mr. McElligott said.
Stephen G. Carrellas, state coordinator of the National Motorists Association, said a high-speed entry system for E-ZPass users was a good idea If fact, Mr. Carrellas said, if more than two-thirds of the state's motorists had the electronic cards in their cars that allowed equipment to record their passage, most toll barriers could be removed -- a notion that has been discussed for years.
"The good news about E-ZPass being delayed is it will prevent the toll increase on the Turnpike to the end of the year," said Mr. Carrellas, referring to a 20 percent percent toll increase for non-EZPass users to be enacted when the E-ZPass becomes operative on that road.
Driving in New Jersey is indeed a challenge. But isn't it true that the most challenging courses -- in golf at least -- are the most expensive? Well, same here, speedo.
William Visser, manager of Public and Government Services for AAA of North Jersey in Wayne, said drivers used to complain much more about paying among the highest automobile insurance premiums in the nation, but piped down a bit after the state imposed mandatory 15 percent reductions last spring.
More recently, Mr. Visser said, they complained about the new emissions inspection system that got off to a sputtering start last December. "We got more complaints about that than anything in recent history," he said. "Nobody likes to sit in line, and those lines never should have happened."
On Jan. 26, Governor Whitman ordered the new test stopped at 15 of the the state's 32 inspection stations. But last month, the more stringent inspection procedure was reinstituted in six stations, and is expected to be in full operation by month's end. By the way, at 9:15 a.m. last Monday at the Paramus station, the posted waiting time was 40 minutes. At the Lodi station,, it was 75 minutes.
"We had a crush at the end of the month and at the beginning of the month," said Mr. Dourgarian. "But generally speaking, last week the average waiting time was half an hour."
The next major gripe for drivers could be having to pump their own gas. Senator Gerald Cardinale, a Bergen Republican, said drivers could save five cents a gallon, gas up faster and only pay a five-cent differential for full service.
But people like Robert Hallbauer, a retired quality engineer from Edison, insists most people don't want to pump their own gas, particularly in bad weather. Mr. Hallbauer questioned the savings in terms of both time and money.
"It's more like 10 to 20 cents in other states, when you can find full-serve stations," he said. "In high-risk areas where you have a gas station where they don't trust you, you have to prepay and then go out and pump your gas. Then you go back in and stand behind somebody buying something. It's not a time saver."
Not a time saver? Then step on it. Since spring 1998, 65 miles per hour has been the speed limit on 475 miles of highway. After an 18-month study, the state found that the total number of accidents in those zones were up 18 percent. although fatalities were down 8 percent. Next step: another 18-month study.
Just last Monday, a stricter seat belt law went into effect allowing the police to stop and ticket motorists for not wearing their belts. "I think the New Jersey driver is very able to cope with situations," Mr. Visser of AAA said.
And apparently New Jersey drivers are better driver than their New York counterparts give them credit for. "Eighty-eight percent of all New Jersey licensed drivers have no points on their driving record," Mr. Dourgarian said.
You know those aggressive New Yorkers, though. They probably thought points were good.

HEADLINE: Bringing a Town House Back Full Circle

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
JEFFERY AND FAITH LARSEN of Greenwich, Conn., have been anticipating life in an empty nest, now that their children are 14 and 15 years old. So they have decided to move to a new nest. That nest, it turns out, will be an old one, a four-story town house on East 62nd Street built in 1870 and expanded to five stories in 1919.
When the Larsens move in -- the target date is January -- they will join a small but impassioned band of city dwellers who are bringing town houses full circle back to their origins as single-family homes after decades of being subdivided into apartments. Projects like the Larsens' require stamina, determination -- and more than likely a great deal of money. 
 Mr. Larsen, the chief executive of ICor Brokerage Inc., a four-month-old company that offers business-to-business online brokerage services, said that he paid more than $2 million for the house and estimated that the renovation costs would probably hit $1.5 million.
Last month, 10 studio apartments in the building and a duplex that once housed an art gallery were demolished. In addition, the facade will be rebuilt to its original state, a step that has gotten the required approval of the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
"It was really ugly, and now it will be really beautiful," Mr. Larsen said. "I want to bring it back to the look and feel of a block in a historical district."
Restoring the house to exactly what it was in 1870 is an almost impossible task, though. "Because a fifth floor was added, we can't make it look exactly is it did, so we must be innovative," Mr. Larsen said. "We are putting on a mansard roof with two dormers."
That the Larsens have seized a rare opportunity is clear, but just how rare is impossible to measure.
No definitive figures exist for the number of town houses in the city. A computer analysis of city property records by The New York Times, using descriptions that would suggest town houses, found 4,400 buildings in Manhattan and 15,200 in Brooklyn that fell within the parameters. Those figures were arrived at by counting the number of residential buildings of three to five stories on lots less than 25 feet wide. The buildings had no more than 12 units and were built before 1905, after which few town houses were constructed in Manhattan.
Other estimates vary widely. For example, figures taken from the city's Department of Finance by the Real Estate Board of New York put the total number in Manhattan at 1,386, a mere sliver of the borough's residential market, which includes 200,000 co-ops and 65,000 condominiums, according to the board's estimate. For Brooklyn, Steven Knobel, the executive vice president of Mitchell, Maxwell & Jackson, an appraisal firm, said, "Our guess is that there are somewhere around 45,000 town houses."
Last year, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, 145 town houses changed hands in Manhattan. The single-family town house is experiencing a something of a renaissance, a trend that has been accelerating in recent years, brokers say, bringing back a style of gracious living in buildings that don't soar to the sky and dwarf their neighbors.
"For a time the single-family house in Manhattan became almost extinct," said Tim Desmond, a town house broker at Stribling & Associates. "In the 1920's, with the advent of big apartment buildings, apartment living came into vogue, and houses went out of favor. That left housing stock that was chopped up into 4 to 12 units."
Many of the apartments in buildings with three or more units were subject to rent control or rent stabilization, limiting the profits the landlord could reap. After 1986, they lost even more luster as investments, when federal tax laws were changed to significantly restrict their use as tax shelters. But other factors were emerging to make the single-family house a diamond on the market, although sometimes a diamond in the rough. Those factors include a soaring economy, a dwindling supply of large prewar co-ops and a growing resistance to what some prospective buyers describe as the tyranny of co-op boards.
"Now we are again in a gilded age in New York, but unlike the turn of the century, there is no vacant land, so people are reconverting these buildings," said Frederick W. Peters, the president of Ashforth Warburg Associates.
Brokers say that their clients have numerous motives. "With a different perception of safety in the city, people who might not have thought of doing it 10 years ago are today, and people who 10 years ago might not have been in a position to utilize the entire house are now," said George W. van der Ploeg, a vice president at Alice F. Mason Ltd.
"We are seeing a trend toward larger, more opulent houses," he said. "A town house is probably 5,000 square feet, bigger than most apartments, and that makes a statement. In addition, some people chafe at the concept of the co-op board having so much power, from approving the buyer to approving the renovation."
And, many brokers say, compared with the square footage of a co-op or condominium, a town house offers a bargain.
"You get a lot more bang -- or space -- for the buck," said Barbara Fox, the president of the Fox Residential Group. "Say you live in a 20-foot-wide house that is 60 feet deep. For five floors, that gives you 6,000 square feet. You would have to have an immense apartment to equal that. Plus you probably get a garden in the back, you may get a terrace, and you can improve the roof and have a sun deck. It is not cheap, but it is a lot cheaper than getting the same interior and exterior space in a co-op."
The trend seems to have no geographical limits. In Manhattan, houses are being snapped up on the East and West Sides, uptown and downtown, from Harlem to Greenwich Village.
"There are no undesirable neighborhoods for this in Manhattan," Mr. Peters said, but he did agree that there are some blocks that command special attention. "Notoriously, the most desirable street is 70th Street between Park and Lex. It is famous for some incredibly beautiful buildings."
In Brooklyn, where town houses have long been dominant in some neighborhoods, the market is surging as well. Brooklyn Heights, the oldest landmarked district in the country, commands the highest prices, $2 million to $3.5 million, said Christopher Thomas, a senior vice president and the sales director for William B. May in Brooklyn. "And we are doing a lot of business in neighborhoods we didn't go into three years ago, like Fort Greene and Clinton Hill," he said. In Fort Greene houses are going for $700,000 to $1 million.
Melinda Magnett, the president of the Corcoran Group in Brooklyn, said: "Prices are soaring here, though they are nowhere near those in Manhattan. A vice president of Juno.com and his wife who are now renting on the Upper East Side are buying the first-ever million-dollar brownstone in Clinton Hill and converting it to a single-family."
The demand has led, not surprisingly, to bidding wars. Richard Steinberg, managing director of Ashforth Warburg, put a single-family house at 161 East 62nd Street on the market last month for $3,150,000. "Within four hours I had three full-price offers," he said. "We went to sealed bids and sold it over the asking price by $150,000." Should the deal fall through, he said he had two backup offers in hand.
Mr. Steinberg is also the representative for Premiere Properties of Manhattan, a company owned by a British investor, Michael Cannon.
"He knew there was a shortage in the New York market of high-end single-family homes, so two years ago he decided to buy multiunit buildings as long as they could be delivered vacant, renovate them and resell them," Mr. Steinberg said. "So far, he has done two, including a building on East 66th Street that he bought for $3,750,000 and sold for $7,250,000."
From the buyer's perspective, the single most critical consideration in the decision to convert a town house that contains four or more units is whether those apartment are occupied and whether they are rent-controlled or rent-stabilized.
Tenants who are not protected by rent control or stabilization can be legally evicted at the end of their leases. To evict a rent-controlled tenant, the owner must obtain an order from the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal verifying the owner's compelling need for the apartment and then must start court proceedings.
Stabilized tenants are protected, too, but Housing Court can authorize evictions at the end of the lease if the apartment is to be occupied by the owner or an immediate member of the family. People age 62 and over or people with disabilities may not be evicted from a stabilized apartment on the grounds of the owner's need for it unless the landlord provides a comparable apartment nearby at the same or lower rent.
With all these conditions standing as potential barriers to the full conversion of a town house, many prospective buyers make it a condition of sale that the building be empty, and many sellers make payments to tenants to move.
Steve Mark, a general contractor who bought a 10,000-square-foot mansion at 8 East 77th Street for himself and his family of six, did that when his bid on the building was accepted. "When we bought it, it had three or four tenants, and our contract was subject to its being vacant," he said. "We gave the seller six months and then could have broken the contract. There was one holdout, so we gave another three months, but they had to pay him $250,000."
H OUSES converted to single-family status by previous owners or ones that can be emptied by the sellers are worth significantly more than those with tenants in residence. Sara Gelbard, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group who specializes in Greenwich Village, Chelsea and Gramercy Park, recently closed on a house in Chelsea with a duplex apartment and two floor-throughs for $1,750,000, a sum she described as unusually low. "Two doors down there is a house on the market that has been renovated for single-family with an asking price of $2.6 million," she said.
"My recommendation is never to buy anything with the intention of kicking people out," she added. "Offer either to buy them another place or settle with them. You have to be creative."
She gave this example: "Several years ago, I had an owner who bought co-ops for two tenants, relocated them and is allowing them to stay for life, and then he will own the apartments."
Even the wispiest of hints that a building may be for sale is likely to strike fear in the hearts of tenants.
"We are getting more calls all the time over the issue of owner occupancy," said Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants & Neighbors Coalition. "We are seeing more and more eviction cases being brought against tenants in rent-regulated apartments in smaller buildings. Some of those times it's because landlords want to occupy the entire building and other times because they simply want to charge market rents."
Mr. McKee would like to see the laws amended so that rent-stabilized tenants would have the stronger protections rent-controlled tenants have, and he favors limiting the number of apartments a landlord can take over. "That would make people safe in their own homes," he said. "There are cases when the owners act in good faith and other times when they use occupancy as a ruse. They simply have a relative live there for a few months."
Although empty buildings fetch higher prices, there are still some owners who want -- or need -- the income generated from tenants to help carry the mortgage or provide a sense of security. And some brokers, Paul Massey, the president of Massey Knakal Realty Services, among them, contend that "buying such a building is absolutely worth it."
"If you value a building with a stabilized tenant in it and you put a value on the same building were it to be empty, there is a huge leap in value that allows you to pay the tenant," he said. "If there are three or four tenants, you get more of a break."
To illustrate: "The average multiple-unit dwelling in the city sells for about $200 a square foot," he said, "and the average single-family residence for $500 to $1,300 a square foot."
When San Orr, an investment banker, and his wife, Sarah, an owner of Babybox.com, a Web site that sells baby gifts, began looking for a town house last year in the Park Slope and Fort Greene, they considered renting out part of whatever they bought for the income it would generate.
"Then we decided not to, because we found a house where we didn't need the rental income," said Mr. Orr. He would not divulge the price he paid for the house, which is in Fort Greene. "We have two dogs, and we are expecting a baby in August," he added, "and we wanted not to have to worry about people coming and going. We also felt that we would best be able to restore the initial character of the building in its entirety rather than just using one apartment."
Once a building is empty, the process of transforming it into a single-family residence can take a year or more.
"Though in some ways it is more difficult to do a house than an apartment," said Mr. Mark, who has been the contractor on several town houses and is now doing his own, "logistically it is easier. You don't have to have the plans approved by the co-op board or the building's architect, only by the city. You can work 10 hours a day, not 5."
The scope of the project helps, too. "In any renovation, the more you do, the easier it is," he said. "Trying to make new work blend into existing conditions is the most difficult. If you totally gut a place, it may cost more and take more time, but it is less difficult."
But one buyer's difficulty may be another buyer's nightmare. Whenever he hears a building described as having "good bones," Warren Pearl, a contractor who has been renovating town houses in Manhattan for 30 years, becomes suspicious.
"Clients and architects say that all the time," he said, "and what they don't realize is that they are all wrecks, simply because they were converted a long time ago, probably with improperly done structural modifications to accommodate all those kitchens and bathrooms."
Mr. Pearl estimates a renovation will cost 50 percent of the purchase price. "If you pay $6 million, it will cost approximately $3 million," he said. "In terms of square footage, high-end residential jobs are about $300 to $400 per square foot."
Renovating town houses in New York City presents unique challenges. "You have problems here you don't see anywhere else in the country," Mr. Pearl said. "You have attached houses and sometimes one wall is not attached. Manhattan is filled with underground streams, which is why buildings often lean, and there are flooding problems people aren't even aware of."
Among the more serious flaws he encounters are joists damaged by walls, plumbing and electric lines added when the house was converted to apartments, and water damage from inadequately caulked bathtubs and leaky radiators and roofs. "People don't understand the scope and extent of work that is necessary," he said.
That certainly proved true for a woman who moved into a house on the East Side with her husband and three children in February. It was not until the building had been gutted during a year of construction work that they were told that the joists -- the beams that hold up floors and ceilings -- were collapsing.
"The most important thing I learned from the experience was to remain calm when the surprises come," said the woman, who spoke about her experiences only on condition that her name not be used. "The biggest thing for me was to tackle the problem of the day, and every day there were new problems, electrical, plumbing, joists. If you don't like dealing with problems, this is not for you."
M ICHAEL HOURIHAN, a former tax lawyer who is now commercial real estate developer, has converted two brownstones in Manhattan. He is still recovering from a structural surprise. "I usually live in the houses myself for a while before selling them, but my most recent one I ended up selling quicker than I had anticipated," he said.
Last spring, Mr. Hourihan bought a house on East 69th Street that had been built in the 1870's and converted to a rooming house in the 1930's. Gutted by fire about 30 years ago, it was rebuilt into a four-family residence. When he bought it, Mr. Hourihan intended to carve out a duplex for himself, retain two rental apartments to carry the mortgage and then take over the whole building for his own use in a few years.
"In the process of doing cosmetic renovations in the rental space, we discovered structural flaws that were a result of the renovation after the fire, stuff even an architect and engineer who came through couldn't see," he said.
The necessary repairs would have been so extensive, he said, that "once I had to do that level of rip-out, I decided it would be too costly to put in kitchens and bathrooms for the apartments only to rip them out in a few years when I wanted to change it to a single-family," he said. Instead, he skipped right to the final renovation.
"I moved in for a short while, but it didn't make sense to be paying the heavy mortgage, so I put it on the market around Thanksgiving, and it will close on April 25." He bought the building for $1.4 million, he said, and spent $350,000 in renovations that would have cost far more had he not been in the business. He is selling it for $2.7 million.
By comparison, the house the Orrs bought in Brooklyn needed relatively little repair. Since it only contained one rental apartment, whose kitchen and bathroom they have already removed, they did not have to gut it. "It was renovated with new electrical and plumbing systems in the late 1970's, so the renovation is mainly to change it from a two-family to a one-family house rather than major structural changes," Ms. Orr said.
They took down a 25-foot wall that had been put up to keep the stairway private and are installing 10-inch steel beams to prevent floors from sagging.
Meanwhile, the woman who is renovating the East Side town house is moving into the home stretch, picking out knobs, putting up house numbers at the front door, installing lighting fixtures.
The unexpected crises are now a memory. "I thought my house would be nice, but I never thought it would be this beautiful," she said. "It's great having a basement for storage, having a place to put bills, having a basketball net in the backyard, being able to open the door and just walking outside without going into an elevator."
But there is one break she has yet to make. "You definitely miss the handyman," she said. "So I have hired the handyman from my old building to come in one Sunday a month."

HEADLINE: For Expatriate Families, A Home Away From Home;
Foreign Enclaves Dot the Landscape as County Attracts Temporary Residents

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
IT is a glorious spring morning, the daffodils standing at attention outside Bernice Woodbury's white Colonial on one of Scarsdale's prettiest streets. Inside are nine women, babies and toddlers in tow, eating bagels and swapping shopping tips and vacation ideas. But in one important way this is not a typical Westchester play group: the happy chatter has the long, flat accent of Australia, with a sprinkle of New Zealand and Scotland.
"This is a chance to get out and have a talk and a cup of tea," said Carolyn Broughan, an Australian mother of three who lives with her husband, Patrick, in nearby Edgemont. "You leave all your family and friends at home, and it can get lonely." 
 They call themselves expatriates -- well-to-do Germans, Japanese, Australians, French and other foreign nationals who have found their way to Westchester after being transferred by their companies to New York City.
For Americans familiar with Ernest Hemingway, the term "expatriate" conjures up images of youthful decadence. But the county's expatriate community has nothing in common with the dissolute and aimless characters in "The Sun Also Rises."
In many ways, the expatriates of Westchester, who live side by side with Americans 2in some of the county's most desirable towns and villages, have blended so seamlessly into suburban life -- with mothers shuttling children from play dates to practices -- that it is easy to miss them.
But their numbers have been growing, along with the global economy. And as foreign families struggle to adapt to a new culture for an average of three to five years while preserving a bit of their own, they are adding a multinational effervescence to the county, with certain towns acting as magnets for particular nationalities.
Snapping in the wind high above German School New York in White Plains are the American, Austrian, German and Swiss flags. The new Auray Cheese Shop in Larchmont, where the French-American School of New York is situated, offers 80 French cheeses along with crusty baguettes, truffle oil and French chocolates. ("We realized there was a huge French community here, and nobody was doing cheese," said Dale Saffir, who owns the shop with her husband, Warren Reid.) Japanese produce and packaged foods fill the aisles of Meidi-Ya, a Japanese market in Hartsdale, while the Japanese-owned Parisienne bakery next door sells traditional buns filled with sweet red-bean paste.
"Everything has gotten very international," said Ruth Chizzini, director of relocation for Julia B. Fee, a real estate agency with offices in Rye, Larchmont and Scarsdale. "We're getting a lot of people from London, Switzerland, France, Germany and Singapore. They're always interested in the schools, and they like to be close to the city if they can."
Indeed, lower Westchester, where a number of towns are increasingly identified with one or more nationalities, is beginning to resemble a map of the world. Sometimes, a family wants to be near a foreign school. Other times, a company will steer employees to particular suburbs where they may even own houses, as a couple of Australian banks do in Scarsdale. Then there is the snowball effect, in which couples gravitate toward towns that already have hefty numbers of their compatriots.
The French have congregated in Larchmont as well as in nearby Mamaroneck and New Rochelle (a city that, coincidentally, was settled by French Huguenots in the late 1600's). The Germans have overwhelmingly chosen White Plains as their temporary hometown, but they can also be found in Rye, Scarsdale and Mamaroneck. Australians, New Zealanders and Brazilians prefer Scarsdale and Rye, in that order. And the Japanese, whose Westchester presence has shrunk in recent years because of the faltering Japanese economy, are still enamored of Scarsdale, although they also look for houses and apartments in Rye, Harrison, Hartsdale and Eastchester.
Scarsdale, in fact, is famous in Japan, standing for quality schools and housing.
"It's a brand name, and the Japanese like brand goods and brand names," said Kuniko Katz, a Japanese expatriate who raised a family in Scarsdale after marrying an American social studies teacher years ago. Last year, Mrs. Katz, who has tried to bridge the gap between the two cultures, founded Japan America Community Outreach, a nonprofit organization, which helps Japanese expatriates become acclimated to American society while introducing Westchester residents to Japanese life.
Wherever they are, expatriates tend to live in impressive homes in costly neighborhoods, the result of generous housing allowances that can hit $8,000 a month and up. (One exception of late are the Japanese who are being sent over in less senior positions, with smaller allowances.) "You've got to be paid a premium to uproot your family, and expatriates are compensated well enough that they tend to live in nice places," said Joseph C. Snyder, president of the American Australian Association, a business and social organization in Manhattan.
Most expatriates prefer to rent rather than buy, since they are here for a relatively short time. The trick, however, is finding a house to rent in an overheated real estate market. "Everybody wants to sell, and you're the odd one out," said Brigitte Marquardt, who heads a newcomer's club for German-speaking expatriates. Although the County Planning Department does not have numbers to document the presence of expatriates, real estate agents and officials of foreign schools report an increase in numbers among several nationalities.
Some expatriates, like Patrick Croze of Larchmont, who arrived in New York from France on business in 1983, find life in Westchester County so pleasant that they end up staying. "I was transferred here for three years," he said, "and I'm still here."
Mr. Croze, 53, is now the director of finance for the French-American School of New York, a bilingual, bicultural private school with 620 students on two campuses -- in Larchmont and Mamaroneck -- and a waiting list of 120. In 1992, Mr. Croze became an American citizen. Twice a year, he and his family return to France to visit friends and family who often question his decision to become a Yankee.
"I tell them it's good to have one foot on each side," he said. "I find life here very easy. Everything is ordered and clean and extremely safe. In Europe, there is the idea that people here are always killing each other. But New York is safer than Paris."
Of course, it doesn't hurt that French culture in the Larchmont area has evolved to the point that there is a French newcomer's club (with activities almost daily and not only for newcomers), a French theater group, a French bakery and even a doctor who speaks French fluently. In fact, one reason so many French people "stick around" Larchmont, Mr. Croze said, is to be near Dr. Philip Heinegg, an American family practitioner who studied medicine in France and is married to a French woman.
"It's one thing to communicate in a foreign language when you're doing business," said Dr. Heinegg, whose practice in Larchmont treats 300 French patients. "But when there is something wrong with you physically or emotionally you need to talk about it in your mother tongue."
For women, the expatriate experience can be especially tough. All are torn from friends and family, and many leave behind careers as well. Once in the United States, only the husbands qualify for work visas. Friendships with Americans can be elusive, and husbands typically work long hours and travel frequently on business.
The expatriate social organizations are a crucial outlet. Members of the German newcomer's club have visited the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in Manhattan and toured historic mansions in the Hudson Valley. The French Welcome Service, which puts out a newsletter four times a year, organizes crafts projects, bridge games, morning jogs, cooking classes, book discussions and play groups for its members.
There is some intermingling between nationalities, too. Though largely Australian, the Scarsdale play group, which meets every other week, also includes women from New Zealand, the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany.
But even more valuable than the formal networks, expatriates say, are the loose circles of friends that function like surrogate families. Jacque Yates, an Australian mother of two in Scarsdale, said she recently sent her baby sitter to the home of a neighbor, another Australian, who needed someone to watch her children while she went to the doctor.
"You bend over backward because everybody's in the same boat," Mrs. Yates said. "We don't have mothers and relatives here, so we help each other out at the drop of a hat."
Perhaps nothing provides so strong a reminder of home as food, and expatriates are expert at tracking down authentic providers. Karl Ehmer Quality Meats, with three stores in Westchester, and Atlantic Meat Market in Norwalk are must stops for self-respecting Germans in search of classic German sausage.
For Mr. Croze, the Frenchman, a stroll down Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, the popular street of Italian food markets, satisfies a certain longing. "It's like shopping in Europe," he said. "There are all these little shops, and you can speak Italian to the people."
At times it can seem as if expatriates have built parallel societies for themselves, between the socializing and the schools (there is a Japanese elementary school in Greenwich and a Japanese high school in Purchase). But many foreign nationals say they relish the chance to experience American culture firsthand. And it is not only the children who want to pass for an American.
Ian M. Phillips, executive vice president and general manager of the Americas for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, who lives in Scarsdale, said one of his greatest goals was to be able to use telephone voice-recognition systems successfully, which so far have been tripped up by his New Zealand accent. "I'm absolutely sure that some day I'll get that down pat," he said. "Another three years."
Even the German School in White Plains, which receives funds from the German, Austrian and Swiss governments, takes pride in its American attributes, from its softball program to multi-ethnic food.
"Our cafeteria is run by a French caterer, the cook is Italian and all the service aides are South American," Wolfgang Ditscheid, the principal, said. "When you go through our school corridors, you hear our kids speak English."
Befriending Americans, at least for the adults, is sometimes difficult, however. Many Americans in Westchester, expatriates say, are too busy for their existing friends to take on new friends who will eventually leave. A language barrier can make relations harder still.
Mrs. Katz, the cultural go-between for the Japanese, is adamant that Japanese women reach out to American women. The sharing of Japanese rituals, in her mind, is a perfect opening.
In March, she organized a Japanese Festival at the Eastchester Library, with 15 Japanese women demonstrating the art of the tea ceremony, calligraphy, flower arranging and origami for 60 American women and children. In May, Mrs. Katz's organization, Japan America Community Outreach, plans a series of similar demonstrations at the Scarsdale Historical Society.
In the early 1990's, tensions flared in Scarsdale after a sharp influx of Japanese families there; one magazine article spoke ominously of "The Japanning of Scarsdale."
"They were coming one after another in the school system, and it was very hard for the teachers and the community members," Mrs. Katz said. "All of a sudden there were Japanese everywhere. But then people got used to it, and the Japanese also started to leave one by one."
As she loaded daikon, bamboo shoots and green tea into her cart at Meidi-Ya, Tsuru N. Hiroshima, a Japanese expatriate who lives with her husband, Koji, in Hartsdale, agreed that newcomers needed to make the first move. Recently, she showed some fellow members of the Scarsdale Golf Club different ways to prepare tofu. "You have to sell yourself if you are in a foreign country," Mrs. Hiroshima said. "You can't wait for people to come to you."
Regardless of nationality, most expatriates appear to like American life more than they dislike it. Yes, there are mild irritations along with profound qualms: American dependence on the automobile, capital punishment, puritanical views, to name a few.
But expatriates also gush about American politeness. They rave about Westchester County's open space and New York City's cultural riches. They admire the community involvement of residents. And they cannot get over the weather: one expatriate likened Westchester's light to that of Tuscany. There is, they say, a lot to miss.
"It will be hard," said Kirsten Thoma-Cerny, a German lawyer who is returning with her family to Frankfurt this summer after seven years in Harrison. "We got accustomed very much to this country. The Americans make it easy."
 
Helping to Make The Living Easier
 
The economics of being an expatriate can be fairly attractive. Many families receive generous housing allowances, which rise along with an executive's corporate rank. Companies often pick up the tab, too, for private schools, furniture and trips home to visit family and friends.
 
What follows is a snapshot of the financial package given to one Australian family in Scarsdale. The couple, who have two children, agreed to describe the perks of living abroad on the condition that their names not be used.
 
Despite his company's largesse, the executive said his family's life style here was not lavish. "We're living in a similar standard to how we would in Australia," he said. "But everything is more expensive here." While his salary is paid in Australian dollars, the stipends for housing and other costs are paid in American dollars.
 
HOUSING ALLOWANCE: The family gets $7,000 a month to spend on rental housing, a sum that nets a choice selection of homes, even in Scarsdale. But house rentals are scarce. "We looked for six or seven weeks," the executive said of the family's search throughout the county. "We looked at seven houses a day and by the afternoon, the houses were gone."
 
SCHOOLS: While some companies pay tuition for private schools, the Australian family is on its own. But the ample housing allowance enables them to live in one of Westchester County's finest school districts, and, of course, there is no language barrier.
 
FURNITURE RENTAL: When they arrived, the couple went to a furniture showroom and picked out an instant interior for their three-bedroom house, from sofas and beds to rugs and lamps. The company pays the $600 a month it costs to rent the furniture.
 
UTILITIES: The company throws in another $600 a month to cover the family's utility expenses, which include phone, gas heat and electricity.
 
HOME LEAVE: Once a year, the company flies the family back to Australia. The cost of the round-trip, business-class fares is $15,000.

In Princeton, Housing Prices Eclipse Their SAT's

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: PRINCETON

 BODY:
In the Princeton real estate market, pleading cannot hurt. When David Campbell and Amanda Rose saw a house they wanted a few weeks ago, listed at $239,000, they enclosed in their sealed bid a letter and a picture of their year-old daughter.
They won the competition, with an offer of $250,000, after months of watching prices rise and preparing to pounce. "It was clear that if waited we might not get this house," Ms. Rose said, "and there might not be any other house." 
 And so another house departed the superheated housing market here, where the general rule these days is that if you see anything advertised, it has already been sold. Real estate agents and buyers describe bidding wars -- four or five offers is not uncommon -- with mortgage contingencies scratched. Their best guesses are that prices have risen by a third since last summer.
"We're hotter than any other market in New Jersey," said Catherine McCool, the manager of the Gloria Nilson real estate office in Princeton. Ms. McCool measures the heat by the number of buyers lined up; she estimates that the traffic in her office has quintupled in three or four years.
Peter Blicher, president of the Central Jersey Builders Association, measures the heat by the multiple-listings book for Mercer County.
Searching for a ruler during a telephone interview, Mr. Blicher said: "A year ago it was probably two inches thick. It's now less than an inch."
To be sure, Princeton is not the only frenzied market. While the median price of existing homes across the state has been roughly in line with the inflation rate -- the New Jersey Association of Realtors reported an increase to $166,800 last year from $162,400 in 1998 -- there are plenty of hot spots.
Timothy Richards, president-elect of the Realtors association, said prices were shooting up in pockets of Bergen, Monmouth, Morris and Essex counties, too. "The baby boomers are out there buying their buns off," Mr. Richards said.
In Princeton, as in most places, the lower and middle ranges is where the pain is, said Robin L. Wallack, a broker with Nilson.
But here, "middle range" means $400,000 to $700,000. Ms. Wallack said it had probably been a year since she heard of anything under $100,000, and the current listings, slim as they are, show a healthy bulge over $1 million.
"That's about the going rate for bigger houses near the university," Ms. Wallack said as she pointed out some recently sold properties. One of them, a well-kept ranch house on a half-acre, brought more than $500,000. It is now back on the market, offered by a builder with plans to demolish it and build a new one for $1.3 million.
"I've seen a lot of comings and goings," she said, "but I've never seen a market like this, ever."
And a million dollars cannot buy most of the new houses rising in northwestern Princeton Township, a kind of woodsy frontier where a few dozen buildable lots have been carved out. Of the few remaining, a four-acre parcel off Drakes Corner Road is listed at $639,000; a four-acre lot closer to town is listed at $795,000.
"Lots in the Princeton area have probably gone up $100,000 in the last six months," said Mr. Blicher, whose company, Westrum-Pennington Properties, is finishing a development in Hopewell Township where prices start in the$600,000's. "I have to look anywhere in the state just to find property to build on."
Tom Vogt, a molecular biology professor, said he and his wife were "awestruck" by the prices but bought a one-acre lot in Princeton Township last year for $350,000 -- and then watched prices rise around them. Now they are designing a house while living in their university apartment, though Mr. Vogt acknowledges that like everyone else in Princeton he is unable to stop watching the market.
"It's gotten to the point where people are ringing doorbells, saying, 'I'd buy your house if you'd sell it,' " he said. He mentioned a street in his neighborhood where houses that sold for $500,000 two years ago were bringing $780,000. "Friends of ours there were delighted to hear us regale them with stories about prices," he added.
For Ms. Rose, a graduate student at Rutgers, and Mr. Campbell, who teaches at the College of Staten Island, buying was a quick march -- though their transaction was a little slow by Princeton standards. "We started looking on a Thursday," Ms. Rose said. "My husband saw the house Friday, I saw it Saturday, on Monday morning we put in a bid, and on Tuesday it was accepted."
Debbie and Ed Soffen claimed their new house within a day -- a day they had begun with no intention of buying anything.
The Soffens, both doctors, have lived in Princeton for nine years, and wanting to stay in their neighborhood, bought a small house on a large lot two years ago with a rather leisurely plan to replace the house with a bigger one.
As of a month ago, they were working with an architect to design the new house when they received a call: a house on Carnegie Lake, where they had always wanted to live, was going on the market. When they saw it, they decided to buy before they walked out the door.
"When I was trying to describe the house to the insurance company, I couldn't quite remember," Mr. Soffen said. "They were asking, 'Well, what's it made of? What are the floors made of?' I hadn't been in it long enough."
Within two weeks, their first house was sold. They plan to list the second soon. "We wanted to do it one at a time to keep it a little sane," Ms. Soffen said.
At real estate agencies, "agents used to check the computer once a day," said Anne Kearns, manager of the Prudential Fox & Roach office in Princeton. "Now we're checking every hour, every half-hour."
Even if the stock market falters, real estate experts say, the corporate expansions and the local start-ups under way around Princeton seem to dictate a longer life for the longest and strongest market ever.
Mr. Blicher, predicting that new construction could not ease a statewide housing shortage any time soon, added that prices were shooting up especially fast here "because Princeton is just so desirable."
And there will always be a Princeton. For decades, the town has generated stories of the quest for a place in the right ZIP code (that would be 08540 or 08542) and even waiting lists for a post office box within. And in the current issue of Town Topics, a long, loving ad for a $575,000 ranch house end with a common consolation prize: "In Lawrence Township, with a Princeton address."

Seeking a Line in the Sand

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: PORT ELIZABETH

 BODY:
The traffic is already thickening in this tiny old town, and by the end of the month the weekends will deliver thousands of Philadelphians from the Route 55 freeway to the traffic jam snaking up Route 47 from the shore. The backup starts here, in Cumberland County.
While the beaches boom, South Jersey political leaders are trying to raise from the dead a plan that environmentalists find all but incredible: the extension of Route 55 through the marshy plains between Port Elizabeth and the Garden State Parkway. 
 "Where 47 comes down it's horrendous," said State Senator James S. Cafiero, Republican of North Wildwood. "People can't back out of their driveways."
Three months ago, the Senate passed a nonbinding resolution urging the state Department of Transportation, which had turned aside the proposal for decades, to complete the highway. Shortly afterward, the board of the South Jersey Transportation Planning Organization, the agency charged with reviewing projects in the region, endorsed the Senate resolution.
Environmental advocates are fighting back. They maintain that a 20-mile freeway would destroy some of the state's most ecologically fragile land and mar the beauty that draws tourists, all in the cause of easing congestion that lasts perhaps 300 hours a year.
"This summer we'll be proactive, while we have this audience of three-quarters of a million people," said Douglas Jewell, a real estate broker in Swainton who is a leader of Concerned Citizens of Cape May County, an environmental group.
The proposal is also opposed by the Sierra Club, the New Jersey Audubon Society and other groups that say it would undermine the anti-sprawl objectives of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan.
Jeff Tittel, president of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, said he was skeptical of the Whitman Administration's assurances that the state has no plans to extend Route 55. Mr. Tittel cited several highway projects that had appeared suddenly on the Department of Transportations project list.
"If it gets political momentum, the next thing you know, it's getting approval," Mr. Tittel said.
James Weinstein, the state transportation commissioner, acknowledged that the Senate resolution was "absolutely" significant. "When a project has the support of the Legislature," he said, "it raises it to a different level."
But Mr. Weinstein said the department had no plan beyond improving existing roads. "The reality is that the environmental challenges are substantial," Mr. Weinstein said.
A feasibility study in 1993 mapped out a likely route for the new road but did not endorse the project, in part because 40 percent of the highway would cross wetlands. The study then placed the cost at $423 million to $483 million -- a price tag that environmental advocates say would now approach $1 billion.
Still, both sides regard the renewed call to extend the highway as a test of the administration's resolve.
The Senate resolution "should not have an effect on a governor committed to smart growth and the state plan," said Bill Neil, the director of conservation for the New Jersey Audubon Society.
But Senator Cafiero, who sponsored the resolution, along with the Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, said it expressed the legislature's frustration with decades of delay. "I came to the legislature in 1968, and that project was on the board then," Senator Cafiero said. "It becomes more costly as time goes on. If enough pressure can be brought to bear, whatever plans they have can be diverted or amended a little bit."
The environmental obstacles are huge. Half of the new road would lie within the pinelands. It would need approval from the Pinelands Commission, which has already registered its reservations, the Army Corps of Engineers and state and federal environmental agencies.
Those problems were cited in a 1998 report by the South Jersey Transportation Planning Organization, which evaluated many alternatives for alleviating shore traffic both from the Garden State Parkway and Route 55, which begins in Gloucester County. The report concluded that the project "would face extreme environmental problems" and "would also be very costly."
But now, said Timothy G. Chelius, the agency's director, the project "is at the top of this organization's list."
The Route 55 plan is just one thread in a larger debate over economic development in the southern counties.
"To the power brokers there, they are an underdeveloped area that wants what the rest of the state has," Mr. Neil said.
Senator Cafiero agrees. "You can't expect us to keep all these open fields and green spaces while depriving us of the ratables that reasonable construction would allow," he said. "We can't be the windows on the world."
Mr. Jewell said that elected officials were responding to development interests, which contribute heavily to their campaigns, and that the vast majority of residents opposed further building in the county.
"We just want to preserve a way of life," he said. "If we want to be Atlantic County or Asbury Park, we can do that, too."
But some residents do support an extended Route 55. "There are a sizable number of people in South Jersey who are opposed, for want of a better phrase, to anything happening," said Brian Reynolds, a year-round Avalon resident.
Mr. Reynolds, who wrote to the transportation planning organization on behalf of a homeowners group, said in an interview that "on Route 55 on a summer Saturday morning you could have a backup four or five miles long before you get to 47."
Another concern, he said, was evacuating the islands in the event of a hurricane threat, particularly since parts of Route 47 are susceptible to flooding.
On Route 47, Yvonne Glauner, who runs Two Pines Country Gifts in a shop behind her parents' farmhouse, said most people considered the traffic a nuisance, but not one to be solved by a new four-lane highway. "To do all that and disrupt the wildlife and people's homes for three months of the year doesn't make sense," she said.
Ms. Glauner said it would not matter much to her business if shore-bound traffic was diverted. In the bumper-to-bumper stream on Friday nights and Saturdays, she said, few pull off for gift shopping.

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY;
A Forgotten Threat: Free Trade in Population

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IN their determination to derail the forces of globalization -- a process in which dastardly capitalists provide employment to impoverished people all over the world -- protesters in Washington focused recently on a pair of plump targets, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Yet they directed none of their ire at the Washington headquarters of another notorious agent of globalization, the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
 Of course, the I.N.S. is not really responsible for America's decision to tolerate consistently high levels of legal and illegal immigration, or for the nation's indifference to the age, training or skill level of most of the immigrants it admits.
But the protesters seemed mainly to want a symbol. So why assail global trade (the importing of goods) but ignore immigration (the importing of people)? After all, economists across the political spectrum agree that the growing volume of world trade yields economic, social and even geopolitical benefits to Americans and foreigners alike, making the world more peaceful and more affluent. There is no such consensus on current immigration policy.
Many of the protesters claimed to be environmentalists. Surely the arrival of large numbers of immigrants, who will soon begin consuming land, fuel and other resources at gargantuan American levels, is an environmental issue.
Other protesters profess a concern for American jobs. Yet unemployment in this country is negligible.
The real problem for American workers is that immigration keeps increasing the supply of labor, seriously suppressing low-end wages. George J. Borjas, a Harvard professor of public policy specializing in immigration, calls this "an astonishing transfer of wealth from the poorest people in the country, who are disproportionately minorities, to the richest."
John Micklethwait and Adrian Woolridge, in their exhaustive new book about globalization, "A Future Perfect" (Crown Business Books) state flatly that "immigration has a much more direct impact on American wages than trade does."
What's more, immigration holds down wages in exactly the kinds of low-skill jobs that are not easy to shift overseas -- the only ones, in other words, that are likely to remain available in the long run to the poorest Americans. Many of the poor -- often immigrants themselves -- generally take a much dimmer view of high immigration rates than does the latte-and-S.U.V. crowd, which mainly sees cheap child care and great new ethnic restaurants.
Certainly, immigration has played a role in the declining fortunes of organized labor. Consider the drywallers of Southern California. In the 1970's, installing gypsum wallboard there was highly paid union work. But at the end of that decade, contractors began using nonunion Mexican immigrants, many of them from a single village. By the early 1980's, union drywallers had been completely displaced, and wages had plummeted.
Eventually, after a struggle, the immigrant drywallers formed their own union and won raises, but their pay remains far below what their predecessors earned -- perhaps because there are more immigrants waiting to take their places.
In the rhetoric of its opponents, global capitalism has a prominent failing: income inequality. But in the United States, that inequality is almost certainly exacerbated by immigration; indeed, it is becoming common again for the bourgeoisie to employ servants, though no one uses the term in polite company.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve and bete noire of anticapitalists everywhere, recently called for more immigration of skilled workers. Software companies, of course, love that idea. They want more immigrant programmers, even though there is no great shortage of homegrown software labor, at least according to Norman Matloff, a computer scientist at the University of California at Davis who also studies immigration. There is only a shortage, he says of cheap software labor.
IT would be more logical for foes of globalization to also oppose immigration, but such a stance is, of course, politically incorrect. While supporting both free trade and immigration may be more consistent, I'm not sure it is any more right. If we are to continue reaping the benefits of globalization, we must do more to help those who suffer the heaviest cost -- America's working poor, who should, at the least, receive decent pay and health insurance for their labors. The nation is unlikely to make much headway on this or many other important fronts (like income inequality, suburban sprawl or social cohesion) until we reassess which people, and how many of them, can enter the country. In the past, big influxes have often been followed by long periods of digestion in which fewer newcomers were admitted.
The time may be right for another such breather.

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS: VOWS;
Eugenie Diserio and Bill Buttenwieser

BYLINE: By LOIS SMITH BRADY 

 BODY:
AS the founder of Astronet.com, an astrology Web site, Eugenie Diserio will gladly, even proudly, tell you that until recently she experienced plenty of setbacks, broken hearts, horrific blind dates, cars that broke down and unemployment. To her, life is about cycles -- caused by moons and planets moving in and out of one's celestial house -- and at 45 she's been through plenty of them.
In her 30's, she went through a wild, glamorous, sleepless cycle as the lead singer of a New Wave dance band in Manhattan, the Model Citizens. Then, in 1989, she quit performing, had a child and moved to Woodstock, N.Y., where she baked bread, wore Birkenstocks and drove a Saab with nearly 200,000 miles on it. "That was her Mother Earth time," said Dorette Sacripanti, a friend. 
 In 1992, after breaking up with a boyfriend, she returned to her hometown, New Canaan, Conn., moving into an apartment above her parents' garage. She arrived with no money, no job, her son (Jake, now 11) and a broken heart. "She was really up a creek without a paddle," said her mother, Roseanne Diserio.
Eventually, she got a 9-to-5 corporate job just for the health benefits, but hated it. "I thought, 'God, I'm not supposed to be this generic person,' " she said. When she was fired in 1994, she began a project everyone thought her wackiest yet: she created Astronet.com, which now includes daily horoscopes, astrological charts for couples and an advice column for the lovelorn, Ask Genie. (She's Genie.)
As she built Astronet, which went online in 1995, the only men in her life were Jake and Sam, her overweight mutt. "I was a total single mom," she said. "Sometimes, I'd get depressed and Jake would say: 'Oh, Mom, you're not alone. You have me.' "
Then, in the fall of 1997, she met Bill Buttenwieser, a corporate pilot who is now 43. "We were introduced by my sister, who had been my sole dinner partner up until then," Ms. Diserio said. "Bill was recently separated and at a very low moment. My sister told him: 'You should really meet Eugenie. She's nice and she deals with a lot of people with problems.' So we met, and he unloaded."
Ms. Diserio got his birth date that night and checked him out astrologically. (She's a Libra; he's a Taurus.) "We had a lot of compatibilities in our charts," she said. "So I thought, 'Oh, I'll give this guy a chance.' " As it turned out, the pilot and the astrologer had much in common. Both had been through failed relationships; both were parents (he has three daughters); both knew the stars well, albeit from different perspectives. She describes him as a punctual, orderly and poetic pilot who comes back from work and talks about the spectacular thunderstorms or shooting stars he saw that night.
He said he began falling in love with Ms. Diserio right from the start: "The first time I shook her hand it was like static electricity. There was really a power between us."
Now that her "struggling days" seem over, when people ask Ms. Diserio for advice, she's like a personal trainer. "I get really tough on people," she said. "I try to empower women, because there was a point in my life when I was so unempowered. You have to be very, very proactive. You have to make a good life."
The couple were married in Darien, Conn., on April 29, a day she chose after consulting her charts. The wedding was at the Woodway Country Club, where she used to play tennis in a black leather jacket in her Model Citizens era. This time she wore a conservative white gown with her hair in a bun. Jake gave her away and cried more than anyone. (From happiness, he said.)
Now, Ms. Diserio hopes she's entering a stable, financially secure, suburban, domestic cycle. (Last year, Hearst New Media acquired Astronet for a price in the seven figures, and she now drives a "Big Benz," as she calls it.) She and Mr. Buttenwieser are shopping for a house in New Canaan and want to have children of their own. "I'm kind of a nester," she said. "I was always moving. Now, I'm going to find a home and stay awhile."

HEADLINE: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE;
Snapshots in Scent

BYLINE: By Alex Witchel

 BODY:
I STARTED wearing Chanel No. 5 because of Catherine Deneuve. To my teenage eyes she was the epitome of French style and classic beauty, and I figured that if I wore it, too -- bell-bottoms aside -- I would somehow acquire that same je ne sais quoi. In Scarsdale.
I had my dalliances along the way. There was Charlie (Shelly Hack's appeal was somehow not eternal) and Chloe, even Fracas for a minute, but in the end it was always Chanel. Those dreaded women at Bloomingdale's who aim their atomizers and fire get nowhere with me. 
 But after 25 years, even I was bored, so when I read that Sarah Horowitz was taking appointments for her Fragrance Journey, I called. "The fragrance equivalent of rebirthing," the notice read, "Horowitz coaxes forth scent-related memories and then blends you a scent with emotional meaning."
Ms. Horowitz is based in Malibu, but she road-trips regularly to New York and London; it turns out she has 1,200 clients. Though it sounded kind of kooky, I found the prospect somehow intriguing -- like having a shrink and a personal shopper rolled into one.
While customization has proved popular recently in everything from suits to ice cream, it is taking off in the top tiers of the fragrance industry. Creed, the very upscale European fragrance house, whose perfumer is the sixth-generation Oliver Creed, offers custom scents ($20,000 for Mr. Creed himself to oversee a process that takes six months). There are also Creed master blenders at Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, who can blend five or six of the existing 100 Creed scents for customers in an hour, for the more affordable fee of $400 to $1,000.
On the West Coast there are a growing number of fragrance boutiques like Lather in Pasadena and Homebody in Los Angeles that blend custom scents for clients like K. D. Lang. As Mary Lavo, the merchandising manager in charge of cosmetics for Barneys, says, the custom-scent trend is not sweeping huge numbers because of the time (and money) the process requires -- like couture versus ready-to-wear. Historically, fragrance was an exclusive privilege of royalty and the very rich, until the late 1800's, when the common folk got in on the act. So, it's not surprising that with the economy soaring now, the very rich have once again realized they no longer have to smell like even the moderately rich.
While the custom-scent trend has not broken through to the masses, some online sites plan to offer the service to users, via questionnaire. (Reflect.com was the only one I found promising that personalized scents "will be available soon.") Ms. Horowitz and some other professionals in the fragrance business are skeptical of this sort of venture, however, since body chemistry plays such an important part in determining a scent.
She settled down to determine mine in my apartment, breaking her "no house calls rule," because her New York schedule was so jammed she could see me only on her day off. (She usually sets up shop in a hotel suite; appointments can be made by calling 310-317-6858.)
The Fragrance Journey costs $255 for a 90-minute session and includes a quarter-ounce French-cut bottle of the perfume she creates with you. (Perfect Perfumes, her ready-to-wear line, as she calls it, is sold in New York at the Bigelow Pharmacy in Greenwich Village.)
Ms. Horowitz travels with a fragrance organ, a large case containing 120 bottles of fragrances and essential oils. As she set up her apparatus and put some New Age music on the tape player, I learned that she grew up on Long Island and graduated from Emerson College in Boston, where she discovered her interest in scent while working for Essence, a store on Newbury Street, now defunct. She has apprenticed at Belmay, a perfume house in the Los Angeles area, and has spent the last 12 years combining her love of scent with her love of psychology.
"My passion is to incorporate emotional and physical history into the blending of fragrance," she said. "I love listening to people and seeing what we can put together." The results have included everything from separate daytime and nighttime scents to a custom-made bridal scent that the bridegroom doesn't smell until the wedding day. "After that, you only wear it on anniversaries or special occasions," she said. "It's Pavlovian. You're impregnating the oil with your memory."
Ms. Horowitz started the session by telling me, "You will have to name the fragrance you give to yourself," which she would then print up on labels for my future orders. She has a lab assistant who translates her handwritten formulas into sprays, bath gels and body lotions.
She gave a brief history of fragrance, noting that the Egyptians made cones out of beeswax and tallow, laid blossoms on them and wore them on their heads. As the heat of the sun melted them, the scented fat ran down their faces. Yum yum.
"This is one of the oldest art forms," she said. "You are receiving the highest gift you can give yourself, a fragrance based on your experiences and what you love."
Then her questions started. What were my favorite foods? Favorite color? What were my scent memories of my mother? Do I love citrus? Not especially. How about sweet? Even less.
Yes, I do like the ocean, better than the mountains. I like roses and grass and violets. I especially like the way some people smell like soap, so clean and straight from the shower.
As I spoke, she pulled bottles from her case and grouped them on the table, moving them around as if they were chess pieces. She gave me a Parmesan cheese shaker filled with coffee beans and instructed me to inhale periodically; it works as a palate cleanser for the nose.
"Perfume is built like music is," she said. "The base note, middle and top. The base supports the scent, like the percussion, the middle is the bouquet of fragrance and the top note is the most pungent and pulls you into the rest. It's like the strings."
During the first round of inhaling her bottles, she told me what each scent was and had me tell her whether I loved it, hated it or wasn't sure. What followed was a series of childhood memories, instantaneous snapshots of the oddest assortment of people and places: my Aunt Marcia's bathroom, the soap in my underwear drawer in junior high school, a hotel room in Puerto Rico.
Sweet pea smelled like camp. Cassis smelled like Chanel No. 5. Basil smelled like dinner and didn't interest me at all. As a matter of fact, I disliked most scents.
"There's no wrong answer here," Ms. Horowitz said encouragingly. "It's all about you, and I know how to balance it."
During the second round of inhaling she instructed me to keep my eyes closed. "When they're open you have a mental association with what you perceive the scent to be," she said. "With your eyes closed, you go on your gut. I watch your facial expressions and see where the emphasis should be when I blend."
I ended up with six ingredients for her to mix with her long plastic eyedroppers: Oriental musk, rose, sweet pea, African violet, gardenia and cassis. "It has a garden feel, and the cassis makes it very sophisticated," she said, putting it on my arm. I smelled it and winced. It was way too sweet.
She nodded. "Your skin brings the rose up," she said. "It depends on body chemistry. Certain people pull up certain notes faster."
She kept adjusting, adding one drop at a time from skinnier glass eyedroppers to different areas of my arms and hands. She ran her nose up and down the skin, sniffing, like a puppy. I started to feel that my choices were wrong, but she kept mixing until suddenly I smiled. Yes.
"It reminds me of something," I told her. "Something good."
She smiled. "You," she said.
After she had packed up and gone, I showered, dressed and put on my new perfume, as I did the day after and the day after that. I tried not to notice, but it was still too sweet. The spray she had made was better, less concentrated, but still not right. One night I went back to Chanel No. 5, which surprisingly, smelled thin and chemical by comparison.
I called Ms. Horowitz. "This happens about 10 percent of the time," she said apologetically. "My goal is to have you love this, so I'm going to rework it based on the formula and send you some samples in the mail."
She wasn't completely surprised by my reaction, she added. "My impressions of you," she said, "were that you are extremely thorough and very specific. Yet, there is a little contradiction. You said you didn't like sweet things, but when you smelled them, you liked them."
She hesitated. "If you don't mind my saying so, you do a lot of thinking in your line of work and I think you don't want to be perceived as too sweet."
She was probably right. But she had overcompensated for me a bit too much.
After I hung up, I realized I still hadn't named my scent. I could wait, of course, until the revised version came back. But one night, at the movies, the name came to me. I had caught a whiff of myself, and it was fragrant, familiar, even comforting. Not to mention decidedly imperfect.
"Mine."

HEADLINE: MONEY & MEDICINE;
Patients Can Burn Cash, Too

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Jennifer Steinhauer covers health care for The Times. Her column on the economics of health care appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: jestei@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
ASK people how money is wasted in the health care system, and their tone of voice undergoes an interesting change.
Doctors huff and puff about the squadrons of workers they have had to hire to meet the paperwork demands of managed care. Patients complain about the $60 they shell out for three-minute appointments during which doctors seem to do little more than blink at them. Insurance companies bemoan unnecessary tests. 
 In fact, there are many quantifiable ways in which millions of health care dollars go up in smoke each year. Patients are complicit in the process, though they do not always know it. Doctors, insurance companies and policy experts each have a laundry list of ways that patients aid and abet waste, sometimes at the peril of their own health. Here are some of the problems they cite.
 
UNNEEDED ANTIBIOTICS -- In rare agreement, doctors, insurers and scientists all say there is widespread, wasteful misuse of antibiotics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta estimates that roughly 50 million unneeded prescriptions for antibiotics are dispensed each year.
Why? Doctors say patients -- especially those who were up all night with a miserable child -- dislike going home empty-handed. Others demand the most expensive types of antibiotics even when they are not appropriate. And some doctors feel that while an antibiotic may not help a situation, it won't hurt, either.
That attitude deeply concerns the C.D.C., which has seen a rapid increase in antibiotic-resistant infections, including those of the ear, urinary tract and respiratory system, in part because of antibiotic misuse.
"I think the average person can help by understanding that antibiotics offer no benefit for colds and flu and viruses," said Dr. David M. Bell, who works on antibiotic resistance issues at the C.D.C. "They should not be disappointed when the doctor does not prescribe them, and they should not demand them."
 
PREVENTIVE SCREENINGS -- In theory, screenings are great, because finding and treating illnesses in early stages tends to be less expensive and more successful. But many people are screened for diseases they are at no real risk of contracting.
Colon cancer experts, for example, generally recommend waiting until the age of 50 to begin screening for the disease unless it runs in the family or a relative has developed it at 55 or younger. But the once-distasteful colonoscopy has been promoted into something of a rage among people who do not really need it, these experts say, eclipsing cheaper tests that may be more appropriate.
"Katie Couric showing that the colonoscopy is a tolerable and accurate screening test is a good thing," said James E. Allison, a gastroenterologist at San Francisco General Hospital and investigator for Kaiser Permanente, a West Coast health maintenance organization. "But the message should not be that average-risk people Katie's age should get a colonoscopy."
Others who do not need the procedure are the very elderly who have been screened in the past; those with terminal illnesses, though 30 percent of primary care doctors refer such patients for the test anyway; and people who have had a benign polyp removed in the last five years, since there is only a remote chance it will come back, Dr. Allison said, citing studies by respected cancer centers.
Looking at screenings more broadly, many experts say that far too many people get M.R.I. scans for lower back pain, and that unnecessary surgery and invasive tests often follow. A New England Journal of Medicine study from the mid-1990's found that as many as 85 percent of patients with lower back pain could not be given a definitive diagnosis.
 
OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCTS -- Every doctor and managed-care executive has an example in this area. (Their views are their own, so manufacturers, save the angry letters.) Dr. Jack Swanson, a pediatrician in Ames, Iowa, and the chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on practice and ambulatory medicine, does not much care for vitamins for healthy children.
"Most pediatricians don't think healthy children need extra vitamins, even the ones that are picky eaters," Dr. Swanson said. He also derides food additives for children with disabilities. "I think parents see these things advertised and think they are important to use," he said.
Oddly, no one mentioned the mental-health cost of reading really tacky magazines in the doctor's waiting room. But the patient's role in that, of course, is elective.

In aSearch for Hot Wheels, Buyers Hit a Dead End

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
AS Robert Forester watched his dealer pull up in a black Chrysler PT Cruiser to take him for a test drive, he decided on the spot that the retro-looking small van would join his family's fleet.
"I got in that PT Cruiser and fell in love," said Mr. Forester, who works for a printing and stationery business in Henderson, Tex., 150 miles east of Dallas. 
 But two months after he ordered a red one with automatic transmission and tinted moonroof for his mother, Jean, it still has not arrived. In fact, it has not even been built, and Chrysler representatives could not tell him when it would be.
With auto sales booming along with the economy, consumers who want the hottest vehicles are struggling to find the unfindable, which this spring includes eye-catchers like the PT Cruiser and the Toyota MR2 Spyder sports car, the highly rated Honda Odyssey minivan, and luxury vehicles like the BMW X5 sport utility and Mercedes S-Class sedans. Orders like Mr. Forester's go on waiting lists and languish for months.
In some areas, it can be impossible even to find a vehicle to inspect in the showroom, because dealers are selling every one that comes in. Honda dealers on Long Island are telling customers who want to test-drive an Odyssey that they must first order one, put down a deposit, and then wait for it to arrive.
In response, many consumers find that they must alter their tactics, searching by phone over wide areas for dealerships that have a car on the lot. A growing number of people are turning to the Internet, combing dealer sites, omnibus shopping sites like Autobytel and Microsoft's Carpoint, and even auction sites like eBay for leads.
Tracking down a hot car is one thing; taking title is another. Joel Manby, a former executive with Saab and Saturn who is now president of Greenlight.com, a car-buying site, estimated that half of all buyers use the Internet to research or find vehicles, but that only one in 20 concludes a deal online.
THE Internet also tends to lengthen the lines at the dealers who have hot cars on hand. Corky Jones, Internet sales manager for Covington Pike Chrysler in Memphis, said his dealership had 103 orders for PT Cruisers from people as far away as Ohio, Illinois and Texas. In one hour on Wednesday, six people came into the showroom to see the vehicle, with its vaguely 1930's front end; they were told that new orders would be filled in December.
Mr. Jones likened the demand to the frenzy last year over Volkswagen's New Beetle, which remains in short supply in some parts of the country. But he is enjoying the clamor. "Just once in your life, you want to sell something that is so popular you have people lining up for it," he said. "It's fantastic."
On the wall in Covington Pike's showroom is an ever-lengthening list of buyers who have put down $500 deposits. James Alexander, a mechanic from Mason, Tenn., who went on the list in February, just got his PT. "It's a joy to drive," Mr. Alexander said.
Despite having no bargaining leverage on such a hot vehicle, Mr. Alexander got his for the sticker price, about $20,000 with options, because Covington Pike has decided not to charge a premium. "That wouldn't be fair to the customer," Mr. Jones said.
But other dealers feel differently. Last week, anyone willing to pay $24,999 -- $5,000 above list -- could drive home that day in the dark blue PT Cruiser on the showroom floor at Village Chrysler-Jeep in Royal Oak, Mich. Village's new-car sales manager, Jeff Radke, said it had been bought used with a few hundred miles on the odometer; his waiting list for new ones numbers 60.
And the dealership is not guaranteeing what the final price will be on those, he said, leaving open the possibility that it will tack on a premium if demand stays strong. And if customers balk? "If they don't want it, they can cancel," he said. "It's up to them."
Some dealers are looking to maximize profits on scarce vehicles by auctioning them online. Blouin Truck Center of Augusta, Me., posted a dark red PT Cruiser on eBay last week, seeking an opening bid of $19,990, or $2,400 above list. "It's a variation on what the market will bear," said Mike Linkenbach, the dealership's manager. "This is a unique vehicle. This isn't like a Dodge Neon that they build every day."
Steve Rossi, vice president for global communications at DaimlerChrysler, said such markups were isolated. "You've heard a handful of stories," he said. "What you haven't heard are the 10,000 positive experiences, people who went through the process, placed an order and got their vehicles." Chrysler dealers delivered 8,325 PT Cruisers in April, he said, and have about 79,000 more on order.
IN introducing the X5, its first sport utility, in December, BMW found itself in the catbird seat. Jack Pitney, a spokesman, said, "We're in an enviable position where demand far outweighs supply."
Too far, in fact. The first year's production is sold out, and dealers are not yet allowed to take orders for 2001 models. For now, the only way to get one is to buy it used; an X5 with 4,700 miles was on eBay last week at a minimum bid of $49,100, just $800 below its base price when new.
So, too, with Toyota's new MR2, a two-seat sports car whose production was limited to generate buzz with consumers: all 7,425 available this year are spoken for, the company said. And at Betten Imports in Grand Rapids, Mich., the back-order time for the latest Mercedes S-Class cars, which start at around $80,000, is up to a year.
The Odyssey has no such cachet; its attractions are Honda's reputation for quality and raves in the consumer press. Joseph Phillippi, automotive analyst at PaineWebber, observed, "It's a Honda -- enough said."
Introduced more than a year ago, the Odyssey is still scarce, even though Honda is making as many as it can. "Most dealers only have one or two," said Michael Luckey, an automotive consultant who shopped for an Odyssey in Pompton Plains, N.J. Mr. Manby of Greenlight.com, which matches potential buyers with 1,000 participating dealers, said it "is tough to find anywhere."
Perhaps the toughest of all, for now, is BMW's Z8 sports car, featured in "The World Is Not Enough," last year's James Bond thriller. The car went on sale only last Monday, but all 400 to be sold in the United States have already been allotted to buyers who ordered them up to a year ago, when the Z8 began appearing in European car magazines. An Internet search last week found none on auction sites.
In such cases, "the advice I can give any customer is basically, 'Get to your dealer early,' " said Steven Sturm, vice president for marketing at Toyota.
What will be the next hot car? Analysts mention the Audi TT Roadster and the new Thunderbird that Ford is planning for next spring. Jeff Leckta, Internet Services Manager at Betten Imports, cites the convertible New Beetle. Though Volkswagen told dealers not to expect the car until the fall of 2001, he said, "I already have orders."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BENDING ELBOWS;
Couple of Homeboys With the Gentrification Blues

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LEDUFF 

 BODY:
Fort Greene, Brooklyn, has always been home to a black middle class, but the Ave belonged to the broke and the bus drivers. The playground belonged to the tough kids like Chulo, who wear flannel and sneakers and whiskers.
That was before the Change. The Caucasian invasion, they call it; before the police and the block associations, the bars, cafes and the artistic bubbleheads. They and their money took over. 
 The Ave, as it is known to locals, is the block bounded by DeKalb, Lafayette and Carlton Avenues and Adelphi Street. In the middle is a playground. Along the perimeter are the new bars and the brownstones. Rows and rows of beautiful brownstones. One stop from Manhattan.
Gentrification doesn't just happen, said Chulo, 21, whose given name is Eric J. Melendez. These new people have to be helped, and he was one who helped them. Now he regrets it.
A couple of Europeans opened cafes on the Ave not long ago, and Chulo was attracted to them. They were something different, and good-looking women went there. He now works hustling plates at a French joint called Chez Oskar. He keeps the neighborhood kids off the owner's back and out of her till. He makes $300 a week. He spends evenings at the bar. He now sees possibilities beyond the streets.
"They been good to me," Chulo said. "I been good to them."
But things have gone too far, as far as Chulo's concerned. There is a South African restaurant on the Ave named Madiba, owned by a white man. A few weeks ago, according to Chulo, some white South Africans started a ruckus there with the black employees and left, leaving a racial stink the air. "It bugged me out," Chulo said the other afternoon at Madiba over a beer. "I thought this was still Brooklyn."
His story is Brooklyn to the bone. His mother died young. His father is locked away. He bounced around in foster homes until he was adopted. He was 14 when his second mother died, 14 when his second father died and 14 when he moved into the playground on the Ave.
The park became his home, the bench his mattress, the boys there his family. He drifted from $6-an-hour jobs to street-corner hustling until the white people came with a job and he got an apartment.
It hasn't worked out so well for the others, Chulo said, shading his eyes as he sat on one of Madiba's outside tables. Last week, Chulo said, he watched the light go out in a second-floor apartment on the Ave and saw a friend come down the stairs with the last of his possessions.
"I guess you ain't coming back here no more for real?" Chulo asked.
"Ain't no one to come back to," answered the friend, W. P.
The young men sat in the U-Haul, under the street lamp, drinking Corona and smoking menthols.
W.P. was moving to East New York, a neighborhood of vacant lots and cheaper rents and a growing number of economic outcasts from Fort Greene. The landlord had raised W.P.'s rent again. The liquor store closed for the same reason, and W.P. can't afford the drinks in the new bars.
"Man, what happened to the old neighborhood?" W.P. asked. He said it as if he'd been sneaked up on in the dark and beaten with a wet pillow.
"Not even a good grocery no more," Chulo said. CHARLIE LEDUFF

Not Just Surviving, but Thriving

BYLINE: By LESLIE BERGER 

 BODY:
MAYBE Jay Pearsall harbors some sort of death wish. He has, after all, been steeped in murder and mayhem for more than 10 years as the proprietor of Murder Ink, the Upper West Side mystery bookstore.
But the wholesome-looking Mr. Pearsall, who just opened a second store selling new and used books, insists he isn't suicidal, just hooked on a business that can be as intensely personal and satisfying as, well, a crime of passion. 
 "I could make more money in an easier way dealing rare books out of my apartment," he said. "But there's something, you know, in my blood to collect these books and turn them around."
Like Murder Ink, the two-month-old Ivy's Books and Curiosities is brimming with charm, uncommon titles and advice aplenty from a well-read staff. The two shops are connected on Broadway, between 92nd and 93rd Streets, and each has its share of antiques and friendly nuzzles from Gus, Mr. Pearsall's wirehaired pointing griffon. So far, he said, "No one has expressed anything but glee about having something other than another mediocre restaurant or Godiva chocolate."
By pumping profits from Murder Ink into a new store just 10 blocks north of Barnes & Noble, Mr. Pearsall has taken a big risk. But it seems to be one that other independent booksellers are taking, too, despite a shellacking over the last several years from Barnes & Noble, Borders and Amazon.com.
The decline in independent bookstores, from a nationwide peak of 5,400 in the early 1990's to 3,200 today, has tapered off during the last two years, according to the American Booksellers Association. Although the association does not break out separate figures for New York City, there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that indies are cautiously reopening their doors to readers starved for face-to-face contact.
Only 76 independent bookstores remain in all five boroughs, according to an association Web site (www.bookweb.org), and many of those are part of museums and other cultural centers. But for every lost icon like Endicott Booksellers, Watson's and Burlington, there is an Ivy's, a Crawford-Doyle and a Posman's, according to Carl Lennertz, a marketing consultant at the association's headquarters in Tarrytown, N.Y.
Shakespeare & Co., whose flagship store at Broadway and 81st Street closed after Barnes & Noble opened a block away, has not only re-emerged on the Upper East Side (near Hunter College), but is also becoming a small chain of its own. After regaining a foothold at Lexington Avenue and 68th Street, Shakespeare has opened branches near Baruch College (in the East 20's), near Wall Street, in Greenwich Village and, most recently, in the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
"Any new retailing phenomenon runs out of gas after a while," Mr. Lennertz said. "It's one thing to buy a discounted best seller, and it's another to go in and ask, 'What should my book club read?' "
Personal service is clearly the strength of independent mainstays like the Corner Bookstore, at Madison Avenue and 93rd Street since 1978. On a recent Saturday, pink and red carnations brightened the shop's windows while loyal customers politely vied for space at the cash register.
Carol Vanderkloot, a publicist, snapped up several children's classics for her niece's sixth birthday while Kent Lombard, a perfume chemist, and his wife, Randy, an interior designer, bought "The Horse and His Boy" by C. S. Lewis for their 7-year-old son, Hunter.
When "The Horse and His Boy," the third volume in the Chronicles of Narnia, wasn't readily available recently, the store's workers advised not skipping ahead.
"They didn't press us for another sale, but ordered it for us and called as soon as it came in," said Ms. Lombard, adding, "I don't mind paying a little more money for the service."
The Corner Bookstore's staying power may also stem from the fact that the proprietor, Lenny Golay, and her husband, Ray Sherman, own the four-story building where it is situated (and where they live). Two years ago, the couple opened a second store, the Lenox Hill Bookstore, on Lexington Avenue between 72nd and 73rd Streets.
Commercial rents have put a lot of stores out of business, said Fern Jaffe, who has owned Paperbacks Plus in the Riverdale section of the Bronx for three decades. Her core customers, Ms. Jaffe said, are neighborhood residents who shop along Riverdale Avenue, have known her for years and are now buying books for their children and grandchildren. "The money we're making today is based on a capital investment of old money," she said.
FINANCIAL independence also gave rise about five years ago to Crawford-Doyle, at Madison and 81st Street, whose chatty co-owner, John Doyle, is a retired I.B.M. executive and an avid reader.
"It's really not an economic enterprise anymore," Mr. Doyle said of the book business. "It's a labor of love."
The store grossed just under $1 million last year and barely broke even, Mr. Doyle said. But as he sees it, his staff gets decent wages and he and his wife, Judy Crawford, are able to dine with authors and chat with celebrity walk-ins like Emma Thompson.
Less secure but just as passionate are the operators of Nkiru, a Brooklyn landmark that has specialized in African-American literature since 1976. Talib Kweli Greene and Dante Smith, a hip-hop duo known as Black Star, bought the bookstore in 1998 with the advance from their first album. But competition, plus a $3,000 monthly rent, proved too much for them. The shop, on St. Mark's Avenue in Park Slope, was recently revamped into a nonprofit education and cultural center.
"You just can't rely on walk-ins," said Dr. Brenda M. Greene, Mr. Greene's mother, who now runs the center. Dr. Greene also heads the department of languages, literature and philosophy at Medgar Evers College. Current plans for Nkiru include an expanded selection of multicultural literature, writing seminars and weekend hip-hop performances.
Clearly, establishing a niche is critical. PosmanBooks, which started out as a purveyor of college textbooks, has successfully expanded into the general retail market while clinging to its collegiate roots and finding specialized markets.
Maxene Posman, the president of PosmanBooks, said that the family had doubled its business in the last few years. Though the company still specializes in college bookstores, Posman's three general trade stores have also carved out their own niches. The Grand Central store, for example, offers a wide range of management-training books for employees of nearby corporations.
Most independent bookstores also have Web sites or are developing them. But several booksellers said they had little expectation of reaping much profit on the Net and were going high tech mainly to support www.booksense.com, a Web site that is part of the booksellers association's national campaign to help its members compete online.
Mr. Pearsall, for one, clearly prefers selling books in person, and the intimacy of his stores may be hard to resist. But even his most appreciative customers go high tech and low-rent once in a while.
"I love the feel of this store," said Erin Moriarty, a reporter for "48 Hours," who was prowling for a new mystery recently at Murder Ink.
"How could you not? But I also love the mix of books and people at Barnes & Noble, and I also order books online. I'm an equal opportunist."

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
Expectations, Over the Rainbow

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IT is fair to say that technology investors have high expectations about the future growth of companies in their portfolios. But I bet that those companies have almost no chance of meeting those optimistic expectations.
Why am I so downbeat? It all comes down to the issue of whether huge growth rates can be sustained. 
 Consider a star of the new economy, Cisco Systems. Sure, its gear is essential to the growth of the Internet. But it is unlikely that Cisco will perform well enough over the next five years to satisfy the earnings expectations that I believe are implied by its current price-to-earnings multiple of 188.
To gauge those expectations, we first need to calculate how much Cisco's earnings are likely to grow over the next five years.
If Cisco follows the typical pattern of growth companies, its multiple will drop as it grows and matures. So assume that five years from now, Cisco's P/E will be 50 -- still well above the market's long-term historical average of about 15.
Next we need to postulate the company's stock performance. Cisco's stock has climbed 105 percent, annualized, over the last five years. So, to be conservative, we will guess that it will grow just 22 percent a year -- still double the stock market's long-term average.
Given these cautious assumptions, Cisco's stock will be at $183 in May 2005, up from $67.5625 on Friday. And many investors would be happy to get that kind of return.
But here is the rub: Cisco's earnings will have to grow by nearly 60 percent a year, on average, over the next five years to meet those expectations. And if we assume that Cisco's P/E is below 50 in 2005, or that its price is higher than $183, the requisite earnings growth rate will have to be even higher. To put this in perspective, consider that the earnings growth rate of the median technology company has been just 13 percent, annualized, over the last five decades.
So if you buy Cisco today, expecting that it will hit $183 in five years, you are making an implicit bet that its earnings will grow five times faster than those of the average technology company. And new research suggests that the odds of that are very low.
Josef Lakonishok and Louis K. D. Chan, finance professors at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studied nearly every technology stock from 1951 to 1999. In particular, they sought companies whose earnings growth rates were consistently above the median of all publicly traded companies.
They found that over periods of five years or more, just 4.7 percent of companies, on average, had earnings growth that beat the median during all years of the period. The number is statistically insignificant because, assuming that earnings growth was random, 3.3 percent of the companies would have beaten the median each year in any case.
Then the professors loosened up a bit, and searched for technology companies whose earnings growth rates exceeded the median in four out of five years. The results were almost identical. Their conclusion: Sustaining consistent, above-average earnings growth over five years is so rare as to approach statistical insignificance.
Of course, the professors were looking only for those technology companies that would beat the median earnings growth rate. The analysis of Cisco suggests that investors are betting, in effect, that the company will beat the median earnings growth rate by a factor of five.
I DO not mean to pick on Cisco. It is unlikely that any company's earnings can grow 60 percent a year for the next five years.
But analysts are forecasting such growth for many companies. According to First Call/Thomson Financial, nearly 280 of the nearly 6,200 companies it tracks have consensus five-year projected earnings growth rates of 60 percent or more, annualized.
Some people say earnings don't matter in the new economy. But the professors foresaw that argument: They reached nearly identical results when they looked at sales growth rather than earnings growth.

HEADLINE: Florists Fling Bouquets For Money, Not Love

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI

 BODY:
AN unsuspecting woman received a bouquet of flowers recently at her Fifth Avenue home. Set in a silver-plated urn, the $350 arrangement was lush with romantic pink roses, Italian poppies, deep-purple sweet peas, calla lilies and a card that read, "We'd be a good match."
Her secret admirer? A floral designer named David Beahm, whose intentions were not particularly romantic. The object of his attentions is a member of the organizing committee for a fall fund-raising gala for the Metropolitan Opera, with the unofficial position of flower chairwoman: she picks the florist who picks the flowers. 
 The unsolicited arrangement was "a courting bouquet," Mr. Beahm explained. He sent it in hopes of winning the account to provide flowers for a party that annually attracts some of New York's richest and swellest, names like Kissinger, Kravis and Bass. (He didn't want to reveal the woman's name, out of fear that his competitors would court her as well.)
Mr. Beahm sends up to five courting bouquets a week this time of year, with a retail value of $250 to $400 each, to women all over the city who are immersed in the charity social circuit and are selecting the decor for fall benefits. Doing flowers for the $1,000-a-plate dinners can make the career of an ambitious florist. Centerpieces that provoke oohs and ahhs among the guests can lead to contracts to provide arrangements at extravagant society weddings and Park Avenue dinner parties, and to fill the floral needs of hostesses like Carroll Petrie, who spends up to $20,000 a week in the summer filling her Southampton house with Casablanca lilies and white mixed blooms.
The "flower chairs" and those who advise them are the keys to this lucrative business, and they are courted in ways that go well beyond sending a free bouquet. Four florists discussed how, to win these women's favor, they provide flowers at discounts of 50 to 75 percent for the private needs of some of the city's wealthiest and most socially active hostesses. The largesse includes fresh flowers sent weekly to the women's homes, bouquets that they send to friends as thank-yous for dinner invitations and reductions of tens of thousands of dollars from the going price for their daughters' weddings.
The deep discounts are little known outside the world of the ultrasocial. "It's simply the way most of my friends keep fresh flowers in their houses year round," said Arlene Dahl, an actress who can be seen at many a Park Avenue dinner party. "It's like buying wholesale."
Ms. Dahl, who chooses the decor for the Oscar party for New York members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and for annual galas by the Pearl S. Buck Foundation and the New York Cancer Society, said that at this time of year, her apartment is abloom with courting bouquets. She considers it an innocuous form of petty bribery, she said, adding, "It's in the course of business."
She has not chosen florists for public events as a result of price breaks for her personal flowers, she said, but she knows others who do. In general, women who receive personal discounts say they see nothing unethical in choosing a florist for a public fund-raiser and receiving discounts for one's personal use.
The practice is related to the quiet but widespread convention that allows some of New York's best-dressed, most socially visible women, who are often most able to pay full price, to receive clothes free from designers, or have their homes furnished at a deep discount. "Doing an apartment for free or at 'a special price' is the only way for some newcomers to get the caliber of clients on their roster," said Mario Buatta, the interior decorator. "These women kind of sponsor you."
Polly Onet, a party planner with wide experience among the beau monde, agreed. "That's New York," she said. "Look at the girls we know who get all these cut-rate designer clothes, and they are loaded and they don't pay a dime, for clothes or jewelry. We see them every night, and they don't even dry-clean the clothes before they bring them back to the designer, and the designer doesn't care -- he is just happy that they are wearing the clothes."
Sharyn Mann, another object of Mr. Beahm's attention, is a well-connected social figure with homes in Manhattan and Quogue, N.Y., which she likes to keep well appointed with fresh blooms. "Flowers are your calling card," she said. "They represent you and your taste. Flowers are like angels blessing the room."
One day recently, Ms. Mann was showing Mr. Beahm pictures of a 28-acre island she and her husband, Stephen, an investment banker, had bought in Vero Beach, Fla. Sitting on the down-filled damask couch in the family room of her Fifth Avenue duplex, Ms. Mann said, "David is going to see the property before my husband." (Mr. Mann had approved the purchase sight unseen.) She turned to Mr. Beahm to say, "We must go to Vero Beach soon." Mr. Beahm agreed. With a blush on his cheeks and glee in his voice, he said, "I already have ideas of what we're going to do."
Mr. Beahm had that week filled Ms. Mann's living room overlooking Central Park with more than $600 worth of Kwanzan cherry blossoms and lilacs, at no cost. Ms. Mann, who was chairwoman of the Food Allergy Ball at the Plaza in December, hired him to do the flowers for the 70 tables at the event, which raised more than $2.2 million for charity. Ms. Mann introduced him to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Valerie Zilkha, Fe Fendi, Iris Love and CeCe Kieselstein-Cord.
"My head was spinning with all the contacts," he said.
"If you make the right people happy and then meet the right people, that hopefully is going to make the discount worthwhile," he added. By the same logic, he said he did the gala flowers for $20,000, with the cost covered by an anonymous sponsor, though the job was really worth more than $80,000.
Ms. Mann said it is natural for an up-and-coming florist to offer a discounted fee for a high-profile assignment like her gala. "He was just starting, unknown in New York, so it was understood if he was good to me, I in turn would be good to him by introducing him to everyone I know," she said. "I purposefully looked for someone just starting. Other people who are established and well known don't try that hard."
As for the flowers he provides for little or nothing for her apartment, she denied using her position with the gala for personal gain. "I have never asked for anything personally," she said. "Whatever David charges, we pay the bill." Even if that bill is sometimes nothing.
Another charity woman, who receives about $300 worth of peonies and roses for her home each week, paying only about $100, also defended the practice. "Look, what's wrong with receiving discounted flowers at home?" she said, sipping a cocktail during a "tailgate party" at the New York Auto Show to benefit the East Side Settlement House last month. This woman is not a flower chairwoman, but she has many prominent friends. "We are giving these boys a big opportunity," she said, "and you know, important people come to my home and see what they do."
In fact, many florists say they refuse to court socialites, either with the occasional sample floral display or with more valuable long-term discounts. "I know it goes on," said Helena Lehane, a floral designer who places arrangements every week in the homes of several Upper East Side billionaires. "I think integrity has something to do with it. I have preferred over my career not to court."
Those who do court justify it as good business sense. Gaige Clark, a co-owner of Spruce, whose clients include the model Amber Valletta and the actress Julianne Moore, said, "I do give special discounts to special clients."
"Doing business with them has helped our name get out there, considering who they are sending their flowers to: people in fashion, people in the film industry," Ms. Clark said.
Some florists never have to weigh the ethical or economic issues, because they are already so busy they don't have to offer discounts. Two designers, Robert Isabell and Philip Baloun, have long had a near duopoly on society parties and benefits, and both deny courting clients with personal discounts. In fact, hostesses sometimes grumble about their high prices. Donna Harvey, a senior account manager at George Trescher Associates, which organizes charity fund-raisers, said it was hard to stay within a budget when planning a party with one of the top-tier florists.
"They are very talented, but many times we have to look elsewhere for someone who is eager for the business," she said.
Lauren Veronis, another socialite involved in the charity world, is heavily courted by up-and-coming florists. "If you get a nod from Lauren Veronis, you're in for the long haul," one florist said.
Ms. Veronis, who was chairwoman this spring of a gala celebrating the 30th anniversary of Zubin Mehta's directorship of the Israel Philharmonic and a buffet dinner at the Four Seasons for the Irvington Institute for Immunological Research, is flattered by the sentiment. For both events, Ms. Veronis broke with the florist she has long favored, Mr. Isabell. "We used Robert for years, and he was wonderful," she said. "But it was time to move on and give the up-and-coming a chance."
For both events she chose David Tutera, a party planner in Mamaroneck, N.Y., who, she said, has not given her any discounts for personal flowers.
"The understanding always is when they do a big charity that there is no budget for the party," she said. "We want all of our proceeds to go to the basic research, so we're delighted to provide the audience for their work to give them big exposure. But in return they have to work below cost."
Mr. Tutera, whose clients include Clarissa Bronfman, several Tisch family members and Iris Cantor, said: "I don't exactly give them financial discounts. I give them more attention and hand-holding. Personally, I'm totally with them every step of the way and I make sure they get the best flowers.
"I know in the long run what I will receive if I give them a lot of attention. I know who is on their guest list. The secret to being successful in the society world in New York is all word of mouth, and I know what they can do for me if I give them a better product for a little less."
Another up-and-coming florist who does give Ms. Veronis a price break is Lisa Marie McWilliams, who said she provides flowers for the Veronis homes in New York and Southampton more than 40 times a year, for 40 percent less than the going rate. Ms. McWilliams said she was so grateful for the exposure her work receives because she is Ms. Veronis's florist that she would not think of charging more. Moreover, it is her way of repaying Ms. Veronis for encouraging her to leave a previous employer and go into business on her own. "I owe so much to her," said Ms. McWilliams, who has not handled any of the charity accounts Ms. Veronis oversees, but hopes to in the future.
Ms. Veronis said she had never asked Ms. McWilliams for a discount, and seemed unaware she was receiving one. "Whenever I use anyone personally, I have never received a reduction or asked for one," she said. "It would be inappropriate to expect something like that."
The hand-holding that florists provide is no small thing on the social circuit. Like fashion designers, interior designers and even some hairstylists, florists have gone from being members of a service class to escorts and dinner-party guests in some of the swankest company. At a gala for the Horticultural Society of New York on Tuesday, where the city's new and old society converged around 40 tables set with flowers by 48 designers, Suzette de Marigny Smith, a chairwoman of the event, described "the very special relationship" some people have with florists.
"They have to be little geniuses," she said. "They have to know more about you than your dressmaker and your interior decorator and your caterer."
Ms. de Marigny Smith, who was wearing a Sander Witlin gold lame dress with hand-painted irises and waving a gold wand, said some of the florists "are very amusing and attractive people, and they are good conversationalists, and they're just fun to have at parties -- like flowers."
Another coveted assignment for floral designers is the society wedding. Some admit that they are willing to offer huge discounts on jobs worth tens of thousands of dollars to have their work seen at its most extravagant by the right crowd.
Joanne de Guardiola, an interior designer who is a player in prominent charities like the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the New York Botanical Garden (she is fashion chairwoman of the garden's June gala), could have hired a name-brand florist for the wedding of her stepdaughter, Jeanne de Guardiola, next month. Instead, she is using Ms. McWilliams.
"This could be very big for me," Ms. McWilliams said. "There will be a lot of important people there who could very well recommend me for the next step, the charity parties." She said she would charge the family $50,000 to $75,000, less than half what a comparable job for another wedding would cost.
Ms. McWilliams, who speaks to Joanne de Guardiola every week, is planning a white and cobalt theme with lots of peonies for the wedding, which will be in Southampton and will be attended by 400.
Like many florists in her position, she must weigh how long she can continue in business without making a profit on some of her biggest jobs.
For Mr. Beahm, who said he lived hand to mouth despite consorting with the rich and powerful, the flower business is a dicey one indeed. "Personally, they'll spend as little as they can get away with," he said, referring to the women who ask him to send bouquets to friends as thank-yous for a dinner party or to mark a birthday. "The minimum I'll let someone get away with paying is $50, and yet they'll get a $250 bouquet. It's killing me. I have to remind these ladies all the time that I'm not the charity."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
Away From the Glare, Dow Corning Recovers Its Footing

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

DATELINE: MIDLAND, Mich.

 BODY:
GARY E. ANDERSON knows what most people think of when they hear the name Dow Corning: breast implants, and nothing else. And if Mr. Anderson, Dow Corning's chief executive, were an irritable kind of fellow, that would irk him mightily.
After all, Dow Corning makes 10,000 products for more than 30,000 customers, and it never derived more than 1 percent of its sales from breast implants. These days, operating earnings are growing robustly. 
 Yet the impact of implant-related class-action suits has kept Dow Corning operating under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws since 1995. And because Dow Corning is owned by the Dow Chemical Company and Corning Inc., not directly by shareholders, and because it sells no consumer products, neither the business press nor securities analysts have paid much attention to the company's recovery.
But irritability is not Mr. Anderson's style. A soft-spoken, easygoing man who does not wait for Fridays to dress casually, he patiently discusses the implant issue when asked.
No, Dow did not lose customers, suppliers or employees when the implant debacle hit. Yes, he stands by subsequent studies that absolve silicone from blame in autoimmune and other diseases. Yes, he had hoped that Dow Corning would have emerged from bankruptcy by now, but no, it probably will not for another couple of years.
Only after answering such questions does Mr. Anderson turn to the subject that really makes his juices flow: Dow Corning's mainstay silicone business.
"We sell something to every SIC code," Mr. Anderson said, referring to a common classification system for industries.
SMALL wonder. Silicones are remarkably inert materials; they do not conduct electricity, they are resistant to heat and cold, and they don't react with most chemicals. They are thus ideal insulators, protectants and additives.
Dow Corning routinely pumps about 8 percent of sales into research -- a high percentage for a materials company -- and its roster of patents and products keeps swelling. Its silicones add a soft, nongreasy feel to skin lotions and help shampoos leave behind high-gloss hair. They provide leak-proof seals for automobile engines and coatings for air bags.
The company just introduced a new line of silicone adhesives and protective sealants that make it possible to reduce the size of computer chips without risk that they will short out. The latest PlayStation from Sony already uses the chips, and Dow Corning executives predict that the semiconductor market, now accounting for about 2 percent of sales, will bring as much as 15 percent of sales and 20 percent of profits by 2004.
The specter of huge settlements over the breast implant issue keeps Dow Corning in bankruptcy. But as Siegfried Haberer, a 30-year Dow Corning veteran and now its executive vice president, said, "I haven't seen major impact from the bankruptcy on our business in the last five years, and I don't think I'll see it in the next five."
Dow Corning's fiscal health -- not to mention a study last year that seemed to clear breast implants in health problems -- infuriates its legal antagonists. Sybil Niden Goldrich, co-founder of the Command Trust Network, which distributes silicone implant information, and a self-described "silicone breast implant survivor," has long been critical of the scientific studies of implants. "It seems unfair that you can do business as usual under the protection of bankruptcy," she said.
IN one sense, the same factors that have kept Dow Corning's rebound a secret have given it a certain immunity to public anger. Started in 1943 by Dow Chemical and Corning, it has never had to contend with skittish shareholders. And because its customers are other businesses, its sales have not been affected by any emotional backlash. "The guy ordering silicone sealants isn't thinking of negative public relations," said J. Jeffrey Cianci, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read.
Mr. Anderson said customers have rallied round him. "I got tons of reassuring calls from customers and suppliers," he said. "You could tell they were thinking, 'There but for the grace of God go I.' "
There has been no mass flight of employees; in fact, the list has grown with newcomers -- including many women.
"Of course I'm sympathetic to the women who've gone through this," said Denise L. Wiggins, who joined as global marketing communications manager in 1997. "But during the interviews, I got the sense of a company with high integrity and a solid base of employees. The breast implant situation just wasn't top of mind for me."
That "situation" has given Dow Corning a rough financial ride, though. Before its bankruptcy filing, the company took nearly $2 billion in pretax charges to reflect its liability under an industrywide settlement agreement. As of Dec. 31, 1999, Dow Corning was named in 25,000 pending lawsuits.
To make matters worse, the Asian economic meltdown sent Dow Corning's sales and profits into a nosedive in 1998. Its revenues have been stuck at around $2.6 billion for the last three years.
Still, last year the company was back to $220 million in operating income -- a nice rebound from the $831 million operating loss in 1998. And net income was back to $109.7 million, a lot better than the net loss of $598 million in 1998.
"If Dow Corning were publicly traded, it would be one of the better-regarded specialty chemical companies on the street," said Mark Gulley, an analyst with Banc of America Securities.
Dow Corning's parents have offered not just sympathy, but empathy. Dow Chemical, after all, went through its own tumult when dioxin, a byproduct of its defoliant Agent Orange, was branded a health hazard.
"We told them, get some high-level people to focus on the implant issue, and let everyone else focus on the rest of the business," said William S. Stavropoulos, chief executive of Dow Chemical. In fact, in 1992 Keith McKennon, a Dow Chemical executive who had coordinated much of Dow's public response to the Agent Orange litigation, joined Dow Corning as interim chief executive. One of the first things he did was to plead the company's case on "Larry King Live."
Both Dow Chemical and Corning emphatically deny persistent rumors that Corning is losing interest in the venture and that Dow will buy its share. "Dow Corning has focused all of its energies on one field of science, and we're enjoying the fruits of that, so why mess with it?" Mr. Stavropoulos said.
Corning, meanwhile, has moved heavily into fiber optics, an area that makes great use of silicone coatings. Thus, Dow Corning's products "are in high demand in many of the same growth markets Corning is pursuing," said Keith Horn, technical director of organic materials in Corning's science and technology group.
But one high-growth industry is conspicuously absent from Dow Corning's to-do list. The company is soured, perhaps forever, on medical applications, which in 1990 represented 7 percent of sales. Dow Corning sold its line of implants for knees, hips and the like soon after the first breast implant suits, and has scuttled research into synthetic skin, eye fluids and artificial eyes.
"We could have continued the evolution toward a bionic person, so society has lost out," Mr. Anderson said. "But until trial lawyers are reined in, and we get better laws, it's just not worth the aggravation of making anything that goes into the body."

HEADLINE: SENIORITY;
A Lost Generation Seeks Its Due

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach and arrival of retirement appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
DURING a lunch last month with Ann A. Fishman, a marketing consultant on generational issues, I had the eerie feeling that she had been reading my resume -- or my mind.
She was talking about the characteristics of the so-called silent generation -- people too young to have struggled through much of the Great Depression and fought in World War II, but too old to be baby boomers. The "silents," less numerous than the generations they are sandwiched between, are often overlooked by advertisers and other purveyors of popular culture who are obsessed with appealing to teenagers, young adults, boomers or the elderly. 
 This goes a long way toward explaining why I can surf through scores of cable channels and find so little to watch. It also tells me why a movie I like runs in theaters for only about 15 minutes, or why only one or two copies of it are stocked at the video store.
"The G.I. generation gets attention, and rightly so, because of its role in World War II; the boomers get attention because of their numbers," said Ms. Fishman, who is president of the Generational-Targeted Marketing Corporation, based in New Orleans. "History has forced the silents, members of a transitional generation, to be overlooked."
Members of the silent generation are now in their mid-50's to mid-70's. A total of 49 million of them were born, compared with 79 million boomers (who would now be in their early 40's to mid-50's) and 63 million of the G.I. generation (now in their mid-70's to late 90's), according to "Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069," by William Strauss and Neil Howe (William Morrow, 1991).
Ms. Fishman, who has also served as a fellow with the Senate Special Committee on Aging, is careful to note that not everyone in a generational group is alike, but they do tend to share certain characteristics. "The G.I. generation, for instance, is a generation of doers who believe the good life has to be earned," she said. "Baby boomers tend to be self-absorbed and rebellious against authority; they were the main force in the antiwar movement in the Vietnam era. Silents have always done the right things. They did what their parents told them. They are reliable and show up for work on time. Silents tend to be helpers and teachers, and their generation has produced most of the great civil rights leaders -- but not a president."
AS the silents age, many are beginning to panic, because they have never had a great adventure. They were not called on to save the world, as the G.I. generation was, and they have not been as wrapped up in satisfying themselves as the boomers have been.
"They think they are due," Ms. Fishman said. "They want more of a taste of life. Many see it as now or never."
That now-or-never feeling is one reason that many workers in their late 50's and early 60's are choosing to retire early and to proceed on their own terms -- perhaps in other work -- in what some experts call a second middle age, made possible partly by advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles. And, thanks to the long economic boom, many of them can afford it.
Joe Taylor, who will be 56 next month, retired last May from a career as a school psychologist in Corydon, Ind., to start a woodworking business in his home.
"I didn't do this for the money," Mr. Taylor said. "I was tired of what I had been doing and wanted to do something more creative. I find woodwork satisfying. People enjoy what I make."
Mr. Taylor is keenly aware of the role that history can play in shaping generations. When he was in college in the early 1960's, he used a student deferment to avoid being drafted and sent to Vietnam. "I regret that to this day," he said. "I missed my war."
People like Mr. Taylor should serve as a wake-up call to corporations and other employers who often overlook silent-generation workers. Ms. Fishman contends that unless companies move aggressively to retain the silents, they risk losing valuable workers who are at the peak of their expertise.
"They also risk losing valuable mentors who help them retain younger workers," she said. "The Generation Xers, whom companies complain they can't keep, get along much better with the silents than with boomers. Gen Xers like being mentored because it gives them a sense of family, which many are lacking. So silents are not only the top performers in the workplace, they are a key to retaining younger workers."
One way to keep silents on the job, she suggested, is to offer work schedules that allow blocks of time off -- perhaps three or four months a year -- for adventure or self-fulfillment.
Mr. Taylor likes that idea. "If my school had offered me something like that," he said, "presumably at a reduced salary, I would have stayed on."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: John Montgomery;
Bridgeway Ultra-Small Company Portfolio

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
ON Sunday mornings, John Montgomery plays the flute with a folk-rock group at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Houston. On Tuesday evenings, he rehearses for three hours with the group's vocalists and other musicians. "We could really use a drummer," he complains.
A former research engineer at M.I.T., Mr. Montgomery, who is 44, sees his music as complementary to the computer-based calculations he uses to pick stocks for the $42 million Bridgeway Ultra-Small Company Portfolio. "Math is the underlying language of music," he said. 
 The Ultra-Small fund has turned in some sweet results, returning 23.3 percent a year, annualized, for the three years through April 30, versus 8.2 percent for its peers in the small value category, according to Morningstar Inc., and 15.2 percent for the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks.
Mr. Montgomery came to money management by an unlikely route. In 1985, he joined the Houston transit system as a senior budget analyst and during his off-hours developed computer models to manage his investments. He said that in 1990 and 1991, his last years there, his investment earnings far exceeded his modest salary. In 1993, he started Bridgeway Capital Management, which now manages a total of $135 million in four actively managed funds, two index funds and a dozen private accounts.
Mr. Montgomery's background in budgeting leads him to run his firm economically. The firm does not advertise, for example. And because Mr. Montgomery does not allow personal trading by his firm's seven employees, Bridgeway has no need for a compliance officer to monitor their investments.
Moreover, by negotiating with brokerage firms, he has trimmed the average commission the fund pays to just a penny a share. The average such expense is 6 cents.
MANAGERS of successful small-cap stock funds generally face a problem: their funds are flooded with cash, forcing them to buy bigger stocks. In Mr. Montgomery's view, a small-cap fund is easily managed as long as its total assets do not exceed the average market capitalization of the stocks it owns. So he closed the fund to new investors in June 1998, when assets reached $27.5 million; he plans to shut it to all new investments, including those by existing shareholders, when assets hit $55 million, the fund's current average market capitalization.
That market cap is still far smaller than that of the typical small-cap fund. Mr. Montgomery focuses his search for stocks on the smallest 10 percent of issues on the New York Stock Exchange, but also picks from among 2,000 very small stocks in an index created by the Center for Research in Securities Prices, which tracks the smallest stocks traded on the Big Board, the American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.
In choosing stocks, Mr. Montgomery never visits companies or meets with their management. Instead, he uses five proprietary computer models, the details of which he is loathe to discuss.
He does say, however, that four of the models review fundamental data like per-share earnings growth and cash flow; the fifth analyzes technical factors like trading volume and relative price appreciation. Each model is used to pick a list of 10 stocks; the names sometimes overlap.
"We're a black box shop," he said in a slight Texas drawl. "We put the data in and the computer cranks it out."
The portfolio is filled with cheap stocks: its typical price-to-earnings ratio is in the low to mid-teens, though its three-year earnings growth rate averages 36 percent a year.
Mr. Montgomery runs the technical model monthly. Three of the fundamental screens highlight value-oriented stocks and are run weekly. The fourth, which looks for attractive growth stocks, is run daily.
The fund owns about 160 stocks, giving it a degree of diversification that dampens the inherent risks of investing in the smallest stocks, he said. Typically, he sells stocks when they no longer meet his models' criteria, or when the models produce better candidates.
AMONG the stocks he likes is Team America, a Worthington, Ohio, company that provides payroll, retirement plan management and other human resources services to business. Its per-share earnings, cash flow and sales have been strong, he said, but the company's share price is "dirt cheap," in part because of an acquisition-related charge taken last year.
As the company moves forward, Mr. Montgomery said, the share price could double in the next 12 months. He bought shares in May 1999 at $4.78; they closed at $4.50 on Friday, 16 times his 2000 earnings estimate of 28 cents a share.
Another favorite is the Howell Corporation, an integrated oil and gas company in Houston. "Oil prices are way up, and its stock price is dead in the water," he said. But because its cash flow was $3 a share last year, he said, "you could earn your price back with cash flow alone in less than three years."
Mr. Montgomery, who bought shares last July at $6.50, predicts three-year earnings growth of 15 percent a year, on average. The shares closed Friday at $7.1875, or 4.5 times his earnings estimate of $1.60 a share this year.
He also likes Lifemark, a health maintenance organization in Phoenix. "The industry as a whole is cheap," he said, "but this company is doing great."
He noted that the company has doubled its annual per-share earnings for three consecutive years. Wall Street expects earnings growth to average 30 percent a year for the next five years.
He bought shares in October 1998 at $4.375; it closed Friday at $4, or 6 times analysts' consensus earnings of 65 cents a share for the fiscal year ending in May 2001.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
The Case Against Retail Stocks

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
SPEND, spend and then spend some more. Americans have always liked to shop. But over the last couple of years, consumers in this country have been buying at an unprecedented rate.
With all that stuff flying off the shelves, you would think that retailing stocks would be in great shape. From the start of 1998 until the end of 1999, that assessment would have been correct: the S. & P. retail stores index nearly doubled. 
 But since then the group has been a bust. The index is down 15 percent this year.
A good chunk of that decline began on Wednesday, when a team of analysts at Goldman Sachs cut its ratings on many retailing stocks. George Strachan, a Goldman vice president, was in the group that issued the report. He took time last week to talk about why he has turned cautious. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
 
Q. Since so many stocks were involved in this downgrade, your shift in opinion seems based on macro environment factors. Is that the case?
 
A. Yes, this is a macro call. It is not based on what the companies are doing today, and the fundamentals still look pretty good.
We look at a number of leading indicators that power spending growth. One is real wage growth, which peaked in April 1998 at 3.4 percent, and has now decelerated to 1.3 percent.
The second is housing turnover, which also peaked in the spring of 1998 at a growth rate of 16.1 percent. Currently it is declining at a 7.6 percent annual rate. That means fewer and fewer new and existing homes are being sold, even though the level of activity is still very high.
The third factor we look at is installment credit, which is growing at the same rate it did a year ago.
With personal consumption spending growing at somewhere between 5 percent and 6 percent and all these indicators heading south, we felt we would probably see a deceleration in retail sales growth in the second half of the year. That's why we cut our ratings.
Q. Could you give some insight into the anatomy of your decision?
 
A. Well, there were six people involved in this call. We have been watching these indicators for a year and a half.
I may have let the decision to downgrade these stocks slide a little bit because of the market, and because from an absolute perspective real wage growth at 2 percent was not so bad. But it is lower now, and we decided it was now more appropriate to be cautious.
 
Q. The Federal Reserve has been raising short-term rates, and is likely to raise them some more. Was that a factor?
A. We don't see much, if any, correlation between change in the federal funds rate and changes in real personal consumption expenditure. If I am on my way to Wal-Mart and I hear the Fed has raised the funds rate, the information doesn't change my behavior a bit. We are six months into a rising rate environment and spending hasn't slowed a whit.
Q. How much of a slowdown do you see?
 
A. We think we will see a deceleration in the growth of personal consumption expenditures from about 5.7 percent currently to around 4 percent. Now, 4 percent is a pretty decent level of growth. In an expansion you normally see personal consumption growth average about 3 percent. So that deceleration may not be enough to satisfy the Fed.
 
Q. And yet since the start of the year the stocks have been weak. Are retailing stocks projecting a slowdown in the economy?
 
A. I wouldn't say retailing stocks have been leading indicators of economic slowdowns.
We had an early cyclical move in the stocks in early 1991, and then they underperformed for a couple of years. What has made retailing interesting in this cycle has been the rise in personal consumption alongside the problems in Asia, which slowed exports and industrial production. That generated a late cycle rally. Everyone wanted to own Wal-Mart, for example, because it had little Asian exposure. The growth names had a marvelous late cycle move, which is uncharacteristic.
 
Q. What other retailers are growth stocks?
 
A. In addition to Wal-Mart, Costco, Target Stores and Kohl's are the pure growth stocks in my sector. Tiffany is another growth stock, but I don't cover it.
A lot of these stocks have outperformed the market by as much as 80 percent over the last two years. And I think these five stocks will continue to provide market leadership. They still have tremendous growth opportunities in front of them.
 
Q. Which are you less enthusiastic about?
 
A. We cut our ratings on Federated Department Stores, May Department Stores, Neiman-Marcus, Abercrombie & Fitch, TJX and Ross Stores to market performer from market outperformer.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
Of Forty-Niners, Oilmen And the Dot-Com Boom

BYLINE: By PATRICIA NELSON LIMERICK; Patricia Nelson Limerick, author of "Something in the Soil: Legacies and Reckonings in the New West" (W.W. Norton, 2000), is a professor of history and chairwoman of the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado at Boulder. She is president of the Western History Association.

 BODY:
MOST financial writers, groping for historic precedents to explain the dot-com boom, cite foreign events, like the tulip mania and the South Sea Bubble. But the most important precursors are those episodes in American history that exemplify our passion for seeking fortune and adventure in new territory. Mining and drilling, in particular, have set a mood that has never disappeared from the West. It is the attitude of extractive industry -- get in, get rich, get out.
The distinctions between mining or panning for gold, drilling for oil and founding or investing in a dot-com are great. Founding a modern technology company, especially, may depend on expertise of a sort alien to the earlier venturers. They trusted luck and intuition. But the parallels remain striking. 
 Like the Internet boom, the California Gold Rush of 1849 was also a huge media event. It dominated national attention and it fixed certain expectations in the American mind-set: fortunes for the finding, riches waiting for men with the right pluck to come seize them.
Guidebooks, newspapers and rumor all publicized, and often exaggerated, the riches to be made out West. Susan Lee Johnson, in "Roaring Camp: The Social World of the California Gold Rush" (New York: W. W. Norton, 1999), recounts how men left the familiar bricks and mortar, or at least the wooden logs and shingles, of home, family and farm, for a world turned upside down, where few of the old norms applied.
Many were disappointed, and many disgusted. "All are here for money," the forty-niner Peter Decker wrote in "The Diaries of Peter Decker: Overland to California in 1849 and Life in the Mines, 1850-51," edited by Helen S. Giffen (Talisman Press, 1966). "The importance of the dollar and the might of an ounce are studied, sought for in every possible way. In short the sociable man is lost in the money-seeking gold-hunting selfish acquisitive miser and conniving millionaire."
Henry David Thoreau dismissed arguments that the extreme exertions of many gold prospectors gave them a moral right to their riches. "It is not enough to tell me that you worked hard to get your gold," he wrote. "So does the Devil work hard."
In fact, the California mining boom provided the occasion for a national debate about wealth, as the historian David Goodman demonstrated in "Gold Seeking: Victoria and California in the 1850's" (Stanford University Press, 1994). Ministers warned that the explosion of riches would corrupt the national character (warnings that appear to be muted or absent today).
Ten years later, the spirit of the California rush ruled over the petroleum boom in western Pennsylvania. There, one well returned $15,000 for each dollar invested, as Daniel Yergin recounts in "The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power" (Simon & Schuster, 1991). "The oil and land excitement in this section has already become an epidemic," according to an 1865 citation from one local editor. "Land, leases, contracts, refusals, deeds, agreements, interests and all that sort of talk is all they can comprehend. All our habits, and notions, and associations for half a century are turned topsy-turvy in the headlong rush for riches." But, the editor predicted, "the big bubble will burst sooner or later." This painful lesson was learned by many investors in the hundreds of oil companies that went public.
IN Texas, the Spindletop gusher of 1901 set off such a frenzy of exploration and trading in shares that the discovery also became known as "Swindletop." In two years, land prices rose from $10 an acre to as much as $900,000. But the inevitable glut lowered a barrel of oil to 3 cents.
Succeeding Texas booms enshrined the wildcatter in history and novels, television and film. But even into the 1980's, a collapse in oil prices could cause personal bankruptcies and a deep regional recession.
To test my notions about the ties connecting the nation's past to the present, especially in the West, I spoke with Charles Scoggin, a board member at the Center of the American West, a doctor and a high-technology entrepreneur. He is currently on his fourth start-up, called Medrock, a company intended to help consumers find the best health care.
Leaving conventional employment -- in his case, as a medical school professor -- and starting a business, Dr. Scoggin said, can deliver a sensation much like the Gold Rush experience of leaving friends, families, and familiar circumstances behind.
Like a forty-niner chronically wondering if his decision to leave for California was an awful misjudgment, today's entrepreneur, he said, lives with what he calls "the terror that you might be wrong." Those people who choose not to take such risks, or those who stay at home in more comfortable if less promising circumstances, give the adventurer a heavy dose of envy and resentment.
Failed or even moderately successful gold prospectors wondered whether their families and friends would welcome them back. Today, individuals less successful than my friend wonder whether the old-economy companies they left will take them back once their start-ups collapse.
Dr. Scoggin said exaggerated investment claims, wild speculative swings, predatory investors' taking advantage of the little guy's work, fights over claims (read "patent disputes"), constant tests of endurance and adaptability, and a custom of casual dress that makes it difficult to read status at a glance were features of both booms.
More generally, acknowledging the kinship between the Gold Rush and the Start-Up Rush could give today's business innovators cause for reflection, if the declines in many dot-com stocks haven't already.
Dr. Scoggin responded in hearty agreement to the comments of Decker and Thoreau. But he says many entrepreneurs today are driven not only by money but also by the intellectual and personal challenge of innovation. "Good capitalists get paid for solving problems," he said. Providing a service that solves a problem, he noted, is "a lot different than digging a hole in the ground and blundering upon something."
But even some of those who blundered upon something invested talent, intelligence and loyalty in their new communities, contrary to the "get in and get out" mode. When the forty-niner Peter Decker died in 1888, the Marysville, Calif., newspaper gave him an epitaph that anyone could envy: "Success in accumulation of wealth makes many men arrogant and pretentious, but it had no such effect upon Mr. Decker."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
The New Sheenof Municipal Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
EVERY so often, most strikingly when Congress gets agitated about the nation's tax structure, the market for municipal bonds sags, driving yields to lip-smacking levels. Challenges to the bonds' tax-exempt status typically loom much larger in investors' eyes than a possible benefit from the scarcity that would be created by action in Washington.
This time, however, returns on municipals have been elevated by economic fundamentals -- mainly the necessity of competing with the stock market and the near certainty that interest rates -- already raised five times by the Federal Reserve since mid-1999 -- will climb even further. 
 The federal government's budget surplus, meanwhile, is shrinking the supply of Treasury bonds even as growing numbers of refugees from stock-market gyrations are seeking a haven; both forces are driving down returns on Treasury debt.
A result is the unusual situation of long-term municipal bonds that pay tax-free interest yielding just as much, or even a bit more, than taxable Treasury bonds.
"Long-term munis and long Treasuries are basically yielding the same thing," said William Hornbarger, fixed-income strategist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. For many investors, he added, "that's a no-brainer" situation.
To be sure, no municipality or other tax-exempt issuer matches the United States Treasury for credit quality, but the difference is less than many investors imagine. In fact, roughly half of municipals carry insurance, making credit comparisons of little practical consequence.
Until about a year ago, according to Alexandra Lebenthal, president of a family-owned New York firm that specializes in municipal bonds, municipals were considered attractive when long-term yields as measured by the Bond Buyer's Index reached 85 percent of those on Treasury bonds. Now, with the ratio above 90 percent for the highest-quality debt and approaching 100 percent for lesser but still investment-quality bonds, "it's a fantastic time for the individual" buyer to scoop up tax-exempts, she said.
For example, a recently marketed New York State Dormitory Authority issue rated Baa-1 and BBB+ yields about 6 percent in a maturity as short as 10 years. That return is equivalent to a taxable investment generating 9.34 percent for a New York resident earning $150,000 and filing a joint return. Ten-year triple-A bonds yield 5.25 percent, equal to a taxable 8.17 percent.
Most people, though, don't bother with fancy calculations even when sophisticated, state-specific translation tables are available, like the one at the Bond Market Association's Web site, investinginbonds.com.
"The individual investor looks at absolute yield," said Dan Keating, a senior managing director at Bear, Stearns.
A 6 percent coupon is "magic," Ms. Lebenthal added.
Moreover, quality "has probably never been better," according to a study by Merrill Lynch, whose analysts found that upgrades by rating agencies have far exceeded downgrades for the last four years as city, state and authority budgets improved, with the best performance in 1999.
Although mutual funds that invest in municipal bonds had substantial outflows in the second half of last year -- aggravated by redemptions to establish losses for tax savings, of all things -- specialists say the appeal of municipal bonds is broadening.
"It's not just 70-year-old people" any longer, said Jane Trust, who runs four tax-exempt funds for Legg Mason Trust in Baltimore.
Mr. Hornbarger concurred, pointing to stock-market and entrepreneurial profits being redirected to the tax-free market. "We're seeing more and more younger people in their 30's and 40's," he said. "It's part of their asset allocation strategy."
And municipals have become easier to buy, with many state and local issuers insisting on a special retail order period to give individuals first crack at bonds. Moreover, increasing competition has sharply cut insurance premiums, reducing the cost to 10 or 15 basis points (or $1 to $1.50 per $1,000), from 40 or 50 a decade ago. The savings have mostly been passed on to investors in the form of higher yields.
Yet another attraction of munis is their ability to provide portfolio ballast when stocks are in turmoil. "Their volatility is significantly lower -- that is the real edge to municipals," said Michael Shamosh, chief fixed-income strategist for Tucker Anthony Inc. Throughout financial history, he said, munis swing only one-fourth as widely as stocks and half as widely as Treasury bonds, he said.
But what is the smart strategy, given that most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to keep tightening the monetary screws at least through midyear, a trend that overwhelms the downward pressure on rates from a shrinking supply of new bonds?
Most experts suggest deferring purchases of longer-term bonds and buying only those that come due fairly soon, say within a year or two but perhaps in as little as a few weeks or months. The idea is to preserve the chance to reinvest at progressively higher rates rather than being locked into current levels.
It doesn't take much to persuade most investors of the wisdom of that approach, since the municipal yield curve -- the progression of rates through the maturity spectrum -- provides relatively little extra payment for lengthening one's commitment.
"I like the short term if you have to put money to work," Mr. Keating said. "I'd stay within one to five years' maturity."
BUT Mr. Shamosh takes a different view. "You want to get out of the Fed's reach," he said. This suggests buying maturities that are affected relatively little by the Fed's rate increases, those due, say, between 6 and 20 years, in the conviction that the central bank will eventually succeed in slowing down the economy. This, in turn, would reassure the market that inflation -- the worry of long-term investors -- will be kept in check.
Investors should always have some short-term investments for liquidity, Mr. Shamosh said, but longer-term munis are what should be added to a sensible person's portfolio. "The Fed," he said, "doesn't have any control over the long rates, which could come down," enhancing the value of such bonds.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Globalization: Unspeakable, Yes, but Is It Really Evil?

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
THE media coverage has faded. The tripartite enforcers of global capitalism -- the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization -- still make loans and settle trade disputes. But the protesters who rang the alarm about global economics in Seattle and in Washington left a distinct legacy: they made globalization a naughty word.
Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund, says world leaders will have to come up with another way of describing economic integration if the idea is ever to become popular again. Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury secretary, delivered a long address on world development policies recently without so much as mentioning the term. 
 Among both mainstream economists and their left-leaning critics, it has become axiomatic that globalization leaves too many poor people behind. At best, it is described as a blunt instrument for growth that inflicts collateral damage on people who do not have the education or resources to defend themselves. At worst, it actually increases poverty, worsens social divisions and shifts power from people and governments to multinational corporations.
Mark Weisbrot, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington whose writings are part of the protesters' intellectual canon, argues that globalization, as defined by the American government and the Washington-based lending institutions, has systematically failed to help poor countries grow wealthy.
"No nation has ever pulled itself out of poverty under the conditions that Washington currently imposes on underdeveloped countries," he says.
That assertion is disputed, of course, but less vigorously than might be expected. The idea that globalization has done more to help the haves than the have-nots has become economically correct -- a litmus test for progressive internationalists.
A growing body of evidence does suggest that 1990's-style global integration did far less to relieve poverty and inequality than its early supporters predicted. But the record also shows that the process is probably less economically harmful than some critics maintain.
The World Bank recently released one of the few comprehensive attempts to assess the impact of globalization. The bank, a leading target of some protesters, has also been flagellating itself recently, pledging to become a more effective poverty fighter. And its report, "Assessing Globalization," is less than cheery.
The report found than progress on poverty reduction has been glacial. The number of people in extreme poverty -- surviving on $1 a day or less -- fell only slightly from 1990 to 1998, from 1.3 billion to 1.2 billion. The population in developing countries increased during that period, so the change in percentage terms was somewhat greater, from 29 percent to 24 percent.
The only region of the world where poverty declined much was East Asia -- from 27.6 percent to 15.3 percent. It barely budged in sub-Saharan Africa and actually increased in the former Soviet bloc.
The report also found that many nations that opened their doors widest to foreign trade saw income accrue mostly to the rich. China, the United States and Latin America all had bigger gaps between rich and poor by the end of the decade.
The figures help explain why few people these days talk about globalization as if it were a new Enlightenment. But if the era of globalization has hardly been one of universal prosperity, it is probably too early to conclude that economic integration is actually to blame for stubborn poverty.
The report finds plenty of support for the premise that economic growth is the best antidote to poverty, and that the most open nations are usually, though not always, the fastest growers, whether wealthy or poor.
It also finds some nations where the gap between rich and poor narrowed, rather than widened, as reliance on trade grew. That suggests, at a minimum, that the correlation between economic integration and social inequality is inexact. Other factors -- effective government policies, strong labor laws -- are also at work.
In fact, the only safe conclusion about globalization's impact may be that no sweeping conclusion is possible. East Asia and the former Soviet bloc, for example, both globalized extensively in the 1990's, to diametrically opposed economic results.
Or consider another example. Incomes in both African and Latin American nations were growing faster before globalization took hold than they have lately. But it's hard to say globalization is to blame, since Latin America has opened wide to trade and investment recently, but Africa has by some measures become less open.
The protesters were right -- globalization is no panacea. But neither does it seem to be the disease some critics claim.

HEADLINE: Loss and Anger Inspire Mother to March

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WESTMINSTER, Md.

 BODY:
When her son was shot to death by another child showing off his father's 9-millimeter pistol at playtime, Carole Price decided to seek some rustic peace in the country.
"We moved here to get away from everything," said Mrs. Price, wearing a lapel-pin photo of her beaming 13-year-old son, John. He was shot in the head two years ago in a Baltimore suburb by a 9-year-old neighbor who thought the gun was empty when he found it resting alluringly in his father's night stand. 
 "But we did not realize what we were moving into out here," Mrs. Price said. She now clearly knows, she said, sure as her son was one of 12 children killed daily by gunshot in the United States, that there is no way to escape the harrowing aberrations of the gun culture.
Dotting the byways of the rolling green countryside here in Carroll County, near the Pennsylvania border, Mrs. Price, 37, soon began noticing postings by gun clubs and enthusiasts for frequent weekend shooting contests. "Then I saw that the Republican county committee was raffling off a 9-millimeter handgun for a political fund-raiser," she said. "I went through the roof."
Accordingly, with two remaining children to protect, Mrs. Price soon became one of the state organizers of the Million Mom March, scheduled for May 14 in Washington. A promised throng of hundreds of thousands there and in 59 other cities will issue a unified demand in the name of Mother's Day that politicians find the will to regulate guns and their users as thoroughly as automobiles and drivers are regulated.
After dealing with exaggerated crowd estimates and warnings of disruption at the recent World Bank protest in Washington, officials there are saying the Mother's Day march could prove the real sleeper protest of the spring marching season. The multicity crowds from all manner of family, kith and kin are determined to force the gun control issue higher up the political agenda, led by mothers wheeling offspring toward Capitol Hill in phalanxes of strollers.
A counterdemonstration, the Armed Informed Mothers March, is being promised in several cities by Second Amendment Sisters, a pro-gun women's group newly formed in Dallas (www.sas-aim.org). Million Mom organizers say they welcome the challenge as a chance to let politicians measure where the sympathies of most women lie.
The Washington organizers are emphasizing that Mother's Day originated after the Civil War not as some nosegay commemorative day but as a practical calling from the heart for mothers in the sundered nation to take care of one another's wounded sons. Mrs. Price reflects some battlefield grit of her own.
"That 9-millimeter they raffled off was the same kind of gun my child died from, and here were my representatives fund-raising with one," she said, explaining how her organizational fury came to be stoked by the sight of elected county officials making an American political gala of a handgun raffle.
In fact, the organizers claimed a far larger booty than expected, happily telling Mrs. Price that it was because she organized a protest of a half-dozen friends and relatives and attracted extra publicity.
"They were coming out and calling us communists and saying, 'You made us a lot of money,' " Mrs. Price said. "One guy screamed in my face to get out of town." The flinty mother smiled tightly at this idea as the very last thing she would ever do. "I don't understand what they're scared of about me," she said.
"The best thing is I've got three buses going from Carroll County," she said of 150 local people signed up for the Washington march. "Not many men; it's the women, and a lot of them are saying, 'I hope my husband doesn't find out.' "
Mrs. Price hopes they do, for the goal of the organizers is nothing less than to drive gun control as the decisive issue in the presidential and Congressional elections.
Nine months ago, the idea of the march was broached by Donna Dees-Thomases, a New Jersey mother, in Internet chats among women appalled by the relentless pace of child shootings. The organizers rallied round the searing image of terrified youngsters holding hands and running for their lives in a day camp shooting in the Granada Hills section of Los Angeles on Aug. 10.
"It steals your heart and your soul when you lose your child," said Mrs. Price, who is hoping for something far more compelling from women voters this year than the usual "soccer mom" bromides.
"I figure 10,000 alone from Maryland," said Mrs. Price, noting Washington is the recommended destination for anyone within a 10-hour journey. More distant protesters are advised by the march headquarters (www.millionmommarch.com) to join parallel protests in scores of regional capitals across the nation.
"We're telling the politicians we're serious; we don't want to bury any more of our kids," Mrs. Price said.

How Killer B-to-B's Went Into A Tailspin

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI 

 BODY:
GOING into the week of April 10, the shareholders of the Vignette Corporation had more reason than most to be optimistic about its stock price. The company's new series of e-commerce software programs was about to be introduced, and a 3-for-1 stock split was to take effect that week.
But the optimism evaporated quickly. The stock was pummeled as technology shares continued their monthlong collapse that week. It fell even further when the split took effect that Friday -- the day that inflation worries knocked the floor out from under the Nasdaq. Vignette finished at $42.25, down 37 percent for the week and 57 percent from its high of $99 on March 10. 
 Jeff Wrona, portfolio manager of the $3.02 billion PBHG Technology and Communications fund, watched the price dive and felt "painfully sick" -- sicker than perhaps any other Vignette shareholder, save the software maker's executives. Vignette, a company that Mr. Wrona said has great prospects for both long- and short-term growth, represented his largest e-commerce software holding "by far."
In the days that followed, Mr. Wrona and others asked themselves a question: What exactly to do with the business-to-business e-commerce stocks they had poured so much money into in the previous months?
Business-to-business, or b-to-b, Internet stocks had restored e-commerce's good name in investor circles this spring. They did so during an abysmal showing by business-to-consumer Internet stocks like eToys, CDNow and scores of others that had basked in Nasdaq's glow last year, but collapsed in value amid disappointing Christmas performances. Indeed, a casual observer, looking at the performance of the two stock groups, might have thought that investors were shoveling the cash they had pulled out of eToys -- which fell by half from Dec. 31 to March 10 -- into the Vignettes of the world.
Just as quickly, though, the b-to-b group turned into the prime killing ground for overvalued technology stocks. The Merrill Lynch B2B Internet Holdrs Trust, a security that tracks 20 such companies, fell 68.6 percent from March 10 through April 14. Over that period, the Nasdaq composite fell 34.2 percent.
There were a couple of reasons for the severity of the sell-off. One was the outrageously high prices to which many of the stocks had rocketed. The Internet Capital Group, an incubator for industry-specific b-to-b marketplaces, went public at $12 in August and screamed to an intraday high of $212 a share on Dec. 22. A dozen b-to-b stocks -- including Internet Capital, Ariba, Commerce One and PurchasePro -- which were not yet public before the middle of last year -- had soared to garner $125 billion of market capitalization between them in roughly six months.
Another problem was the rising tide of skepticism that seemed to engulf the sector, much of it was well-founded. In the mania, it seemed as if any company that had ever sold a good or service over the Internet rolled out a "b-to-b play," hoping to net a quick jolt in its stock price. In March, Yahoo, the Internet portal company, announced the creation of a business marketplace where industries could research and buy goods. That came five days after eBay announced its own b-to-b exchange.
While bidding up the stock prices of the early marketplace leaders, investors failed to account for the very real threat posed by industry incumbents like General Motors, Ford Motor and General Electric, whose entry promised to undermine the revenue dreams of so-called pure-play Internet companies.
"These stocks certainly got way ahead of themselves," said Ed McCabe, a Merrill Lynch analyst. "B-to-b addresses huge market opportunities, but today there's still little traction, so these stocks are discounting a rosy future. When you discount 20 years of good news, even slightly bad news today can have a significant effect on the present value of those stocks."
Investors had come to look at information through the rosiest glasses. One of the most widely quoted statistics on the business-to-business sector was one put forth by the Gartner Group. It estimated that a staggering $7.3 trillion worth of global corporate spending would go through the Internet in 2004, up from $145 billion last year.
Few people, however, cited the more salient figure in that same Gartner report: that nearly two-thirds of that money would go directly from manufacturers to suppliers, not to the b-to-b Internet companies providing software, technology and the marketplace platforms to clear the path for that spending.
Still, that leaves roughly $2.7 trillion for the b-to-b Internet market -- a healthy number by any standard, even if not enough to justify market all the euphoria. And the recent sell-off has done nothing to diminish the prospects of the b-to-b sector generating that much business, analysts and institutional investors said.
Indeed, according to Geri Spieler, a Gartner analyst, there will be "enormous pressure from both buyers and suppliers" to adopt e-commerce over the next five years because of the enormous cost savings involved. Ms. Spieler said that in 2005, when the first round of corporate technological buildup nears completion, "the entire supply chain between suppliers and buyers will be automated."
"Any company will be able to order anything on the Web and have it customized, whatever," she added. "That's nirvana."
Given such a picture, the stunning decline in prices could now be viewed as a positive for investors who still have a taste for b-to-b stocks. According to Andrew S. Cupps, portfolio manager of the $850 million Strong Enterprise fund, the sell-off will benefit the larger players, because smaller e-business software and technology companies may now be unable to go public or make secondary stock offerings necessary to grow their businesses.
"Certainly, some companies will grow and come public," he said. "But fewer will do it, and they'll do it more slowly. It really creates a better environment for those who've made it through the window."
Which is precisely why the early leaders -- and those with the strongest cash positions -- were the stocks that held up the best in the April deluge.
Skeptics say that one major correction can be followed by another -- and that the 250.99-point drop in the Dow Jones industrials on Wednesday is evidence that markets remain extraordinarily volatile. More important is the assertion that the promised profits of the b-to-b marketplace are just so much pap -- that the reality will never approach current forecasts.
But that ignores an unpleasant fact. If the b-to-b group does not pan out, investors are unlikely to find any safety under the technology umbrella. So important is the b-to-b group to the prospects of blue chips like Cisco Systems and Intel that a failure of the new-business paradigm to live up to expectations would almost certainly put a serious dent in many technology companies -- high-priced as they still are.
But perhaps the spring massacre has served to make the job of picking winners and losers that much easier. Money managers and analysts who follow and invest in this class of stocks say they remain convinced that each b-to-b Internet sector has companies with extraordinary investment promise, especially for investors who are willing to dig.
 
The B-to-B Taxonomy
One problem in picking a smart business-to-business investment, of course, is that any small company armed with a T-1 line can pitch itself as a business-to-business stock. And many do.
At the other extreme, established companies like Oracle, which sells software that helps corporations manage their databases, and Sun Microsystems, which makes servers, the workhorse computers behind the Web, are now called b-to-b plays too, since so much of their future growth is predicated on the growth of e-commerce. And there is the enormous overlap among companies that do business in various categories.
Experts divide the business-to-business Internet world differently, but many settle on several key categories, beginning with so-called infrastructure and architecture companies that make the gear and software that store, retrieve, organize and send bits back and forth across the World Wide Web. These services are meant to support the back end of a corporation's e-commerce system -- Oracle's database software and EMC's data storage systems are but two examples.
Next comes the software that the companies use within their business-to-business systems to serve their customers -- software that is more closely aligned with, say, the sales process or customer relations than a corporation's internal information technology department. B-to-b e-commerce software can help companies buy goods from suppliers or pitch their customers' products on the Internet.
Companies that advise and guide other concerns through the maze of introducing their e-commerce business plans are another business-to-business sector. Call them e-guidance companies if you like.
Then there are the b-to-b marketplaces, roughly the business equivalents of eBay, through which companies exchange goods that are at the core of their business processes. The sector also includes those companies that make software needed to run the exchanges.
 
Architecture
For investors, the appeal of Internet architecture and infrastructure companies is clear. "If you're in a war, you don't want to take sides -- you just want to sell the guns," said Bob Turner, chief investment officer of Turner Investment Partners of Berwyn, Pa. "That's what these guys do."
The heavy artillery includes the hardware, routers, software and technologies that move huge amounts of data as quickly as possible through an Internet connection and are usually the kind of gear made by Cisco and Sun. But many money managers are also bullish on the EMC Corporation, a pre-Internet company that has flourished in the data-rich environment of the Web by selling data storage systems that stockpile a wealth of information, along with software, networks and services to manage that data. Its products are the runaway favorites among corporations.
"To distill it, EMC is the best at what they do, bar none," said Bill Lewis, an analyst at Chase H&Q. "They're absolutely the dominant supplier of enterprise storage systems, and the competition is behind," he added, referring to I.B.M., Compaq, Sun and Hewlett-Packard.
All blue-chip companies have a lot of sales that are not business-to-business. So in approaching a company like EMC as a b-to-b play, analysts said to focus on its revenue streams from its push into e-commerce. The company says that while just 12 percent of its sales are Internet related, growth in that area will be the major driver of revenue this year and will account for the majority of sales in the next 2 to 5 years.
Mr. Lewis is forecasting earnings growth of 30 percent a year over the next two to three years.
The stock has weathered the Nasdaq storm well, closing on Friday at $138, just below its 52-week high of $144 on March 7. Last week, EMC announced a 2-for-1 stock split payable June 2.
That said, the number and strength of its rivals are cause for worry down the road, Mr. Lewis said: "Each of those companies has increased their efforts in storage because they're losing money to EMC. The question is: Does the competition catch up, and when? But so far, we've been expecting more than we've gotten."
Regardless of the pace of corporate e-commerce, Mr. Lewis said the demand for data storage would grow. Mr. Lewis rates EMC a buy, but has no price target.
One infrastructure stock that has retained favor among money managers -- despite the steep fall in its share price -- is Exodus Communications, which builds and hosts Internet systems on its vast "server farms" for corporations. "With the acceleration of e-commerce, a lot of companies have realized they lack the internal resources to manage their Web operations" with their own information technology departments, said Andrea Grosz, an analyst at First Union Securities.
"We think 20 percent of companies outsource some piece of I.T. today, and 50 percent will by 2002," Ms. Grosz continued. "Exodus will be one of the major beneficiaries of that."
The company has roughly 30 percent of the overall market now, she said. More important, that figure includes 50 percent of the most visited Web sites, including Yahoo, Lycos and eBay.
Data hosting, Ms. Grosz said, represents 40 percent of Exodus revenues and, again, the stock's risk lies in the fact that rivals are trying to muscle in on its business. "Large telcos like Qwest and Level3," she said, are among those pushing, "and that could create a commoditization, and price pressure along with it, particularly in the data hosting piece." Exodus shares suffered mightily in the technology sell-off. On Friday, they closed at $85.75, about half their high of $173.3125 in March. Still, Ms. Grosz has a 12-month price target of $130 on the stock.
 
Software
Business-to-business software products seem to metamorphose monthly amid a roiling mass of shifting corporate alliances.
Among the melange of products: procurement software, to manage the buying and selling of products; content management and database management software, to analyze and present content on company Web sites; personalization software, to tailor the content to different users, like human resource employees; and customer relationship management software, which allows salespeople to work more effectively.
The best tactic for investors, money managers said, is to focus on the market leader in each category. Companies with a reputation for having the best product are likely to flourish. Among others, money managers cited Broadvision, which makes personalization software; Interwoven which sells content-management software; and Vignette, which makes specialized software used for everything from running site content to automating some customer-service functions.
"This a very niche-oriented software market now, but it will be consolidated, because sites will want to get it done with two or three different vendors," said Mr. Wrona of PBHG. "That just reinforces why you want to have the best-of-breed."
Instead of trying to figure out the best software products themselves, investors can look at the products that the leading companies are buying. "It's a very, very good indicator of quality," said Storm Boswick, a portfolio manager for J&W Seligman. "It shows the market understands the product, that these are the companies that G.E. and others are willing to go into battle with."
For instance, the fact that Merrill Lynch chose to buy its customer personalization software from Vignette is evidence that it is a leader in that category, analysts said.
According to Stephen Sigmon, an analyst with Dain Rauscher Wessels, Vignette is on track to achieve "one-stop shop" status, the ability to furnish most software needs to customers, through its V/5 series, which is being rolled out slowly, and the array of applications that the company has either developed on its own or added through acquisitions. "All the key metrics -- market share, customer acquisition growth, revenue growth -- are going in the right direction," he said. The stock closed on Friday at $56.3125; Mr. Sigmon has a 12-month price target of $100.
 
E-Guidance
Armies of consultants stand ready to coax Internet-shy executives into the e-commerce revolution -- and collect hefty fees in the process.
The problem, both institutional investors and analysts said, is that companies that provide Internet business development strategies -- Scient, Viant, AppNet -- are seen as "body shops." In other words, they are regarded as businesses whose futures hinge on the quality and number of consultants they can muster.
But not all service companies should be avoided, and the technology stock sell-off may have provided relatively attractive valuations, money managers said. "The best bets here are companies that have a different approach in the marketplace, and large companies," said Alan Harris, senior portfolio manager at Munder Capital Management in Birmingham, Mich. In particular, he cited Diamond Technology Partners, whose consultants advise the highest levels of corporate management.
Among other things, said Richard Leggett, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, a small investment bank based in Arlington, Va., Diamond consultants generate the most revenue per person of any publicly traded company, at $360,000 to $400,000, compared with the industry average of $250,000. And the company's clients renew their contracts with Diamond 81 percent of the time, versus an industry average of 60 to 70 percent, he said.
Still, the dependence on human capital is likely to be a hindrance over all. "The company can only scale so much," he said. "And this market is growing at 60 percent a year." Diamond shares fell 50 percent from their high of $100 on March 9 to $49.0625 on April 14. They have since rebounded to $83.625.
 
Exchanges
No category has done more to push business-to-business e-commerce to the front of investors' minds in recent months than the debut of online marketplaces, often referred to as exchanges. These are one-stop shops for various industries that give commercial buyers and sellers a place to display their goods, sell them at auction, put out requests for proposals and perform other business functions that used to be the domain of the telephone and fax machine.
The sector has two parts. First are those companies that build or run the exchanges, like VerticalNet, Ventro and the Internet Capital Group. Second are the companies that want to sell software to the exchanges, like FreeMarkets, Oracle, Ariba and Commerce One.
The smart way to assess the viability of a particular marketplace is to look at its industry relationships. "The key thing to look at with these exchanges is who's got the big fish in every industry," said Mr. Harris, of Munder Capital. "Once they sign him up, the big fish goes to the suppliers, and says, 'You need to standardize on this platform if you want to continue doing business with me.' "
That means the exchange category is particularly vulnerable to old-economy giants. G.E. Medical Systems and Johnson & Johnson, for instance, recently announced the formation of an online marketplace to serve the medical industry. That is bad news for Neoforma.com, a business-to-business exchange focusing on the same category.
The exchanges best able to defend themselves against old-economy competition are those that address more fragmented markets, where the power is not consolidated among a few hands. That leads Steven Frankel, managing director of Adams Harkness & Hill, to recommend eMerge Interactive, an exchange that serves the cattle industry. EMerge "doesn't have to fear the big guys," he said. "The beauty of it is there aren't any industry giants here." EMerge shares closed on Friday at $21.8125, 67 percent off their March high of $66.875. Mr. Frankel said he had no price target on the stock, but that he continued to "pound the table on this one."
To spread one's bets, some analysts and money managers have gravitated toward the Internet Capital Group, a b-to-b incubator that invests in dozens of exchanges and has helped take them public. It closed on Friday at $38.625, down 81 percent from its closing high of $200 on Jan. 3. "We're still with I.C.G.," Mr. Turner said. "If b-to-b is to survive, I.C.G. will have to be there."
Mr. McCabe, of Merrill Lynch, said he, too, remains bullish on Internet Capital. But in the short term, he said, the company is "very dependent on the market sentiment regarding business-to-business, and the I.P.O. market." He has no price target for the stock but rates it buy-accumulate.
Stocks of companies that sell software to the exchanges were also battered in the spring sell-off. Ariba shares fell from a high of $165.50 on March 8 to $54.4375 on April 17; they closed on Friday at $76.
In part, the exchange software companies followed the decline in the exchanges themselves because they often get a small share of every transaction completed on exchange sites that use their software. When G.M. and Ford indicated that they might not accept such a revenue-sharing model for their proposed exchange, investors feared that the exchange software companies would end up like, well, ordinary software companies, searching for reliable, recurring revenue streams.
However, Scott Phillips, an analyst with CIBC World Markets, said he expected Ariba to get a share of exchange revenues regardless -- if not from a per-transaction fee then from a share of flat fees that exchange participants will likely pay in the future. Such recurring revenue, Mr. Phillips said, gives the company "a compelling business model." He has a 12-month price target of $150 on Ariba.

HEADLINE: Are We as Happy as We Think?

BYLINE: By Alan Ehrenhalt; Alan Ehrenhalt is the executive editor of Governing magazine and author of "The Lost City."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
This is a good time to be many things: a software designer, a suburbanite putting a five-bedroom house on the market, a cook or a carpenter in a service economy where jobs are chasing workers. But it is a bad time to be a social critic.
While most of us drift languidly through the prosperous spring of the new century's first year, one relatively small segment of the American elite is approaching a state of crisis. The keepers of the nation's social conscience are grasping for a role to play at a moment when the society does not feel much like pondering its fate. They are befuddled by a mass contentment they were never trained to cope with. 
 This happens every once in a while, and it happens most noticeably when there is a presidential campaign going on, and we are at least nominally charged with the task of examining our national values and goals.
In certain interesting ways, the year 2000 is a lot like 1928, or 1960. Most of the country is doing pretty well. One political party has presided rather benignly over the White House and the executive branch for the past eight years. An heir apparent seeks to keep the presidency in that party's hands. There is a common perception that the election may mark a turning point of some sort, but no one is quite sure how, and the entire prospect excites very little interest. And pacing irritably on the sidelines is a cadre of nervous critics struggling to persuade us that we are not as contented as we might think.
They have said this before. "The prosperity of the Eisenhower Age is a deceptive sign of vigor and health," Norman Podhoretz wrote in Commentary as the 1960 campaign opened. He pointed to "the boredom one senses on all sides, the torpor, the anxiety, the listlessness."
The literary critic Dwight Macdonald, writing in Dissent, felt the same way. "We are an unhappy people," he insisted, "a people without style, without a sense of what is humanly satisfying. There is a terrible shapelessness about American life." He proclaimed his intention to abstain in the election of 1960, no matter what the candidates said or did.
Turn back another generation, replace Richard Nixon and John Kennedy with Herbert Hoover and Al Smith, and you pick up the same sort of intellectual refrain. The voters seem happy, critics concede, but they are actually in the midst of a deep-seated spiritual crisis. As the 1928 campaign year began, Walter Lippmann was completing "A Preface to Morals" and agonizing as usual about the unwillingness of the American people to take issues seriously. What the situation demanded, Lippmann wrote, was a statesman who could be "successful in converting his constituents from a childlike pursuit of what seems interesting to a realistic view of their interests." Unfortunately, no such statesman was to be found.
H. L. Mencken was considerably less gentle. He charged the American people not merely with complacent inattention, but with woeful ignorance. He returned from one campaign swing and wrote that the voters he encountered "prefer nonsense to sense" and "they have gone so far into the darkness that every light terrifies them and runs them amuck."
Coping with a contented electorate is not easy for any social critic, but there are strategies for doing it -- arguments that can be used to try to burst the bubble of seeming widespread satisfaction.
One such argument is that the middle class may be doing well but that the bottom rungs of the society are suffering more than ever. In 1960, Michael Harrington was the foremost exponent of this view, warning repeatedly in a series of magazine articles that the grinding poverty of "forgotten Americans," in Appalachia and in the housing projects of the northern inner cities, lay just beneath the surface of prosperity.
No critic will be able to startle the electorate this year by discovering poverty in our midst; now we know all about it. But there does seem to be a year 2000 equivalent: the digital divide. The best way to raise the issue of societal inequality in the current climate is to frame it in electronic terms, and this is already being done.
If steps are not taken to close the divide, the computer pioneer Eric Benhamou warned a few weeks ago, in 10 years we will have "a society with 75 percent of the people extremely connected and 25 percent completely adrift." He proclaimed it "a crisis of phenomenal proportions in the making." The presidential candidates have picked up on this. Whether the voters care much about it is another question.
Another approach is to argue that things are indeed comfortable but are about to crash. This year's most outspoken crash critic is Kevin Phillips. Drawing analogies between excessive highway speed and stock market recklessness, he warns that "the country is exceeding so many speed limits that you have to wonder if some big pile-up is coming."
The advantage of crash criticism is that if you keep predicting economic disaster, and survive long enough, sooner or later you will be right. The disadvantage is that by then, you may have acquired a reputation as a Chicken Little. People have an appetite for reading prophecies of disaster retrospectively, after the disaster occurs. They nearly always ignore them at the time they are made, as prophets throughout history have discovered.
During the summer of 1928, Sinclair Lewis warned that "within a year, this country will have a terrible financial panic." It was a remarkable prediction little noted by anyone.
Then there is the "quiet desperation" approach. At the end of the 1950's, the sociologist C. Wright Mills declared that what appeared to be contentment masked widespread individual despair over the moral bankruptcy of the society. The problem was that the unhappy individual didn't realize he had millions of fellow sufferers all around. The job of the intellectual and social critic, in Mills's view, was to point this fact out to him, to translate "personal troubles into social issues."
In the fall of 1960, as Kennedy and Nixon were arguing about steel production capacity and America's prestige abroad, Mills was seeking to make the case for a much simpler proposition: We're not as happy as we think. It was a tough sell.
It would be an equally tough sell now. There are campaign years in which the electorate genuinely seems to be searching for meaning. Both 1968 and 1980 fit in that category. This is not one of them. This is the sort of year that drives intellectuals of the sophistication of Walter Lippmann or H. L. Mencken to label the electorate, as Mencken did in 1928, "hopelessly uneducable."
On the other hand, as the Old Testament makes clear, it is precisely when no one wants to listen that prophets are needed most. It takes relatively little courage or skill to wring one's hands at a moment of genuine crisis. Doing it in flush times is the real challenge.
So as we go about ignoring the social criticism of the year 2000, we still might want to pause to offer the critics a few words of consolation: Don't be discouraged. Cheer up. Things are bound to get worse.

Feeding America's Craving for Value

BYLINE: By JENNY LYN BADER 

 BODY:
IT has been a season of dizzying highs, record lows and amateurs rushing in.
The public cannot help but be mesmerized by twin roller coaster rides: the dazzling parallel arcs of the Nasdaq world and the world of antiques. Both offer the irresistible possibility that, despite the fact that America has always loved "The Price Is Right," the price is actually wrong. It's higher. 
 The bull market gives amateur investors the impression that the thing to own is the new, new thing. "Antiques Roadshow" gives amateur appraisers the impression that the thing to own is the old, old thing.
In a typical moment from "Antiques Roadshow," the most popular program on public television, a woman brought in a glass lamp purchased for $125. An expert told her the lamp was worth $125,000. Just like the little companies on the Nasdaq, the little lamp was suddenly, for no apparent reason, worth 1,000 times what it was supposed to be. And like the little companies, little lamps could be traded online: eBay soon let Web surfers go antiquing, and even Sotheby's and Christie's brought their gavels to the Internet.
Before long, everyone and his grandmother were buying on margin and ransacking virtual yard sales. The declining American ability to focus was colliding with the ascending national economy, resulting in a new model for success, a little like Horatio Alger without the attention span.
Then came the nose dives and scandals. The stock market fell. The auction house giants Christie's and Sotheby's, like the Nasdaq giant Microsoft, became the subjects of antitrust inquiries by the Justice Department, which accused them of price-fixing and collusion. Heart-rending scenes from "Antiques Roadshow" were revealed to be staged. The man who couldn't believe that his Civil War-era sword was worth $35,000 and said he once carved a watermelon with it was not the owner of the sword, but a friend of the appraiser.
The program's producers removed the appraiser from all reruns. They also spliced out a woman who brought in a $250,000 helmet and then mysteriously disappeared amid rumors that the helmet was not hers. And eBay, the spiritual home of a nation of appraisers, is now the subject of three local and federal investigations.
But the bidding continues. Aspiring analysts can play stock games on Web sites, winning prizes for speculator of the month. Aspiring appraisers can read trade secrets in Carol Prisant's "Antiques Roadshow Primer" and make estimates interactively on the PBS Internet site. On the cable channel HGTV, they can watch "Appraise It!" or "The Great Antiques Hunt," a program that combines elements of roadshow and game show. Contestants choose antiques at a fair and win points based on the value of their selections. They also estimate the cost of estate jewelry, identify furniture and guess the ages of buildings.
As opposed to "The Price Is Right," where contestants pride themselves on knowing what things actually cost, contestants on "The Great Antiques Hunt" revel in imagining what things might bring.
At first the fascination with old-world beauty seemed a reaction to the high-technology revolution. Technophobes and neo-Victorians alarmed by life in a cold electronic age grew nostalgic for the comfort of physical design. Traditionalists perturbed by the mass of paper wealth and new money yearned for the nobility of good taste.
The British, who originally gave America Christie's and Sotheby's, also exported "Antiques Roadshow," "The Great Antiques Hunt" and (after making the questions easier) "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," spreading the reassuring notion that riches can flow from collecting or knowing arcana.
But strangely enough this obsession with the old has also been fueled by new technology: the Internet has given collectors novel and ideal ways of interacting. By reaching mass audiences, the Net has driven up the prices of some collectibles even as it has driven down the prices of everyday items.
On eBay, as contemporary alchemists turn Pez dispensers into gold, those obsessed with the old and those obsessed with the new exchange bric-a-brac. A Sumerian fertility amulet dating from 3000 B.C. can find new buyers in cyberspace.
In a larger sense, the fascination with old and new are part of the same mania. Both roller coasters promise accessibility, immediacy and the wonder of hidden value. With the democratization of investing, anyone can order shares of Qualcomm while sitting home in a bathrobe. And the formerly insular antiques world has come to the public, intimating that those with an eye for talent can spot the value not only of the next Intel but of the tarnished teapot in the attic.
Professional appraisers on television sometimes take up to several hours off camera checking a research library. But the viewers don't see the work involved, only the result, as a moldy footstool morphs into a small fortune in a matter of seconds. This is better than reality television: it's television edited to celebrate reality. In a flash, the pompous owner of a fake Faberge egg is humiliated; the unassuming bearer of a genuine Regency box is exalted.
THE forces at work here are more poignant than mere greed. The fantasy of "Antiques Roadshow" is that the chair you loved because your Aunt Tillie gave it to you might also bring in six figures. It is the fantasy that sentimental value can translate into market value, that feelings and family bonds can matter in a material world. It's the fantasy that our old stuff is worth something and that, by extension, we are, too. Going on "Antiques Roadshow" is like holding an emotional I.P.O. for your garage -- an expert can tell you that you're worth more than you previously suspected.
Such fantasies reveal how yet another British import, Harry Potter, has become the best-selling fairy tale of the moment. Readers cherish the idea that a boy neglected in the everyday world has magical powers and fancy lineage in a parallel, enchanted realm. There, eccentricities can turn out to be talents, weird relatives can turn out to be brilliant wizards and the worthless can become powerful.
The public wants to be transported to that place, where the money-losing start-up venture becomes a dot-com to watch and the rickety armchair in the corner is transformed into a priceless heirloom. Losers can become winners, not only of net worth but of self-worth: by all accounts, a happy ending.

Reality Bites Again

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Is that a police car, lights flashing, that we see in our rear-view mirror?
For the last few years the U.S. economy has cheerfully broken all the old limits. And yet there have been no speeding tickets: unlike runaway booms in the past, this incredible expansion has not led to accelerating inflation. Instead, almost every fresh economic statistic has been a cause for celebration. Month after month productivity has risen more, unemployment has fallen further, and inflation has stayed more subdued than most reasonable people would have imagined possible only a few years ago. 
 It's already hard to remember a time when the U.S. business news wasn't good. Yet as recently as 1996 the economic headlines were mainly negative -- downsizing, not technology, ruled the front pages. And though it now seems hard to believe, Bob Dole's economic advisers insisted during the 1996 campaign that Bill Clinton's policies had produced only an anemic, disappointing recovery, and that only with the spur of big supply-side tax cuts could the economy recover its Reaganesque dynamism. (To be fair, critics of Mr. Dole's platform ridiculed his claim that he could achieve 3.5 percent annual economic growth -- a growth rate that the United States has consistently exceeded ever since he lost that election.)
Exactly why the old speed limits on the economy were so suddenly repealed remains something of a mystery. Productivity growth suddenly accelerated, probably because businesses started to make effective use of information technology, though we can only guess why infotech paid off so much in the late 1990's after producing such disappointing results in the previous 15 years. At the same time -- and therefore presumably for the same reason, though the connection is far from clear -- the economy developed a new immunity to inflation.
Before around 1995, the risks of inflation seemed clear in the data: inflation fell only when unemployment was high, as it had been in the early 1980's or early 1990's; inflation rose when unemployment was low, as it was in the late 1970's or late 1980's. And the break-even point, at which inflation neither accelerated nor decelerated, was an unemployment rate of around 6 percent. Who would have thought that unemployment could fall to 4 percent before even the first faint stirrings of inflation would be felt?
Alas, those stirrings are now being felt. Consumer prices are starting to rise noticeably, and competition for scarce labor is finally starting to push up wages. And the productivity number announced on Thursday fell somewhat short of our now exalted expectations. It's not that we're actually getting bad numbers. In fact, only a decade ago we would have been delighted to get results this good. But the numbers nonetheless are a warning that the economy's speed limit has been raised but not abolished, and that we have lately been going at least a bit too fast.
How high is the new, improved speed limit? The truth is that nobody can be sure because America's "new economy" is a very recent creation -- you have to base your guesstimates on only three full years of data. But it's starting to look as if the unemployment rate will have to rise a bit -- from 4 percent to say 4.5 if we're lucky, to 5 if we aren't. And growth will have to slow, from the 4-plus percent of the last two years to 3.5, maybe even 3 percent.
Will we be tempted to exceed these speed limits, even though they are much more expansive than the ones that confined us only a few years ago?
The would-be scofflaws are already complaining. Not a day goes by without some self-proclaimed economic expert indignantly denying that fast growth leads to inflation -- after all, how can producing more raise prices? The answer to this sophistry (I've never figured out whether these people are being deliberately dense, or just doing what comes naturally) is that it depends what causes the growth. If the economy grows rapidly because of an increase in supply -- say because workers have suddenly become more productive -- that lowers inflation. But if it grows because of an increase in demand -- say because of an exuberant stock market -- then the growth is indeed inflationary.
And that kind of growth -- which, it seems, is what we are now experiencing -- has to slow down.

HEADLINE: The World: The U.S. and Africa;
Extending a Trembling, Hesitant Hand

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

 BODY:
FOR most of a year now, the United States has been proclaiming its intention to get more involved in the fate of Africa -- in calming its wars, in building its economies.
The 11,000 men of the United Nations peacekeeping force sent into Sierra Leone, and the helicopter gunships reinforcing them, were the first tangible sign that this intention would amount to more than words. The soldiers were from third-world countries but their assignment was being paid for in part with $70 million from the United States. 
 And another peacekeeping force has been waiting in the wings to try to pacify the even more embattled Congo. Together, the Clinton administration has been hoping, these two forces would forever refute the notion that the international community has been eager to right wrongs in Europe and Asia, but has another set of rules for Africa.
But now the Sierra Leone mission is in trouble. By Friday night, more than 300 of the force's troops were hostage, 4 were missing and presumed dead and rebels were riding in captured United Nations armored vehicles.
That debacle and the hesitant response to it in Washington -- several days of teleconferences among officials of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon and the National Security Council but no action, no decisions -- demonstrate yet again that doing good in Africa takes more than good intentions. Now the likelihood of deployment of even the modest force for Congo -- 500 monitors protected by 5,000 soldiers -- looks more distant, despite a formal agreement last week from the Congo leader, Laurent Kabila.
The second track of the administration's Africa policy -- economic partnership -- was also delivering less than had been promised. Even as the House of Representatives approved a trade bill granting some new trading privileges to Africa, there were doubts whether many countries on the continent have the economic capacity to take advantage of it. And on the much-discussed subject of AIDS, the bill sent a singular snub: In the final version, bowing to American pharmaceutical companies, Congress dropped a provision intended to make AIDS drugs more affordable by lowering the licensing fees for African drug manufacturers.
THE Clinton administration has experienced two defining moments in Africa, barely six months apart. The first was the slaughter of 17 American soldiers in Mogadishu, Somalia, in October 1993 and the dragging of one of the bodies through the streets. The following spring, the administration remained largely silent as a genocide unfolded in Rwanda after the United States agreed to the removal of a United Nations military force there.
After Mogadishu, President Clinton chose to shy away from risking such casualties or humiliation again; after Rwanda, he said genocide could not be tolerated again.
But those are incompatible goals, and in its twilight months, the Clinton administration is strangled by its own constraints as it contemplates the options in places like Sierra Leone, Congo, Angola, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Zimbabwe.
A collapse of the peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone could portend far more than just the loss of a military effort in a small, desperate West African country. At stake, some officials argue, is the prestige of the United States within the United Nations. The American representative there, Richard C. Holbrooke, has worked hard to fix the frayed United Nations-United States relationship, lobbying Congress to restore funding and urging foreign diplomats to understand the American political mood. Last week he was in Congo with United Nations colleagues trying to assess whether it is peaceful enough to send in the peacekeepers.
At the United Nations, Mr. Holbrooke needs the 54 votes of African nations, many of whom have been willing to suspend their disillusionment with Washington if the Sierra Leone and Congo peacekeeping missions can be made to work.
But many also still resent the evident Western view that Africa deserves to be marginalized because its problems run so deep. They argue that some hope should be gleaned from democratic elections here and there, from economic turn-arounds. They point to Mozambique, strengthened by investment from neighboring South Africa; to Kenya, where President Daniel arap Moi has taken steps that could reduce corruption; to Nigeria, whose new president, Olusegun Obasanjo, has assumed the mantle of a regional leader (although his troops, which Western countries wouldn't finance, pulled out of Sierra Leone after being roughed up by rebel thugs).
Most important to hopes for peacekeeping, some African countries now have armies that are willing to take part in international forces on the continent. But it is also clear that African states are not capable of dealing with big crises like Congo or Sierra Leone. For these, they look to the United Nations, and thus the United States.
The difficulty in Sierra Leone is that the big powers on the Security Council won't use their own forces, and this has left the United Nations relying on frightened soldiers from less capable armies -- the kind who sometimes give up their armored personnel carriers when confronted by teenagers with rifles at a roadblock.
The minister of state for foreign affairs of Uganda, Amama Mbabazi, put it this way earlier this year: "When it is Kosovo you are there in one minute and spend billions. When it's East Timor you are there. When it is Africa, there are all sorts of excuses."
So the basic problem of what to do about Africa remains, despite the administration's determination to get more involved. "There are huge stakes" if the Sierra Leone operation fails, said one official. "We have to play pretty tough. Otherwise we are going to walk away yet again."

HEADLINE: Voice of Hope in Kosovo Tells the U.S. of Goals

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
For all the problems of Kosovo today, Veton Surroi, the publisher of the province's largest newspaper, reminds himself that things could be much worse.
"We could have well ended up like the Kurds and made good posters for Amnesty International," he said. "Or Kosovars could have ended up somewhere else, singing their own songs, getting drunk in cafes and remembering 1999 as a lousy year." 
 Instead, Mr. Surroi, who is viewed by many diplomats as a voice of reason in a traumatized corner of Europe, is trying to shape what he hopes will one day be a civil society.
Many officials in the international organizations that now run Kosovo -- which has few courts and a primitive economy -- wonder whether Mr. Surroi's goal can be achieved. Mr. Surroi, in an interview during a visit to Washington, insisted that it can, and that Kosovo must start now to shed its dependence on the United Nations, which runs the province's administration.
Mr. Surroi, who spent the duration of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia last year in hiding from the Serbs in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, is critical of the United Nations management of the province but says it is not going to get any better.
For example, the long promised United Nations police force of 6,500 is still only 2,500 strong -- in part, Mr. Surroi said, because some of the recruits had to be sent home because they failed shooting tests, did not know how to drive, or, in the case of several Americans, were so overweight that they could not walk more than 100 yards. Mr. Surroi dismisses as bureaucratic folly the import of high-tech German garbage trucks to pick up trash when it takes weeks to find fuel for them.
"We've reached the peak of United Nations might, Kouchner has spent all his magic," Mr. Surroi said of Bernard Kouchner, the chief representative of the United Nations in Kosovo. "There's not much more the United Nations can do, now is the time for transition."
So Mr. Surroi, who was in Washington to collect an award from the National Endowment for Democracy, did the rounds of Clinton administration officials and Washington reseach groups with a fairly simple message: Kosovo needs a constitution of its own to provide a legal framework to build democratic institutions in a society that has never known them. At the State Department, specialists in constitutions are beginning to write one, although the thorniest question of all -- whether Kosovo, which remains formally a province of Serbia, should or can move to independence -- is still open.
Even as Kosovo continues to count on outside forces for much of its existence -- on NATO for its security, on German banks for its currency, on the United Nations for its international relations -- its inhabitants, overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian, need to assume responsibility internally, Mr. Surroi said. A constitution is needed to help define what Mr. Surroi calls "self-rule" but not necessarily sovereignty.
For many Kosovo Albanians, the war last year was the culmination of many years of debate about how to separate from Serbia, from its dominant leader, Slobodan Milosevic, and from the federation of Yugoslavia, which includes Serbia and Montenegro, of which Mr. Milosevic is president.
Mr. Surroi argues that Kosovo can have its own constitution and define its borders as within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. "This is a kind of virtual reality, because I can't find anyone who considers the Federal Republic as a functioning state," he said, alluding to the fact that Montenegro has largely broken with Serbia politically, although the two remain together in the federation.
Mr. Surroi suggested that it is too soon to push for an independent state -- a goal of almost all Kosovar Albanians not shared by all Western nations and opposed by Russia.
Soon after the NATO bombing, when returning Albanians killed Kosovo Serbs and burned their homes, Mr. Surroi spoke out against the killings, appealing to his fellow Albanians not to force the remaining Serbs to leave. He was publicly denounced for his stand.
During several public talks this week, Mr. Surroi said that Kosovo still had far to go in moving toward tolerance. He argued that this was another reason for a constitution -- to establish individual rights. "You can't build tolerance on goodwill," he said.
For Kosovo to stand on its own feet -- and remove itself from its dependence on the overwhelming number of aid organizations that are tripping over themselves as they try to help schools and medical centers -- the economy needs to be legally defined.
Like Serbia, Kosovo was run as a socialist area. Now, there is a mixture of the old socialism, wild capitalism and strong-arm tactics by Kosovo Liberation Army fighters who believe that having been in the army gives them the right to expropriate property. "The result is not very encouraging, we have to settle the property issue," Mr. Surroi said.
Mr. Surroi is the first to recognize that criminality abounds in Kosovo although he rejects the argument that criminal bosses have taken control. The Kosovo Protection Corps, which is composed of former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the guerrilla fighters that battled Serb control of Kosovo until NATO won the war, is not a band of "angels," he said. But he disputes the notion that Kosovo has become an enclave for heavy drug trafficking. "Kosovars are involved in drug trafficking but not in Kosovo itself," he said. "Kosovo is not a good route."
There is hope in one small fact, he added. "Things are lousy in Kosovo, I know 100 places where I'd have a much better life. But this is a society that has been without courts, police, laws for 10 months, yet people still stop at the red light."

HEADLINE: Richard Bertram, 84, Builder And Sailor of Racing Yachts

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY 

 BODY:
Richard Bertram, a champion sailor on powerboats and racing yachts and a leading boat builder and broker, died on April 28 at his home in Stuart, Fla. He was 84.
When Bertram raced, he always looked for other boats to sell. In a 1961 profile, The Saturday Evening Post said he sold $5 million worth of used racing boats the year before. 
 Among his clients were Aristotle Onassis, the Aga Khan, King Hussein of Jordan and Prince Bertil of Sweden. Bertram appeared on a Times Square billboard for Camel cigarettes and in a full-page magazine ad for Hennessy Cognac.
To an enterprise in which salesmen once dressed more for picnicking or gardening, he brought glitz and a hard-nosed business approach. One Miami rival said, "His outfit has all the gimmicks -- big parties, big ads, big talk." Bertram was proud of his aggressive sales methods and said 25 percent of his customers had never owned a boat before.
"The country's economy may take a nose dive and people may go broke," Bertram once explained, "but the records show that even in the worst financial crises there is always a man ready to buy a boat. And I'll be there to sell it."
On the banks of the Tamiami Canal near Miami International Airport, he built what he called his boating supermarket. There, in water in a steel and concrete shed 630 feet (two football fields) long, he displayed more than 100 of his biggest cruisers and sailboats.
Richard Howard Bertram was born Feb. 4, 1916, in East Orange, N.J. He began sailing with his parents on Barnegat Bay in New Jersey. At 8, he owned his first boat, a 15-foot Sneakbox. At 10, on the eve of his first race, he stayed up all night planning how to win. There were 50 boats; he finished last. He would seldom finish out of the money again.
At Cornell, he was skipper of the intercollegiate championship boats in 1936 and 1937. His classroom success was not as good. After failing French twice, he dropped out of college. In 1946, he opened a one-room yacht brokerage office in Miami.
In 1958, when he was sailing on Vim in the America's Cup trials off Newport, R.I., he was amazed when a powerboat cut through 6-foot seas at 30 knots. He traced down its designer, Raymond C. Hunt, who said his boat could go that fast on choppy waters because of a full deep-V bottom on its 23-foot hull. Bertram commissioned Hunt to design a similar 31-foot powerboat for him. In 1960, with the new boat, Bertram and Sam Griffith won the Miami-Nassau race, two hours in front of the next boat.
With that boat and successors, Bertram won many United States and European offshore powerboat races, including the 1965 world championship. To translate the virtues of the deep-V hull into high-performance yachts at least 50 feet long, he founded Bertram International. The yachts he built succeeded quickly, and in 1969, aboard his 56-foot Bertram International yacht Envoy, he set a Miami-New York nonstop record of 54 hours 8 minutes.
In yachting, he won the 1948 and 1949 international championships in Lightning Class sloops. He won or placed high in Miami-to-Nassau 13 times, Newport-to-Bermuda 10 times, Lipton Cup 6 times, Trans-Atlantic 4 times and Buenos Aires-to-Rio de Janeiro twice.
His first two marriages, to Katherine Ivins and Pauline Meagher, ended in divorce. His third wife, Lenore Lonergan, died. He is survived by his fourth wife, the former Franchesca Morales; five sons, Scott, Kim, Morgan, Colin and Digby; five daughters, Charlotte, Gretchen, Anne, Caroline and Madelaine; a stepson, John Holzman; five grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter, who was born the day before he died.

HEADLINE: Mbeki Details Quest to Grasp South Africa's AIDS Disaster

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: PRETORIA, South Africa, May 6

 BODY:
For months, President Thabo Mbeki says, he pored through medical journals, consulted with scientists and struggled to understand the epidemiology of the AIDS epidemic that is ravaging his country.
"The problem was so big that I personally felt that I wanted to understand this matter better," Mr. Mbeki said today as he addressed an advisory panel of international AIDS researchers here. 
 "I'm reading all these complicated things, language I don't understand," he said. "So I pile through lots and lots of research documentation. I've got dictionaries all around me in case there are words that are difficult to understand. I phone the minister of health and ask her what does this word mean and she explains."
In this strikingly personal speech, Mr. Mbeki offered his first detailed explanation of how he came to consult with two Americans who argue that H.I.V. does not cause AIDS. The decision, which became public two months ago, quickly touched off a firestorm of criticism.
Leading scientists have criticized him for wasting time on discredited theories while South Africa is suffering one of the highest H.I.V. infection rates in the world. Some researchers have called for a boycott of an international AIDS conference that is scheduled to be held here in July.
And as prominent American newspapers published editorials last month condemning his stance, some government officials here began to fear that the issue would overshadow Mr. Mbeki's first state visit to the United States, set for May 20, a visit that some had hoped would focus on South Africa's blossoming economy.
Today, Mr. Mbeki said that he and his ministers know that the human immunodeficiency virus causes AIDS. He said he reached out to the Americans when he discovered how differently the disease appeared in sub-Saharan Africa as compared with the United States and Europe.
According to the United Nations AIDS program, two types of H.I.V. are currently recognized, and the most common, H.I.V.-1, has 10 genetically distinct subtypes.
Subtype B, which is most commonly transmitted through homosexual contact and intravenous drug use, is primarily found in the Americas, Europe, Australia, Japan and the Caribbean. Subtype C, most often found in South Africa and India, seems to be more infectious with a higher potential for heterosexual transmission, the United Nations says.
When he could not find satisfying explanations for such differences, Mr. Mbeki said, he began exploring the work of researchers who believe that poverty and malnutrition are likely causes of the disease in Africa.
"We were looking for an answer because all of the information that has been communicated says in reality that we are faced with a catastrophe," Mr. Mbeki explained in his speech at the Sheraton Hotel here. "And you can't respond to a catastrophe merely by saying, 'I will do what is routine.' "
Mr. Mbeki refused to dismiss the work of the American researchers David Rasnick, a biochemist, and Peter Duesberg, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of California at Berkeley.
Both men are included in the government's 33-member advisory panel, which met today for the first time and will advise Mr. Mbeki on the cause and best treatments for AIDS. The panel is evenly split between those who believe H.I.V. causes AIDS, including Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, whose research team discovered the virus -- and those who do not.
As Mr. Mbeki described his efforts to understand H.I.V., which has infected more than 3 million people in this country of 44 million, he portrayed an intensely driven, hands-on leader who is reluctant to leave critical decision-making to others.
Tom Lodge, a professor of political science at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said: "In one way, of course, it's an admirable indication of an extremely conscientious and intelligent chief executive. But I think he's also a compulsive interferer. There is a medical establishment. You leave, as it were, to the experts certain things that require expertise."
Similar criticisms come from doctors in the medical community here, on this and other aspects of policy.
In March, government officials scrambled to explain how $6.2 million of the country's $17 million AIDS budget went unspent last year. And last year, Mr. Mbeki stunned health experts by questioning the safety of the standard anti-AIDS drug AZT. The government has decided not to distributed the drug in public hospitals here, even though the National Institutes of Health in the United States has determined that the benefits of the drug far outweigh the potential side effects.

HEADLINE: New Questions On Drug Plans As Costs Soar

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Americans took home some 2.8 billion prescriptions last year, obtaining some of the newest, most heavily advertised and most expensive drugs. They bought many of those medications as members of managed care drug plans run by pharmacy benefit managers, companies that arrange discounts from retail drugstores and often operate mail-order pharmacies on behalf of employer health plans.
Now the pharmacy benefit management companies, or P.B.M.'s, which handle drug benefits for 200 million Americans, are being assigned an important role in widely discussed proposals to add a drug benefit to Medicare. 
 Supporters of a Medicare drug benefit, including President Clinton, believe that the pharmacy benefit managers could obtain discounts from pharmacists and rebates from drugmakers for all Medicare beneficiaries, just as they are expected to do for employer health plans and Medicare health maintenance organizations. The managers, sponsors suggest, would help rein in the costs of the new Medicare program.
But pharmacy benefit managers are coming under increasing scrutiny. Justice Department officials are investigating possible illegal kickbacks. Pending lawsuits contend that some pharmacy benefit managers have violated their duty to act in the best interest of patients. State regulators are weighing concerns about the absence of oversight of the industry.
At Senate Finance Committee hearings in March on the Medicare proposals, the General Accounting Office questioned whether pharmacy benefit managers would be able to control costs under government disclosure requirements. And health care experts say that even for private companies, drug benefit managers have not been able to put a lid on surging costs.
"P.B.M.'s or no P.B.M.'s, it does not have much effect on the growth trend in pharmaceutical expenses," said Henry Aaron, a health care economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
The drug benefit managers do perform valuable services. They handle billions of automated transactions, checking plan members' eligibility online and eliminating mountains of paperwork. They also monitor the drug-buying behavior of individuals, helping people avoid dangerous drug combinations. And for an extra fee from the health plan, they will remind people with serious health problems to follow their doctors' orders.
But though nearly three in four Americans are in drug plans, by the industry's count, national spending on drugs is growing three times as fast as overall health care spending, which itself rose about 6 percent in 1999. Employers' health care expenses were a big factor in the 4.3 percent rise in labor costs in the year ended in March, the biggest increase since the early 1990's. Drug expenditures will double in five years to $200 billion and rise to $300 billion by 2010 if the current pace continues, said C. Daniel Mullins, a pharmaceutical economist at the University of Maryland.
Pharmacy benefit managers say they can slow the pace for health plans that are willing to place tight limits on members' drug choices. Drug costs, they add, would rise even faster without their industry's efforts.
"A third of the increases is from increased utilization," or more people using more drugs, said Judith Cahill, executive director of the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, an industry-supported professional group of pharmacists. "A third is from new, improved products, and a third is from plain old vanilla inflation in the cost of products."
Employers are feeling the cost pressures. "The largest component in employers' health costs is not in-patient care, not out-patient care or doctors' office visits or X-rays; it is prescription drugs," said Raymond Brusca, vice president for benefits at the Black & Decker Corporation.
Many health plans have raised premiums and shifted a larger portion of the price of a prescription to employees and their families. Others, mindful of union concerns and competition for employees in a tight labor market, have swallowed hard and absorbed the increases.
General Motors was one of the first big employers to hire a pharmacy benefit management company, in the 1980's. G.M. spent $762 million on drugs in its self-insured plans last year, up nearly 13 percent from 1998. The company recently hired a doctor of pharmacy to work with the P.B.M. to try to tame these costs.
Rob Moroni, the company's assistant director of health plans, said G.M. expected a cost increase of about 20 percent this year, fueled by large numbers of older retirees covered by the company's plan. Elderly people typically take three times as many drugs as people under 65.
After several mergers last year, the pharmacy benefit management market is largely controlled by the three largest concerns. Merck-Medco, PCS Health Systems and Express Scripts say they have three-quarters of the country's P.B.M. business.
Efforts by those companies and by the other pharmacy benefit managers to control costs have largely been stymied. The savings from discounts that pharmacy benefit managers get from drugstores are reduced by manufacturers' price increases and swept away by intense customer demand for advertised drugs, which are typically more expensive than alternative products. Drugmakers spent $1.9 billion on consumer advertising last year, according to Scott-Levin, a research firm in Newtown, Pa. And sales of prescription drugs rose 18 percent, compared with 1998 sales, according to IMS Health Inc., a market research firm in Westport, Conn.
Industry experts say the pharmacy benefit managers, which typically charge employers up to 50 cents for each transaction as well as other fees, have strong incentives to increase the use of drugs.
"With an increase in utilization, the P.B.M.'s get more money," said Debbie Stern, vice president of Rxperts Managed Care Consulting, a drug consulting firm in Irvine, Calif.
What is more, drugmakers promote new and highly competitive -- often more expensive -- products by giving the pharmacy benefit managers rebates based on sales. (The rebates may or may not be shared with employers.) That system, critics say, encourages P.B.M.'s to choose higher priced drugs.
"I haven't seen anybody giving rebates on generics," the lowest-priced drugs, said Patricia Wilson, a pharmaceuticals consultant based in Rosemont, Pa.
The transaction fees that employers pay for the billions of prescriptions filled each year mount up. But Barrett Toan, chief executive of Express Scripts, said these fees merely "cover expenses to process those claims." He said his customers were reluctant to authorize harsh limits on drug benefits that might antagonize their employees at a time of low unemployment.
At the heart of the pharmacy benefit management business is a list, or formulary, of preferred drugs. The employee or health plan member has a lower copayment on these products, an incentive to choose them. In theory, the preferred drugs -- which include many generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection -- are as good as or better than any in their class as well as the most cost-effective.
But lawsuits filed on behalf of drug plan members over the last three years in Federal courts in several states argue that sponsors of managed care drug plans are violating their fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of patients rather than for company profits, as required by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa. Several of the suits have been filed against Merck-Medco, a unit of Merck & Company, and at least one is against PCS, which is owned by the Rite-Aid Corporation.
Spokesmen for PCS and Merck-Medco said the lawsuits were without merit.
"We believe we have a long history of developing plans and programs that are designed to benefit plan sponsors and plan members, with the ultimate goal of saving money for those plan sponsors and plan members," said John Bloomfield, a spokesman for Merck-Medco.
Some critics have raised questions about how much pharmacy benefit managers really save employer health plans. These companies typically offer large employers discounts of 12 percent to 15 percent, which come out of the retail pharmacy's pocket. The discounts are subtracted from manufacturers' posted average wholesale prices. But those prices may be inflated. "They are not an average, not wholesale and not a price, other than what employers pay," Ms. Wilson, the pharmaceuticals consultant, said.
While a customer waits at the drug counter, a computer screen displays the terms of her insurance: the discount from list price, a dispensing fee of $2.50 or so for the pharmacist, the customer's other prescriptions and recent purchases, and her copayment. The health plan typically gets an electronic bill for most of the charge.
The drugmakers' prices are flexible, depending on the buyer. "They set a price that they think they can get away with," said Uwe Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University.
New drugs are frequently introduced, and some are priced 20 or 30 times as much as older treatments for the same illnesses. Drug prices increased 5.2 percent in the 12 months ended in March, while the cost of medical care including drugs rose only 3.9 percent and overall consumer prices were up 3.7 percent, according to the Labor Department.
Richard T. Clark, president of Merck-Medco, said health plans -- employers and their workers -- pay prices that are "15 percent lower on average" than people without insurance.
Still, because the pharmacy benefit managers and the drugmakers can keep their price decisions well out of public view, questions continue to arise. The National Association of State Insurance Commissioners is considering whether to recommend legislation to regulate the industry. Kathleen Sibelius, the Kansas insurance commissioner, said there was "a growing concern about the monopoly of control by pharmacy benefit managers who currently are not under a regulatory umbrella, are not licensed or reviewed."
"They aren't screened in any way, but they may have a significant impact on access to prescription drugs and costs associated with that access," she added.
William J. Scanlon, director of health financing issues at the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, advised the Senate Finance Committee in March that if the drug benefit managers' role in Medicare was expanded, the pharmacy managers would have to give up the secrecy that now cloaks their pricing deals.
The Justice Department has subpoenaed records of PCS and Merck-Medco, the two biggest pharmacy benefit management companies, in an inquiry over the fiduciary duty to drug plan members and whether certain types of payments to the industry involve kickbacks. No charges have been filed. Both companies said they comply with the laws and were cooperating with the investigation.
Jim Sheehan, chief of the civil division in the United States Attorney's office in Philadelphia, who is heading the Justice Department inquiry, said there was "a tension" between the benefits that pharmacy benefit managers provide and "where they make their money." He added, "The efficiencies in the business are in the claims processing and the mail order services; the money is in the rebates."
Chris Jennings, a White House adviser on health policy, said the administration's Medicare proposal would include requirements to enhance the quality of service to Medicare enrollees. The plan, he said, was built on "taking the best private practices and avoiding the worst."

HEADLINE: Running for Office? The President Has Some Ideas

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
President Clinton has become a crucial behind-the-scenes player in the 2000 campaign, serving as a tactical adviser for House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates around the country.
Although the spotlight has shifted to Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton, prominent Democrats portray Mr. Clinton's role as that of an enormously valuable Strategist in Chief. They describe him as a sponge for absorbing political statistics -- a skill that is all the more enhanced because he has run twice in all 435 Congressional districts. And he willingly brings his well-honed political instincts to bear while exerting the power of the presidency to elect Democrats. 
 Mr. Clinton has been seeking election or re-election since 1974, when he was defeated in a race for Congress. And the president's closest advisers say that although he is no longer running himself, his passion for electoral politics has never receded. They also cite another, more personal, reason for Mr. Clinton's deep involvement: he wants to burnish his own legacy with the election of Mr. Gore to succeed him, the installation of Mrs. Clinton as senator from New York and the return of the House to Democratic control.
"The guy can't live without a campaign in his life," said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana. "Life is a campaign for him. He needs a campaign to keep him going. This guy is not going to go into an igloo and freeze away. He can't help but advise."
Politicians and historians say they have never known of a president so deeply immersed in politics -- or a White House that, even during a lame-duck period, was so focused on polls and electoral considerations.
The president is particularly engrossed in the first lady's race, and to a lesser degree in Mr. Gore's. But his involvement in campaigns from coast to coast is extraordinary.
Mr. Clinton is much more than a fund-raiser in these campaigns, even as he has collected millions of dollars for House and Senate candidates. He offers candidates pointers on television and radio advertising scripts. He played a significant role in urging some prospects to run in the first place, and he often schedules trips and policy announcements with an eye to helping specific contenders.
This portrait of Mr. Clinton has been gleaned from interviews with more than two dozen candidates and strategists, as well as lawmakers on Capitol Hill and officials at the White House and at the Democratic National Committee. Joe Lockhart, Mr. Clinton's press secretary, turned down a request to interview the president; some of Mr. Clinton's advisers said they were worried that it would seem unpresidential for him to discuss his activities openly.
"He's the ultimate junkie," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. "He has the best walking knowledge of anybody in American politics."
Referring to Representative Ron Klink's drive to oust Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Mr. Torricelli said: "Last night he called me about the Klink race. He said he was convinced Klink could beat Santorum. He said, 'I want to do something in Philadelphia to bring our base in for Klink. I know he can carry western Pennsylvania, but he may have trouble consolidating the base in the east.' "
The president's network of contacts is vast because he has stumped in more than half the Congressional districts, his advisers say.
Mr. Klink said that he telephoned the White House after he won his primary in April and Mr. Clinton "took my call immediately."
"It's not just lip service," Mr. Klink said. "He's really focused on this race. He can open doors with other individuals by telling them that this race is very meaningful to him."
Sometimes Mr. Clinton calls candidates on the telephone. More often, he grabs them to talk politics during his travels or at the White House.
Craig Smith, a former Clinton political director, said he was at the White House recently to watch an Arkansas Razorbacks basketball game. At halftime, Mr. Smith said, the president cornered a group of his guests and held forth about the Democrats' presidential prospects in several states.
He suggested that Mr. Gore not write off North Carolina in November, even though Mr. Clinton lost the state twice. If the Gore campaign takes that advice, it may cause the Bush campaign to rethink its own electoral tactics.
"He came over and said, 'How do you think the math is working?' " Mr. Smith said. "He said, 'I think North Carolina looks good.' " But Mr. Smith said he cautioned Mr. Clinton that the Democrats should think twice about pumping resources into the state.
"I told him that state broke my heart -- twice," Mr. Smith said. "But he said, 'I think we've got a shot.' "
Others who have talked politics with Mr. Clinton said he was preoccupied with the need for Democrats to win the loyalty of Hispanic voters. They said he had even spoken in detail about the importance of married Protestants. And, they said, he was particularly intrigued by contests in Michigan, New Jersey and Florida, where Mr. Gore has been pressing his campaign amid the tumult over the administration's handling of the Elian Gonzalez case.
"Clinton is obsessed with Florida," the case of the Cuban boy "and how it impacts," Mr. Torricelli said.
Mr. Clinton still convenes political meetings twice a month or so in the ornate Yellow Oval Room in the White House family quarters. The sessions are not as pressing as they were when they were held weekly before the 1996 campaign, and the group of participants, which often numbers close to two dozen, is usually larger than the more exclusive club of the past. Mr. Gore does not attend anymore.
Nevertheless, Mr. Clinton assembles his top aides, some cabinet secretaries and others to hash over how Democrats are performing and to look for ways to use his presidency to help candidates.
At the start of the sessions, Mark Penn, a presidential pollster, reviews the latest surveys on an overhead projector. The discussion that follows is freewheeling, with Mr. Clinton -- who often chews on an unlighted cigar -- sounding at times like a political operative.
"He is a full-time campaign manager at these meetings," one participant said. "The entire meetings are discussions of how this would be good for Al or for the first lady and how he can help the legacy. Clinton is constantly saying, 'This would help Al.' "
Participants at the group's most recent meeting, in April, recalled that Mr. Clinton said he wanted to accept invitations to speak at college graduations in areas with high concentrations of minorities, like Shiprock, N.M., where he thought his appearance would help spur interest in Mr. Gore's campaign.
A favorite pastime of the group is mocking Republicans in Congress, particularly when they do something that hurts them in the polls.
James Carville, an architect of Mr. Clinton's victory in 1992, said of the president: "If he calls me it would be to chat about Gore and Hillary. But I've had him tell me ideas for brochures in Senate races. He's a rare combination of somebody who's got the brains and the gut."
Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he was dazzled by the president's knowledge of one Congressional district in Indiana, Mr. Andrew's home state. "He said the Eighth Congressional District is one that goes back and forth -- the bloody Eighth," Mr. Andrew said. "He knew that the southern part of the district was more conservative than the northern part. But he knew that in the southern part there had been tremendous growth because of a Toyota plant that opened there. And he knew of the Whirlpool plant in the northern part that had closed."
Michael J. Lapolla, the manager of Union County, N.J., who is seeking a House seat, said he ran into the president at a White House Christmas party last year. "As soon as he found out what I was running for, he said he liked our chances and he knew just about everything about the district," Mr. Lapolla said.
Mike Honda, a state assemblyman from San Jose, Calif., said Mr. Clinton helped persuade him to run for an open Congressional seat this year.
Mr. Clinton has taken a particular interest in the campaign of Representative Rush D. Holt of New Jersey, a freshman in a tight race. "His knowledge of New Jersey politics, and about my race in particular, is astounding," Mr. Holt said.
Bill Nelson, the state insurance commissioner in Florida, who is running for the Senate, said Mr. Clinton went out of his way to praise him at a dinner of Floridians in Washington last November -- a move that he said helped considerably in persuading Democrats to take a serious look at his prospects. "The President stands up in front of all these distinguished Floridians and proceeded to say very kind things about me," he said.
Mr. Clinton is particularly involved in Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign. One participant at a meeting with Mrs. Clinton's advisers said it was the president's idea that he not utter a word at his wife's official announcement of her candidacy in February.
"When the issue came up of whether he would speak at Hillary's announcement, he weighed in and said, 'No,' " the participant said. "He said, 'I don't think that's right. This is her day.' There were plenty of people arguing the other way because it seemed unnatural for him not to speak. But it was a good judgment."
Despite Mr. Clinton's interest in his wife's race, Mr. Torricelli said the president does not fully grasp the unusual assortment of parties on the ballot in New York. "He knows New York politically less than a lot of the other states," Mr. Torricelli said. "He doesn't quite understand the mix of all those lines." Referring to Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, he said, "He calls Schumer and gets his opinion and calls me and plays off where we might differ."
While in past years some candidates have urged Mr. Clinton to stay clear of their districts, most of those interviewed said they were grateful for the president's wisdom and did not view him as an unwelcome meddler. "He's not a Mr. Buttinski," Mr. Carville said.
Yet some candidates were not so willing to bow before Mr. Clinton's expertise, perhaps out of fear that they might appear too close to the president. "I've been in elective office over 20 years in Michigan," said Representative Debbie Stabenow, who is running for Senate and campaigned with the president this week. "I know my state very well."
Asked how often he takes advice from Mr. Clinton, Tony Coelho, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, said: "I'm not going to go there."

HEADLINE: Mayor and Mrs. Clinton Woo Liberal Party

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday returned to what has been a solid source of support throughout his political career -- the Liberal Party, and its leader, Raymond B. Harding -- and asked for the party's backing as he sets his sights on the United States Senate. But Hillary Rodham Clinton also appeared before the same group, arguing that her views were more in touch with the Liberal ideology than were those of the Republican mayor.
Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton each spent an hour in private at a Manhattan hotel with the policy committee of the Liberal Party, the first step in the party's move toward choosing its nominee by June 6. This usually barely noticed rite for candidates in New York drew a bustle of attention yesterday, evidenced by a lineup of cameras and security officers, reflecting the state and national political implications that have become attached to the decision by Mr. Harding's party. 
 "This is not my first time being interviewed by the Liberal Party," Mr. Giuliani said as soon as he left the meeting, grinning as he noted his longstanding ties with one of the smaller parties that his advisers believe could provide the winning margin in this election. When a reporter asked if he considered Mr. Harding a close adviser, Mr. Giuliani responded: "I consider Ray Harding to be more than a close adviser. I consider him a close personal friend."
Mrs. Clinton pointed to the same friendship in remarks that seemed to lower expectations on her chances of winning the support of a party that almost invariably backs the Democratic candidate in statewide elections. "I'm well aware of the mayor's relationship with Mr. Harding and the party," she said. "But I came today to ask for their consideration, based on the issues that I'm talking about in this campaign and what I would do in the Senate."
As Mrs. Clinton knows, the only time a Democrat running for statewide office won without the cross-endorsement of the Liberal Party occurred in a Court of Appeals race in the 1970's, when judges to the state's highest court were still elected. Mr. Giuliani's aides noted this fact in a handout they distributed to reporters just before Mrs. Clinton left the committee meeting to talk with reporters.
The Liberal Party has helped Mr. Giuliani's electoral success as mayor, not so much because of the relatively few votes he drew on the Liberal line, but because the party's support has allowed him to blur his ideological designation, making it more comfortable for some Democrats to vote for him.
Mr. Harding was able to steer the endorsement to Mr. Giuliani with relatively little difficulty during his three races for mayor. But this high-visibility Senate race has presented the party with a particularly complicated choice. And it has put Mr. Harding in the position of choosing between the potential future of the 55-year-old party and his loyalty to a man who is a close friend and a source of jobs for his family and party.
In an unusual display of public dissension, some Liberal Party members have said in recent days that they would oppose backing Mr. Giuliani, saying it would be a betrayal of the party's philosophy to send another Republican to the Senate. And if Mr. Harding backs Mr. Giuliani, he risks losing a presidential candidate: Mrs. Clinton's aides have been pushing Vice President Al Gore to decline the Liberal Party line if the party backs Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Gore's aides said yesterday that he might accede to Mrs. Clinton's request. They said he would put off the decision as long as possible, giving him time to assess whether he needs the Liberal Party to win in New York (right now, his aides think he does not), as well as to see whether Mr. Giuliani stays in the race.
Peter Ragone, a spokesman for Mr. Gore's campaign, said that the vice president was now beginning a closer look at the thicket of independent parties in New York, and that he would "consider the endorsement" of any party that shared his views. However, Mr. Ragone added, "the vice president is a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, and our campaign will do everything we can to elect her the next senator from New York."
Several of Mr. Harding's friends have tried to convince him that the Liberal Party's standing might be permanently damaged if it supports Mr. Giuliani and he defeats Mrs. Clinton this fall. And the advantage that Mr. Harding now enjoys by having Mr. Giuliani in City Hall ends in a year even if the mayor loses, because he will not be allowed to run for a third consecutive term.
Mr. Harding has told friends that he will delay a decision as long as possible, in no small part to see whether Mr. Giuliani stays in the race. The mayor learned recently that he has prostate cancer and has said his medical condition would determine whether he stayed in the race.
The Liberal Party endorsement has been important to Mr. Giuliani's political success to date, but he may be taking some risks in aggressively seeking its support in this race. For one thing, taking the Liberal Party line means giving up the Conservative Party line, said the Conservative Party chairman, Michael Long, who said it was ideologically dishonest for one candidate to run on both lines. The Conservative Party historically has been as critical to statewide Republican candidates as the Liberal has been to Democrats.
"What he did today -- with Hillary, no less -- they both went and knelt at the altar of Ray Harding, who in fact gave us Bella Abzug, John Lindsay and Mario Cuomo," Mr. Long said. "That sends a clear signal to the world that he wants to run with Al Gore, he wants to keep the Liberal tradition, and I don't know who the real Giuliani is."
In addition, running as the Liberal candidate is likely to complicate Mr. Giuliani's efforts to portray Mrs. Clinton as a liberal. That has been the thrust of his fund-raising appeals, and statewide Republican candidates have, for a decade, routinely attacked their Democratic opponents as liberal.
When Mr. Giuliani was asked yesterday whether he considered Mrs. Clinton a liberal, he demurred. "I think it would be overly simplistic to put labels on people," he said. "I think you can say somebody is a liberal on something and moderate on something else and conservative on something else."
Turning the question to himself, Mr. Giuliani said: "I think about me, they would say, he's conservative on economic matters, he's conservative on law and order. But he's moderate, and possibly even liberal, on social issues. It would depend on the part of the country you're in. In New York City, I'm often seen as very conservative. I travel south and west, I'm seen as very liberal. I like that, actually."
Mr. Harding greeted Mrs. Clinton politely when she arrived at the meeting at the Intercontinental Hotel, but, one participant said, asked no questions, sitting quietly in the back of a room that was thick with cigarette smoke.
Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton share positions in their support of abortion rights, gay rights and gun control, as Mr. Harding noted after the meeting. But Mrs. Clinton pointed out some differences between them on issues of concern to Liberals, including her opposition to Mr. Giuliani's school voucher program, and her criticism of the large tax cuts being advocated by Republicans in Washington.
Asked her view of what the Liberal Party stood for, she responded: "Based on what I know of it and what I've read about it, it stands for a sort of positive, progressive tradition in New York politics, and the kind of issues we've talked about. Very strong support for public education. Strong support for child care and working families. Strong support for a minimum wage increase."

HEADLINE: Long Island City Journal;
An Oasis for Fishermen And Riverside Dreamers

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
The blackened iron gantries once dominated this stretch of Long Island City like mechanical giants, their massive and clanking framework lifting railroad freight cars onto river barges like rocks into a sand pail. Manhattan, like a cool sister, obliviously hummed to its own rhythm across the short span of river.
The gantries stand silent now, looming more like towering Tonka toys over what has become a post industrial confection. Two years ago, this two-acre site along the East River was turned into a contemplative playground, into a polished cobblestone plaza, into a wood-and-steel temple for sun addicts and stargazers. 
 But shhhhh. Manhattan still sits across the river, and still is oblivious.
In a city of dwindling secrets, of binocular-toting tourists and space-deprived residents, Gantry Plaza State Park has so far remained an obscure pearl.
This is something that pleases many people in Long Island City and the surrounding communities of Maspeth and Astoria in Queens and Greenpoint in Brooklyn.
"We were afraid it would be commercial, with hot dog vendors, and really gaudy," said Jonathon Chin, who lives about four blocks away and watched the construction of the park with some trepidation.
Mr. Chin, 29, an unemployed waiter, was poring intently over the employment section of the paper, his situation made a bit more bearable by his sun-washed environs.
Some park users say they feel they can extend their arms and almost caress the skyscrapers of Manhattan. But Rebecca Ochner, a 10-year-old on spring break, had something else on her mind. She was sitting at a futuristic-looking circular stainless steel picnic bar, her favorite perch, seeking inspiration for a book she is writing on magic.
"I'm thinking about what Manhattan looked like without all the skyscrapers," Rebecca said.
A Greenpoint resident, she often tags along to the park with her mother's boyfriend, Frank Zito. He comes for the fishing.
"The park makes an artistic statement," said Mr. Zito, a committed angler, examining his bait. "It's functional with style."
On the pier designated for fishing, there is a large free-form steel table with fresh running water for cleaning the catch of the day and a wavy wooden bench that is several yards long.
Throughout the park, bethabara wood, which is plantation grown and imported from Indonesia, is used. It is not a wood that can be easily carved, but "Jose & Sarah" and "Aleandro y Johanna" have managed to leave their monikers on the wooden chaise longues.
On rock-filled paths, there are stone seats and tables that recall the Stone Age. And there are five stainless steel tables for playing chess or checkers. There is no formal garden; instead, native plants and grasses are interspersed throughout.
On one of the other three piers sat Mariaelena Gutierrez, 23, a marketing associate at a publishing house that recently moved from Manhattan to the neighborhood. She came for a lunch break, a tuna sandwich topped off with chocolate candy.
"You don't expect much from the area," she said. "But this is a pleasant surprise."
Her friend, Tracy Tumminello, also 23, a publishing associate eating with Ms. Gutierrez, was decidedly more enthusiastic. "You can't get views of Manhattan like this even in Manhattan," she said.
The park was once home to a deserted waterfront train yard and the resting place of broken televisions, ruptured mattresses and rusting cars. Gantry Plaza, which has so far cost $13 million, is Phase 1 of a planned 19-acre, $60 million park. It will stretch along a one-and-a-quarter-mile span of riverbank.
"It's a 21st-century culture of play that we are all about," said Thomas Balsley of Thomas Balsley Associates, who, along with Sowinski Sullivan Architects and Lee Weintraub, designed the plaza. "It was important that the design be a reflection of the future while being respectful of its past."
For visitors like Anthony Roberson, an unemployed Vietnam veteran, the serenity is enough.
"Here, you don't have the weight of civilization on you," said Mr. Roberson, who sat at the far end of the fish-cleaning table listening to jazz.
Across the water sat Manhattan, still oblivious.

HEADLINE: Small Provider Sees Gain in Cable TV Fight

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
The dispute between the Walt Disney Company and Time Warner Cable that blacked out ABC television for about 1.8 million New Yorkers on Monday and Tuesday provided an unexpected business opportunity to a small telecommunications company based in New Jersey.
The company, Residential Communications Networks, is one of the few alternatives to Time Warner Cable in New York City, where competition for the television industry has long been limited by the high costs of building alternative systems and the reception problems that tall buildings pose for satellite providers. 
 "As you can imagine, our telephones have been ringing off their hooks, from people who want to switch their cable service," David C. McCourt, the chairman and chief executive of RCN, said in an interview last week.
Mr. McCourt, said that people started calling his company, whose services include cable and satellite, in the hours after Time Warner removed WABC in a dispute with the broadcast station's parent company, Disney, over retransmission fees at 12:01 a.m. Monday.
Mr. McCourt contended that the blackout would never have happened if Time Warner faced real competition in New York City.
New Yorkers get cable service from Time Warner or Cablevision, depending on where they live. The two companies do not directly compete in any area.
Except for the much smaller Liberty Cable in Manhattan, the two companies used to be the only licensed cable providers in New York City, operating as government-sanctioned monopolies. But the passage of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 permitted some competition and removed some regulatory controls.
And while Time Warner and Disney have come up with an agreement -- at least until the new July 15 negotiations deadline -- and the cable provider has offered a two-day rebate for its subscribers, the ABC blackout has spawned new concern about a lack of real competition in the cable industry.
Chris Meyer, executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, acknowledged cable companies "have gotten a free ride from groups like mine," but added, "those days are over, with prices going up and this active war on consumers."He and other consumer advocates said they feared the potential dominance of the companies, if cable lines become the popular conduit for television, Internet and cable services.
Companies like RCN were seen as the potential competitors that would bring down cable prices and spur more innovation after the passage of the Telecommunications Act. But that has been slow to happen, government officials acknowledged and consumer advocates said.
Mark Cooper, the executive director of the Consumer Federation, a Washington advocacy group, said that "given the economics of splitting the cable market," possible competitors are "just not interested in coming into New York or any other major metropolitan area with high costs."
In many other parts of the country satellite television has emerged as a competitor to cable service. However, in Manhattan and many parts of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, densely packed and tall buildings interfere with satellite television signals.
RCN appears to have found a way around both the infrastructure and building interference problems. From 1991 to 1996, Time Warner and Liberty Cable waged a David-and-Goliath battle for cable-television customers in Manhattan. By 1996, despite a strategy that focused on large apartment buildings in affluent neighborhoods, Liberty was only able to sign up just 34,000 customers.
In 1996, RCN acquired Liberty's network and began putting satellite dishes on other buildings where interference is not an issue.
RCN officials hope to use the Liberty system as a foundation for their own citywide network. They hope to get around the high cost of building their own network by using Liberty's existing system and bundling services together, including cable, telephone and Internet offerings. In this way, company officials said, RCN would be able to use the same infrastructure to take a share of each of those markets. Company officials would not comment on the number of its subscribers in New York.
But industry analysts said that RCN has taken a path that will have serious limitations. For example, in seeking to sell the most profit-yielding telecommunications package, RCN may find itself restricted to upper-income areas, where people often have telephone, cable and Internet access, and tend to spend a lot on telecommunications.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
The Real Clemens May Have Arrived

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
Roger Clemens pumped his last fastball of a gorgeous yet draining day, a high heater that roared by Rich Amaral for the final out in the seventh inning and caused most of the 54,350 fans at Yankee Stadium to rise and cheer. Clemens exhaled and trudged ever so slowly to the dugout, pulling his glove off, wiping the sweat off his forehead and ending a quality day of work.
The Yankees have seen these dalliances with excellence before from Clemens, so they want to stay cautiously optimistic. They have seen Clemens look like the remarkably effective pitcher he was in a 3-1 victory over the Orioles yesterday. They have seen Clemens dominate for a few starts, only to have that consistency fade. 
 So that is why they wait and wonder if Clemens is finally comfortable with throwing mostly four-seam fastballs and comfortable with being himself. This is merely two straight victories for the new and improved Clemens, who was really being the old and competent Clemens while notching his 250th career victory, but it is enough to have the Yankees hoping that maybe he can be superb all season.
"Roger has always been a power pitcher and, once he gets hot, he stays hot," David Cone said. "Once he gets his confidence, he can reel off 10 in a row. He's starting to look like that pitcher again."
If Cone is right, the Yankees, who have won six straight games, will be relieved and ecstatic. Clemens has often puzzled them since joining the team last year, sometimes pitching like a five-time Cy Young award winner and sometimes pitching like a 37-year-old who has lost confidence in his repertory. But Clemens has returned to his roots, relying on his fastball, and the results have been stunning.
Clemens used an economical 99 pitches yesterday while allowing one run on four hits in seven innings, with five strikeouts and two walks. Those numbers almost mirror the one run and seven hits he allowed while beating the Blue Jays, 7-1, last Sunday. The revival is easy to explain: focus on the fastball.
"He's throwing more fastballs and more fastballs for strikes," catcher Jorge Posada said. "He's locating better and he's getting ahead of hitters. He's not making it harder on himself. He's making it easier on himself."
Posada could not explain why Clemens ever abandoned his best pitch in tight situations.
But, when Manager Joe Torre was asked how important it was for Clemens to continue to depend on the fastball, he was so eager to answer the question that he almost did not wait until it was asked. Torre has long wanted Clemens to be the pitcher who throws 95 miles an hour to barge through sticky situations.
"It's huge that you don't forget you have the thing, even though they know it's coming," Torre said. "A lot of pitchers don't want to throw a particular pitch because the hitter is looking for it, but his fastball is different.
"You can look for it, but he has so much movement and command of it that he doesn't give them many good pitches to hit."
Wearing a Tennessee Titans T-shirt and chugging a sports drink afterward, Clemens was reticent about the 250 victories and the back-to-back victories that have been fueled by his fastball.
Clemens expects to win, so he does not offer much enthusiasm after he does. "It's not ho-hum," Clemens said. "I'll concentrate on my next start and get ready. I'm pleased that the work I've done has paid off. It makes it easier to get up tomorrow and start all over again."
Virtually every time Clemens encountered some danger against the Orioles, he used a fastball to rescue him. Four of his five strikeouts came on fastballs, and the other came on a split-finger fastball. He walked the leadoff batters in the first and second innings, but retired three in a row each time.
Posada bashed a run-scoring double off the left-center-field fence in the second off Pat Rapp, and Shane Spencer had a sacrifice fly in the fourth to give Clemens a 2-0 lead. The Orioles cut it to 2-1 on back-to-back two-out doubles in the fifth before Clemens struck out Mike Bordick on a 1-2 fastball. Albert Belle roped a one-out double in the sixth, but Clemens used fastballs to retire Harold Baines and Cal Ripken Jr. on groundouts. Again, Torre smiled.
"He knows what works for him," Torre said. "I think it's just a matter of putting into practice his approach and knowing that it works."
Clemens said 300 victories "seems a long way off" since it would surely take him until at least the 2002 season, and he claimed that he had not remembered he had won his 250th until Mariano Rivera, who earned his 11th save, gave him the baseball. Cone doubted the veracity of Clemens's claim and lifted his eyebrows while talking about the milestone.
"He should appreciate it," Cone said. "It's a significant number. He's a sure-fire Hall of Famer. The next 50 are going to be tough. If anyone can do it, he can do it."

The Economy, Still Bullish

 BODY:
The unemployment rate dropped below 4 percent last month for the first time in 30 years, the United States Labor Department reported as tens of thousands of census takers and restaurant and temporary workers entered a booming economy.
The new numbers -- 341,000 new jobs and a 3.9 percent unemployment rate -- offered no evidence that the nine-year-old expansion might be ending or even weakening in reaction to the Federal Reserve's efforts to slow the economy by raising interest rates. 
 Wall Street reacted as if it had little to fear. Even though many analysts expect that the Fed will raise the rates at its May 16 meeting by as much as half a percentage point, the market shrugged it off and registered healthy gains Friday.

Custom-Built Wine Cellars a Sign of the Times

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM 

 BODY:
FRED TREGASKIS, who builds wine cellars for a living, said he remembers when city restaurants were the sum total of his clientele. That was in the early 1990's. Now Mr. Tregaskis, of West Cornwall, Conn., is more likely to find work at private homes in Westchester and Fairfield County.
The owner of New England Wine Cellars, Mr. Tregaskis said he built about 40 cellars last year, his biggest year ever. "Cellars have become the rage in new construction," he said. "I've built several cellars in nice homes where the client wasn't an avid wine collector, but felt their home wasn't complete unless it had a wine cellar." 
 Cellars can come with wide-screen televisions, spiral staircases and antique decorative knickknacks.
"They want hand-forged hardware on their door and old-fashioned lighting," Mr. Tregaskis said. "They also often want a medieval Italian look: 'Tuscany.' I hear that word all the time."
As demand for fine wine rises, with a record $18.1 billion worth of wine sold in the United States in 1999, having a place at home to store it safely has become a priority.
Adam Strum, chairman of the Wine Enthusiast, a wine-accessory catalog company in Hawthorne, said sales of its custom-built cellars, which start at about $5,000 for a remodeled closet, rose to 397 last year from 234 in 1998. In the first quarter of this year, he said demand is more than double what it was at this time last year. Christine Hawley of Manhattan, who has designed cellars in Westchester and the Hamptons, said the strong economy has a lot to do with it.
"The economy has been so good, people already have as many cars as they can drive, as many homes as they can go to," Ms. Hawley said. "One thing people haven't experienced is the newest pleasure left, which is wine cellars."
Not long ago, a wine cellar was thought of as a rack under the basement stairs. But today the trend is more in line with Joe O'Connor's 3,000-bottle home cellar in Briarcliff Manor, which Mr. Tregaskis is building.
"We want it to be a room where you can actually have dinner," said Mr. O'Connor, who would not say how much his cellar would cost. "We were very excited to build our house four years ago, but this is something that I'm far more excited about."
Paul Wyatt, a designer who runs the Fine Wine Rack and Cellar Company in San Carlos, Calif., which provides supplies for cellars around the country, said the New York City metropolitan region is one of six regions in the United States where the cellar market is strongest.
"Volume is going up every year," he said. "Periodically, I get so busy I can't see straight, so I raise my prices and volume goes up again."
Evan Goldenberg of Design Build Consultants in Greenwich attributed the strong demand to the rise in the stock market. One of his clients, Tony Bosco of North Salem, is a managing director at Morgan Stanley.
"I got interested in wine through entertaining," Mr. Bosco said. "With the Wall Street career, we would have parties with very fine wines. There would be people there who would go to tastings with professional writers, the kind of people who drank from unmarked bottles and guessed what wine it was."
Now Mr. Bosco is selling his house, and he sees the cellar as a feature more people in the stock-market business have come to expect. "People who have weekend or country homes here, more and more you hear about it," he said.
David Pedowitz, an investment banker who lives in Bedford, is already on his second cellar, with a 5,000-bottle capacity and a $75,000 price tag. He said he has been a wine collector for years.
"'The investment advisory business is tense and nerve racking," he said. "You find people in this business looking for releases from that tension. For me, it's wine, whiskey and cigars.'
In addition to storing his wine at an optimal temperature of 55 degrees, Mr. Pedowitz's cellar, when completed, will include a spiral staircase, a 10-by-13-foot tasting room, a special stand-up rack for his collection of single-malt scotches, mahogany doors and a burglar alarm and a temperature alarm.
Some higher-end clients want elaborate cabinets instead of racks for their bottles, creating an effect that Mr. Goldenberg likens to "a library for wine."
He said his projects tend to be expensive largely because he works with sophisticated refrigeration equipment with temperature-sensitive alarm systems and low-voltage electronic controls.
"Things really started to pick up in 1996," he said. "Projects had been in the $25,000-to-$35,000 range. Then they quickly graduated to the $45,000-to-$55,000 range. I'd have clients call me to say they moved and needed a new wine cellar. I'd have other clients tell me they ran out of space and needed another wine cellar."
While a cellar can be a way to explore a deeply personal passion, for others, it is a smart investment.
"They're a very hot item now," said David Ogilvy, who owns a real estate concern in Greenwich. "What sells houses are things like condition and master bedrooms, but a wine cellar is a really nice piece of cake."
Ms. Hawley said she believed that wine collecting is about more than drinking or investing. It can provide entre into a world where one becomes a "connoisseur of life."
"When you start building a cellar, a lot of things change in your life," she said. "You think about going to wine countries for vacations. You start going to wine auctions. Your friends change, because you're more focused on people who love wine. Your diet changes, because you want food that goes with your wine. It's like having a baby. I see people get so energized and focused."

IRRATIONAL EXUBERANCE
 By Robert J. Shiller.
 296 pp. Princeton, N.J.:
 Princeton University Press. $27.95. 
 We should know better. The greatest stock market boom in history takes place despite all that we have learned about the herd psychology that whips us into buying stocks with such enthusiasm. Never before have so many Americans been so well informed about the propensity of market bubbles to burst, evaporating their wealth before their eyes. And yet people persist -- even after what happened in April -- gambling that a "new economy," more robust and productive than any in the past, will justify the high level of stock prices. Or is it that people know in their hearts that the market is dangerously high, but, caught up in the national mood, they cannot bring themselves to quit?
No one has explored the strange behavior of the American investor in the 1990's with more authority, or better timing, than Robert J. Shiller, a Yale University economist who laces economics with big doses of psychology in his new book, "Irrational Exuberance." That is a departure in his profession. Most economists assume that people are rational and fully informed, and that their stock investments reflect a realistic assessment of the economy. The roller-coaster, less than rational price swings in April undercut that assumption, and so does Shiller.
A chart on Page 8 haunts a reader. It is a single, nervous line, like the tracing on a seismograph, that records the price-earnings ratio for a representative group of stocks back to 1881. The line represents share prices in relation to profits for a number of companies. The ratio goes up when stock prices rise faster than profits. There are peaks in 1901, 1929 and 1966, the high points of the previous booms. These are followed by long, often precipitous declines, each lasting a decade or more before the line finally climbs up toward the next boom. The latest upturn began in the early 1980's and took off in the 90's. The line is still climbing, almost vertically -- already far above the three previous peaks. Research in economics, psychology, demography, sociology and history, Shiller writes, suggests that "the present stock market displays the classic features of a speculative bubble: a situation in which temporarily high prices are sustained largely by investors' enthusiasm rather than by consistent estimation of real value."
What set off this speculation and what feeds it? Shiller ranges widely in his explanations, laying them out in the first 168 pages in easy-to-read, sometimes passionate prose. The last three chapters bog down in a discussion of the proper value of stocks -- only an economist could love it -- and in Shiller's solutions, which have to be taken on faith. (He would draw steam out of the stock market by creating new markets in other items.) But those first 168 pages are must reading for anyone with savings invested in stocks. Just internalizing Shiller's explanations of why we speculate is probably the best antidote of all.
He notes that profits have indeed been strong in the 90's and that growth has coincided with the blossoming of Internet technology, creating the impression that the two are linked. Triumphalism also plays a role. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the greater prosperity in America than in Europe and Japan reinforce confidence in American capitalism, and in the stock market.
Cultural changes are important, particularly the growing public reverence for wealthy business people, the promotion of gambling (which "suppresses natural inhibitions against taking risks") and the erosion among workers of loyalty to their employers. "By pursuing speculative investments," Shiller says, "people in effect create for themselves a second job -- one where they are, at last, their own boss."
Wall Street analysts encourage speculation. The most optimistic are also the most successful, and recommendations to sell become rare. The growth of mutual funds and the spread of self-financed pension plans keep people focused on stocks. So does the endless stream of financial news on all-day television programs. "Such enhanced business reporting," Shiller writes, "leads to increased demand for stocks, just as advertisements for a consumer product make people more familiar with the product, remind them of the option to buy and ultimately motivate them to buy."
The list goes on. Low inflation raises confidence in the stock market, an "illusion" that leaves out the role of interest rates in determining the real value of stocks. But Shiller, whose findings are based in part on his own surveys of investors, is at his best in describing the group pressures and herd behavior that sustain investment -- the amplification mechanism," as he calls it. People are prodded into the market, for example, by the constant suggestion of "the moral superiority of those who invested well" and the ego-diminishing envy stirred by hearing that others have earned more in the market than they have in salary. "The emotional state of investors when they decide on their investments is no doubt one of the most important factors causing the bull market," Shiller asserts.
THE Ponzi effect heads his list. As stock prices rise, people talk endlessly of their windfalls and new investors are drawn in. Each new injection of money pushes up stock prices, creating more happy campers whose stories draw in more investors. Overconfidence fuels the process, which Shiller calls a "naturally occurring Ponzi scheme." It unwinds when something scares the investors, and then the feedback effect works in reverse: negative stories pull down the market.
Like other writers before him -- most recently Edward Chancellor, in his very anecdotal "Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation" (1999) -- Shiller notes that the behavior of today is a replica of that in previous booms, even including the popular notion that a price drop is a buying opportunity, a rationalization also touted in 1929.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, coined the phrase that became the title of Shiller's book. Greenspan has since backed away, suggesting that the rising market may reflect rational investments in an ever more productive and profitable corporate America. But how can investors be thought of as rational and dispassionate when they so often ignore the social and psychological forces shaping their behavior?

HEADLINE: Identity;
American Dreaming

BYLINE: By Richard Powers; Richard Powers is the author of "Plowing the Dark," a novel, which will be published in June.

 BODY:
Of all our national traits, I find it the most singular, the most astonishing, the most appalling and heartbreaking, and the one that most sets us apart from the rest of the self-describing world. Is it possible in America to be pretty much who you want to be? More of us think so than believe in life after death.
Almost all of us, in fact. Of the next 10 people who you meet, 8.5 will bear a faith in their unlimited opportunity. The ability to become a ballerina, physicist, holder of patents, teacher of poetry, real estate mogul, pro basketball player, senator, ambassador, president or even a TV-show host. Pretty much whoever you want to be. A third of everyone in line at the supermarket will be dreaming of fame -- recording contracts, movie offers -- and the great majority of those will consider such dreams realizable. We live in a vast, affirming Levittown, on a double lot between Walter Mitty and Gordon Gekko, our desperation quiet to mute, our belief in boundless opportunity raucous. 
 Ever since the sudden eruption of this continent, European Americans have lived on the edge of an open frontier. Screw things up back East, and you can always light out for the territories. The fact that 85 percent of Americans still feel they have no limits suggests that, even centuries on, the frontier remains untapped and open for homesteading.
Pretty much who you want to be: five seconds of reflection exposes the equally limitless absurdity. Do 8.5 of the next 10 people you meet have a badger's chance at a dog show of becoming a brain surgeon or socializing in Hyannisport? But then, perhaps, they never wanted to. Perhaps, in America, everyone is already pretty much who they want to be, or at least happy in their infinite fallbacks. This is the secret flip side to the American dream: our embrace of endless opportunity may clothe an equally happy acceptance of the most normative social control. In America, you wouldn't want to be what you pretty much couldn't be. In the language of the marketplace -- our true, infinite frontier -- who says you can't have it all? Just don't ask what all may be.
Three years after Frederick Jackson Turner gave his famous lecture, "The Significance of the Frontier in American History," and two years after Edward Stratemeyer (of Hardy Boys and Tom Swift fame) published the first volume in his "Bound to Succeed" series, W. E. B. DuBois began the groundbreaking study, "The Philadelphia Negro." In it, DuBois wrote: "The humblest white employee knows that the better he does his work the more chance there is for him to rise in the business. The black employee knows that the better he does his work the longer he may do it." What an American wants to become has forever depended on who he is allowed to be.
Since the dream of unlimited self-realization has survived slavery and segregation, perhaps I shouldn't be shocked that 85 percent of us still assert it only eight years after one of the worst race riots in American history. But then almost half of us believe that race plays "not much role" in who we are, including three-quarters of African-Americans polled. Hispanic believers slightly outnumber whites.
Nor does economic class much trouble our belief in universal attainment. While 90 percent of people making more than $75,000 assert their unlimited potential, even people making $30,000 or less still sign on at the rate of 82 percent. Those of us who are not winning even the financial part of the race want to believe that our children still might.
The market keeps building us new room to believe, ever more American territories to light out for. Kept in reserve by God and rising up from the filled-in map, the infant Internet promises endless new vistas for self-creation. In this newfound America, everyone can register her own domain name. As gold rushes go, the Information Age threatens to leave the Gilded Age in the pyrite dust. Microsoft alone has produced as many as 5,000 millionaires.
Belief in the digital boom's democracy has, in some ways, democratized it. Almost half of Americans now own stock -- up from 14 percent in 1980. A staggering increase in paper worth has led to an even more staggering sense of paper opportunity. But in the race to be all we can be, consumer debt is mushrooming without any limits of its own. Personal bankruptcies have quadrupled over the last decade, neatly pacing the Dow. We're not afraid of losing all we have. But we're terrified of losing a chance to have it all.
Perhaps for this reason more than a third of us sometimes lament that our lives did not turn out as we wished. A third have visited therapists. Half know someone who has tried to commit suicide. Half of us think we don't get enough credit for what we do. We seem to be free to be everything we want -- except content.
For possibility and contentment may be sworn enemies. Pure potential and its despair combine to create the ideal late-capitalist perpetual-motion engine, with self-realization powering the drive train. So long as we believe there is no ceiling, there will be no end to the effort we'll expend on the way to self-making. Be all you can be. Go for the gusto. Such cheerleading cloaks the sharpest spurs ever invented. For in this country, if you don't become all that you pretty much want, you've only your own indolence to blame.
Discount these grumblings as the duty of a writer. Horatio Alger and the Stratemeyer Syndicate aside, American novelists from Hawthorne through DeLillo have forever made a living by waking America from its dream. Writers, to become pretty much what they want to be, often feel the need to leave the land of endless opportunity. Baldwin, Wright and DuBois (for reasons that almost half of those polled dismiss), Stein (the majority of respondents oppose same-sex marriages), James, Wharton, Hemingway: endless potential drove them away, to realize themselves elsewhere.
But also pardon this returnee's confession. However I would answer the question, I, too, imagine that I might have become, in some hypothetical America, anything I cared enough to be. Something in me carries around this stamp of citizenship.
In America, de Tocqueville said, with only a tincture of French tannic acid, "No natural boundary seems to be set to the effort of man; and in his eyes what is not yet done, is only what he has not yet attempted to do."
Under the burden of becoming anything we hope, between the dream of realization and our waking reality, we've created the most mercilessly productive country on earth. In believing that only the attempt stands between us and what's not yet done, we Americans, for better and for worse, will, in time, do pretty much everything we want, and then some.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in The Times Magazine last Sunday about Americans' belief in their potential misstated the response of African-Americans to a poll question about the effect of race in shaping identity. Three-quarters of African-Americans said that Americans can be what they want to be or close to it. They did not say that race plays "not much role" in the identities of Americans.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Supermarket Stocks, in the Bargain Aisle

BYLINE: By MICHELLE LEDER

 BODY:
SUDDENLY, the long-suffering supermarket sector seems an attractive place for investors to shop. Those seeking safety in a turbulent market have already begun to pile into what analysts perceive as the highest-quality supermarket stock, Safeway. Despite the pounding of retail stocks last week, its shares are up 20.3 percent so far this year; other grocery stocks have also shown gains of late.
Money managers and analysts say some of these companies -- including Safeway -- may still be good bets, particularly for investors willing to take a longer-term approach. 
 Last year, the Standard & Poor's retail food chain stores index of five supermarket stocks fell 26 percent, versus a 20 percent gain in the S.& P. 500, as investors fled value stocks in general and low-margin retailers in particular. This year has been a different story: the S.& P. retail food chain index is up 5.3 percent, compared with a loss of 2.5 percent for the S.& P. 500. But Lisa Cartwright, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, estimates that the group is still trading at a 40 percent discount to the S.& P. 500, based on current price-to-earnings multiples.
The chains themselves have joined the buying spree. Last month, the nation's two largest grocery chains, Kroger and Albertson's, announced plans to buy back $750 million and $500 million of their shares, respectively.
The attraction in a time of tumult is obvious. In the past, grocery stocks have held up well during market downturns and recessions, so the stocks are seen as good defensive plays. The industry is likely to continue consolidating, many analysts say, creating greater economies of scale and fattening what have long been razor-thin net margins of 3 percent or less.
"This sector has good earnings growth and it's trading at close to its 20-year lows in terms of valuation," said Mark Husson, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. "Food retailing stocks are stable and solid. They have good earnings potential and the valuations are very cheap."
Of course, there are risks. If the stocks are to stay attractive, analysts say, earnings per share need to grow in the range of 16 to 18 percent -- a level last achieved in 1997.
While many analysts expect some of the companies to reach that rate in 2000, they disagree on which ones will do so. Last year earnings per share for the five stocks grew just 14 percent, on average.
Then there is the threat posed by Wal-Mart Stores, which has been rapidly pushing into the grocery business with its Supercenter outlets. Wal-Mart Supercenters combine a large grocery store with the traditional Wal-Mart discounted general merchandise in vast stores of between 100,000 and 200,000 square feet. The company is introducing the Supercenters at a rapid pace: there were 739 as of March 31, compared with 582 a year earlier.
Among the large chains, Kroger, of Cincinnati, faces the biggest risk from Wal-Mart because of geographical overlap: Wal-Mart operates Supercenters in about half of Kroger's 15 largest markets. So far, Kroger is holding its own, according to analysts. Indeed, Joseph A. Pichler, the chief executive, told analysts in a conference call two months ago that Kroger had increased its market share in five of the seven markets where it competes head-to-head with Wal-Mart.
"What you're finding is that Wal-Mart is consolidating the business, but that Kroger is still able to compete effectively," said George Thompson, an analyst at Prudential Securities. Mr. Thompson said Kroger should have no problem achieving earnings-per-share growth in the 16 to 18 percent range going forward.
He has a strong buy on the stock and a 52-week price target of $32; the shares now trade at $19.5625, or 14.5 times analysts' 2000 earnings estimate of $1.35 a share.
MASU MULLICK, co-manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, says Kroger presents an interesting risk-reward story because of its $13.5 billion acquisition last May of Fred Meyer, a supermarket chain based in Portland, Ore., that nearly doubled Kroger's size.
"It's a combination of a terrific opportunity and a terrific challenge," said Mr. Mullick, who had about 2.5 percent of the fund invested in Kroger on March 31.
Others say the merger has made it more difficult for Kroger to focus on its Internet strategy. Though Internet grocers are struggling to turn profits, some analysts worry that traditional brick-and-mortar chains will eventually feel some impact.
Over the last month, Safeway has invested in Groceryworks.com, an online grocer in Dallas, while Royal Ahold, the Netherlands-based operator of Stop & Shop and Giant Food Stores, has invested in another, Peapod of Skokie, Ill.
"The Internet is clearly going to be a channel, even if the model has not yet been figured out," Ms. Cartwright said. "But it's important to have a strategy."
DESPITE the run-up in Safeway's stock, it remains the favorite of some analysts, largely because the company has avoided the big acquisitions that Kroger and Albertson's have made.
Safeway, which is based in Pleasanton, Calif., and operates more than 1,600 stores, is often cited as having a strong management team.
"They don't have have the integration risk that Kroger has" as a result of its merger, said Deborah Weinswig, an analyst at Bear Stearns. Her 52-week price target for the stock is $65; the shares closed on Friday at $43, or 19 times analysts' earnings estimates of $2.23 a share for this year.
For its part, Albertson's, based in Boise, Idaho, is not encountering major problems in its merger with American Stores, completed last June, but analysts said it still has to prove that it can handle increased competition from Wal-Mart.
Ms. Cartwright has a hold on the stock and a 12-month price target of $35. It now trades at $32.1875, or 12 times analysts' 2000 earnings estimates of $2.68 a share.

HEADLINE: The World;
Sometimes, National Security Says It All

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TEN years after recapturing the Continent, Dwight D. Eisenhower calculated that the lessons of D-Day could be usefully applied in persuading Congress to lace the land with highways. His administration dreamed up the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways and argued that these roads were not only about economic development, they were about national security.
"In case of atomic attack on our key cities," he wrote in 1955, "the road net must permit quick evacuation of target areas, mobilization of defense forces and maintenance of every essential economic function." 
 Half a century later, the highways he built can barely handle a 5 p.m. crush of commuters in their S.U.V.'s, much less a panicky evacuation of the capital. But if he were alive today, the old five-star might smile to hear the latest Clinton White House strategy. The president and his national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, have taken up a mantra that granting permanent "normal" trading status to China isn't just about profit opportunities, it's also about national security. At the same time, the administration has labeled the AIDS crisis in Africa a threat to national security, and Vice President Al Gore has raised similar fears with his "new security agenda," which includes global warming.
Without question there is a case to be made that economic chaos, disease and climatic upheaval can all trigger political nastiness. So all of this new labeling raises a question: Just when does a big problem turn into a national security threat?
On trade with China, the Clinton administration argument is that granting normal trade status would reassure the Chinese that America isn't trying to hem them in.
"From a national security point of view, it would in my view be a very, very unwise and precarious move to say that the United States doesn't care whether they're part of the world community or not," President Clinton told an insurance group last week, a theme he repeated nightly as he tried to win over 40 or so legislators who were still undecided about the China bill.
Only days before, the White House was arguing that the spread of AIDS in Africa would lead to economic collapse, political instability and civil wars that might eventually require American intervention.
"I'm not saying that we have a short list of national security threats and East Timor is now off and AIDS is on it," Mr. Berger said in an interview. But strife has many origins, he said: "If it creates instability, chaos, conflict and war, that has national security implications."
Mr. Gore, meanwhile, used a foreign policy speech last weekend to argue for the need for "forward engagement" (presumably a Gore-ism for trying to think ahead). He ticked off -- in no particular order of priority -- pandemics, economic inequality, global warming and the digital divide as potential security problems that had to be nipped in the bud.
In Mr. Gore's case, the political calculation is obvious: he is trying to portray his opponent, George W. Bush, as a man caught in what he termed a cold-war mindset that sees national security only in the most conventional terms.
But it is still unclear whether the new Democratic relabeling of issues is just shrewd political marketing -- to Democrats who don't like trade deals, and to Republicans who don't care for foreign aid, particularly when it involves AIDS -- or a truly new agenda for an age of new global threats.
It is hard to tell. As the Clinton presidency winds down, the definition of national security threats has gotten ever fuzzier. Even some senior members of the administration worry privately that the White House regularly overplays its hand and should reserve the national security argument for events tightly linked to the prospect of the United States becoming involved in conflict. "There's a significant risk of crying wolf," one of the president's top security advisers concedes. "This isn't Sputnik," he added, in another allusion to the Eisenhower years, when appeals for education funds could be based on fears that the Russians were well ahead in the race to build the first I.C.B.M.'s.
Clearly there is a strong moral argument for helping the destitute ravaged by AIDS, in Africa or elsewhere. And no doubt the disease could lead to political instability. But so can poverty, and the 1.3 billion people who live on less than a dollar a day trigger meetings at the World Bank these days, not in the Situation Room.
Advisers to Mr. Bush, eager to portray the current occupants of the White House as long on butter and short on guns, carry the argument one step further: by making the list of security threats too long, they argue, the Clinton administration risks taking its eye off more imminent threats. Or as Paul Wolfowitz, dean of the school of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and one of those advisers, wrote recently, AIDS in Africa and the environment are serious problems, but calling them national security threats carries "the implication that conventional security is no longer something we need to worry much about."
But this is also an administration repeatedly stung by the criticism that its foreign policy has been a series of belated reactions, rather than the product of any global strategy. So Americans may be ready to welcome anything resembling preparation for new crises, as long as it differentiates between real security threats, potential threats and social work. And it is possible -- though hardly certain -- that after a decade of unchallenged power and prosperity, Americans are ready to think about their national security in broader terms.
A decade ago, any serious official who argued that admitting Communist China into a Western trade regime might change China's political culture would have been laughed out of the National Security Council. Today, even some Republicans sound a lot like Bill Clinton when it comes to talking about the benefits of exposing China to a Western-designed legal system or fueling the spread of the Internet. "China's emergence as a world power is a classic security issue," said Richard Armitage, who has served several Republican presidents, "and if getting them into the world trading system makes them more restrained, a better actor, then I'm for it."
Mr. Clinton's most potent argument may be the one he hasn't made in public, chiefly to avoid offending two of America's closest allies. In the first half of the 20th century, Germany and Japan lashed out in large part because they felt the world was constraining not only their military might, but their ability to manufacture and export. Any global system that reduces trade barriers, the theory goes, also deflates some of those pressures.
But non-economic forces also cause wars, and it is a mistake, Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers acknowledges, to "overemphasize the link between economic forces and future conflict." Perhaps that is why Mr. Clinton and Mr. Berger last week opened a new front in the China argument. Rather than argue the economic and political benefits of getting China into the tent, they made the case that keeping it out would court disaster -- that insulting China would strengthen the hand of the People's Liberation Army in its battle over China's direction with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, the leader of China's move to a market economy. But if the Chinese economy opens too quickly -- forcing tens or hundreds of millions of workers in inefficient state-owned enterprises out of work -- Mr. Zhu could be blamed for that, too.
Whatever one thinks of the logic, Mr. Clinton's national security case for letting China into the World Trade Organization seems to be winning some converts. "The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has an answer to the economic arguments about this deal," one undecided congressman -- who asked not to be named -- said last week. "But they don't have any answers on the security side." On the other hand, the effort to reclassify AIDS seems to have fallen flat. No one in either party is talking about reallocating the trillions saved by the Soviet Union's fall on international AIDS programs, or any other foreign aid.
But China trade may be different. Eisenhower's highway system is now crumbling, and members of Congress want it fixed. A few who are on the fence about China have suggested that the place to fix the Interstate System is in their districts before Election Day. That might make them more amenable to the Clinton view of national security.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about national security issues truncated a comment from Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. As reported, Mr. Summers said it was a mistake to "overemphasize the link between economic forces and future conflict" because noneconomic forces also cause wars. But the main point of his comment was, "When people are prosperous and hopeful, they don't look for men on horseback."

HEADLINE: Next Up, Making Adriaen's Landing Work

BYLINE: By NICOLE ITANO 

 BODY:
THE state government agreed last week to invest more than half a billion dollars in Adriaen's Landing, an ambitious plan to develop Hartford's waterfront that many people hope will ignite an economic revival in the state's struggling capital city.
Hartford, which has the highest unemployment in the state and the lowest per capita income, is trying to capitalize on the experience of other cities such as Baltimore and Cleveland, which have worked to revitalize their downtowns through public investment in sports complexes, convention centers and retail districts. 
 While the state's decision to put $529 million into this project has been lauded as a turning point for downtown Hartford, almost everyone involved with the project agreed that the long-term success of the project will require more than just sticking a new hotel and convention center into the downtown. Supporters hope the project will be a catalyst for further economic development and help turn around the city's image. For that to happen, however, the project must be successfully integrated into the surrounding city and coordinated with other urban revitalization projects.
"This is not a magic bullet for the city," Representative David McClusky said. "The city has a lot to prove. Not only does it have to get this project right so that it doesn't become another Constitution Plaza or Hartford Civic Center, it has to get its act together on other issues such as education and social services."
All together, Adriaen's Landing will cost an estimated $771 million culled from a combination of public and private sources. The state will raise most of its share from bonds. The project will include the construction of a convention center, a 700-room hotel, entertainment and retail space and upper-income housing targeted at young professionals on a 33-acre patch of land near the Hartford waterfront, as well as a $90 million football stadium in East Hartford for the University of Connecticut.
The House of Representatives passed the bill authorizing state funding for the project on Tuesday and Gov. John G. Rowland, who has put his political weight behind Adriaen's Landing from the beginning, signed it into law less than an hour later.
Mr. Rowland's rapid action on the funding bill is illustrative of the unusual coalition that has united behind this project. While the bill faced sharp criticism from some members, it passed easily in both the House and Senate with strong support from both parties.
Public investment in projects like Adriaen's Landing, which are intended to draw people downtown and attract private investment, have become popular methods of urban renewal in cities that have been losing population and jobs to the suburbs.
"These kinds of projects can be very symbolic and very important and significant in making those other kinds of investments take place," said John Melcher, associate state director at Michigan State University's Center for Urban Affairs Community and Economic Development Program. "Downtowns by and large have had a traditional role of being the centers of commerce and financial centers for communities."
Mr. Melcher said a city's image could affect the reputation of the surrounding region, influencing investment decisions and people's decision to move into the area. Much of that image, he said, is based on the perceived vibrancy of the downtown area.
Mr. Melcher cautioned, however, that downtown redevelopment projects must be accompanied by other initiatives to fix schools, support community organizations and provide affordable housing.
"That isn't in and of itself a solution to many of the problems that face our urban cores," he said. "Healthy downtowns and poor neighborhoods make you no more successful than healthy neighborhoods and poor downtowns."
Opponents of the project, who were few in number but vocal with their objections, question whether Adriaen's Landing is even a good place to start revitalizing Hartford. While the project may gentrify the city's center, they argued, it would leave the surrounding neighborhoods mired in poverty.
"A project like this has never, ever, anywhere in the United States, been a catalyst for turning around a distressed city," said Representative Jefferson Davis, an opponent of the bill. "We're going to find ourselves in five years with the convention center done and a city that is still segregated both economically and racially."
Mr. Davis said the Baltimore harbor project, which supporters of Adriaen's Landing and similar projects point to as a classic success redevelopment story, failed to help the poorest residents and improved only a few square miles of the city.
David Rusk, a specialist on urban issues and author of "Inside Games/Outside Games," said that the success of a project like Adriaen's Landing depends largely on whether one is looking at the downtown or the surrounding city. While Adriaen's Landing may turn the downtown into a tourist attraction and popular residential area for young professionals, he said he doubted that any positive economic effect would spill over into the surrounding neighborhoods. Hartford's biggest problems, he said, are its poverty and segregation.
"This initiative is not going to affect that picture," Mr. Rusk said. "That situation is the primary burden that the city of Hartford must deal with."
While Adriaen's Landing has attracted a great deal of attention, city and state officials said it is only one part of the Hartford revitalization effort.
"Adriaen's Landing tends to get a lot of the attention because it's the biggest development project," said Dean Pagani, a spokesman for the governor. "Millions of dollars have been spent in the neighborhood trying to create new business, trying to create safer hosing conditions near Trinity College. It's a process that is taking place throughout the city."
The Capital City Economic Development Authority, a quasi-public agency charged with overseeing Adriaen's Landing and other state-funded redevelopment projects in Hartford, is also working to bring more housing downtown, revitalize the ailing Hartford Civic Center, and bring more parking to the downtown area.
The Riverfront Recapture Project has been working to reconnect the downtown to the water by creating a network of public recreation facilities.
The success of Adriaen's Landing will depend largely on integrating these various projects and connecting them to the rest of the city through transportation and education initiatives, those involved in the project said.
"This is only the end of the beginning," said Brendon Fox, executive director of the Capital City Economic Development Authority.

HEADLINE: Where 'Separate but Equal' Still Rules

BYLINE: By Ward Connerly; Ward Connerly is the chairman of the American Civil Rights Institute and the author of "Creating Equal: My Fight Against Race Preferences."

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

 BODY:
If you're looking for one of the last bastions of segregation in America today, you are likely to find it at your local bookstore. I learned to my surprise and consternation last week that a customer looking for a specific book may need to identify and be conscious of the race of the author in order to locate it. Or the customer will need to presume that the subject matter is an issue of importance only to readers of a specific race.
As a recently published author, I stopped by a prominent bookstore in Washington a few days ago to autograph its stock of my new book, which recounts the story of my advocacy against racial preferences. First I looked in the "New Arrivals" section. It was not there. Nor was it in "Politics & Government" or "Biography & Autobiography." 
 When I asked a store employee to check to see if the book had been ordered, the manager recognized me as the author and helpfully explained that the book had been shelved under "African-American Interest." When I asked why he had placed the book in that section, he said he had done so as a "service to the community."
The "service" to the African-American "community" is in reality a great disservice to the general book-buying public. And for those authors like me who find themselves consigned to the redlined literary ghetto, it represents discrimination of the most insidious type.
One of the great joys of bookstore shopping is serendipity, the unplanned discovery of a book one hadn't known existed. Most of my book purchases over the years have been the result of such chance encounters, and I know that I am not alone. Publishers, after all, work hard to design attractive dust jackets to encourage impulse buying.
But for black authors -- or any authors who write about race issues -- the "special section" approach rules out the serendipitous purchase. Only those book buyers who self-consciously identify with the "black community" are likely to head for the "African-American Interest" shelves.
What about other readers who may be interested in the subjects we're writing about? If they browse in "Performing Arts," will they find the new biography of David Geffen, but not Sidney Poitier's memoir? If they check the shelves in "American History," will they see Tom Brokaw's books on the World War II generation but not Michael Eric Dyson's controversial reinterpretation of the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.?
The shelving of their books in a special section deprives black authors or "race" authors of significant sales opportunities, putting them at a competitive disadvantage compared with authors whose books are not ghettoized.
But the economic harm pales in contrast to the intellectual and cultural damage caused by the bookstores' version of racial profiling. They have fallen into the trap of thinking that a writer's skin color is a reliable guide to judging the contents of his or her books. My book, like those by other writers who happen to be black, is meant for readers of any race interested in the subjects and controversies I address. By relying on a blatant stereotype -- that blacks are the only ones interested in the history, culture and politics of black people -- the bookstores marginalize some writers and limit their ability to reach out to a broader audience and to share common bonds and values.
If bookstores are truly interested in performing a "service to the community," they should make an active effort to integrate black writers, and writers of other ethnic and racial groups, into the general mainstream of the publishing world, and to allow books to rise and fall on their literary and intellectual merits -- not on their supposed narrow appeal to racial pride.
"Separate but equal" did blacks no favors in schools or on public transportation; it does us no favors in bookstores, either.

HEADLINE: Terrorism's Real Locale

BYLINE: By Ali Abunimah; Ali Abunimah is vice president of the Arab American Action Network.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Global terrorism has a new face: its practitioners are less the well-organized, state-sponsored groups of old and increasingly part of "far-flung and loosely structured webs of terror." So said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright last week as she released a report on global terrorism.
The report also had two other major conclusions: that there has been a shift from politically motivated terrorism to a brand driven by religion and ideology, and that the primary terrorist threats to the United States emanate from the Middle East and South Asia. 
 All of this may seem like conventional wisdom, but a closer look at the government's own data reveals a reality at odds with it. And policies built on flawed conclusions could do more harm than good.
Contrary to popular perceptions, most terrorist attacks against American targets do not emanate from the Middle East or South Asia. Of the 169 specifically anti-American attacks on foreign soil in 1999, 96 were in Latin America, 30 were in Western Europe (many of these committed by groups opposed to the war in Kosovo), nine in the countries of the former Soviet Union and 16 in Africa. Only 11 were in the Middle East, and just 6 in Asia. The proportions have been similar since at least 1996.
Much of the terrorism in Latin America, which includes bombings and kidnappings, is committed in Colombia and Peru by leftist rebels and right-wing paramilitary groups. American citizens and commercial interests have been attacked partly for ransom money to help finance insurgencies and partly to undermine national economies.
But these groups, which commit most of the attacks against Americans and their property abroad, get less attention than groups with Arab or Muslim orientations.
In the Middle East and South Asia, the terrorist attacks against Americans that do take place usually arise from a perception that the United States has taken sides in local political conflicts, like those between Turkey's government and the Kurds or between Israel and the Palestinians. Most terrorism in South Asia is linked to conflicts in Kashmir and Sri Lanka. The United States continues to list some countries in these regions -- most notably Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria -- as "state sponsors" of terrorism, but acknowledges that they are generally far less active today than in the past.
We must not be complacent about terrorism and should continue trying to identify dangerous groups. But we must also be conscious of overreacting to a phenomenon that typically claims fewer American lives in a year than domestic handgun violence claims in a single day.
Arab-Americans and Muslims living in the United States have too often borne the brunt of government suspicion and media stereotyping. After many in the media rushed to blame Middle Eastern terror groups for the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 -- erroneously, as they soon learned -- several Arab-American groups reported an increase in hate crimes and harassment. Last December, there were reports of increased and sometimes abusive scrutiny of Arab-American travelers after the State Department linked a threat of terrorism around New Year's Day with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, without giving any specific grounds for such a connection.
Arabs and Muslims, almost exclusively among immigrant groups, have also been subjected to the use of secret evidence in deportation proceedings -- which, in opposition to American traditions of open justice, has been legal since 1996.
The cruelest paradox is that many of the people suspected of having connections to terrorism actually came to America to escape conflict and injustice in their homelands and could be important allies in the most effective long-term antiterrorist strategy of all: improving relations with their home countries and bringing just solutions to conflicts there. The worst thing the United States could do on the home front is to make them, and the American public, feel that these people are strangers who bring danger to this country, rather than would-be citizens who strengthen it.

HEADLINE: Challenges Lure New Workers

 BODY:
The newest crop of workers may be less concerned than had been thought on the high salaries and stock options.
In a survey to be released today by WetFeet.com, an online recruiting and career site, 869 undergraduate and graduate students from more than 50 colleges and universities around the country were asked to rank their priorities in making career decisions. 
 Challenging work topped the list of important factors. It was followed closely by solid "training for future work." Third in ranking came "good colleagues/boss." Salary was fourth. Stock option packages fell to the bottom, along with "ability to dress casually" and "no weekend work."
"Even in today's economy, where it seems everyone is going after the Internet gold rush, people are looking at their career decisions very carefully and are weighing other factors as more important than salary and stock options in their career decision," said Stephen Pollock, president of WetFeet.com.
Mr. Pollock said he found the results particularly striking because the survey was in February and March, when the stock market was still flying high.
"Even before the recent volatility in the stock market, students show they're very thoughtful about their career choices," Mr. Pollock said.
WetFeet.com, based in San Francisco, hired Q & A Research, a research firm in Novato, Calif., to conduct the online survey. Survey participants were drawn from users of the WetFeet.com site as well as other career and educational Web sites.

HEADLINE: An Absence at Auction Time;
Former Sotheby's Official Is in Limbo Instead of in the Spotlight

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL and RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
In other times, this would have been Diana D. Brooks's moment.
On the eve of the multimillion-dollar spring auctions of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's in New York, it was always Ms. Brooks's striking presence and booming voice that predominated. 
 As the auction house's president and chief executive, she cropped up on "Charlie Rose" or "Today," talking up the forthcoming sales. She greeted the thousands of visitors who thronged Sotheby's York Avenue galleries to view the art coming up for auction. Ms. Brooks, six feet tall with distinctive curly blond hair, presided over cocktail parties, dinners and brunches in the United States and abroad for Sotheby's big-money collectors. When the selling began, sometimes she even wielded the auction gavel herself.
But as experts finish preparing for the two weeks of auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's that begin tonight -- hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of art will change hands -- there is an uncomfortable silence on York Avenue. Ms. Brooks, who had become something of a celebrity in the 13 years since Sotheby's made her the first woman to head an auction house, resigned under fire on Feb. 21, along with A. Alfred Taubman, the company's chairman and its biggest shareholder, in connection with a federal antitrust investigation. Allegations center on whether the two colluded with their counterparts at Christie's, Sotheby's archrival, in setting the commissions charged to buyers and sellers. Between them Sotheby's and Christie's dominate the multibillion-dollar auction market.
The prospect of financial ruin or even prison has taken a toll on Ms. Brooks and her family, friends and associates say. "She is extraordinarily upset and terrified about the consequences," one friend said, speaking on condition of anonymity. She recently cut her hair short and straightened it to be less recognizable. But the friend also described her as resilient and physically fit, still devoted to morning runs of several miles.
Except for one visit to Sotheby's since her resignation -- several hours that employees described as painful in their awkwardness -- Ms. Brooks, 49, has kept to herself, spending considerable time at her mother's house in Hobe Sound, Fla., but returning periodically to a luxury apartment on the East Side of Manhattan and a Connecticut home.
She and her husband, Michael C. Brooks, a venture capitalist, recently bought a house in Jupiter, Fla.; Florida protects homes from seizure in bankruptcy proceedings. The week she resigned from Sotheby's, the couple put their 7,262-square-foot Colonial house in Greenwich, Conn., on the market for $4 million, along with an additional two-acre plot for $1.5 million. They also own a residence in Lawrence, on Long Island.
Ms. Brooks turned away numerous requests for interviews, made through one of her lawyers, Stephen E. Kaufman, and Sotheby's chief spokeswoman, Diana Phillips.
Ms. Phillips, a longtime confidante of Ms. Brooks, said that they had spoken from time to time since Ms. Brooks's resignation and that "she sounded fine."
As Ms. Brooks's lawyers maneuver to negotiate a settlement with the Justice Department, her life is in limbo. If charged and found guilty, she could be heavily fined and sentenced to up to three years in prison. But the Justice Department could still determine that the evidence is insufficient to warrant prosecution, or it might offer her lenience or even immunity in exchange for her testimony.
People close to the case said she was prepared to testify that Mr. Taubman had directed her to meet with her counterpart at Christie's, Christopher M. Davidge, to discuss price-fixing arrangements. But they said she would give such testimony only in exchange for favorable treatment from prosecutors. Such a statement would support one made by Mr. Davidge, who has told the government that a former chairman of Christie's, Sir Anthony Tennant, devised the price-fixing scheme in meetings with Mr. Taubman and then instructed Mr. Davidge to carry it out on behalf of Christie's.
Christie's turned over documentation from Mr. Davidge to the government and has received immunity dependent on its continued cooperation.
Through their lawyers Mr. Taubman and Sir Anthony have disputed the accounts and denied any wrongdoing. The chief Justice Department antitrust prosecutor in New York, John J. Greene, has consistently declined to discuss the case.
Life at Sotheby's is not going on entirely without Ms. Brooks. Although she is no longer a company officer -- she and Mr. Taubman are now listed only as board members in Sotheby's catalogs, and even those references will soon disappear as neither is standing for re-election -- she remains on her full salary of $600,000, people close to her said.
William F. Ruprecht, Sotheby's new chief executive, who joined the company in 1980, confirmed only that she was still getting paid for helping with what he called the transition. Art dealers say that she has been calling their clients, hoping to win business for Sotheby's.
So big was her role at Sotheby's that it was impossible for her simply to walk away, officials at the company say. It was Ms. Brooks who shaped relationships with the company's most important clients, often pre-empting other Sotheby's specialists. It was Ms. Brooks who brokered every important deal, whether for a highly valuable Picasso or for a giant canary diamond. "She's a very smart, innovative thinker," said George Goldner, chairman of the department of prints and drawings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, who negotiated complicated deals with Sotheby's while curator of paintings and drawings at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. "She was not restricted by the boring ways most people buy and sell art."
Collectors and dealers say they do not believe the Justice Department investigation will hamper a serious collector who covets a Monet or a Matisse. But in an auction world governed by the "three D's" -- death, divorce and debt -- the robust economy is such that collectors who don't have to part with their artworks are holding on to them. Since no big collectors died this past winter, experts at both Sotheby's and Christie's were left to scramble for property. Ms. Brooks was Sotheby's most powerful business getter.
The first daughter of a family of six children, Ms. Brooks was brought up comfortably on the North Shore of Long Island. She once said she remembered her father, Martin, telling her she could do anything her two older brothers did.
"I believed him," she said years ago. "When I was 8, I announced I wanted to go to Yale." She graduated from Yale in 1972.
The man she would marry, Mr. Brooks, was also a Yale graduate. Their eldest child, a daughter, graduated from Yale last year.
Her father controlled the only private water company covering a part of New York City, the Jamaica Water Company. After he died in 1977, Ms. Brooks's brother, Andrew, took over the company, then called Jamaica Water Properties, and through rapid acquisitions built it into the nation's largest computer reseller, a multibillion-dollar public company renamed JWP Inc.
Ms. Brooks later joined the board of JWP but left before December 1993, when the company collapsed in bankruptcy and litigation charging fraud in bookkeeping. JWP later re-emerged as the Emcor Group. A lawsuit by insurance companies seeking to recover $148 million from Ernst & Young, JWP's accounting firm, was recently reinstated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York. Ms. Brooks was not a defendant in the actions.
Ms. Brooks got to Sotheby's by accident. In 1979, while taking a leave from Citibank, where she was a lending officer, to spend more time with her infant daughter, she was told by a friend that Sotheby's was looking for a business person. She was hired part time as director of financial planning and soon assumed the job full time.
For four years Ms. Brooks, who is known to her friends and colleagues as Dede (pronounced DEE-Dee), concentrated on the business side of the company. Then she moved into a more administrative position. That was in 1982, when the company's profits were down and its staff bloated. Through buyouts and pink slips, Ms. Brooks reduced the staff by 90. The move earned her praise from some outside financial analysts, but some inside the company called her "the hatchet woman."
As a boss Ms. Brooks was known for putting a premium on the company's profitability and seeking out new business opportunities, for instance, using the Internet and offering clients insurance. She stressed that the company's future depended on reaching beyond the traditional deep-pocketed buyer.
But her management style lacked subtlety and got mixed reviews. "Dede is an extremely smart person, effective in putting teams together in every imaginable project and creative in bringing people together, often outside their regular expertise," her successor, Mr. Ruprecht, said. "We had a full and frank relationship with each other, and 'warm' needs to get added to that."
But some colleagues and former Sotheby's employees, who signed confidentiality agreements in exchange for lucrative financial settlements but who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, said she displayed a temper and willfulness, sometimes directed even at Mr. Taubman, the chairman, who himself is strong willed.
"Nothing happened without her knowledge or say-so," said one former employee. "She micromanaged everything."
But Mr. Ruprecht made light of such accounts, saying, "She deconstructed some things and put them back together." He called her "a conciliator and provocateur, as any boss needs to be," adding, "We worked all the time in concert -- not all the time."
From the beginning, despite occasional frictions, Ms. Brooks won the support and respect of Mr. Taubman. "I think they worked closely with each other for a long period of time," Mr. Ruprecht said.
In 1990 she was elected to the board of the Yale Corporation, on which she still serves. She and her husband have contributed generously to the university.
She was asked to leave another board, however, that of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, after she resigned at Sotheby's.
She supports various charities, including a juvenile outreach program in Baltimore that she and two friends started after Ms. Brooks's godson, a 19-year-old high school student, committed suicide two years ago. A sportswoman who runs nearly every day and was known to have whipped male employees on company golf outings, Ms. Brooks frequently spends vacations tackling challenging pursuits like helicopter skiing.
Her competitive side was just as visible in the office. When the company arranged with Amazon.com last year to create a new Web site called Sothebys.Amazon.com, which sells collectibles online, Ms. Brooks was all over the airwaves once more. The company has poured tens of millions of dollars into that site and a sister one, and once more Ms. Brooks was not only Sotheby's champion, but also its personification. Promotions for the Amazon venture featured a picture of Jeff Bezos, chairman and founder of Amazon, and Ms. Brooks posed together in a gilt frame.
That was only last summer, but in many ways it was a long time ago.

Royal KPN Reopens Talks On Mobile Phone Venture
Royal KPN returned to the bargaining table with another potential partner, NTT DoCoMo of Japan, just days after KPN called off merger talks with Telefonica of Spain.
Royal KPN, the largest telephone operator in the Netherlands, and DoCoMo, the mobile operations of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, have been negotiating in fits and starts for over a month now. They are hoping to reach an agreement that could include an alliance between the two companies' mobile telephone operations. Page C12.

Time Warner's Big Gamble
Time Warner's decision to block the ABC television network in 3.5 million homes last Monday will surely be a prominent chapter in public relations history. In just 39 hours -- the time it took for it to restore the ABC signal -- Time Warner managed to anger many of its customers, rile local and national politicians, , draw the ire of the Federal Communications Commission, and upset what had looked like smooth sailing on the way to approval of its merger with America Online.

'Millionaire' Enters 'E.R.' Zone
With a week of celebrity contestants, ABC had already found a new way to use "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" to hammer its competitors in a sweeps month. But last Thursday the network managed to pile on some additional torment for NBC: ABC quietly let the Thursday edition of "Millionaire" run eight minutes long, just enough to blunt the start of NBC's strongest series, "E.R." ABC beat "E.R." in its first half-hour, something no regularly scheduled ABC show had done in the seven-year run of the hit medical drama. C20.
 
A Top Inspired by Buckminster Fuller
Kurt Przybilla's childhood jungle gym inspired a lifelong fascination with Buckminster Fuller, the architect and futuristic thinker who invented the geodesic dome, and that led to Mr. Przybilla's newly patented invention, which he describes as an omnidirectional top. He says that his tops can help children develop an intuitive understanding of physics or chemistry in much the same way that an understanding of geometry can grow out of playing with blocks. Patents.

HEADLINE: Falling Euro, a Unity Currency, Instead Bolsters Dollar and Pound

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 7

 BODY:
The pink roses with dashes of peach were popular on a sunny spring afternoon at the downtown farmers' market.
But for anyone thinking in terms of dollars, what was more striking was the price for a dozen: 7.2 German marks, or $3.31. Not long ago, they would have cost almost $5. 
 Fresh-cut flowers have long been a bargain here, but something else is at work now as well: The euro, Europe's fledgling single currency, has plunged 24 percent since its debut on Jan. 4, 1999.
The euro was supposed to unify the economies of 11 European countries and be a symbol of stability to rival the dollar, the yen and even the British pound. The idea was to be a European champion just as Airbus aircraft took on Boeing.
But so far it has been a boon to the very currencies with which it was supposed to compete. Now Americans brandishing dollars or Britons spending pounds are finding bargains from Amsterdam to Vienna.
On Friday, in an extraordinary statement for a central banker, the president of the European Central Bank, who is to the euro what Alan Greenspan is to the dollar, all but apologized for its descent, saying it could "undermine the perception of the euro as a stable currency."
He and and another top official hinted, for the first time, that the bank might reverse its policy and try to raise the value of the euro by going into currency markets and using its reserve of dollars to buy euros.
Thanks to the euro, the price of a McDonald's Big Mac costs less in Germany than in the United States. French wines, Belgian beers and Italian shoes are all bargains when priced in dollars.
Euro bills and coins are not yet in circulation, but local currencies like the German mark and French franc are locked to the euro's value and controlled by the European Central Bank, in Frankfurt. That means that euro weakness matters little for Germans buying goods with marks or Italians with lire.
"As long as I don't go on vacation in the United States, it doesn't bother me," said Dagmar Hofmann, a rose cultivator who brings her flowers into Frankfurt every Friday.
But it means that the euro is suffering a crisis of confidence. Since its debut as the official monetary measure of Europe, used mostly by banks, corporations and stock markets, it has fallen from $1.17 to below $1 last year and to just 89 cents last week.
The decline has mystified analysts, mortified politicians, alarmed central bankers and reignited suspicions among those who never liked the idea of giving up their currencies.
"I believe we will have to pay dearly for the euro," said Rainer Forster, a 37-year-old electrician. "The British haven't joined yet, and now it turns out that was pretty clever."
Wim Duisenberg, the central bank president, said in his written statement on Friday, "The euro's exchange rate has given rise to questions from European citizens who are concerned about the value of their currency." The implication that the bank might intervene cheered euro speculators, and the currency's value rose slightly against the dollar later in the day.
"I understand their concerns, since a persistently lower euro exchange rate might ultimately lead to higher prices in the shops," he added.
The vice president of the bank, Christian Noyer, was blunter, saying that intervention in the markets was "a tool in our hand," and that "we may use it."
For now, though, some Europeans have felt almost cheated. "There is a general feeling of unfairness," the French newspaper Le Monde said in an editorial. "Does the United States deserve such a strong currency? The dollar's superstar status demonstrates how well Washington is able to steer the international financial community into overlooking the weaknesses of the American economy."
Europe is hardly in an economic crisis. The euro countries are growing at a rate of about 3.4 percent this year, the fastest clip in years, and not that bad compared with the 4.5 percent expected for the United States. While inflation is lower than in the United States, unemployment is still high at 9.6 percent. American unemployment was 3.9 percent last month.
Nor are volatile exchange rates anything new. But the fallout from the euro's plunge is getting serious. It has greatly strengthened the position of opponents in Britain, which will make it more difficult for Britain to adopt the currency.
Partly in response, conservative German politicians demanded last week that Greece be barred from adopting the euro for several years. The European Commission recommended on Wednesday that Greece be allowed to join. But when the euro dropped to a low of 88.9 cents on Thursday, the Bavarian governor, Edmund Stoiber, blamed the decline in part on the news about Greece.
The economic consequences are beginning as well. With import prices higher, inflation in the euro zone reached 2.1 percent in March.
By making European goods cheaper in American dollars, the euro has fueled a boom in European exports, and that has propelled German economic growth, which is expected to more than double from last year.
But the euro has also created a deep economic wedge between Britain and the Continent. The pound has risen just as sharply against the euro as the dollar, with devastating results for British manufacturers.
Thanks to the strong pound, British products are now expensive in continental Europe, and Britain is being flooded with low-priced imports from the Continent.
Exchange rate problems were one reason for catastrophic losses at Rover, the British maker of four-wheel-drive vehicles that Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G. bought and tried to export to Europe and is now desperately trying to sell.
Jaguar, the luxury auto maker, has absorbed what amounts to a double-digit price decline in Germany to keep from losing market share. So some Jaguar models in Germany cost less than in Britain.
British consumers, furious, have started a campaign called "Rip-Off Britain" to put pressure on companies that charge more for products in Britain than on the Continent.
But the big debate is about the reasons for the decline, which has confounded economists.
The most common explanation is that the American economy's remarkable boom has been an unprecedented magnet for money.
One common criticism of the euro-zone economies is that they have not yet deregulated their labor markets and reduced taxes.
Others point to conflicting signals from the European Central Bank. "I admit that we have not always been equally successful in communicating our policy intentions to the public," Sirkka Haemaelaeinen, a member of the bank's executive board, conceded in a speech last week.
The problems may go deeper. Economists note that the bank has been following a surprisingly loose monetary policy.
Not only are interest rates substantially lower in Europe than in the United States, but the supply of money has also consistently expanded faster than the central bank's own targets, hurting the euro's value.
So far, ordinary citizens have remained fairly relaxed. Even many Germans, who treated the mark with almost religious reverence, seem patient.
"The euro's image is pretty bad right now, but I think it has been bad-mouthed," said Severin Fiebon, a 27-year-old bank worker in Frankfurt. "The euro is still very young."
Gerhard Bocke, a retired teacher here, said he has lived through big swings before. "The exchange rate between the dollar and mark has changed so often," Mr. Bocke said on Thursday. "It goes up, then it goes down. I don't really care about it as long as I don't travel to America."

Women's Sports Foundation Expands Mission Beyond Opening Doors

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS 

DATELINE: UNIONDALE, N.Y., May 7

 BODY:
Female athletes, coaches, administrators, educators and entrepreneurs gathered here this weekend to celebrate their accomplishments and to prepare for the challenges ahead.
In assessing the state of women in sports, those attending the 14th annual conference of the Women's Sports Foundation agreed that there were more opportunities for women since Title IX of the 1972 Educational Amendments banned sex discrimination in federally funded school programs. Now, in a stance that reflects the influence of the foundation and its constituency, the group wants to focus less on getting in and more on moving up. 
 "Initially the primary function was opening doors of opportunity," said Donna Lopiano, the executive director of the foundation. "Now, it's exploiting the participation of women in sports in an economic sense, gaining access to assets, program expansion and addressing the continuing problem of girls being discouraged from sports."
That sentiment was echoed in the theme of the conference: Brave New World of Women's Sports. For the 350 who registered for the three-day event at the Long Island Marriott, it was a chance to exchange information and ideas, network and develop strategy to fulfill the potential that women have in athletics.
It provided a setting for the kind of informal debate many women had not engaged in since their college days, on topics as disparate as the feasibility of a 24-hour women's sports channel and the notion that news media images have increasingly portrayed female athletes as sex objects.
During a panel discussion on women of color in sport, Krista Ford, the only African-American woman on the United States bobsledding team, talked about the trials and tribulations that come with being "a first and only."
"There's no diversity in winter sports," said Ford, who also competes in bodybuilding. "In bobsledding, there are no women on member boards. It's all good old boys."
Ford said she had grown weary from the constant battles, but vowed to continue the fight "so other kids won't have to go through the hell we've had to endure as pioneers."
Established in 1974 by Billie Jean King, the foundation has emerged as a leader and advocate for women's sports. From May 1974 to May 1999, the foundation awarded more than $5 million in grants and scholarships to girls' sports programs, elite athletes in training and other leaders in women's sports. It annually responds to more than 100,000 requests for information on issues ranging from pregnancy and exercise to coed sports, and assists more than 700 students, parents and coaches a year on gender equity issues.
To ensure its place in the future, the foundation has begun to change the way it reaches its audience. Last year it created a Web site, www.womenssportsfoundation.org.
"Women's sports has been somewhat prevented from educating the next generation," Lopiano said, noting that because men are still largely in decision-making roles in athletics, women do not have equal access to young athletes. "We had to find a way to leap over the more traditional communication systems of getting to kids through teachers in the schools and go directly to the teens by using teen media vehicles: television and the Web. The Web is the most cost effective."
Another measure of the foundation's clout was found in the mix of corporate sponsorships for this year's convention. Although there were female-oriented sponsors like Tampax and Sports Illustrated for Women, big donors also came from the finance, apparel and telecommunications industries. Among them: Merrill Lynch, Mervyn's of California and America Online.
Karin Lofstrom traveled here from Ottawa, where she runs an on-line company for women's sports products.
"We don't have an organization like the Women's Sports Foundation in Canada," she said. "It's so exciting to be here with these women, who are helping to change the role women play in sports not only in America but throughout the world."

HEADLINE: Serving Self While Serving Others

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
J. T. Houk, the impresario behind one of the nation's largest charities, is no stranger to controversy.
The Internal Revenue Service once tried to revoke his organization's tax-exempt status. Last year, Congress and the I.R.S. put a stop to a charitable giving strategy promoted aggressively by Mr. Houk that critics said benefited donors more than recipients. 
 Now Mr. Houk is facing a challenge to what he claims is the cornerstone of his brand of philanthropy: finding ways to have donors and volunteers pay themselves for their charitable deeds.
Rejecting the notion that anyone ought to perform a charitable service for free, Mr. Houk derides what he calls the "charity poverty syndrome." He acknowledges that some people make exceptional volunteers, but says, "Volunteers give you dregs, not dynamite," especially as fundraisers. "You get what you pay for."
Donors who entrust money instead to his Falls Church, Va., charity, known as the National Heritage Foundation, set up individual accounts that mimic foundations at a fraction of the cost. In turn, they are eligible for immediate tax deductions for their gifts and are encouraged to use the money in their accounts to pay salaries and expenses for themselves and their families.
Donors need not worry about the low pay charities offer, says the pitch on the foundation's Web site, "We would strive to bring your salary up to private industry standards."
But many in the charitable world bridle at the notion that people have any business paying themselves to carry out their charitable impulses.
"It's like paying the Girl Scouts to sell cookies," said Jack Shakely, president of the California Community Foundation, which is one of many competing charities that also offer "donor advised" funds, which allow donors to set up individualized accounts with funds earmarked for charity.
The California Community Foundation bars donors from paying themselves or family members. "It's not illegal, but it just doesn't pass the 60-second smell test," Mr. Shakely said.
The National Heritage Foundation, however, is far less restrictive, one reason why at last count tens of millions of dollars from some 4,000 foundations had been set aside for charity under its auspices. How much of that money will ever go to worthwhile causes is far from clear.
Administrative and marketing fees payable to National Heritage, some of which are split with financial advisers who bring in the funds, come right off the top. Then there are also the many families who dip into their National Heritage accounts to pay themselves salaries or defray expenses.
Dr. W. John Martin of Rosemead, Calif., set up his charity to fund research on viruses that no university or government agency would underwrite.
Robert and Cynthia Fleming of Poulsbo, Wash., used some of the money they gave to National Heritage to send their son to Mexico for three years, calling it missionary work. While the Flemings could have tried to create their own foundation, it would have been "very time consuming and expensive," said Ms. Fleming, who heard Mr. Houk's spiel on radio and was persuaded.
Jerome T. Barrett of Falls Church, Va., heard about National Heritage from a colleague. What he finds most appealing was foundation officials' willingness to look after many of the details of running a charity. "They take care of the money, and they will defend you in court" if a donor runs afoul of I.R.S. rules, Mr. Barrett said.
He uses his charity, Friends of FMCS History Foundation, to sponsor research on a book he is writing on the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, where he once worked. His foundation no longer has enough assets to allow him to dole himself a salary, but it covers the rent on his office.
While Mr. Houk says the National Heritage Foundation ultimately controls where every dollar under its management goes, many of his competitors want Congress to outlaw use of such accounts to siphon money to donors and their families. The effort to curb this practice was reported last Friday in The Wall Street Journal. The Clinton administration has proposed going further: restricting the gifts these funds can make to charities registered with the Internal Revenue Service. That would preclude donors from giving to foreign charities and needy individuals.
Mr. Houk makes no bones about favoring old-fashioned entrepreneurship as a way to invigorate the nation's charities. Accustomed to being the focus of regulatory ire, Mr. Houk, a former Fullbright scholar who boasts a law degree, an M.B.A. and a Ph.D., refuses to back down even at the risk of further scrutiny by the I.R.S. and sharp public criticism. "The envelope needs pushing," he said.
If that makes him something of a maverick, so be it. "All progress is created, in my opinion, by skewed personalities," he said. "The champion is not an average guy."
Quick to rely on biblical sources to support his views about paying volunteers, he claims the National Heritage Foundation has the potential to revolutionize churches, schools and other charities. But he is convinced that competing charities, the government and the media are conspiring to put an end to his efforts.
Born in Dayton, Ohio, Mr. Houk, who is known as Dock, describes himself as coming from a wealthy background. He said his family was connected with the Mead Corporation, the giant paper company. He claims to have given nearly all of his inheritance to charities except for some property he kept for his wife and some small mutual fund accounts for his grandchildren.
After graduating from Brown University, he spent a year in Finland on a Fullbright scholarship, where he earned an M.B.A. Later, he added two other advanced degrees before working for the government researching the impact of international aid.
In 1968, dismayed by the government's actions to crack down on private charities, Mr. Houk created the National Heritage Foundation in anticipation of the 1969 Tax Reform Act, which took aim at perceived abuses by corporations and individuals whose charitable activities were said to be more for their benefit than that of others. "I didn't like the 1969 tax act," Mr. Houk said. "I thought it might cauterize charitable giving."
Mr. Houk was also busy on other fronts: creating what he claims was the first socially conscious mutual fund and teaching in the economic and business department of Liberty University, the college founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell.
By the early 1980's, the National Heritage Foundation was coming under increased scrutiny by the I.R.S., which can revoke a charity's tax-exempt status for some offenses. The service brought a case in 1982, alleging that the charity was really a group of private foundations, which would be subject to different requirements, and that it offered significant private benefit to financial planners who promoted it.
Mr. Houk's organization, which by then had ousted him at the insistence of a big donor and had changed its name to National Foundation Inc., won the case in 1987.
He got going again in 1994, forming a new group that he again called the National Heritage Foundation. It invoked many of the same principles about the evils of big government, attracting many powerful supporters. For instance, Bruce R. Hopkins, a prominent Kansas City charity lawyer, wrote the forward to Mr. Houk's book, "The Coming Charitable Revolution," in which he lauded Mr. Houk's vision of a grassroots brand of philanthropy. That said, Mr. Hopkins said in an interview he never meant to provide Mr. Houk's organization with a blanket endorsement.
There also remains significant enthusiasm for Mr. Houk's creativity at motivating people to give among people who work with donors.
"The big issue is charitable entrepreneurship, and how far you can push that," said C. Dennis Brislawn, a trusts and estate lawyer in Kirkland, Wash., whose clients have set up foundations at National Heritage. "Dock Houk is one of the champions to push the limits."
Besides getting a cut of the fees levied on donors' accounts, financial planners who generate a lot of business for National Heritage have also been rewarded occasionally by having foundations set up in their own names at National Heritage's expense. Planners may also use foundations to pay themselves for raising funds for charity.
What Mr. Houk and his organization get out of all this is open for debate.
In 1998, when people were enthusiastic about a plan to buy so-called split-dollar life insurance policies at his urging, National Heritage took in $128 million in revenue, its tax returns show. The split-dollar life insurance scheme, in which donors' gifts to a charity were used to buy life insurance policies naming both the charity and donors' heirs as beneficiaries, was outlawed last year, and Mr. Houk says National Heritage's revenues fell to about $61 million in 1999, information that is not yet available on the tax returns. Some donors who took his advice and bought split-dollar life insurance policies that have backfired are mulling lawsuits, although it is not clear that Mr. Houk would be the target of such actions.
Even in a banner year like 1998, only $3 million was disbursed to outside charities, the tax returns show. Another $3 million covered other program expenses like honorariums and publicity, and nearly $60 million was used to buy insurance policies and other investment products used to build endowments. And information on how much donors are paying themselves cannot be gleaned from the tax returns.
The charity's 1998 tax return makes no mention at all of Mr. Houk's own pay package and does not list Mr. Houk as one of its top officers, omissions that Mr. Houk acknowledged were an error, especially when the organization's letterhead refers to him as its executive director and chief executive officer.
Mr. Houk says he makes about $6 an hour, roughly $12,000 a year or so, in keeping with his sense that he does not need the money. He does, however, allow the organization to pick up some of his expenses, like frequent travel to the West Palm Beach area, where he maintains a modest office.
Having installed his wife, son and daughter-in-law in top positions at National Heritage, he allowed them as a group to make about $166,000 in 1998 salaries, according to the tax returns.
At an airport lounge in West Palm Beach last Friday, Mr. Houk said he did not understand why he was such a target for regulators, who he said were paying undue attention to him.
"We're probably more socially responsible than the average bear," Mr. Houk said defiantly. He says he could easily spend his days playing tennis and enjoying life, but there is little sign of surrender. "We're not going to quit fighting," Mr. Houk said.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Numbers Hint at Change in Voting Rules

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
The latest numbers offered a stunning contradiction: a 3.9 percent unemployment rate, the lowest in 30 years, and two major national polls showing Gov. George W. Bush of Texas leading Vice President Al Gore by 5 percentage points.
To put that contrast in perspective, the last time a president's party lost the White House in good times was 1920. And even then, the country was recovering from the double-digit inflation of World War I. 
 So why isn't the booming economy blowing Mr. Bush away? Have the rules changed?
Perhaps.
First, the economy has stayed strong so long that most people are not worrying about it. Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster, said, "It doesn't sit there as a major worry that people talk about." Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster who collaborates with Mr. Hart on the NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll, said one reason for Bush support among older people was that "only about 6 percent of the old people have economic worries."
Second, Mr. Gore does not get credit for the way things are. Polls show the public gives it to President Clinton and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
That may be reasonable enough, but Mr. Gore's own weakness as a candidate compounds that problem. After all, Mr. Gore is campaigning on a promise to keep the same economic policies Mr. Clinton has followed, while Mr. Bush's central campaign message is that he wants a very big tax cut.
But the NBC/Journal poll showed that only 27 percent of voters thought Mr. Gore was very likely or fairly likely to pursue policies that would keep the economy strong, compared to 32 percent who said that of Mr. Bush. (Both of them enjoyed less credence than they did in December, when 36 percent had confidence in Mr. Gore and 43 percent in Mr. Bush.)
The NBC/Journal poll had Mr. Bush ahead, 46 percent to 41 percent. A Gallup Poll for CNN and USA Today had the Bush lead at 49 to 44. Both polls were taken the last weekend of April, and the margin of sampling error for the NBC/Journal survey was plus or minus three percentage points, one less than for the Gallup Poll.
Mr. Gore has simply not capitalized on winning his party's nomination more easily than Mr. Bush won his or achieving quickly the party unity and support from Bill Bradley that Mr. Bush is still seeking from Senator John McCain.
Mr. Teeter said the data in the NBC/Journal poll explained it. "Gore is not a very good candidate," he said. "He is not a very likable candidate." Mr. Teeter argued that Mr. Gore's frequent attacks on Mr. Bush ran the risk "of looking like the guy who is out of his time," out of step with an optimistic country.
Though Mr. Teeter agreed that a strong economy was a major factor in retaining a president or his party, he said the most "likable" candidate had won most postwar elections. The clearest exception was 1968, when a losing war, civic turmoil and rising inflation helped Richard M. Nixon edge out Hubert H. Humphrey. In 1976, Mr. Teeter said, both Jimmy Carter and President Gerald Ford seemed likable.
Still, these are early days. When the nomination contests ended in March, public interest in the campaign plummeted, and surveys by the Vanishing Voter project of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University show that knowledge about the candidates has also declined.
There is no question that the Gore message in the summer and fall will emphasize continuity and accuse Mr. Bush of risking prosperity for a needless tax cut. Comparisons with the last Republican administration are inevitable, but will have special bite because the phrase "Bush recession" will surely be used.
Mr. Hart, while conceding Mr. Gore's weak standing, cited a focus group he conducted last Tuesday in a Philadelphia suburb as offering hope for Mr. Gore. Everyone in the group of 12, whether he or she favored Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore, "wanted the same policies," he said. "They didn't want to tinker with the economy."
"Al Gore is sitting on a gusher," Mr. Hart said, if he can find a way to identify himself with the voters' desire for continuity.
The best evidence that it is not too late for Mr. Gore comes from a New York Times/CBS News Poll taken in May 1988. That was the last time a vice president ran to succeed a popular president in an economic boom. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis led Vice President George Bush, 49 percent to 39 percent. It did not last.

HEADLINE: China Trying to Crack Down On Vocal Liberal Intellectuals

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 7

 BODY:
China's leaders are trying to rein in a growing and increasingly assertive liberal intellectual movement, criticizing prominent academics and authors in speeches, forbidding newspapers from running their articles and punishing or shutting down publishers who have brought out their work.
In recent years, unofficial and quasi-official outlets for liberal political ideas have multiplied rapidly in China -- on the Internet, in informal discussion groups, in magazines and books that result from collaborations between independent editors and state publishers. At a time of rapid economic and social change, China's leaders clearly view this trend as a threat to their political power. 
 Despite his Western-leaning economics, President Jiang Zemin has in the last year constantly reiterated the importance of standing fast by Communist ideology in a China overrun with dot-com start-ups. In the last few months, those admonitions have led to a series of punitive actions against writers perceived as straying too far in a liberal or reformist direction.
"It's a very tense time," said a prominent professor, who like others would speak only if not identified. "President Jiang is very unhappy with some things that friends have written. He wants to undertake some ideological cleansing."
In a country where economic reforms have spawned greater pluralism in ideas and the means to express them, it is impossible to mount a concerted old-style Communist Party campaign, academics here say. But the scattershot attacks have been many and varied, and do have short term consequences, at least.
In a speech in Guangdong province, Mr. Jiang himself directly criticized a much-revered retired official of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Li Shenzhi, for an Internet essay.
The editorial offices of the Reform Publishing House in Beijing have been shut down for bringing out "The Secret Scriptures of Officialdom," a book that obliquely describes the back-stabbing and bribery required to attain public office.
Liu Juning, a political scientist who has written about the need for political reform, was fired from his job at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and editors at the state-owned Commercial Publishers had to write self-criticisms for publishing his book.
High-level officials have canceled the scheduled publication of the second volume of the official "History of the Chinese Communist Party, covering 1949-82, saying the final draft was too critical of the party's past errors. Gong Yuzhi, one of the book's chief editors, has retired as deputy head of the Central Party School, in part as a result.
Editors at two lively, independent newspapers, Southern Weekend and Shopping Guide, have been replaced. And editors at a popular newspaper have been criticized for reporting that several employees of the United States Central Intelligence Agency were disciplined for the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade a year ago -- a fact not reported in the state-controlled media.
"It is evident that Jiang Zemin feels that the intellectual community has become too brazen," said a newspaper commentator, who also would not be identified. "Everyone is aware of the spirit of Jiang Zemin's speeches. And even if they don't agree, they know if they don't act, they're putting themselves in danger."
Chinese liberals say the timing of the intense criticisms, after years of stuttering but slowly expanding intellectual freedom, is probably related to Communist Party politics.
They say China's leaders are nervous about the liberalizing forces that could be unleashed by China's expected entry into the World Trade Organization, as early as this year. They add that Mr. Zemin's tenure as president and party leader will probably end in the next few years and that he is trying to burnish his image to maintain some role for himself in the future. That means turning down the volume of critics.
Overall, the campaign has had a clear dampening effect: China's growing stable of liberal intellectuals -- in universities, government research institutes, the media and publishing -- are lying low. For instance, more than half a dozen people who last year would have been happy to be quoted by name, refused to be identified in this article.
But most remain confident that the current tightening on intellectual life will pass. And in the China of today, threats from the central authorities have diminished influence. Bookstores are still filled with provocative books. And people fired from government institutes can now often find a way to make a living in the expanding private sector.
"I can continue to do my work, but it will be more difficult," said Mr. Liu, the political scientist who was fired. "Now, for example, I think it will be very difficult to publish articles or books in the major media. And, perhaps, students will not be able to invite me to lecture at universities."
The government's surprising face-off with Mr. Li -- by far the mosttalked-about event in the crackdown -- shows both the government's determination to curb liberal voices, and also how far some essayists have gone.
A one-time aide to Zhou Enlai, the late Prime Minister, Mr. Li had been considered nearly untouchable, until he was berated by Mr. Jiang in a speech this year to Communist Party cadres. The criticisms were deleted from published versions of the lecture, Chinese journalists said.
Mr. Li, who is in his late 70's and will probably suffer no immediate effects from Mr. Jiang's speech, has long issued muted criticisms of the government, generally concerning the 1988 military suppression of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. But his recent essay was considerably more explicit, mocking last year's lavish celebration of 50 years of Communist rule.
"Hitler is dead, Stalin is dead; there can't be that many countries left that strive for this vision of grandeur," he wrote. "My own guess is perhaps only Kim Jong Il's Korea would embrace it."
His essay was widely circulated in intellectual circles -- on paper and by e-mail. It was ultimately posted on the Internet, though not by Mr. Li himself, his friends say. That is when it came to the attention of government officials.
Although liberal academics say senior officials have also directly criticized a few other longtime reformers, including the economist Mao Yushi, the tightened policy has generally trickled down by more circuitous routes.
In the last year, Mr. Jiang has insisted that all officials rededicate themselves to Communist ideology through his "Three Stresses" campaign ("Politics, Study, Probity"), and some have clearly heeded the call.
In early March, the central government's News and Publications bureau called publishers to a conference just outside Beijing to deliver Mr. Jiang's admonitions, specifically criticizing two publishing houses.
Although all publishing in China is theoretically owned and controlled by the state, most publishers these days collaborate with independent, for-profit book editors, generally by selling them a government license to print a particular book. This widespread practice, which started as a way to raise money for cash-strapped state publishers, has opened up the industry to a broad spectrum of politically sensitive topics, since the actual editing is no longer done by government employees.
At the conference, state publishers were told that Mr. Jiang wanted to curb the practice and were instructed to review all books they had brought out since 1997 to see if they contained attacks on the leadership.
"Suddenly, all of the publishers totally withdrew, without exception," said an independent editor. "Now they've started coming back, but very slowly, and the book has to be totally secure and unprovocative."
The tightening has surprised many Chinese who had hoped that the government would open publishing and generally relax security, once the 50th anniversary celebrations were over last fall. And in a throwback to old-style Communist campaigns, trouble for individuals has often been heralded by an article in an obscure journal or a letter to the editor.
Mr. Liu's firing from the Academy of Social Sciences grew out of an indignant letter from a graduate student at Beijing University who had heard him speak. The letter, printed in Guangming Daily, a party newspaper aimed at intellectuals, was addressed to the academy and also to the president.
Still, even as Chinese intellectuals bemoan the current climate, they feel more inconvenienced than terrified by the government's wrath.
"The methods are pretty much the same as in Deng Xiaoping's and even Mao's time," the professor said. "What's different is that nobody pays attention anymore. The effect is very limited. Intellectuals don't feel that much pressure. And ordinary people don't pay much attention or sympathize with the authors."
He predicted that the current effort would peter out within a year because "no one approves of this kind of criticism anymore." And the graduate student who caused the dismissal of Mr. Liu would probably have trouble getting a university job in the future, he said.
And even as some authors complained that publishers had put their books on hold, strong liberal voices were cropping up here and there -- in some very unlikely places.
The current edition of "Reading Room," a monthly journal published under the auspices of the Hunan Province News and Publication Bureau -- the provincial censorship organ -- features two long, somewhat daring essays. One advocates more aggressive economic reform. The second explores the often prickly relationship between writers and politics.
"In China, winning and consolidating state power was the main objective of all revolutionary work, and publishing, as a part of it, was no exception," Li Xianzhi wrote in this second essay. "The longstanding precepts of 'class struggle' and 'ideological dictatorship' destroyed people's ideas of rule of law, that is, their ideas of freedom."

HEADLINE: Higher Stakes in Eviction Battles;
Landlord-Tenant Fights Soar With Real Estate Prices

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Even in the storied annals of New York City Housing Court, where landlords have tried to evict tenants for everything from barking dogs to unauthorized washing machines, the case against Dana Escoffier was novel.
As Mr. Escoffier tells the tale, his landlord accused him of looking too young. 
 Testifying about his case at a City Council hearing on rent regulation in February, Mr. Escoffier complained that he suddenly faced eviction proceedings after living for 28 years at 523 Hudson Street in Manhattan.
The landlord's lawyer claimed that the tenant of record by now would be 69 years old, and since Mr. Escoffier looks nowhere near that age, he must be an impostor and should be thrown out. While he could pass for someone in his 40's, Mr. Escoffier said he is actually 55 and has no idea where the lawyer came up with 69. To avoid eviction, Mr. Escoffier went to court with a State Department of Motor Vehicles identification card, only to face new challenges to his lease.
"It's about greed, about getting as much money as they can for the apartment," said Mr. Escoffier, who pays $443 a month for the small two-bedroom under rent stabilization regulations in the West Village. He figures that if he is evicted and the apartment is deregulated, the owner could quadruple the rent in today's turbocharged real estate market.
One longtime tenant advocate who thought he had heard it all was struck by the too-young charge. Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, said, "It's the craziest thing I ever heard of."
Although trying to evict someone for looking too young is a peculiar argument, landlords are adopting increasingly aggressive tactics to oust tenants from valuable rent-regulated apartments.
Real estate experts say the city's sizzling housing prices, coupled with the weakening of rent regulation laws in 1994 and 1997, have made it increasingly lucrative for owners to empty apartments with low rents, especially in Manhattan. Landlords, many of whom say they are being shortchanged by illegal subletting, often spend thousands of dollars per case for lawyers and even private detectives, but they can quickly recoup those costs in higher rent and in the building's resale value if they win.
"The incentive to get tenants out by any means, legal or illegal, is tremendous," Mr. McKee said. "If you get a vacancy, you've got a gold mine."
When a rent-stabilized apartment is vacated, an owner is allowed to charge the next occupant as much as 20 percent more. If renovations and other specified allowances add up to a monthly rent of more than $2,000, then the apartment is permanently deregulated. Deregulation -- the holy grail of the rental business -- means that the landlord can charge whatever the market will bear.
"Some buildings are serving blanket notices to everyone terminating tenancy," Mr. McKee said. "If just one person gets frightened and moves out, they're ahead." Tenants are often unaware that "the landlord has to prove his case, and no one can be evicted without a court order."
Tenant lawyers say they are getting swamped with cases. Colleen McGuire, whose law firm was hired by Mr. Escoffier, said, "There is a surge, almost an epidemic."
But owners say they are forced to protect their property from deceitful tenants who illegally sublet regulated apartments at great personal profit, cheating landlords of their rightful income.
"There is a greater level of aggressiveness on the part of owners because so many people are living illegally in rent-stabilized units," said Joseph Strasburgh, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, the leading owners' group. "In Manhattan, particularly, you have a large number, so thousands have been challenged purely on the basis that they don't live where they say they live. But to say that owners are just using this as harassment is unfair."
Soaring prices have raised the stakes and the abuses, both sides say.
"Tenants themselves recognize this is a very hot real estate market," said Sherwin Belkin, a lawyer who represents owners. "Like landlords, they're viewing apartments as having enhanced economic value. Tenants engage in deceptive activities, and that has the landlords digging a little deeper and pushing the envelope further, like a rubber band with each side tugging and pulling.
"Ninety percent of sublet requests are absolutely deceptive," Mr. Belkin continued. "They're actually moving somewhere else, putting someone else in the apartment and getting extravagant amounts of money but insist on the application that they intend to come back at the end of the sublet. It gives new meaning to insider trading."
The economic boom has reduced evictions for rent arrears, but the number of cases like Mr. Escoffier's has risen since 1994. That was when the City Council changed the law to deregulate any vacant rent-stabilized apartment if the monthly rent could be raised to $2,000 through renovations and other factors. The year before, owners filed 15,058 eviction cases. Filings jumped to 17,975 in 1994, and in the five years since they have averaged 22,200. Last year there were 22,781.
"There's been a tremendous upsurge, akin to the mid-80's co-op boom," said Samuel J. Himmelstein, a tenant lawyer. "My practice has virtually tripled since 1995."
Eviction litigation can be expensive for both sides, easily costing thousands of dollars. "No one wants to pay attorney's fees for frivolous cases," said Mr. Strasburgh of the Rent Stabilization Association.
Mr. Belkin said that the biggest cases involve the most valuable apartments, where "the tenants are almost always represented by counsel."
But tenant advocates paint a discouraging picture, with most tenants facing eviction without a lawyer. "I've had tenants crying that they can't afford a lawyer," Mr. Himmelstein said. "For every one who can, there are three or four who can't."
He warns that contesting and losing a case makes tenants liable for legal fees for both sides and retroactive rent at market rates, which could add up to tens of thousands of dollars. "I've had clients sit here and say, 'That would mean bankruptcy for me.' " Some tenants simply give up and move out.
Mr. Escoffier said that his building, a five-story brick walk-up with 18 apartments, once had a tenants' group that staged a rent strike to get bathrooms installed in the apartments, instead of shared ones in the hallways. "But that has dwindled down, and now people are fighting their own battles.
"I don't want to move. I can't move, can't afford it," said Mr. Escoffier, a nutritionist. His apartment is a narrow railroad flat with a fireplace, two small connected bedrooms, slanting floors and an enclosed toilet in one kitchen corner and a shower in another.
After spending half his life there, Mr. Escoffier said, he was shocked when eviction papers were served last fall, and even more puzzled by the accusations. "They kept saying I was too young to be 69," he recalled. "But I never said I was 69." In court, when he produced better records of his tenancy than the landlord did, Mr. Escoffier said, "The judge said, 'He must be who he says he is.' "
But documentation of his age did not end the eviction case. There were five more rounds of court hearings, Mr. Escoffier said, and in each, the landlord's lawyers tried other arguments to get rid of him.
One argument was that the original lease was signed by Mr. Escoffier's father, and that the son was not entitled to stay. Mr. Escoffier denied that, saying that he was married and had reared two children there, but that "my father never lived here."
The owner's lawyer also contended that Mr. Escoffier really lived somewhere else and that the apartment was illegally occupied by a subtenant, described first as a young man who recently answered the door and later as an older man also seen on the premises. Mr. Escoffier said that he had business away from the building on the day of a scheduled repair and had his nephew there to let the superintendent in. And the older man was simply a brother visiting from Brooklyn, he said.
"They're willing to try anything; they just want to get the apartment so they can charge more money," Mr. Escoffier said of the continuing court battle.
The litigation is exhausting, he said. But he enjoys recounting some courtroom volleys, like his response to a claim that he had not been seen around the building. "I said to the lawyer, 'Are you saying that since I was not seen I didn't exist?' I asked the lawyer, 'Do you believe in God?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Have you ever seen God?' He said, 'No.' I said, 'Are you saying he doesn't exist?' The judge chuckled at that one."
The landlord's main lawyer, Thomas S. Fleishell, declined to be interviewed on the issues. "Suffice it to say that Mr. Escoffier's conduct over the years has given reason to bring the proceeding," he said. The building's recorded owner, Hudson Street Equities Group, does not have a listed telephone number. The building managers, Time Equities, deferred to the lawyer.
"I may be soft-spoken," Mr. Escoffier said, "but I am a fighter and I stand my ground." He said he was especially motivated to defend his home. As a young man, before getting his life together and going to college, he lived for a while in Central Park. "I was homeless before it became fashionable," he said, "and I don't want to go back."

HEADLINE: Out-of-State PAC's Continue to Aid Pataki

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 6

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki, hoping to keep his political choices open, has continued to raise money through two political action committees that he set up outside New York to enhance his national profile.
The stated purpose of those committees, which bear the name "21st Century Freedom," is to help Republican candidates around the country who share his views. But campaign records show that most of the total of $892,573 raised so far has been used to benefit Mr. Pataki by building new political alliances and subsidizing an increasingly expensive political apparatus that helped him win two terms as governor. 
 The out-of-state PAC's -- one was formed under federal law, and the other in Virginia, where there are no limits on contribution amounts -- have channeled $67,433 to state and federal races outside New York. Yet they have paid at least $126,944 to Mr. Pataki's longtime pollster, Arthur Finkelstein; $118,046 to his political consultants, Kieran Mahoney and Adam Stoll; and $190,653 to a half-dozen campaign aides who are or have been on his payroll for years.
Other money has been used to hire prominent Republican consultants who could help Mr. Pataki in a future run for national office. For instance, Benjamin L. Ginsberg, an elections specialist at the Washington law firm of Patton Boggs, whose clients include Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, billed $7,264 in legal fees as recently as March. Stephen Moore, an economist with the Cato Institute in Washington, received $27,500 for fine-tuning Mr. Pataki's fiscal proposals, while Peggy Noonan, a speechwriter for Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan, was paid $10,000 to polish his words.
The money figures are the latest the committees had available. In the case of the Virginia PAC, they cover all of calendar 1999; the federal PAC's figures cover the period from January 1999 to March 31, 2000.
Although Mr. Pataki has not revealed his political plans, it is clear that he commands substantial resources that could be mobilized on short notice. In the last week, politicians and lobbyists have speculated that Mr. Pataki may do just that to run for the Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton if the probable Republican candidate, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, is forced to drop out because of his prostate cancer.
Mr. Pataki, the most successful political fund-raiser in the state's history, has brought in a total of more than $3.2 million in contributions since January 1999, including $2.4 million through his main campaign fund, Friends of Pataki, which is based in New York.
He has already spent more than two-thirds of that money -- mainly on political consultants, salaries for his full-time campaign staff members, travel and fund-raising expenses -- even though he does not face re-election until 2002.
"It's a complete change in culture," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester County who has criticized Mr. Pataki and Republican leaders for their aggressive fund-raising practices. "There is no election cycle anymore; it's flat-out fund-raising from the inauguration to the next election."
Zenia Mucha, chief political adviser to Mr. Pataki, said money from all three committees had enabled the governor to travel around the country and build support for the party. "The governor feels very strongly about promoting the Republican agenda of smaller, more effective and efficient government, lower taxes, individual freedom and other issues that are part of it," she said. "We have and will continue to use these PAC's to disseminate and promote that message."
Many lobbyists and other regular contributors complain that they are paying heavily for Mr. Pataki's growing political activities. They say privately that Mr. Pataki's campaign aides have aggressively encouraged them to send donations to the Virginia or federal PAC's as a way to skirt New York's contribution limits.
"Now they call and ask us to make out two or three checks instead of one," said a lobbyist who had given several thousand dollars to Mr. Pataki's committees but spoke on condition of anonymity because the issue had become so sensitive.
Under New York election law, a corporation's contributions to all candidates and committees is limited to $5,000 a year. The law also limits an individual's donation to a governor's general election campaign to $30,700 over the four years of his term. But several corporations and individual donors would have exceeded those limits if their donations to all the committees were tallied up.
Bell Atlantic, one of the state's largest employers, contributed $50,000 to the Virginia committee -- 10 times the corporate limit in New York -- in addition to $50,500 in largely unregulated soft money to the Republican Party's housekeeping committee. Although Mr. Pataki's PAC is separate from the Republican committees, they often transfer money back and forth.
A real estate developer, Peter S. Kalikow, contributed $25,000 to the Virginia PAC and $12,500 to Friends of Pataki, a total of $37,500, which is more than the state's limit for individual donors. He also directed $12,500 to the Republican state committee, and his company, H. J. Kalikow, gave $5,000 to the state committee.
The Virginia PAC collected $291,400, or more than half its total contributions, from New York businesses, residents and other political committees. The federal PAC, which is barred from accepting corporate donations and limits individuals to $5,000, still raised $356,073 including $138,375 from New Yorkers.
Blair Horner, legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said Mr. Pataki's multiple committees had made a sham of the state's campaign finance laws. "It essentially means there are no campaign contribution limits for governor," he said. "Those who are seeking to curry favor can give as much as they want."
Ms. Mucha rejected such criticism. "This gives us the ability under the law -- which, the last time I looked, both parties were doing -- to go out to other states and other arenas and talk about the governor's successful record in New York and the principles of the Republican Party," she said.
To some extent, Mr. Pataki's out-of-state committees have helped finance Republican aspirations in other parts of the country. The Virginia PAC contributed $28,000 to 12 Republican candidates running for the State Legislature in New Jersey, and $28,100 to 8 Republican candidates in Virginia. The federal PAC contributed $11,333 to 11 Republicans from Vermont to Arizona who are running for federal office.
But campaign records show that most of the money has been used to further Mr. Pataki's own political interests. There was little real difference in how the money was spent from the three committees -- indeed, the same political consultants drew regular payments from each one.

HEADLINE: AIRLINES IN A PUSH FOR SHORTER LINES

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
A traveler prints a boarding pass from her office computer, drives to the airport and then walks straight past the snaking line at the main counter. She drops her bags on a conveyer belt and dashes to the gate, where the bar code on her boarding pass causes her photograph to appear on the gate agent's computer screen. Her entire time in the airport, from curb to gate: less than 10 minutes.
At the moment, this scenario is little more than a dream for all but a few, elite passengers. Airports are more crowded than ever, and lines are sharply longer than they were even a few years ago. 
 But in a competition to attract the business travelers responsible for much of the carriers' revenue, airlines are spending tens of millions of dollars on new technology. They hope to whisk passengers through terminals more quickly, redefining what industry executives glumly call "the airport experience."
By the end of the year, Continental Airlines plans to have 300 A.T.M.-like computers across the country that allow people to print their own boarding passes and baggage tags. Delta Air Lines has spent $750 million over the last two years wiring airports and preparing to introduce similar gadgets. Northwest Airlines responds to canceled flights at its hubs by rolling out banks of wireless phones with direct connections to its reservations desk.
And Alaska Airlines, the most aggressive in using technology recently, has begun to allow people with electronic tickets to print boarding passes from home or office computers. As part of a pilot program, it has also scanned the driver's licenses of about 500 frequent fliers into its computer system. The bar code on the boarding pass retrieves both their driver's license and a larger photo so travelers never have to reach into their wallets before boarding the plane.
For now, business travelers are the main beneficiaries of the improvements. Some of the initiatives, such as calling passengers' cell phones to tell them about a late flight, are available only to the top tier of frequent fliers, and others, like the kiosks, appeal mainly to travelers who do not check bags.
Continental has even installed a kiosk in the lobby of AT&T's headquarters in New Jersey so travelers there can get a boarding pass before they arrive at the airport. And Northwest is testing a program that allows employees of 10 midwestern companies to print their own passes off the airline's Web site.
But unlike some other recent perks for corporate road warriors -- like expanded first-class sections or the installation of double beds on overnight flights -- much of the new technology will eventually be available for all passengers to use, industry experts said.
"Airports weren't designed for the volumes they're now getting," said Michael L. Zea, a vice president in Mercer Management Consulting's airline practice. "There's a lot of strain on the system, and technology can be very helpful in easing that."
Of course, automated systems are not always reliable. During a threatened strike by U S Airways employees in March, passengers holding electronic tickets needed old-fashioned paper tickets to have any hope of getting a seat on another carrier. And if the airlines eventually replace agents with the machines, they could both anger their unions and force passengers to do more work to board a plane, travel experts said.
But after a year in which consumer complaints more than doubled from their 1998 level, industry executives say that shortening the lines at their airport counters is a sure-fire way to boost their carrier's images.
As air travel has surged during the long economic expansion and both the size of airports and airline staffs have failed to keep up, the average amount of time that travelers spend in line at the main counter has reached 16 minutes, up 20 percent from three years ago, according to Airport Interviewing and Research, a White Plains company that surveys passengers. The stricter security standards that the government has adopted in recent years have added to the lines, as well.
As a result, no matter what travelers think of folding themselves into a middle seat or drinking the airlines' mediocre coffee, they will generally be happy if their trips take less time than they have come to expect, airline executives say. "You can make up for a lot of coffee sins by having a line that's been reduced," said Dirk C. McMahon, the senior vice president for ground operations at Northwest Airlines. And, at $10,000 apiece, the machines cost much less than additional employees.
The stakes are high enough to have caused recent lawsuits between airlines with different views about how best to move passengers through airports. Continental has sued United to force it to remove metal templates on baggage X-ray machines that prevent passengers, including Continental's, from carrying large bags onto airplanes at Dulles Airport near Washington.
Continental says its planes' overhead compartments are large enough to fit the bags and that allowing customers to carry on luggage instead of checking it reduces delays. United says the big bags result in overstuffed bins that cause delays.
Though it is unclear which argument holds the most sway with passengers, they clearly care deeply about the issue. Bill Harsh, a management consultant who flies more than 200,000 miles a year, said he had stopped flying United, once his main carrier, because he could no longer carry on his luggage. "I had a bag that fit in every overhead compartment in America but did not fit through their template," said Mr. Harsh, who lives in the Maryland suburbs of Washington.
A spokeswoman for United said the airline has received few complaints about the templates.
For now, though, the biggest attempts to reduce lines involve technology. Delta and other carriers are putting up computer screens near gate counters in an attempt to answer easy questions, such as the reason for a delay, that often clog up lines. Northwest's agents in Detroit and Minneapolis are using hand-held computers to print boarding passes for passengers waiting in long lines.
The initiative that is the furthest along is the installation of the ticket kiosks that print boarding passes. Alaska, Continental and Northwest have put them in dozens of airports, and British Airways and Alitalia, among others, use them in Europe. Delta has installed them in Boston, New York and Washington for shuttle flights, and United is now testing a version in Aspen, Colo.
Airline executives say they have not cut any jobs because of the machines but likely would have had to hire more agents without the kiosks.
Typically about six feet tall, the machines allow passengers with electronic tickets to insert credit cards, print boarding passes and sometimes change their seats or get tickets on earlier flights. The machines pose, in text form, the security questions that gate agents ask passengers who check in the old-fashioned way.
For now, there is rarely a line, and almost never a long one, at the kiosks. Mary Anne Smith of Metuchen, N.J., used one of them last week at Newark International Airport before boarding a Continental flight on a business trip. "They're quicker even than when there are no lines" at the counters, she said. "I don't have to talk to anyone."
They are mainly useful, however, for passengers who have no bags to check and no questions to ask.
Only Alaska, in Anchorage and Portland, Ore., now permits passengers to print their own tags and then drop them onto a conveyer belt from which the luggage is X-rayed and put on the plane. The other carriers force passengers using the kiosks to wait in a line -- usually separate from the main one and shorter -- to check their bags.
The airlines have also not fully explained the policies to travelers, analysts said. Ms. Smith, for example, said she believed she could not use the kiosk at all if she had wanted to check a bag.
In addition, the kiosks do not yet give fliers the same control that talking to an agent does, particularly for frequent travelers whose requests the airlines often meet, noted Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst at PaineWebber.
"I can't ask that the seat next to me be left open. I can't ask about upgrade wait lists. I can't ask questions about the status of a connecting flight," Mr. Buttrick said, adding that he rarely uses the kiosks.

O'CONNOR, JOHN CARDINAL

 BODY:
O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. The Board of Trustees of the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York wishes to express profound sorrow and a deep sense of personal loss at the death of His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop of New York and President of this charitable Federation. Throughout a lifetime characterized by extraordinary accomplishments and service, Cardinal O'Connor was foremost and preeminently a dedicated priest, imbued with love of God and love for all God's people. His leadership and many initiatives on behalf of the poor and disadvantaged of the Archdiocese have been a source of untold strength to this Board and a special blessing from Almighty God. With loving concern, our Good Shepherd recognized the demands of our changing times and encouraged tirelessly the development of many new programs for the benefit of children and youth, recent immigrants and refugees, the aged, the homeless, handicapped and the sick. As the Shepherd of God's people, his concerns were universal as he devoted himself with apostolic charity and zeal to the welfare and the best interest of all, not only in New York but throughout the United States, the Americas and the Third World. We thank Almighty God for sharing with us the faith and wisdom, the strength and the talents of his devoted servant, John Cardinal O'Connor. His memory and example will remain with us as a lasting legacy and inspiration. The Board of Trustees of The Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York Most Rev. Patrick J. Sheraton Vice President Rev. Msgr. James J. Murray Secretary
O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. The Jewish Community Relations Council of New York joins New York's Catholics in mourning the passing of His Eminence, John Cardinal O'Connor. A trailblazer, he opened new vistas in CatholicJewish relations: fighting for the freedom of Soviet Jewry, the diplomatic recognition of Israel and the condemnation of antisemitism. His compassion and unfaultering respect for the dignity of all human life led him to eschew hatred and bigotry of all types. In New York, he was the first archbishop to address Solidarity Sunday on behalf of Soviet Jewry and the first to attend a Salute to Israel Parade. As the keynote speaker at our 50th anniversary commemoration of Kristallnacht, he used his homily to movingly identify with Jewish Holocaust victims, while describing himself as a "spiritual Semite". He was a pastor to all New Yorkers with the ability to move those of us who knew him and those who merely knew of him. His is a monumental legacy. His memory will surely be a blessing. Gedale Horowitz, President Michael Miller, Executive V.P.
O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. The Rabbis, Trustees and members of Congregation Emanu-El of The City of New York record with deep sorrow the passing of our cherished friend, His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor. We join with sensitive humanity everywhere in giving thanks to God for the nobility of his life and the glory of his accomplishments. With matchless integrity and indomitable courage, he served his Church, simultaneously reaching out in heroic and creative ways to build genuine bridges of dialogue and understanding with Judaism and the Jewish people. No one in the American Catholic hierachy past or present, has been as caring and faithful a friend to the Jewish people as was His Eminence. He taught both Christians and Jews that theological differences, though profound and decisive, need not be barriers to love and understanding. We will cherish his memory as a blessing and the legacy he bequeaths is inscribed upon our hearts and written within our souls. Dr. Ronald B. Sobel, Senior Rabbi David E. Marrus, President Herbert C. Bernard, Secretary
O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. It is with profound sadness we mourn the passing of a remarkable leader of the Catholic Church in North America. His constant efforts on behalf of those most vulnerable in our society is his legacy. His caring and compassion have set an example for all to emulate. We, in our synagogue communities, are grateful for his unceasing efforts to raise interfaith relations to the forefront in the Catholic community and for his ever-present friendship. We appreciate his groundbreaking work that led to formal diplomatic relations between the State of Israel and the Vatican. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and the members of the Archdiocese of New York. The National Council of Synagogues representing: Central Conference of American Rabbis, Rabbinical Assembly Union of American Hebrew Congregations and United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism
O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. Members and officers of the American Federation of Teachers, the United Federation of Teachers, and the New York State United Teachers, mourn the passing of John Cardinal O'Connor. He devoted his life to building bridges of understanding between those of different faiths, races, classes and viewpoints. While no stranger to controversy, he was a gentle man who cherished civility. He was a champion of the poor and dispossessed, of immigrants and working families. We will remember his strong support for public education and the teachers of New York. We valued his friendship and his wise and generous advice. His death is a loss for New Yorkers and all Americans who have lost an outspoken crusader for the rights of workers and the cause of economic and social justice. Sandra Feldman, Pres. AFT Tom Hobart, Pres. NYSUT Randi Weingarten, Pres. UFT
O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. The officers and members of the Newspaper Guild of New York note with the greatest sorrow the passing of our dear friend, His Eminence The Cardinal. John O'Connor was a man devoted to his faith, to the welfare of what he lovingly called "the human person," and to helping the organized working men and women in New York's communications industry to achieve fairness in the workplace and equity in their careers. He was proud to be called "a union guy." We were proud to have known him. He will surely be missed, and he will surely be remembered. Barry F. Lipton, President William J. O'Meara, Secy-Treas. Peter Szekely, Chairperson Newspaper Guild of New York, CWA Local 31003
O'CONNOR-Cardinal John. In memorium. Cardinal O'Connor was a good and humble man. With gentle style, he worked tirelessly to diffuse difficult situations. Cardinal O'Connor represented the rights of workers and often reached out to the teachers of the Archdiocese of New York. He was adamant about keeping our Catholic schools open and giving all children the opportunity to receive quality education. True, he was a good priest and a good man, but to us he was also a strong advocate of Catholic education. He will be sorely missed. The Federation of Catholic Teachers OPEIU Local 153, AFL-CIO Michele L. Cody-MacDonald, President Edwina Dunne, Secretary Patricia Gabriel, Treasurer
O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. Mutual of America, its Board of Directors, together with all of its Officers and Employees, celebrate the life of John Cardinal O'Connor. He was a caring man of great wisdom. His depth of commitment to improving the lives of all New Yorkers, particularly the neediest, has touched us all. Cardinal O'Connor has set an example for all of us in both his life and his death. May he rest in peace. William J. Flynn Chairman of the Board Mutual of America Life Insurance Company Thomas J. Moran President and Chief Executive Officer Mutual of America Life Insurance Company
O'CONNOR-Cardinal John. The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations joins in mourning the loss of John Cardinal O'Connor. His outspoken opposition to racism and anti-Semitism, his support for Israel and leadership in furthering Vatican-Israel relations, and his special friendship for the jewish community will always be remembered. Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Malcolm I. Hoenlein, Executive Vice Chairman
O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. Our city and our Church will sorely miss this man of prayer and humor. We have been inspired by his compassionate outreach to the poor and vulnerable. We have been strengthened by his leadership in ecumenical activities and civic reconciliation. We extend our prayers and sympathy to his family and flock. Ellen and Robert Shafer
O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. We mourn the loss of this good shepherd, defender of the defenseless who loved the sinner. We celebrate today the ascendancy of this good priest whose wisdom, capassion and leadership form a template for those who follow. David McDonald and Family

HEADLINE: New Zealand Acts to Protect Its Isolated Environment

BYLINE: By ALLAN COUKELL 

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand, May 8

 BODY:
Two police officers, three government officials and a museum curator assembled outside a modest house on a quiet suburban street here a few months ago. The occupants were away, but the party, armed with a search warrant, entered through an open side window, using pepper spray to subdue a barking guard dog.
The officials were responding to a tip about contraband on the premises, and they quickly found what they were looking for: a pet spider named Bob. 
 The spider, a Chilean rose tarantula, is just one organism on a long list of animals, plants and microbes that are unwanted in New Zealand, a country serious about its biosecurity.
New Zealand's geographical isolation has allowed farms, orchards and tree plantations to remain relatively free of pests and disease that could push up production costs and reduce market access for export produce. But the isolation has also left its native ecosystems susceptible to foreign invasion.
New Zealand's birds were ill-prepared to cope with the influx of cats, dogs, rats and stoats that accompanied human arrival. Many species are now threatened. Many of the animals and plants brought into the country have proliferated wildly in the absence of their natural predators. The Australian brushtail possum, for example, was introduced to New Zealand a century ago. Despite control efforts, possums now number about 70 million. And they are consuming native forests at an estimated rate of more than 20,000 tons of foliage every night.
Isolated island ecosystems in other places face similar problems. On Guam, the introduction of the brown tree snake in the 1940's led to the elimination of nine species of birds and a native bat, and other species are considered threatened. Officials in Hawaii have established cargo inspection programs to keep the snake out of the state.
For now, New Zealand remains snake-free. But three times this year, snakes from Australia and Indonesia were captured in or near newly arrived shipping containers, raising fears of further reptilian incursions.
New Zealand's precautions against foreign invaders "are probably the most comprehensive and dynamic in the world," said Dr. Barry O'Neil, director of New Zealand's Biosecurity Authority. "But can we ensure that another snake won't get to New Zealand? No."
As in Hawaii, New Zealand's biosecurity begins overseas. All shipments with the potential to carry pests must be inspected and certified offshore. Upon arrival, goods are subjected to more scrutiny. International travelers also are inspected.
Each year, New Zealand intercepts about 4,500 organisms and seizes 86,000 "risk goods," like apples, meat and honey, that could carry diseases. Upon arrival, every one of more than 60,000 imported used cars is checked, inside and out, for insect hitchhikers. And under New Zealand law, any person who knowingly smuggles plant or animal material could face a penalty of up to five years in prison and a fine of about $48,500.
But globalization is making the border increasingly difficult to police. Increased trade means more cargo to inspect. (Even now, only about a quarter of incoming shipping containers are inspected.)
Tourism and international travel may pose even greater threats. Modern air travel whisks passengers around the world so quickly that fruit flies and other insect pests tend to arrive alive. To reduce the biosecurity risk, travelers are met by dogs trained to detect meat or plants, and X-rays of baggage are frequently taken in search of biological material. But tourism is an important industry in New Zealand, and international travelers, despite the value they may place on New Zealand's unique flora and fauna, are unlikely to tolerate lengthy delays for inspections.
Moreover, many potential invaders are microscopic and almost impossible to detect. Among the most feared organisms is the virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease in livestock. Plant viruses and fungi also pose significant and unknown risks.
Hundreds more pests, as yet unidentified, may have already arrived. There are about 22,000 species of plants growing in gardens around the country (outnumbering wild species by a factor of five). Dr. David Penman, author of a report called "Managing a Leaky Border," said as many as 200 of those might become weeds over the next 40 or 50 years.
The difficulty for New Zealand is balancing the cost of its biosecurity program against the economic and conservation benefits it provides. An effective quarantine system is possible, but zero risk is not, said Dr. Ruth Frampton, director of Forest Biosecurity at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
"We have to decide what is appropriate," Dr. Frampton said. "But in my personal view, a biosecurity defense system may be more important than traditional defenses such as an army or air force."
Last month, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry announced that a parasitic honey bee mite, Varroa jacobsoni, had been discovered on one property. Quarantine zones were quickly established, as officials scrambled to determine the extent of the invasion. But the discovery had come too late; the mite was already widespread.
Until this discovery, New Zealand was one of only two countries considered free of the mite, which may damage the country's bee export industry, wipe out the wild honey bee population and reduce the pollination of crops. Eradication -- the last line of line of defense for biosecurity -- is under consideration, but any operation will be costly, and success is far from guaranteed.

HEADLINE: A Crossroads in Canadian Health Care

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: EDMONTON, Alberta, May 3

 BODY:
Around the besieged provincial legislature building here, the din of banging pots died away, candles flickered in the evening breeze and protesters began singing their hymn: "Oh Medicare."
"Long live our plan, keep it free from greed," hundreds of voices sang into the spring night. Referring to the health care plan for all Canadians, they sang, "Oh Medicare, we stand on guard for thee." 
 As North Americans wrestle with mounting health bills for aging populations, many people in this free-market-oriented province are backing a health care model that has fallen out of fashion of late: a government-administered national health plan.
Since Canada put most of its health care under government control in the late 1960's, many Canadians have lauded the program as evidence that they enjoy a more beneficent society than the United States, where about 45 million people do not have health insurance. Asserting their system's superiority, Canadians note that life expectancy here is higher than in the United States, 75.8 years for Canadian men, and 81.4 years for women, according to government statistics for people born in 1997, the latest year available. Life expectancy in the United States that year was 73.6 for men and 79.4 for women, federal statistics show.
But in recent years, the image of Canada's universal health system has been tarnished by negative developments: waiting lists stretching for months for cancer treatment and heart surgery, Canadians pulling strings to get faster and better treatment in a state rationed system, and thousands of doctors and nurses emigrating to the United States for better salaries and working conditions. In a recent survey by the Angus Reid polling organization, 8 in 10 respondents out of 1,500 Canadians interviewed said the nation's health care system was in "crisis."
With other opinion polls indicating that Canadians view health care as the nation's top issue, Ralph Klein, the popular premier of Alberta, unveiled a bill in March that Americans might consider cautious. After a preamble outlawing "private hospitals," the bill goes on to allow overnight stays in "surgical clinics."
"It is touching the so-called third rail; it is opening up the debate on health care," Mr. Klein, a Conservative, said on Tuesday as he wearily prepared for an eighth night of protesters outside the legislature, chanting "Kill the bill."
Under the bill, expected to be passed on May 11, the government would reimburse private clinics for performing the same surgeries performed in government hospitals.
At a rally Tuesday night, attended by about 500 people, there were two common themes: that Canada's socialized medical system had faltered because conservative governments had starved it of cash, and that private "surgical clinics" would open the door for the "Americanization" of Canadian health care.
"The politicians create the problem with delays and waiting lists, then they come up with the answer: "We are going to privatize it," Andrew Dorosh, a 64-year-old retired social worker, said as banners waved reading, "People, Not Profits" and "Our Health Isn't for Sale."
Mr. Klein's efforts to chip away at the government health monopoly have won national attention, in part because Alberta, a province with a pro-business government, has set much of Canada's financial policy agenda in recent years, slashing taxes and erasing budget deficits.
Few people question that Canada, like much of the Western world, faces a looming health care crisis. About half of all hospital days now go to people over 65, a group expected to double in 30 years.
But the surprise here has been the dogged loyalty of Albertans to their public health system. In a recent poll for The Calgary Herald, a conservative newspaper, 52 percent of Albertans opposed the health bill. Only 40 percent supported it.
"This is the first time I have seen a sustained protest against a piece of legislation in 20 years in this province," Nancy MacBeth, provincial leader of the opposition Liberal Party, said in an interview. Referring to this conservative province of ranchers, oil workers and high tech engineers, sometimes called the Texas of Canada, she added: "Albertans don't tend to protest. It is not our nature."
As part of an effort to balance budgets, Canada cut the number of its hospital beds by 28 percent over the last decade, to 125,863 in 1999. In Alberta, beds were cut by one-third, to 12,502 last year.
At the same time, on the theory that more doctors generate more medical spending, Canada restricted the number of medical school students in the 1990's by 20 percent. Faced with higher workloads, 4,000 Canadian doctors and 6,000 nurses moved to the United States over the last decade.
Now, with tax revenue up because of Canada's economic recovery, Ottawa plans to inject an additional $3 billion a year into provincial health care.
In Canada, the public sector accounts for about 70 percent of $60 billion in annual health care spending, slightly down from 75 percent when the program began three decades ago. Private spending largely goes for dental care, optional eye care and drugs.
But talk of allowing more private participation in health care immediately sets off alarms. After Barbara Amiel, a columnist for Maclean's, the leading national news weekly, wrote an essay titled "Why We Need Private Medicine," she was immediately barraged with 130 e-mail messages and letters, almost all hostile.
At the rally Tuesday, a sign bobbed above the crowd: "This is not the U.S.A."

HEADLINE: Scientists Decode Down Syndrome Chromosome

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE 

 BODY:
Reaching another milestone in the race to decode the human genome, a team of principally Japanese and German scientists has essentially completed the DNA sequence of chromosome 21, a result that sheds light on the workings of Down syndrome.
The team is part of the international consortium of academic centers led by the National Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust of London. The consortium has now completed two chromosomes, numbers 21 and 22, which are the two shortest of the human complement of 23 pairs. 
 Chromosome 21 is best known in the context of Down syndrome. Affected children are born with three copies of the chromosome instead of the usual two. Usually a third chromosome is lethal because the extra doses of its genes derange the carefully balanced economy of the cell.
The decoded DNA sequence of chromosome 21, being published in this week's Nature, explains why Down syndrome children escape the usual death sentence, although at a cost. The chromosome has extremely few genes -- a mere 225, according to the consortium team's count, in its 33,827,477 decodable units of DNA.
Biologists who study Down syndrome do not know whether there is a general imbalance because of all the extra genes, or whether a handful of specific genes underlies the 80 or so specific disorders of the syndrome. The decoding of chromosome 21 at least establishes a catalog of all the relevant genes.
"So defining the players and the playing field is a very major step that the Down syndrome community has been working toward for years," said Dr. Roger H. Reeves, a geneticist at Johns Hopkins University who studies the syndrome.
Identifying the genes, and when and where they operate, could lay the basis for someday devising gene therapy for the syndrome, Dr. Reeves said.
The consortium team estimates that if chromosomes 21 and 22 between them have an average number of genes, the total number of human genes would be a mere 40,000. Other estimates range from 70,000 to 140,000.
It may seem extraordinary that with the human genome so close to completion, the estimates of its number of genes are all over the lot. But recognizing human genes in the DNA sequence is a rapidly developing art.
A bioinformatics company called DoubleTwist, of Oakland, Calif., said Monday that it had downloaded the consortium's human genome data, which at present cover 80 percent of the genome, and that with its own software it had identified about 105,000 probable human genes.
If the higher estimates of human genes are correct, the consortium teams that analyzed chromosomes 21 and 22 may seem to have been too conservative in its gene count.
The Japanese-German team decoded all of chromosome 21 except for the centromere region, which cannot be tackled by present methods, and 10 small gaps of particularly resistant sequence, which are being left for analysis later.
In decoding chromosome 21, the consortium now leads 2 to 0 in the genome race against its rival, the Celera Corporation of Rockville, Md. But the score is misleading because Celera's strategy is to decode all the chromosomes in tandem, and company officials say they are only weeks away from the goal.
DoubleTwist's ability to survey the genome is evidence of the impressive amounts of human DNA data the consortium has been putting into the public database. The directors of the five leading sequencing centers said today that they had decoded 16 million units of DNA in overlapping segments that together covered 85 percent of the human genome. Their project is now moving into the finishing phase, that of filling the remaining gaps.
"From my point of view the race is over in that the vast majority of the human genome sequence is freely available on the web," said Dr. Eric S. Lander, director of the genome sequencing center at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass.

HEADLINE: Debating the Real Price of Space Bargains

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: LAUREL, Md., May 5

 BODY:
The formal talks at the meeting were all about planned and proposed spacecraft missions throughout the solar system: stunning descriptions of balloons deployed in the atmosphere of Venus to sample its acrid air or robot vehicles plumbing the moons of Jupiter or blasting holes in asteroids.
But informal discussions in the hallways, during meals and at cocktail hour often drifted to recent concerns about mounting challenging interplanetary missions on tight budgets and risking failure by trying to do too much with too little. 
 As 300 space scientists and engineers gathered for the fourth International Conference on Low-Cost Planetary Missions, conversations turned to last year's failures of two American Mars probes and how lessons learned might apply to other projects under way or being planned. The twin losses of the Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander craft, hallmarks of the less-expensive exploratory approach, have spurred worldwide self-examination on how best to uncover the solar system's secrets on a budget.
Stamatios M. Krimigis, head of the Space Department at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory here and host of the conference that is held every two years, said the growing emphasis on low-cost international missions had fundamentally changed planetary exploration. "The question is whether we'll survive the revolution," he said at the meeting.
Most of those attending the conference agreed that flying more budget planetary missions and fewer billion-dollar larger ones had become the norm. There remains a need for some larger, more comprehensive robot craft, like the Galileo probe that has spent years exploring Jupiter and its moons. But teasing out details about numerous planets, moons, asteroids, comets and other bodies requires flying many more missions more often than in the past.
"We've done surveys of the solar system with Voyager, Galileo and other major missions to find out what is out there," said Dr. Edward C. Stone, director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. "Now the challenge is to get out to these places and sample them in detail. And that means we have to go much more often and need a lower-cost way of doing it."
Dr. Stone said in an interview that the failure of the recent Mars spacecraft, for which his laboratory has taken some criticism for its management of the missions, showed that there were limits to the "faster, better, cheaper" approach to programs NASA had taken in recent years. "We found that there was a limit to 'faster, better, cheaper' and that we took too big a step based on past successes," he said.
All current programs are being re-examined to assure that they can meet their goals and are properly managed, he said. "Everyone is looking at what they are doing to be sure they are managing the risks associated with spaceflight properly."
Independent panels of experts who reviewed the back-to-back losses of the $165 million Mars lander and the $125 orbiter last fall blamed the failures on inadequate management, insufficient testing and poor financing. The pressure to conform to the "faster, better, cheaper" credo compromised the projects and forced people to try to do too much with too few resources, the critics said, and upper management had no idea of how much trouble the programs were in.
One of the studies, conducted by Tony Spear, the retired project manager of NASA's popular 1997 Mars Pathfinder mission, said senior managers expected too much of projects that followed his successful one. He suggested that NASA slow the planning and approval of new low-cost programs until it trained more experienced project managers, put into effect better risk assessment for continuing projects and replaced seasoned engineers and managers lost to retirement or staff cuts.
Mr. Spear, who headed a session at the conference on the "faster, better, cheaper" controversy, said it was too early to say if the reforms urged by the review panels would make a difference in future mission success. NASA's entire Mars exploration program is under review, with the space agency so far deciding to send a planned 2001 orbital mission but canceling a landing craft for that year.
The first projects in NASA's streamlined program to explore the solar system, including the $270 million Pathfinder and the $224 million NEAR Shoemaker asteroid rendezvous mission operated by the Johns Hopkins laboratory, were successful because they were adequately financed and staffed. This, he said, could have inadvertently contributed to later problems.
"Pathfinder allowed us to be too complacent in future project planning," Mr. Spear said. "After the first wave of success, the bar was raised for cutting costs even more, and it went too far. For Mars, they tried to get two missions for the price of one and it couldn't be done."
At his session, Mr. Spear said he interviewed hundreds of people for his study and had spoken with thousands since, with most of them agreeing that the "faster, better, cheaper" policy of small missions espoused by NASA's administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, was the best approach under current budget restraints. "Most people agree that it's here to stay, even if they can't define what 'faster, better, cheaper' is," he said. "It is simply an attempt to improve performance."
Dr. Ed Friedman, chief technologist for civil space for the Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation in Boulder, Colo., said the approach simply meant trying to do more with the same resources. "It's like a losing football team at the end of a game going into a two-minute drill," he said. "They try to do more of what they have been doing to win."
Dr. Friedman said the concept could be improved in several ways, including doing realistic testing of spacecraft under the same conditions they would encounter on a mission, having all team members understand the entire mission and not just their parts of it, paying more attention to the unique computer software required for each mission, and keeping some people in a program from the earliest design stages until the end to maintain a continuity that could not be conveyed in written reports or computer databases.
Liam P. Sarsfield, a senior policy analyst with the Rand Corporation's Science and Technology Policy Institute, criticized "faster, better, cheaper" as "sloganeering versus engineering." While building smaller spacecraft is inevitable because the technology exists to do it, they are more economical and scientists favor this approach, he said NASA was mainly using the concept simply as a performance tool for cutting costs.
"It's wrong to try to combine high risk with aggressive cost goals," Mr. Sarsfield said. To achieve cost objectives, he said, NASA cut too deeply into testing and technical reviews that would have contributed to better risk assessments for these projects. He noted that critiques of the Mars mission failures found that the projects were understaffed, requiring some team members to work 80-hour weeks to try to keep up with their workloads.
"This creates satellite sweatshops that are unfair to workers who are inadequately compensated for their time, and hides the true costs of the programs," he said.
Mr. Spear agreed with some of the criticism, saying that people who took short cuts or "dumb risks" under the guise of "faster, better, cheaper" were not properly following the concept. "There has to be some flexibility and the ability to adjust goals if things don't go as planned," he said. "If you are working under a fixed cost and schedule, for instance, you have to be able to change the scope of the mission, perhaps leaving an experiment or something off to compensate."
Participants at the meeting said that even without formal policies to cut costs, there was pressure worldwide to find ways drive down the price of space exploration. The European Space Agency (ESA), a consortium of 15 countries, is planning to dispatch a mission called Mars Express that would orbit the planet's poles in 2003 and send down a small lander to examine soil composition.
While ESA has never adopted the "faster, better, cheaper" mantra, there has been considerable pressure to cut mission costs in recent years, said Gordon P. Whitcomb of the European consortium. In a new approach, the Mars mission will use technology developed for previous projects and turn over much of the project management to contractors working under the supervision of a reduced ESA project team.

HEADLINE: 'Africa Must Unite'

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "A Shadow on Africa: Attack on Peacekeepers Brings Concern That U.N. Will Again Shy From Region" (front page, May 5):
Developments in Africa continue to validate the belief of Kwame Nkrumah, the first prime minister of independent Ghana, that "Africa must unite." Nkrumah denounced the political balkanization of the continent into a multitude of weak, nonviable nation-states. 
 He was opposed by the former colonial powers of Europe, the United States, apartheid South Africa and other Western interests opposed to the political, economic and military independence of Africa.
Four decades later, Africa remains weak, fragmented and still unable to address its many problems effectively. Today, even the most ardent critics of Africa cannot deny the historical imperative for a strong, unified continent.

Technology Shares Tumble, With Cisco Leading Drop

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Technology stocks sank yesterday after a bearish report on Cisco Systems Inc. rekindled doubts on the value of technology shares.
Financial, drug and airline stocks jumped higher, helping to buoy the Dow Jones industrials and offset the downdraft in technology stalwarts. 
 But trading volume hit its lows for the year, continuing a trend of slow activity as unseasonably hot weather hit New York City and traders skipped out early.
Most investors stayed away ahead of earnings reports from three technology leaders, releases of economic data later this week and the Federal Reserve's meeting on interest rates next week.
"With today's volume, it feels like the market's not even open," said Adam Weisman, managing director at Wit SoundView.
The Nasdaq composite index dropped 147.44 points, or 3.9 percent, to 3,669.38, pulled down by Cisco, the market's most heavily weighted issue. Technology stalwarts rolled back nearly across the board.
But strength in financial and drug stocks kept the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average afloat. The Dow rose 25.77 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,603.63.
Broader market measures trended lower, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropping 8.46 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,424.17.
Cisco fell 5, to 62 3/4, after an article in Barron's, the financial news weekly, questioned its market capitalization. The stock was Wall Street's most active a day ahead of Cisco's quarterly results, expected after the market closes today.
"Obviously, Cisco is a huge player and the news is having a detrimental effect," said Chris Dickerson, an analyst at Global Market Strategists.
Analysts and traders warned against making much of the market's moves, saying many players are holding back until next Tuesday, when the central bank is expected to raise borrowing costs, perhaps as much as half a percentage point.
Before that, though, the market will be hit with earnings reports from Applied Materials and Dell Computer, as well as economic data at the end of the week.
Applied Materials dropped 6 3/16, to 95 11/16, and Dell lost 11 5/16, to 47 15/16.
"With all that in front of you and a looming interest rate increase, why in the world would anybody do tons of stuff today before they hear what Cisco has to say, what AMAT has to say, what Dell has to say, what the Fed has to say?" Mr. Weisman of Wit SoundView said. AMAT is the stock symbol of Applied Materials.

Down Day for Treasuries
 
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday on speculation that faster inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by a half-point next week.
Bond investors need to see that consumer prices are not rising faster "to offset the negative news we've had on inflation for the past month," said Kent Gasaway, who helps manage $1.5 billion at Kornitzer Capital Management and Buffalo Funds in Shawnee Mission, Kan. He has been gradually selling government debt the last few weeks and buying higher-yielding corporate bonds.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 25/32, to 100 4/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.24 percent from 6.18 percent on Friday.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 12/32, to 99 19/32. The note's yield, which also moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.56 percent from 6.50 percent on Friday.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of 3-month and 6-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.478	96.891	High Rate	6.02%	6.15%	Investment Rate	6.19%	6.43%	Low Rate	5.95%	6.01%	Median Rate	5.98%	6.12%	Total applied for	$25,744,434	$24,202,308	Accepted	$12,632,934	$11,779,308	Noncompetitive	$1,400,309	$1,125,584

HEADLINE: Watery Grave for a Roman Ruin

 BODY:
Turkey, the site of numerous ancient Greek and Roman cities, can boast of antiquities that are among the finest and most abundant in the world. But now Turkey is mocking its rich cultural inheritance by heedlessly flooding what may be one of the world's richest collections of Roman mosaics before the world has a chance to see them.
In the last few months, archaeologists have been urgently excavating the ruins of an ancient city that flourished in southern Turkey 2,000 years ago, against the day only weeks from now when it will be inundated by the rising waters created by a dam project. The ancient city, Zeugma, was a base for the Roman Legion at the eastern edge of the Roman Empire. It was a thriving center for the Silk Road trade on the banks of the Euphrates River, comparable in size and wealth to Pompeii. Rich traders decorated the floors of their villas with exquisite mosaics depicting scenes of Greek mythology. The city is believed to have succumbed to invasion, fire and an earthquake in the third century A.D., and has been covered by layers of dirt and rubble ever since. 
 Archaeologists began concentrated excavation this past winter, after belatedly discovering that it was an important site that was soon to disappear under water. The dam that threatens the site is part of an ambitious multibillion-dollar economic development plan. Most of its gates were closed only at the end of last month to begin creating a large artificial lake to be used for power generation. No one disputes Turkey's need for electricity. But surely a way can be found to postpone the destruction of an invaluable archaeological find. Archaeologists working at the site have said that in four months they can collect and preserve mosaics comparable to the region's finest, while in two years they could surpass even the world's greatest collection, in Tunis. These are not onerous delays for a long-term energy project.
In recent years Turkey has objected to the plundering of its antiquities by thieves and foreigners, launching an aggressive campaign to repatriate artifacts that it says were taken out of the country illegally. In 1993 New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art agreed to return the so-called Lydian Hoard, a cache of some 200 treasures dating to the sixth century B.C. that had been removed from Turkey in the early 1960's.
Countries like Turkey have a legitimate interest in seeking to reclaim their cultural patrimony, but they also have an obligation to protect that patrimony. In this case Turkey is betraying its own history by allowing a site of priceless value to be destroyed. Cultural institutions around the world may doubt Turkey's claim to value its cultural inheritance if it sacrifices so rich a treasure. It is not too late for Turkey to work with archaeologists to find a realistic timetable that will save these treasures from extinction.

HEADLINE: Outmanned, Outgunned in Sierra Leone

BYLINE: By Michael Maren; Michael Maren is the author of "The Road to Hell: The Ravaging Effects of Foreign Aid and International Charity."

 BODY:
The drama in Sierra Leone, where a rebel group is holding 500 United Nations peacekeepers hostage, is all the more distressing because of the circumstances: the soldiers wandered into the West African bush with outdated maps, got lost, and then were captured and stripped of their weapons by the very guerrillas they were sent to disarm. The rebels also made off with armored personnel carriers and other military gear.
For the United Nations, the Sierra Leone debacle is the latest humiliation in a string of peacekeeping failures that includes Somalia and Bosnia. It is sure to contribute anecdotes and ammunition to the critics in the United States who regard the United Nations as useless and not worthy of our support. Apologists for the peacekeeping effort describe it as good intentions falling short of their mark, but hope that a speeded-up deployment of more U.N. troops will help. 
 Either way, however, the effort to intervene in Sierra Leone's brutal nine-year civil war was doomed from the start. It was the product of wishful thinking on the part of Western countries, which have the world's best financed, armed and trained armies, but thought they could dispatch their commitment to peace in Africa by hiring underprepared third world soldiers and putting them in blue helmets. Collectively and awkwardly known as Unamsil, the troops began arriving in Sierra Leone late last year to enforce a 10-month-old peace accord between the recently elected government and the Revolutionary United Front, a group known for winning hearts and minds by hacking off the hands of men, women and children across the countryside.
Many of the peacekeepers are from elsewhere in Africa, a policy that makes sense until you realize that they and the other troops were sent into Sierra Leone without the support they needed. The soldiers, from countries with few economic resources, are ill-equipped and poorly trained; African nations generally are not sending the elite troops that protect presidents or are used for defense at home. In some cases, the troops are thrown into peacekeeping operations because their home countries are being well paid to hire them out. So what motivation and commitment to the cause should the soldiers be expected to have? In Sierra Leone they are outnumbered -- 8,700 against 45,000 rebels -- outgunned, and in all ways no match for the hardened rebels they are being asked to police.
There are two ways to deal with a rebel group like the Revolutionary United Front. The first was employed by the Nigerian-dominated West African peacekeeping force that recently left Sierra Leone as part of a peace agreement. The Nigerians kept the peace as they had done earlier in Liberia, by being as ruthless as the rebels they were up against. They earned the rebels' respect by playing their game.
This is not an option for the United Nations, which must adhere to strict rules of engagement and must deal with the scrutiny of the international press.
The second way to contain the rebels would be through overwhelming force and technical supremacy. In other words, by using troops from developed nations -- and in significant numbers. The United States, despite its military might, would never expect its soldiers to battle the odds that the African troops have come up against in Sierra Leone. Indeed, the doctrine of overwhelming force would demand something on the order of 100,000 troops backed by significant air support to contain a rebel group the size of the Revolutionary United Front.
Of course the price tag for that would be considerably higher than the $70 million the United States government is now contributing to Unamsil.
Without a full commitment from the West, the United Nations has no authority. Combatants see the policing force for what it is, a ragtag collection of third world armies thrown at a problem. They are regarded as the international equivalent of rent-a-cops.
Africans see the commitment of Western troops in the Balkans and understand that the world is serious about peace there. They see the neglect of Africa, and it leads them to despair. They are not fooled by the presence of the United Nations and words from the West about a commitment to peace.
If the world thinks Sierra Leone is important, let the world really enforce the peace. If not, the message will be clear. The West doesn't care.
